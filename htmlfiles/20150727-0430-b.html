But my worst crime was when me and my lads broke into a house and destroyed a lot of shit just because we were bored.</br>   nice try fbi   I killed a homeless person once, but I wouldn't say it is truly a crime because he broke into my house.  <br>browsed on /b/ before it was edgy</br>  Havent you heard? /b is for authoritarians only  <br>I was 13 and me and some friends jumped someone. He was in the hospital for a few days. Did a week in juvie and 20 days ankle bracelet. I was a very stupid child.</br>  I shot a nigger in reno  <br>Bravo</br>  I'll just copy and paste what I posted here before.<br><br>Sup /b/? Last month I went carhopping and some people actually left the keys to their front doors in their cars. With these cars I only took the front door key and left everything else alone, that way it wouldn't be immediately obvious someone had broken into thir car. Well, christmas time came around the next week and I took these keys and a notepad with the addresses the cars were parked in front of and went robbing. I used the keys to get into the front doors and I crept into the living rooms at about 2am. As expected there was presents around the trees and I just took everything and loaded in the back of my van. I repeated this for 5 other houses that night. In the end, when I got home and opened everything I got a nice haul. Included was a couple of decent brand laptops, a few iphones and ipods, cash from christmas cards totally £370, gift vuchers to various shops coming to a total value of £450, a couple of videogames consoles and a fair few number of PS4 and XBOX games. I have since sold the spare PS4 consoles and games off. I kept one XBOX console and PS4 though for myself. All in all i've netted myself a few grand overnight. So /b/, what do you think?</br></br>  Back when I was in school we had Apple laptops at one point I stole 5 of them got 600 out of them I continued to do so until the school put GPS trackers into them after that all I did was shop lift until I got bored of it  I was shopping with a friend last week. She wanted me to buy her a Wispa bar so I picked it up and instead of paying for it I just walked out with it to her astonishment. She couldn;t keep a straight face walking past security but I was all poker face. Master thief here  <br>Prostitutes. More than 2 dozen prostitutes.</br>  Has anyone or does anyone currently go carhopping?  Once when I used to go to school they had a equipment room for Outdoor ed classes I busted the handle off the door and stole 5 grand worth of camping gear, Best fuckin 5 grand I ever spent   ITT: Anon forgets 4chan is a honeypot   <br>H-honeypot?!</br>  <br> Be 17 <br> Out on the town being retarded with some friends <br> In Sweden there is a "tradition" to burn down the decorative "julbock" in Gävle. <br> Find one like it but smaller and made of spruce twigs rather then straw in my hometown. <br> Figure smokebomb in pic related would make for funny reactions from people and possibly even news articles. <br> Make salpeter and sugar smokebomb and plant it. <br> Light sparkler fuse and walk away. <br> Get 10 meters before 6 plain clothes officers have me and my friend in custody. <br> They have been watching us the whole time from their cars parked across the street. <br> Accidentally set the damn thing on fire. <br> Get charged with "Vandalism with fire" <br> Avoid the more serious charge of "Unlawful use of incendiary or explosive substance". </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Once, I killed my friend's fat cat with a knife and stripped it of fat. Then, I made some soap with the cat's fat and dissolved the body in a bath of hot lye. I Gave my friend the cat soap as a present.  <br>Why hello there, anon. I think that if I found you in my house I would shoot you on sight if I had a gun. Or try and stab you and chase you. Or just grab your plate number and memorize your car if I failed the formers and/or you got away. Aside from that, I guess it's pointless to say anymore. At least on here. All I'm saying is that if you are prepared to rob/kill/whatnot be ready to face consequences. Although I suppose killing for someone stealing from you is unreasonable as fuck and not good enough reason to have a death sentence. Maybe. I might try to do it anyways though, or at least injure you. Brutally injure you. That's all I shall say for now. Goodbye, anon. You deserve whatever's coming to you if you fuck up or otherwise.</br>  You know what i always wanted to do? A real robbery. I want to pull a gun inside a convenience store and tell the clerk to empty the cash register. But that's near imposible to me because i'm a complete pussy.  <br>If you were to rob my store, my friend in the back would blow a hole right through your head faster than you can pull the trigger. Don't do it anon.</br>  <br>Hey, if they didn't want to lose all their shit then they'd have taken better care of it. It's nature taking it's course here, they were stupid and made stupid mistakes so I capitalized on it.</br>  <br>if you live in aus id maybe do it with you. but gotta get the cigarettes as well tho.</br>  <br>see<br><br><br>You'd have a much greater chance of a hole in your head since you live in Texas where almost everyone owns a gun</br></br></br></br>  Smoking weed in ny house.

"since you live in texas" makes no sense. no one owns guns in aus so its pretty easy to rob a store. cunts get away with it all the time, i havent done it but wouldnt mind trying it for the thrill.</br>  <br>I thought you meant austin, TX loi</br>  I robbed a bank in Club Penguin once  I was a huge klepto from 14-22. Stole over $6000+ CDs, dvds, stole an ashbory bass, 5 Nintendo 64's, lots of other shit,<br><br> but my biggest was a $2100 Parker fly guitar. <br><br>Pic related</br></br></br></br>  Stole a traffic cone, put it back the next day.<br><br>Still live with the guilt</br></br>  Killed a guy, burned the body, buried it in the forest.  <br>well done.</br>  <br> But my worst crime was when me and my lads broke into a house and destroyed a lot of shit just because we were bored. <br><br>That was my house you prick.</br></br></br>  <br>How do I turn myself in?</br>  <br><br>Shot a man in Reno.</br></br>  <br><br>For what reason?</br></br>  <br><br>Just to watch him die.</br></br>  Steal eat from market and run  I, Manson and her girls were there on that day. You all know what happened.<br>But they never catched me because I am behind several vpns.</br>  I cheated on a test in high school once. I had never felt that much anxiety in my life before.  slashed about 4 different cars tires at my high school once because half the cars were owned by some emo fags that yelled at people all day. one motherfucker was 6ft 3 with black/red hair that was the sorta long over the eyes thing, face completely covered in pimples &amp; zits, fat fucker that had chains &amp; all the black k-mart clothes you could buy. kinda looked like this guy but as i said, fat &amp; pimples everywhere.  <br>If this is true, greentext?</br>  <br>Like people who actually live in the criminal world know (or care) about this site. Not a lot of 14 yo's and bored middle class dads have committed a lot of felonies.</br>  <br>I used to rob growhouses in highschool. was going pretty well too until they started guarding them at night with guns and shit. Had a buddy get chased out a second story window by some crazy gook with a samurai sword. good times.</br>  <br> greentext </br>  <br>I'm gonna sound stupid, but what's a growhouse?</br>  <br> be me 13 <br> got a gun <br> shove it up my asshole like the faggot i am <br> about to cum <br> pull trigger <br> mfw that homeless person was me <br> mfw i stole someone's gun and used it as a dildo </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>so, you slashed his tires... because he yelled at people? You don't sound like a very rational person, Anon.</br>  <br>marijuana grow op. they buy a house on the cheap, steal power from another unit on the block and grow copious amounts of bud</br>  <br>you are the scum of the earth</br>  <br>Worst crime was giving nobuo uematsu credit for the final fantasy 11 soundtrack when the majority was done by the superior naoshi mizuta... i'll never forgive myself.</br>  <br>You ruined christman for 5 families and made there children cry, you piece of shit, i hope you get impaled through the testicles</br>  <br>Again, if they didn't wanna lose it/couldnt afford to lose it, they'd have took better care of it. I feel no guilt about their loss</br>  <br>you poor tortured soul</br>  <br> Being this summer </br>  <br>What kind of retard leaves tjeir front door keys in their unlocked car overnight? They deserved it</br>  <br>What you did there was invading private properties without any permission, and that is immoral. <br> thou shall not steal </br></br>  <br>wat<br><br>ur such a fag<br><br>enjoy never getting laid by anything less used than a public toilet</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying I care so long as I made some serious bank </br>  <br>its a bit hard to explain. they were complete fucktards, you bump into them in the hallway, they'll yell at you, make a giant fucking scene for no reason but for their enjoyment. they once beat the shit out of a new ESL kid because he didnt say sorry, he simply didnt know how and those fuckers just smashed him, they wouldnt fight fair either, at times 7 or 8 of them would kick the shit out of one or two guys who would stand upto them. they were cunts and i wish i slashed their tires more often.</br>  <br>No. You are a parasite on the world and if you truly believe what you're saying it's no surprise that you have to rob because I would expect that your EQ will be too low to get a job of worth. There's a reason that there are laws against what you did. It's completely on you. I know you don't care what I say or what you read on here but I honestly hope that something bad happens to you. Karma doesn't exist, but I have my fingers crossed that you make a bad mistake.</br>  <br>same here. lel</br>  <br>I did your vices, only it was vacation house<br>worst would probably be non-consensual sex, you know animals, 6 years old girls, I killed a puppy once, and I don't seed my torrents</br></br>  <br>I have a job so money isn't an issue for me, but when I see the opportunity to get ahead in life, even at the expense of others, i'm gonna take it.

Keyed his shit, smashed his windows out, carved "DONT REPRODUCE" on his hood, doors, and tailgate, and slashed 3 of his tires (because in my state, unless all 4 tires are vandalized, no insurance payout)<br>Instaregret after i left, but it subsided after a day or two. Haha</br>  <br><br> ahead in life <br> Thinking that a few thousand is ahead <br><br>Now I know that my hunch was right about you being a poorcunt. If it was white collar crime then I would agree, but you are a shit tier criminal. You will never be big time because you don't even know what big time is.<br><br><br>Exactly</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>shitdude, wish i had an opportunity like that. were you caught?</br>  <br> yes </br>  <br>No you didn't</br>  <br>Poor cunt for seeing an opportunity to make a few extra grand for a few hours work?

Would you kindly not reproduce?</br>  <br>he knew, but had no proof, so he couldn't do shit about it. He tried to beat up the kid whose dad has access to the crane and ended up getting jumped by about 7 or 8 of us. felt good man.</br>  <br>No, that's not why I think you're poor and of little worth.<br><br>I think that because of your mindset and justification of your own actions. Unwillingness to accept blame. All qualities of a coward and typically won't get you far in life. Unless you were born in to cash.</br></br></br>  <br>Broke into apartment by smashing the door, then beat shit out of one guy, with my friend. Have stole things from tractor garagers? but never from shop. And all this drunk fighting. But im reguler more like very good person, here where I come from.</br>  <br>ive always wanted to jump the cunts that bully people for no reason, like shit, never been really bullied myself but just the feeling of beating the shit out of someone who deserves it would feel great. well done anon, proud of you.</br>  <br>I'm doing pretty well for myself. I just like making extra money on the side, it is always much appreciated. You should give it a try, buy yourself a new birthday present or something as a reward.</br>  <br>Whatchu finna no wite boi</br>  fucked my 16 year old gf when i was 19.. shes now 19 and im 22.<br>im a very bad man</br>  <br>about 10 years ago I reported a girl missing that I chopped up and dumped random parts in 5 states after I boiled her flesh down.

One of the texts mentioned me in it and me fucking her (her friends knew about it) so the police looked at it and started investigating. NEVER talk to police without consulting a lawyer first.

We used to be very close, and I knew he was bipolar and couldn't handle the fact that I hated him, even though he was a guilt ridden relapsed alcoholic who dragged me through his relapse. I wanted to kill him, but I disowned him instead and let him do all the work. He killed himself 11 months ago.<br>Before his relapse, he was actually a very hard-working, well-mannered, intelligent person who had my utmost respect. Now I'd piss on his grave if I could get away with it.</br>  <br>I FUCKING CALLED IT NO ONE ELSE CAN HAVE IT, thanks anon</br>  <br> Tell me about your worst crime. <br><br>sex repeatedly with child</br></br></br>  <br> 39.976239, -81.069262 <br>NIGGA I LOVE FIVE MINUTES AWAY, IM THE GUY WHO CALLED THEM AND ILL POST THEM IF I FIND THEM</br></br>  <br>so i imagine you were a social outcast beyond this clique of social outcasts<br><br>cuck</br></br></br>  <br>Did you stick it in the pooper?</br>  Horsecock      <br>I do enjoy a good horsecock, I tell you hwhat.</br>  <br>It's alright.
