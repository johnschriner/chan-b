It's a shame a fuck with such poor taste posted them though.</br></br></br>  <br>Triptykon, Celtic Frost, and Hellhammer. Without those three, we wouldn't have a lot of the metal bands that we have today.

Except I wouldn't include Triptykon in the list, even though that Fischer effort is in my opinion his best. Triptykon is rather new and while I'm sure has influenced bands since it's conception, hasn't nearly influenced the number of bands that Hellhammer or Celtic Frost has.</br>  <br>so far i like earl's album better than tyler's.</br>  Basicly every Maiden album (except virtual xi)  <br>If you like postmetal/sluge/industrial/hardcore<wbr> you'll love them</wbr></br>  <br>I know he's shit<br>But just that one song, honestly, cracks me the fuck up<br>Lol he even made a music video for it<br> enter two heroin addicts <br> he actually paid to see these guys drink booze and shoot up </br></br></br></br></br>  any dingus fans?  <br>Oceanic and Panopticon are great.

It states good tier albums.<br><br>If OP wanted only metal albums he would have wrote that</br></br></br></br></br>    mmm  <br>Yesssssss</br>  <br>this</br>  Tell me about your worst crime.<br>I used to shoplift in my teen years. But my worst crime was when me and my lads broke into a house and destroyed a lot of shit just because we were bored.</br>  I think my worst was probably doing graffiti in an abandoned warehouse.<br>It sucks because I was young when I was doing it so I don't remember a lot of it, but I remember my brother hopping the warehouse fence onto the train tracks and tagging there, I got scared and started to shout for him to come back but he wanted to carry on.<br>Hear someone shout from the other side of the warehouse, "YOU LITTLE SHITS I'M GOING TO FUCKING GET YOU"<br>Brother hops back over, we ride off on our bikes, never actually saw the dude<br>Brother thinks it was someone from the MOT company next door just fucking with us.</br></br></br></br>  <br>-CP possession<br>-Drugs possession and usage</br></br>  This was way back in the early 80's before most of you were born..but back then kids could actually go outside of their neighborhoods without too much worry of being abducted or whatever. <br><br>I think I was 7 or 8..my brother's best friend down the street got his dad a bowling ball for his birthday or some other occasion. <br><br>My brother knew the dad would throw out the old one. <br><br>So on trash day the following week, older brother asks me if I want to go play baseball. Of course I say yes, and grab my shit to go. We clear it with mom she says have fun. <br><br>We get outside, older brother says leave the baseball stuff home and get our bikes and meet me at David's house. <br><br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/630543206#p630558388">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  r8 thread<br>fb friends edition</br>  <br>9/10</br>      bump for hotties  <br>more?</br>    bump    <br>7 and 5 respectively<br><br><br>need body but 6 for now<br><br><br>4<br><br><br>8 but only if body holds up to face<br><br><br>7<br><br><br>both 8's but right should do something about the crazy eyes</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>on second thought right should be like a 7.5, left deserves to be recognized as a little better</br></br>      <br>3.5<br><br><br>6ish but can't tell for sure. could go up or down</br></br></br></br>    <br>mongoloidian invasion/10</br>    <br>8/10</br>    <br>what is it with some of these pics where you can't see the body (or in some cases face) clearly<br><br>how are you supposed to rate in that instance<br><br>try and capture both clearly in your sample<br><br>pic related</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>5/10 both<br><br><br>3.5<br><br><br>6 maybe, but i get the feeling shit goes downhill without all that makeup<br><br><br>9 easy</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>oh and 5</br>    <br>6<br><br><br>8<br><br><br>5.5 &amp; 6<br><br><br>6<br><br><br>5.5<br><br><br>5<br><br><br>6.5<br><br><br>8 &amp; 8<br><br><br>8<br><br><br>8 &amp; 7</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>        What do you all think of my older brothers girlfriend??

It works on really young men, but as you get older, you see that she's really not that good looking.

Maybe a few of you have lost someone close to you to cancer. How does it feel knowing there's a cure but the drug companies aren't interested because they can't patent it and make big $$?<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=z1i<wbr>fXxbxhZc</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>If there is a cure than why powerfull people like politicians die of cancer?<br>Why rich people like steve jobs die of cancer?</br></br>  <br>Because the drug companies aren't manufacturing it and making it available to all.<br>No $$$ to be made<br>They don't care. They make more from chemo and research $.</br></br></br>  <br>They'll never find a cure because they wouldn't be able to have such big beautiful offices.</br>  <br>Or this....</br>  <br>Or this.....</br>  <br>Fuck off you edgy teen faggot. <br>There's no conspiracy, stop buying into shit because you watched zeitgeist once.</br></br>  <br>At least someone gets it.<br>Faith in humanity somewhat restored.</br></br>  <br>Or this......</br>  <br>Good answer...<br>Now do you want to calm down and contribute something intelligent?</br></br>  <br>or this....</br>  <br>More money to be made by people dying rather than living. Cured, end of story. Dying? Long list of med bills and doctors need to make their Ferrari payments.</br>  <br>kurz gesagt?</br>  <br>Another guy that gets it.<br>We need to spread this around,<br>Get people with cancer taking this stuff.</br></br></br>  <br>Atl reporting in. <br>Don't think they have a cure.<br>Powers that be are evil but not sadistic.</br></br></br>  <br>Is it any different than the "terrorism" bullshit? We could end terrorism basically by just wiping out most muslim countries even if it involves nukes. People got no sand anymore.</br>  <br>so there is no cure that they are hiding? You are complaining that they are not searching for a cure?</br>  <br>underrated post</br>  People need to take this stuff, Then when their cancer is gone and their doctor asks how they did it, Tell doctor to fuck off and stick his radiation aka chemo up his ass.  <br>feels the same as it always has, this is not recent news. plenty of potential cures and treatments for plenty of diseases, including cancer have been held back over the years.</br>  <br>Confirmed everything I just said. <br><br> "I'm so clued in, I know how the world works, wake up sheeple!!" <br><br>There's literally no intelligent conversation to have with people who believe this trash, same with chemtrails, universal poisoning and the like. <br><br>You're all dumb cunts<br><br><br> Yes let's eradicate 2 billion people bc we invaded their land and they got pissed at us. <br>Fuck me you have to be 14.<br><br><br>This thread is aids</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Did you watch video?<br>The drug companies CAN'T patent it<br>which means ANY company can make/sell it.<br>No monopoly for big pharms=not interested.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Next time any of you are at a hospital look in the doctors parking lot. I was at St Vincent in Toledo for a heart scan, and before the procedure I looked out at the docs parking lot, full of lambos and ferraris. Hypocrites.</br>  <br>Your posts are aids<br>If you don't like/believe it...move along<br>or stay here and rant like a child.<br><br>you chose the latter. Good job kid.</br></br></br></br></br>  Right because every oncologist, every researcher, every drug company, hell every doctor is just in it for the money. There's no fucking conspiracy  <br>they do take the... Hypocritic oath.</br>  <br> &gt;Yes let's eradicate 2 billion people bc we invaded their land and they got pissed at us. <br> Fuck me you have to be 14. <br>Jesus H. you're retarded. They're not killing us because we "invaded" their country you dumb fuck. Quit watching cnn.</br></br></br>  http://www.snopes.com/politics/medi<wbr>cal/cancercure.asp<br>Doesn't say no, but key comment is last para<br> In the meantime, caution is advised. Don't become the victim of a cancer scam. The scamsters are sure to follow this report as night follows day.  <br><br>Rather than be sucked into OP's conspiracy-theorist hysteria, I suggest interested people read a reasoned account<br>http://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk<wbr>.org/2010/05/12/potential-cancer-dr<wbr>ug-dca-tested-in-early-trials/<br><br> and now I'm out - off to fashion a helmet from tinfoil for OP </br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></wbr>  This is pure cancer.There is no "cure for cancer" because it's a general term.For example,there is no cure for wounds,maybe skin wounds but how are you supposed to heal a brain wound from a machete to your head?This fucking conspiracy shit is killing me.Why did they invent any other medication,for example cure for tuberculosis or the simple flu?You guys are retarded.  <br>That's because doctors get big bonuses from drug companies to peddle their shit.<br><br>Drug companies don't create cures<br>They create customers.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hmmm, who do I believe?<br>The doctor that says/proves he has cure?<br>Some idiot with stale meme on /b/?<br><br>Tough choice.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> kid <br> implying you're above the age of 18 <br><br>Nobody educated would believe this shit once they leave HS.<br><br><br>Yes, "they" are. <br><br>You realise the USA are the worlds biggest terrorists right? I mean cmon I know you ignore it bc it benefits you, but seriously lmao.<br><br>Drowning in summer rn</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Aren't you a conspiracy lover?Of course bro,i'm trying to show you how deep is the rabbit hole.You can continue believing those matrix programs that call themselves doctors.You are a slave,fellow.</br>  <br>So he's still here ranting<br>Your obvious underage attitude is showing<br>I'll take the high road and just ignore your childish obviously deperate cries for attention.<br><br>Go cry somewhere else kid, Nobody here cares.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>So that is not really big pharmas fault, they are just protecting their interests by not making a drug that wont give them money.<br><br>This is the reason as to why we pay taxes, why we have a governament, so he can look for the interests of the population even if there is no profit to be gathered. Its not big pharmas fault, its the governament fault.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Lmao. <br>Stop posturing on an anon board you tard</br></br>  Hi /b/ros, Femanon here.<br>Was wondering if you guys can help?<br> So my Boyfriend and I have been dating for 3 years <br> No sex the last 3 Months <br> ask wtf is up <br> says he's depressed and isnt in the mood <br> find him talking to his ex and watching porn a lot. <br> says he's helping his ex sell something and didnt ask about the porn <br>I'm not overweight and get a handful of good compliments about my looks so I doubt its that. I also honestly don't care about the porn that much, its just frustrating that he's giving his hand more attention then me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Try doing it by force!  <br>he wants a real grl. because if you're here it means you only think you're a girl.</br>  Piss on him and tell him to make love with you  He sure helps his ex with his dick you based faggot    <br>How old are you two ?</br>  <br>Don't forget to post pics!</br>  <br><br> femanon here <br> implying  <br><br>Tits or gtfo cumdumpster.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>He's limp from all that fapping.</br>  most girls ive done this to are too interested in themselves. get on your knees and suck his dick til hecums the next time you catch him with porn, let him watch it while you do it. <br><br>if you want him to prefer you tohis hand, you need to take care of him. most bitches dont put much effort in to be sexy, thats probably whats wrong.<br>that will be tits.50 for the advice.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I suppose you could do the same? Start fapping to porn and go fuck your ex in between the laps.</br></br>  <br>have a serious talk with him. But dont say you want him to have sex with you, say you want him to stop watching porn.<br>He is probably addicted to it and is insecure about beeing able to have sex with you. Make him go for at least a few days without porn, than give him a blowjob. This way he wont go back to porn. Keep doing this for some time, absolutely no porn and a blowjob from time to time. He will come looking for sex. If he doesnt than just stop giving him blowjob, now he will certainly come looking for sex.</br></br>  <br>Suck his dick while he´s asleep. Every guy wishes for that. He won´t say no when he wakes up unless he´s gay or something.<br><br><br><br>That´s not how it works you fucking newfags.</br></br></br></br></br>   femanon here <br>post tits with timestamp or gtfo</br>   Mfw theres guy somewhere in this horrific world that is either so bored or so autistic that he feels the need to identify himself as a female online for attention <br> tits with timestamp on a cold rainy day in stoke or get the fuck out you limp dick motherfucker </br>  <br>thats exactly how it works</br>  <br>If you tell him to not watch porn you're just going to take the role of his mother, he's probably doing it because sex has become stale and he's looking for new things but doesn't want to be a dick and say that. Either that or he has some weird fetish he's too mortified to share with you, do you know what kind of porn he watches? no comment on the ex thing expect suspicious as fuck</br>  <br>shut your fucking mouth summer, that is not how it works.</br>  You know the rules and so do I    <br>stfu summer.</br>   I'm not overweight and get a handful of good compliments about my looks so I doubt its that   <br>The rule only applies to bimbo sluts seeking attention.</br>  <br>tell him what every guy wants to hear <br> "Honey, i think i want to try anal  <br>If this doesnt get him in the mood there is no hope for u</br></br></br>  <br><br><br> saying summer in every sentence is the worst new-faggotry <br> please An hero </br></br></br></br>  <br> implying OP isnt his mother </br>  <br> implying theres actually a female behind that person monitor <br> killself.jpg </br></br>   femanon here   <br>Care to prove otherwise?</br>  <br> femanon here <br>stopped reading, kill yourself you attention whore</br></br>  <br>You are the cancer that ruins the internet for everyone.

But from guys perspective- I was very stressed couse of studies, Had realy butyfull gf, but the trueth is she kind of did sex like a log... i mean I tried to buy her a nice lingerie or something hot, wanted to try something else, maybe toys, or some new positions. Trueth is even if girl is hot, if she just lays and waits for sex it will get borring very quickly. Buy something hot (coreset maybe?), ride him or something.
