SHE STILL HASN'T SHOWN US TITS EITHER.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Me posting my 'tits' would be a(not relevant to this thread and b(make me even more of an 'attention seeker'. I'm only here to give advice not nudes</br>  <br>That's all women are good for. Crying, giving birth and making life miserable for the men around them.</br>  <br><br>It's the rules, faggot. You aren't a special snowflake.</br></br>  <br><br>People always rag on girls for wanting attention online, but every post on every site, even anonymous ones like this, are a cry for attention - especially on 4chan. Even if someone calls you a faggot, admit it, you live for seeing that little number indicating someone replied to your post. We're all just lonely social animals and looking for someone to talk to, otherwise you wouldn't be on a social website.</br></br>  Best way to introduce myself to a girl I don't know?  <br>Because 4chan has rules about my tits, mhm. Read them, I don't see any rules that apply to my body</br>  <br>It became relevant when you stated your gender.<br>Now tits pls</br></br>  <br>There is nothing I already don't know about the female body, its all over the internet.<br><br>Now if you can explain to me how the female brain works that would help. Does rationality elude your grasp or do you deliberately press our buttons until we snap? Are women born stupid or choose to be like this?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Get a job with her or join a club/team/etc she's in, or make friends with her brother or male friends. Most other ways will be deemed 'creepy', especially if you're not physically attractive to her.</br></br>  <br><br>yes and yes? <br><br>honestly not going into a lot of details because i am pretty confident about creating my own narrative but i was just curious about another person's perspective. the thing is i really like this girl and i'm relatively sure she feels the same way about me, if that is even possible. we are very similar in a lot of ways, and i like that, coming from someone who likes people different from myself. she smokes weed every day, tho i dont too much myself. she has a strong relationship with her family, she likes astrology, its an interest we share. we just have a lot in common. i think we're sharing the mutual issue of being pretty guarded because we work together (though not directly, the same place tho) and i'm just looking for ways to overcome that but at the same time just chill about taking it slow. an outside perspective might be helpful here</br></br></br></br>  <br>........ posting your tits with a timestamp proves you're a woman, and that you are willing to give those who seek to give you attention what they want and actually accomplish what you're doing here. Otherwise, you are simply garnering attention by noting you're female and making all the males on the site freak out and get boners for you, i.e., being an attention whore<br><br>tl;dr : You're doing the exact opposite of what you want to do</br></br></br>  <br> Glad to know I'm doing something right. <br>obviously not or you wouldnt have asked</br></br>  <br>Megan says tits or GTFO</br>  <br>This. Pointing out your a grill on an anonymous image board in your OP is a cry for special attention. Therefore tits are a must.<br><br>Tits or gtfo you cunt</br></br></br>  <br>Just be confident and say what you feel is suitable. There's no right way to do it</br>  <br><br>Tits or gtfo whore</br></br>  <br>Tell her your name and that you have noticed her like a Senpai.</br>  <br><br>Yes, but men do this without having to inject their gender into it. We get it, society puts you on a pedestal, I don't need to be constantly reminded that you have a cunt and oversized breasts. <br><br><br><br>Tits or gtfo out. Nobody gives a shit what you have to say.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Not OP, but frankly I think we have enough women here that we can just treat them like anyone else now. Just call her a faggot and move on.<br><br>PS, OP is a fag.</br></br>  OP deliver    <br>This isn't the first time I've heard her answer from a chick. She may have not given us tits but this information isn't very unusual or rare coming from a lot of women. 6/10, ill trust for now.</br>  <br><br>That's because it's assumed that everyone is a cis male here, which is fine until you start acting childish about it.</br></br>  Stupid fucking whore doesnt know the rules.<br><br>This is now an anal prolapse thread</br></br>  <br><br>may we see your tits or would you like to get the fuck out?</br></br>  <br>Ever heard of fact checking?</br>  <br>never mind what Simon says ...</br>  <br> claims to be femanon <br> posts picture of dinosaur <br>Nice try T-Rex, you're not getting any of my dignity</br></br></br>  still no tits  <br>All girls are different when it comes to the brain, I just don't think you're hanging around the right women. The best you can do to avoid girls like that is do t tolerate it when they push your buttons by eliminating that minority you'll be left with the women you want to hang around.</br>  <br><br> unironically using CIS <br><br>I don't want to see your tits anymore, just GTFO</br></br></br></br>  tits or gtfo  ur dumb  <br>I had to take a shit until I saw that. Now I just don't know anymore.</br>  <br>I think that in this case it was okay to state my gender to show that I'll give a different perspective on things. Has nothing to do with attention, I'd like to keep the things that are private to me private. I don't go asking all you guys to prove you're male and post your docks. It should go both ways</br>  tits or sheep   Everyone, lets simply abandon thread and ignore this attention seeking whore   <br><br>Confidence is the answer. Not "listening to what she has to say." Words literally don't matter in a conversation. I spout out nonsensical bullshit all the time to women and it works because I have confidence and I'm not needy. There isn't a set of tricks that will get you a woman, you need to work on yourself. Get your shit in order and then they will be chasing you.</br></br>  <br>Megan says ...</br>  Why does my girlfriend wanna be a reckless slut? I'm breaking up with her today when she comes over.  <br> tolerate it when they push your buttons <br>Like when you don't post tits and still try to have a thread on my /b/?</br></br>  tits or wot?  How do approach girl in public without looking like a creep?  <br>lol</br>    tits or tongue  <br> I don't go asking all you guys to prove you're male <br>We never claimed to be, you dumb bitch.<br>TITS NAO!</br></br></br>  <br>I don't doubt that, I just don't think that would work if you're trying for something long term</br>  How do i tell a woman of whom is relative of a friend that i dont wsnt to be friends because i wsnt to be more. Yes im fucking terrible with people we ended up sitting together on the couch watching movies a couple nights before and asked her where we stand and i got nothing helpful she said i dunno. How fucked am i  <br>I scaled it down so that it didn't trip 4chin's duplicate image detection system. Here is the best one:<br/></br>  tits or i dont know if this is even a prolapse pic  <br>This is 4chan nothing stays relevant to the thread for more than ten posts. Especially when you're retarded enough to state your shit tier gender. <br> Sage until tits. </br></br>  <br>That's not how its interpreted on this site. Sadly, all women who state their gender are considered attention whores after the Boxxy incident, and are now required to give up the thing the newfags and pervs want the most to prevent it from ever happening again</br>  tits or even snakes need to poop  <br><br>"Listening to them" isn't going to work long term. Having confidence will. "Listening to them" will just turn you into a yes-man that they will quickly lose attraction and respect for.<br><br>Look up RSD.

Pushing feelings to the back of your mind fucks you up in the long term, so you gotta pull it off like a bandaid and say how you feel and how you need space or need to end it or whatever you need to do. I'm sorry but there aren't great ways of handling this stuff considering there isn't much of an off switch for feelings.</br>  <br><br>How!?</br></br>  <br>I'm not posting my tits, but I see nothing wrong about my tongue</br>  <br>what would be the most hassle free to break up from a long term relationship with out the girl loosing her shit and going all EMO and shit?</br>  <br>not optional cunt</br>  <br>Just tell her your feelings and be open for it.

I'm sorry for assuming you're guys</br>  <br><br>The best way to do it is to slowly become more distant until she doesn't want to be in the relationship anymore.<br><br>The most fun way to do it is to randomly block her and ignore her. She will be wondering for years what she did wrong.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If I'm not attracted to someone physically but they were really nice to me I'd give them a go. It's really a personal thing though, some girls don't care about the physical state at all. Others a little too much.

That rule has been standard here since before 2004, and you won't be the first to try and circumvent the rules...your thread will just be spammed with demands of tits or GTFO. Also, you're a girl on the internet...cam or not, you're still a whore.</br>  <br>And the has the nerve to ask me to walk her out Bc she doesn't think my neighbor hood is safe!</br>  <br><br>LARD ASS DETECTED.<br><br>Put down the cheetos and get your shit together.

I'd say just explain to her as to why you want to end the relationship and I'm sure she'll understand</br>  <br>I'm a fag, and I ain't want to see no tits. Keep your blouse on and give me some advice: <br><br>How do I deal with mild depression. I'm an activist in a city with the most crooked politics, where activism is co-opted by elitism and by corrupt elected officials themselves. It's depressing, because activists in this city are going along with a charade of autonomy, but basically most activists are in somebody's pockets. See this, what do?</br></br></br>  <br>Because advice is based on knowledge not looks my friend</br>  <br>I have a question. <br>Kill yourself.</br></br>  <br><br> since before 2004 <br><br>newfag detected. 4chan wasn't even made until 2013, when r/cumlovers broke away from reddit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Rules are rules attention whore. Whores dont need manners. The fact you dont understand why the rule even exists suggests your a whore and a newslut.<br><br>Im going to explain it to you because you're obviously a dumb fucking bitch.<br><br> OP makes a point of identifying her gender in the OP, specifically that she has a cunt <br> Ergo, she's an attention whore and must provide tits <br><br>or<br><br> OP makes a post but make no mention of her gender <br> through discussion in the thread is becomes apparent OP is a female <br> She did not try and leverage her gender in the OP for attention <br> she is not an attention whore <br> no tits required <br><br>Get it now cunt? Is that simple enough for you?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe you guys just didn't have any chemistry, keep on looking and you'll find a girl attracted to you don't worry</br>  <br>Your post made me grow a vagina.<br>You are what's wrong with the worlds, kill yourself<br><br>and OP; tits or gtfo</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>what knowledge do you have that isn't based on your anatomical parts? You're just a vapid cunt who thinks she knows everything. Go take a shower.</br></br>  <br> I'm sure she'll understand <br>grills will find some excuse to make it my fault</br></br>  <br>Another femanon here. I broke up with my boyfriend because many reasons. Between the low libido, the stress, the fact he played WoW all the time when I came over and he didn't want anything serious as in settle down and move in together, I just fell out of love and I broke up. <br><br>Now, he wants me back with a fury and keeps calling, promising me moving in, mariage and babies, but I'm just over him. Told him it's over repeatedly. Blocked him on fb, had a few friends explain to him he needed to leave me alone. Still gives me the puppy look every time we meet and keeps trying to tell me we had a good thing together. I try to be nice and just repeat the message ad nauseam, because he is not a bad person and I don't want to become bitchy. What else can I do?</br></br></br>    <br>Its gonna do you more harm then good..being with someone you dont love turns into resentment and then it just gets worse from there</br>  <br>If you want to see change, be the change.</br>    <br>Nice mustache kid. <br>Guys it's not a grill. <br>MODS!</br></br></br>      <br><br> what do <br> an actual faggot <br> doesn't want to see tits <br><br>Just kill yourself. Nobody gives a fuck about you and your "activism." It's all a charade for political figureheads anyway. Three years ago Obama didn't even have the balls to take a stance on gay marriage, now he's considered the Gay Marriage Jesus. <br><br>The only people who care about your cause are the politicians who feign enough interest to get your faggot votes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    Even disregarding the lack of tits, this is fucking rubbish advice. Step your game up, OP.  <br>For me its confidence...not that cocky "im hot shit" kind....just a guy whos confident in what he says and does<br><br>That with some wicked humor is sexy</br></br></br>    <br>tits or gtfo</br>  <br>And you're implying that advice is based off of looks? I'm just putting forward the female perspective on things is all.</br>  <br>Activism these days mean little if you do it the usual way. Do things that will attract instagramming, sharing on fb etc, performances, art pieces. Those are things you can do alone, but it's going to get you exposed and in trouble eventually.</br>      <br>The point is not the assumption, but the declaration by you, assuming someone is one thing is not grounds to call them out on it, as the phrase "TITS or GTFO" is calling you out on your statement, not on an assumption we made. Furthermore, I have been nothing but polite to you, used proper grammar and responded in both a mature and timely manner. Not all men are assholes, and not all women are dainty little flowers, and what I myself am is irrelevant. Since you decided to state your gender on a fully anonymous image board, not only are you calling attention to your gender, you are also asking the men on the board to pay attention to you simply based on your gender and to salivate over your prospective assets. In order to maintain the order, we need proof that your objective here is more then just attention from males. In order to keep the order on this board we need timestamped pics of your breasts so that the pervs will leave the thread and we can continue on with your original objective, this benefits both you and the board, since it results in less requests for something and more productivity, now if you would simply post a picture of your breasts, with the time and date written clearly on a piece of paper in shot, we can all move on to what you wish to do.<br><br>-Sincerely<br> The concerned of /b/</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That's why you don't ask women for advise.</br></br>  <br>So my Gf is going to a private photoshoot and makes clothes and coursettes for women. She's told me not to worry, but I had an ex who used to cheat going and saying she was modeling. Plz halp!</br>    OP Would you show feet w/socks pls?  <br>Timestamp pics, or it didn't happen. <br><br>How would you like it if gay men demanded you humiliate yourself because of your gender organs? <br><br>TOGTFO (twat or get the fuck out)</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Explain to him you have no intention on getting back together with him, if he is smart enough he'll leave you alone. If it escalates just detach yourself from him, don't meet up with him or talk to him in general</br>    My girlfriend forgot that we had plans for the whole day, am I in the wrong to be upset?  <br>u mad?</br>  <br><br>You can't claim to give the perspective of the entire female population. You could claim to give the perspective of the female population that doesn't bathe regularly, posts online for attention, and listens to death metal. I doubt anyone gives a shit about that perspective though.</br></br>          <br>As a women every time a woman says not to worry it's to calm you down while she goes and sucks off the "photographer"<br>end it now while you can without notice. You'll never be happy with her.</br></br>      <br>Have trust in her, it's easy to assume off of past experiences. Tell her that you're uncomfortable with her modelling but you'll let her do it because it makes her happy.</br>  <br>You have value as a human being, but I'm not going to bother with you any longer.</br>  <br>Vag or GTFO</br>  <br><br>Stop dating whores</br></br>  <br>Ask her what else she was doing during the plans. It shouldn't bother you unless it's happened more times then one</br>  <br>I'm your man then: intelligent, nihilistic and with a wicked sense of humor.</br>  <br> [insert passive aggressive PC womanshit here] </br>  OP show feet w/socks pls :(    <br>Any perspective by a female is a female perspective. I wasn't saying I speak for all girls out there.</br>    <br>As a mother you don't just forget something that special. She has no regard for your feelings and does not care about special moments like all women do with the ones they love. In short: you're not a loved one.</br>    <br>I have 2 others bt wanted an azn</br>  <br><br> am I in the wrong to be upset <br><br>Yes, unless its a habit or she doesn't sincerely apologize. Shit happens, people forget things.</br></br></br></br>          <br>seconded</br>    <br><br>You aren't special. Despite being a grungy, fat, vapid cunt, you are still too frigid to post your faceless tits on an anonymous imageboard. Follow the rules. Post your tits.</br></br>  <br>Tits or gtfo i guess.</br>        <br>I have bad wiring, metaphorically speaking. In short, I blurt exactly what is on my mind when asked a question or prompted for any kind of response/ answer. I am still working on this glitch. I'm bright, but stupid socially because of this... I know what went wrong in hindsight, usually moments after I spoke.<br>I'm not particularly honest, but I kinda' have to be because of it. In what I read, ladies would find me a dream come true because if this... but it makes it that those who get past first impressions are also the same ones who eventually hate me, except for my female friends. They love me more than their female best friends but hate the idea of my being more than an occasional friend with benefits.<br>Question: Why do females who want a relationship in a life-mate way need someone who CAN deceive on a regular basis. I have the will... crap ability.</br></br></br>  <br>Go back to dumblr</br>              <br>1. Go to a therapist you Aspie Retard<br><br>2. Stop feeding the attention whore exactly what she wants</br></br></br>      <br>I don't think you're really going for the right women for you, every girl goes for something different in a man so it really isn't fair to generalise the attractions</br>  <br>As a feminist I'd like to point out that not ask wymen desire cis males like yourself.<br>stop raping. And rid your female friends of you.</br></br>      <br>I really like this girl but in the past year before we got together she had more than 3 boyfiends, and cheated on (perhaps) all of them. Now that we've been together awhile (6 months) she told me more about it and says its because she never truly loved them, but says she actually can feel her love for me. Shes my first and only girlfriend and I want us to be together because we make eachother really happy, but my friends are all convinced she'll just cheat on me. I've gotten into a couple dights with her about it and I cant tell if she actually feels bad about it or just crys to get sympathy and keep me close to her. I have no proof she is currently cheating on me whatsoever but I dont want to waste time or effort if she'll make the same mistake again. What do?</br>  <br><br>And please cut off your oppressive penis.</br></br>  <br>admit it: gender cliches are real - all you want is a paycheck to let you sit and care for babies and tan. you want to be treated like shit in exchange.</br>              why would we want femanon advice about relationships? thats like asking children for advice about raising children    <br>Why should she be limited to just you? Women are not your pets to keep around. Without men we can achieve Soooo much more without you cis makes oppressing us. Leave her.</br>      <br><br>Your trolling is so obvious it can be seen from the fucking surface of the moon</br></br>  <br>Stop oppressing me.</br>  <br>Been having a problem with this for awhile, This girl and i have been hooking up and being all lovey dovey for the last year and a half, apparently we've had crushes on eachother for the greater part of our friendships. Anywho we were doing this behind her fiance's back which is shitty i know but he was an awful person. So controlling and whiney. She finally got the stones to leave him yesterday and me being super excited to actually be able to date her (since i was single for most of it) but she isnt talking to me as much definitely not as affectionate. I feel like im the only one trying anymore. Im scared she lost interest or is going with someone else but she still tells me how much she cares about me and all that shit. I dont know im just confused at what to do. Halp.</br>  <br>And get off my thread! Cis scum</br>      <br>I do see a therapist. I can intellectually see things, just cannot relate. "Aspie Retard" is rude. Feeding attention whores what they want to get what I need is a fair trade<br>.<br>So, there are women right for me? I know. I do not know how to find them. Until then, I do my best to "play normal."<br><br>Rude</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Topkek. Your retort is that even though I give her all of me and promise shes the only girl for me, im oppressing HER? Plus, if I wanted an open relationship, thts what I'd have and I wouldn't be asking this question. And I thought guys were gender biased.</br>      <br>If I'm Soooo rude Gtfo my thread!</br>    <br>butthole pics or gtfo</br>  <br>It's Suiseiseki's thread now, bitch/</br>        <br>Oh honey. You're not that great to give. Wymen deserve much more than what your gender offers.<br> nothing btw </br></br>        <br>No, Aspie retard is accurate, if you don't like it, don't fucking come here you worthless little shit stain, you'll never have a girlfriend, so you might as well kill yourself<br><br>How do I know you wont? I'm one too you logically thinking little shithead<br><br>As for you exchanging with an Attention whore, trust me, its not a fair trade, she's getting off on you paying attention to her, her advice is worthless and not compelling nor is it even useful<br><br>welcome to 4chan, you may see it as a website, I see it as a bucket of piss to drown rats in</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Obvious troll is obvious 3/10 for getting me to reply</br>          <br>Now that you explained - fair enough. Thank you.</br>    <br>I might be getting dem feels for one of my best friends exes. We hang out all the time and she constantly tells me how "good" I am and other various complements, while on the other hand she also asks me for advice with her Tinder-fucks. I know that since she's my buddys ex I should just stay away but I won't do that. Wat do?</br>     femanon on /b/ <br><br>why the fuck would I ask advice from you? lmao</br></br>    <br>As a lesbian. I use men as tools. Sorry hun you're nothing more than a dildo. That's why she lost interest in both of your cis scums</br>      <br>Kill them, but make it look like an accident.</br>            <br>He-bitch! It's time to stop posting!!</br>            Op here reminding you that you're relationships mean nothing to your gfs and we'd all be better without men. Strip yourself of your rape sticks and maybe you'll be someone. Thanks for participating in my thread! :D  <br>You're not a lesbian, but an extremely obvious troll, a Lesbian, unless they were also a militant feminist, would never say such a thing, lesbians do not consider men as less then them. You're not a militant feminist, I know this because, unless their raiding us, they avoid this place like the fucking plauge, stop being so obvious, and fuck off<br><br><br>Good to know you're acclimating well, you will get that "Aspie Retard" thing a lot from here, apologies on being so brutal, simply wanted to welcome you in true 4chan style, and give you a taste of what you're in for</br></br></br></br>    <br>Kill yourself, works every time.</br>  <br>Kill yourself</br>  <br> My thread went up in flames so I'll pretend to troll them </br>  <br>Stop oppressing me.</br>      <br>yeah it worked for the from Yu Yu Hakusho</br>  ...  roll  roll  ayy lmao  <br>rolling</br>  ?  roller fuck  roll  ▲<br>▲▲</br>  roll  Rolololol  What did she see, /b      Anon  OP  <br>nice dubs</br>    <br>What am I looking at</br>  <br>The rare creature known as My Little Pepe. <br>Extraordinary.
