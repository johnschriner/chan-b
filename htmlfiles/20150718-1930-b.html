She goes back to fucking  who is on the couch naked. I go home to my house where only me and Coral lives. Coral asks why he can't live with his mom and dad? I cry at night as i masturbate to a picture of my beloved wife.  Wait a moment. Is the other ERP Thread not an ERP Thread?  <br>nope, its labeled incorrectly</br>  <br>Index Edition.</br>  <br>Awwh..... Let me hold it then~</br>  <br>Goddammit, meant to link:<br><br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;628723608 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;628723608 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;628723608 <br><br>Where's my 50 fucking shekels?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it said erp thread tho... idk whats going on</br>  <br>My katana? Sure, just be careful with it.</br>  (The search continues.)<br>Laurel gazed down at the shimmering, shifting mass of people in the arcade below. The wide glass coverage spanned out only two-hundred meters below her, rumbling with the vessel's rhythm in its rapid ascent. She could see, now, why some people referred to it as the 'Fish Market' – indeed, there were schools of humans, ranging from the shiftless to the well-to-do, all meandering about in discordant flow. The Fish Market itself, suspended near a kilometer above the city's base, had once been a marvel of engineering. Fifty years later, and it was just another suburban shopping mall.<br><br>Perhaps that had driven her to take the contract. Ostensibly a government stint, backed by some faceless business group: greasemonkey work on routine flights to adjust relay stations on the obverse side of the moon. The woman's green-painted lips twisted up in a smirk at that; it was better than aimless wandering surface-side, looking for crypto to leech and dying off on a steady stream of toxins in the air and in needles. A long time ago, people thought mutants came from space: turns out they were bred in the city.<br><br>And she was one such mutant: a genemodded rogue cooked up in a woman's womb, and doctored in some off-the-grid lab soon after she'd turned thirteen. No one cared, no one minded: not even she – becoming a grown-up in the Low-town slums was a shitty way to exist. The researchers that tweaked her eyes so she could see the same luminescence that drew exotic creatures to mundane pasture knew that too. She'd been fed, watered, carefully clothed, and even educated by them.<br><br>Five-hundred meters now: people were specks and she could drag her engineer's goggles down to watch them, but didn't care to.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh like this? *puts her mouth around your cock and sucks hard! But then stops suddenly .* You want my warm wet mouth wrapped around it cutie? I didn't hear any begging hehe</br>  (con't from) <br>At that distance, the big metal box was starting to make its way through the smog layer that hung over the city, like some grimy blanket in free-fall toward a bed. The window's treated surface caught flecks of greasy slime, which rolled off the surface in thick drips. The woman reached up, tapping against a hard interface next to the pane, wedged into the thick plastic coating the metal armature. The image shifted, photocells in the porthole rendering a semi-opaque picture of the tall spires in the distance, airways making their spindly way over suspended arcades and shorter towers. <br><br>She sighed: the tallest buildings in the city were constructed out of graceful curves, elongated in bizarre lines and fluid twists, stretching up to scrape the sky with fingertips of alloy and glass. Towers of neo-Babel, designed to tempt some heavenly hand into smiting them to the ground. Individuals no longer existed in the computer-generated impressionist piece, just shifting blobs of mass in dull, peachy tones. Any color drifted in tracers whenever the vessel bounced and rocked against the monstrous cable suspending it, dragging the box-like vehicle up to the stratosphere where it would finally take off.<br><br>Footsteps issued a dull metal ring from behind her, and Laurel cocked her head to the side with her multi-colored tendril hair sweeping about in a bird-like dance, tearing her from those murky ruminations. The alien length of her tongue slurped across her plump lips before she turned, leaning against the reinforced glass porthole she'd been spectating from. Her tan skin folded and her lean muscles rippled as she stretched, pulling up a tight synthetic-leather vest to reveal her midriff and pierced navel.<br><br>“Best view in the house,” Laurel drawled, shrugging to motion at the aperture, “spot's reserved if you want to sight-see, but I could give it up for the right price.”</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The other one was a fake I believe.<br>This is the real deal.</br></br>  Reply to nanako<br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;628723308 <br>Here I am!</br></br>  <br>NOT DEADPOOL</br>  <br>Oh my~ It's so rigid</br>  Reply from the fake thread<br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;628722260 <br>"Yay! Thank you Sponty!" She can see the outline of his rapidly growing erection in his pants as she slowly unzips them. His cock springs up the monent it is free, already hard from being this close to such a magnificent futa.</br></br>  <br>Just stay here... with me~</br>  Waiting for the girl who wanted to have me for dinner. I am still very much interested.  <br>NO SHIT IT WAS FAKE</br>  <br>...Stop it.</br>  <br>Please Mistress! I'll do anything! I just want you to wrap those breasts around my dick and suck the tip!</br>  Walkers start to overrun the camp. I bash every single one that crosses my path keeping coral safe. Coral spots, my wife and <br>across the camp and instantly bolts to them.<br> and my wife cry of happiness knowing coral is safe and immediately leave the area forgetting me. I kill all the walkers and sit alone in the now emtpy camp surrounded by dead bodies. I cry and masturbate to the picture of my beloved wife while covered in all the blood.</br></br>  <br>So for the 5 seconds you aren't boning and moaning, how are ya?</br>  <br>hmm strange why would there be a fake one? looked like there was erp going on to me</br>  <br>Trixie brings her hands up to her back and hugs her tightly.</br>  <br>i'll stay here with you, forever~</br>  <br>Riiiin~<br><br>It's a masterpiece...</br></br></br>  <br>Please continue I'm laughing so hard, I want to know how this ends<br> Rin </br></br>    *Snow purrs* it is? *he pokes her breasts* wow...  <br>Yeah, it was made by some ancient tribe or something, hell if I remember.</br>  <br>Good boy! But no mistress, only Mami! I love hearing my name! *wraps her lips around the tip of your dick and sucks! Her tongue swirling all around it, her breasts squishing it as she moves them up and down!*</br>  <br>*she walks towards you, jerking her huge throbbing member while licking her lips from lust*<br>Mmmh anon... bend over... for your mistress~</br></br>  So who's all in here?  <br>My guess is two people tried to make a thread at once.<br>Everyone kind of got confused about which one to go to.</br></br>  <br>Trainer</br>  <br>Her hands and fingers interlock with Trixie's as Her beloved embraces her. "I love you so much Trix~"</br>  <br>Oh god! Keep going Mami! But it would be wrong for only me to feel good. If you want to 69 and still use those breasts.....</br>  <br>Um.... Not Cyborg that's for sure! Who's Cyborg? Never heard of him. that Aquaman though. Fuck he's sexy, I wish he was here.</br>  <br>If I pull off those drawers, will you fuck me?<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=d99<wbr>94nv8BcU</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>Nah, it was /hga/ being stupid and making a thread titled ERP in disguise as a hangout thread.<br>idk what they thought would happen</br></br>  <br>"Ah!" I moan slightly. "Why did you do that? I mean, I don't mind.... But why?" I say, blushing even more if that was even possible.</br>  <br>HGA THREAD HIT LIMIT<br>WAS HGA THREAD IN DISGUISE</br></br>    <br>Tired of not boning and moaning<br>These threads are tiring, too many intimidated by my manly, whily charms<br>Might have to quit while I'm ahead, gender confused pokemans</br></br></br>  <br>"Yes mistress..."<br>He gets on all fours, his ass pointing towards her. He wiggles it eagerly.<br>"Ready when you are." ;-)</br></br></br>  <br>Of coursh! Unless you refuse my offer in favor of someone else's.</br>  Ab initio confirmed not dead<br>Horribly injured but not dead</br>  im ban  <br>WHAT. THE. FUCK.

Do some stuff</br></br></br>  <br>i was curious... *snow blushes* <br>I Sowwy~ *he pokes it again out of curiosity*</br></br>  <br>I'm glad he turned out fine.<br>Here's hoping he gets better soon.</br></br>  <br>Mmmm, good boy! *she continues to suck and stroke with her breasts! She stops it all, takes off her panties and presses them against your face!* Why don't you get a taste first? Tell me how much you love my panties! *She goes back to sucking, licking and pleasuring your cock! Her breasts squeezing it hard, stroking it!*</br>  <br>Can confirm. Cap of his post.</br>  <br>Hopefully it's not as bad as he made it sound. Regardless, I'm glad we heard from him</br>  <br>"Trixie loves you too!" <br><br><br>"Lewd!"</br></br></br></br>  <br>That was me</br>  <br>Hmm... Suspicious..</br>  <br>"You don't have to just poke em, y'know. You could hold em if you want..." Oh god what am I doing.</br>  <br>Ab Initio was originally known as 'Cheater' since he loved cheating on his girlfriend<br><br>He changed his ways, but his ex girlfriend beat him nearly to death with a bat<br><br>That's the very short version</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>"Hehe, you're quite welcome~"<br>She'll finish removing his pants, now and then 'accidentally' brushing past the pole in his underwear, before going up to remove his shirt.<br>"Hmm, there we go."<br>Once that's done, she'll turn her back to him, and lift up her frilly white hair, exposing the strap of what could barely be rightfully called a 'bra'.<br>"There, now it's your turn~"</br></br></br></br></br>  it's months later and I wander on and find a group of survivors in a mall. Some blonde slut is fucking an old man. I ask to get in on this action. They immediately point a gun at me asking who i am. i simply respond with "i'm officer friendly, from up the road aways". They stop fucking out of fear of being arrested for public indecency. I respond with "well i don't think those rules apply anymore". They immediatly start fucking again telling me to fuck off and let them have their privacy. I go into the back room and masturbate to the picture of my beloved wife, crying the whole time.  Chan Updated.<br><br>http://sin-board.bo.pl/</br></br>  <br>Delicious. I have to taste you! It would be wrong if we didn't come at the same time.<br>*Buries face into your loving folds, caressing them with my tongue*</br></br>  <br>Mine, huh? What do you mean by that, exactly?</br>  <br>*Snow blushes stareing at them* wow... their big...</br>  <br>For you.</br>  <br>What is? I mean I never heard that name in my life! Cy borg? Sounds like a baby band name to me baby!</br>  <br><br><br>He posted a quick message in the other thread<br>Said he was in the hospital since tuesday<br>something about jess finding his baseball bat<br><br>Seemed to be in a lot of pain, Not getting out any time soon and on heavy pain killers that have helped him sleep through most of this week<br><br>that's all he posted before the thread got nuked</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She grinds her cock against your anus slowly, while grabbing your ass and pulling it towards her hips.<br>And not soon later she spits on her cock, smears it, and starts to slowly slide it in, inch by inch. <br>She giggles and says softly: "your really tight today anon... I love that~"</br></br></br>  <br>I am too Snake.</br>  <br>Goood boy~<br><br>Whatever you are doing, don't stop</br></br></br>  <br>I guess we're pretty glad he's alright.</br>  <br>Sure thing! How do you people manage the office logistics of your enterprise?</br>  What happened to the Shimikaze poster?  <br><br>Fucking this. <br><br>I can't shake the slight feeling that it could all be some elaborate ruse, given our location, but it's comforting to see the post.</br></br></br></br>  <br>"Yeah..." I say, holding them up. "They are, aren't they?" I realize that they are right in your face from me holding them. "Oh, sorry!" I drop them down.</br>  <br>i can be more than just a good boy if you want~</br>  <br><br>How strange</br></br>  <br>I'd hate to say this but it'd be foolish to not consider the possibility that he's lied about the whole thing.<br><br>I'd prefer that actually, at least then we'd know for sure he wasn't assaulted</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I'm scared for him man...</br>  <br>Well its a song. But I'm curious to see what you're thinking.</br>  <br>*Snow blushes and pokes the breasts again* Y-Yeah... T-their v-very pretty~</br>  <br>It all starts with a single idea, friend! Outsource if you're still in planning phases, and hire the right people with the right ideas! <br>As you can see from this chart, proper ERP is crucial on the path to success.</br></br>  <br>"Ya like~?"</br>  Where else can I go to ERP and find partners? I'm new to this.  <br>Deadpool is going to break the 4th wall once again and tell you that he is simply trying to bone chicks, not become a wide internet personality</br>  <br>Question: what's CRM?</br>  <br>He fumbles a bit with the strap, but soon succeeds in undoing your bra. He kisses your neck from behind as he takes your bra off. He reaches in front of you and gently caresses your breasts. "How are you so perfect?" He mutters into your ear as his "tent" rubs against your sexy butt.</br>  They finally stop fucking. they let me in the room and ask if i want to come back with them to their survivors camp. I ask if i could find some hot tail there. They respond with "maybe". We arrive back at their camp and all i see is indecent behavior as far as the eye can see. I walk through the camp seing things i never though anyone would do in the woods, especially in front of a crowd of people also doing lewd shit. I hear a fimilliar voice. It's . I dash over to the tent the voice is coming from and unsip the tent door. I am disgusted at the sight of him fucking Coral while my wife masturbates and watches. Coral screams "Daddy! Daddy! as penetrates him. Lori is now fatter and screams for  to plunge his dick deep into her preggo eggo. I am shocked to find that she is now pregnant with his child. They didn't notice my disgusted face peeking into their tent the whole time. I walk off out of the camp into the distance sobbing the whole way. I finally collapse on the side of the road and start to masturbate into the picture of my wife while still sobbing. A walker is attracted to my sad fapping and comes closer. i scream at it "JUST EAT MY DICK! JUST EAT MY DICK!" shaking my penis at it. It comes and nibbles off my penis while i sob uncontrollably. I start to regret my decision and immediately kill the zombie. I cry and lament ass i slowly pass away and turn into a dickless zombie. The end.  <br>Right here. Bend over.</br>  <br>I'm in an ERP thread. What do you think?</br>  <br>In what way may i ask?</br>  <br>2l8<br><br>You've accomplished both in two nights</br></br></br>  <br>"If your uncomfortable, just let me know. You seem a bit nervous." I moan a bit as you touch my breast again. "Like I said, you can do more than just poke em. You can do whatever you want with em really."

I've never taken a dick this big before."<br>He strains against your cock, his asshole squeezing it as if it didn't want to let it out. "Mmm... this feels really good..."</br></br>  <br>Hey, tired?</br>  <br>Thanks~..</br>  <br>U-u-um... O-oh O-k! *nervously Snow puts his tounge to the nipple of the right breast and licks it*<br>S-sorry!</br></br>  <br>in any way you want!</br>  <br>*Blushes* I'll show you my panties if you answer my question. *Playfully teases with her skirt* Will ya? ;)</br>  <br>Right to the point then huh.

I'm just tired..</br></br></br></br>  <br>"Ahh..." I moan a bit louder now, wondering why this is even happening. "You can suck on them too, I won't mind." Why? Why? Why? I can't stop.... He's only 7...</br>  <br>You cheeky cunt m8<br><br><br>Don't listen to him, he's silly.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sleep is for the weak.</br>  <br>You are in an erp thread, small headed girl, I don't know how you are expecting anything other than my dick<br><br><br>O.o<br><br><br>One day, line cutter<br>One day<br><br><br>I think toots would rather kill me than have me put in her, or your, cush caboose</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Oi kunts. Looking for an immigrant Chicky babe to erp with.<br>That Stuff makes me like diamonds</br>  <br>Mind if I give them a little sniff?</br>  <br>As he undoes her bra, her large breasts bounce out freely, ripe for your caresses. You'd find that they're indeed incredibly soft, and her skin silky, almost heavenly.<br>"Mmm~ I don't know, I guess I just am~"<br>She'll then turn her head to face you. The infinitesimal distance separating your mouth from hers would send her heated breath softly flowing onto your face, beckoning you to kiss her.</br></br></br>  <br>"She does~"</br>  <br>CRM threads when?</br>  <br>Nya~?<br>*Snow puts his mouth to it and begines suckling*</br></br>  <br>Or those who are nearing death. like some people :^)</br>  <br>Please kill me oh god please let me die<br><br><br>Oyy m8 I put shaky policies rite here in me gabber</br></br></br></br>  <br>He needs no further urging to move his lips to meet yours. One hand begins slowly kneading your perfect, bouncy, breast as the other moves down and takes hold of your cock and starts stroking. "Do you mind if we start with the 69?" He looks into your eyes, his own filled with lust.</br>  <br>I guess you're right.. I don't know..</br>  <br>"Nngh.... Keep going..." I start to rethink this. I wonder why I'm still doing this. It's so wrong, I should stop....<br><br>But I don't want to. I want more of him. I want him to be with me. Just for a moment, at least. "I like this. Just keep doing it... I can repay you, if you need me to."</br></br></br>  <br>"If you liked that you are going to Love this~" She picks up the phase, starting to fuck you faster and deeper with every thrust. Her throbbing memeber pulsates from pleasure, and she starts to moan very seductively.<br>Her balls are full of her hot seed, and they keep slapping against your ass with every push.</br></br>  <br>Tony-kun! It's been too long...</br>  <br>MODS</br>  <br>*She blushes more with all this attention* Would you mind helping me, then?

I've been pretending for so long now that I don't even know how not to pretend anymore.

You know that moment when you first wake up and you don't know who you are or where you are? I wish that moment could last forever, just forget everything and start over again.

Perfect drink.</br></br>  <br>Fernet branca with coke, ate too much at dinner.</br>  Nice beer and cheap whiskey  <br>Mac and Jack's isn't a homebrew. It's a legitimate micro brewery. And that African Amber you drink? It's close to Smirnoff Ice in terms of drinkability, Grow the fuck up and have a Manny's you faggot.</br>  Drinking a few stouts but I will prolly die in a few months bad I'm a chronic highly functioning alcoholic.... Close to 20 beers a night... My body hurts  <br>If you're okay with that then continue on, otherwise change it.</br>  <br><br>Chill the fuck out man. I love Manny's. Good stuff. And i know its a fucking micro brewery but you still can't buy it in stores. I mean luckily i live right next to the brewery but still. Can't grab it on the weekends.</br></br>  <br>If it's a hot day I usually go with a lynchberg lemonade <br><br>-Jack Daniels<br>-triple sec<br>-sprite</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>considering the fact that im a motherfucking boss, im drinking that steely steel. that high grav. that 211. yall niggas know what im about. pic related, its me gearing up to fuck the tits off your mother.</br>  <br><br>See man, i hate drinking whiskey in the heat, but a good whiskey sour sits just PERFECT when its nice and hot out.<br><br>Jack Daniels/Jim Beam<br>Non-Pulp Orange Juice<br>Lemon Slice<br>Tea Spoon of sugar/salt mix.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Water  I have never drank alone, but I'm having a shitty night.

Cut that "Nigga" shit out.</br></br>  <br>It's all good /b/ro, I just have a distaste for their brew since having to change their awful kegs. Absolutely the worst shape to have to handle when you're busy as fuck behind the bar.</br>  <br>Sounds close to mine. I think either is solid thoug<br><br>Cheers bro</br></br></br>    <br><br>For tonight? Yeah it will make you feel better. <br>Tomorrow morning? You're gonna feel 10x worse.

This is shit compared to Colorado brews.Colorado produces god tier beer.</br>  <br>You mean just the hang over, or something else?</br>  <br>Ever heard of Russian River Brewery?</br>  <br>Seriously no beer is better.</br>  Water  <br> But, that's like, your opinion man </br>  <br>Yeah they're shit<br>Damnation what I had</br></br>  <br><br>I hope so.

But if you start drinking sad, and go to sleep sad, you will wake up sad x10. My experience. May be different for others.</br></br>  <br>Bud light</br>  Can we all just agree that this place makes the best damn beer in the states?  <br><br>You're sure are right about that my dude. It is just my opinion.</br></br>  <br>That shit is fucking disgusting, I wouldn't wish that shit on a confederate flag loving nigger.</br>  <br>We just got the All Day IPA at my restaurant haven't tried it yet. But I will go ahead and disagree and say Odell is the best brewery</br>  Any NC niggas here tonight?  <br>it'll put hair on your dick, and from the way you sound.... you need it.</br>  <br>old rasputin. nuff said</br>  <br>When 1 or 2 beers get you drunk again, you're on the downhill</br>  I tried Dogfish Head's 120 Minute IPA for the first time today. The taste wasn't as punchy as I was expecting, but damn is it strong.  A mixture of half krakken rum and half coca cola. Been drinking this same mix every night for the last month finishing a bottle of krakken and a six pack every night...... Yup... FML.  <br>My home state</br>  <br>No I'm sorry but founder's does.<br>It's been established look it up</br></br>    <br>that shit will fuck you up</br>  <br> old rasputin <br>Huh never had it, Brewery is a couple hours north of me I might have to make a trip</br></br>  Silent Sam  <br>Look it up founder's is the best brewery in ameria</br>    Popov  Not drinking right now but a Sazerac is a god tier cocktail.

Not some piss that's the cheapest shit in the storestore nobody likes a cheapskate.</br>  <br>Gross. Thats some high school shit.</br>  Anyone heard of the KBC?  <br>Nice. I like kraken with just a splash of coke and lots of ice.</br>  <br>lol how about no</br>  <br>I know. Sad. Drink it straight here.</br>    <br>I love me some krakken. Its funny, I had a friend over who hates krakken but loves the bottle and was willing to trade the bottle she bought (that was full) for an empty clean bottle (of which I have far tll many) because all she wanted was the bottle. Free drinks are good drinks</br>  Pepsi earlier, now water.  <br>As of 2013, two of its beers, Kentucky Breakfast Stout (KBS) and Canadian Breakfast Stout (CBS), were ranked among BeerAdvocate's top 10 beers, with CBS ranked as the 4th best beer in the world by user review.[9] In a 2013 poll, Ratebeer.com listed Founders as the, overall, 3rd best brewery in the world;[10] Founders was 2nd place in 2011 and 2012.[11] In April 2010, Founders won four medals at the World Beer Cup in Chicago, Illinois,[12] and the brewery went on to win two more medals at Denver's Great American Beer Festival in September of that year.[13] The brewery also won an award at the 2012 World Beer Cup in San Diego, California <br><br>Maybe not the best in the world but you'd be hard pressed to find anything better in america</br></br></br>  <br>Where. You from? I live in nevada and ive never seen this in a store???</br>  Popov fag here. Why do you guys drink?  <br>ahh but...</br>  <br>Michigan. The Great Beer State.</br>  <br>To forget and numb myself to the fact that my ex is a whore who less than a month after accepting my proposal and engagement ring fucked some guy behind my back</br>  If you haven't had a founders beer you're truly missing out on something amazing. <br>It's a bold statement I know, but wait until you've tried it</br>  <br>I'm from Spain</br>  <br>this and Sol, because im depressed...</br>  <br>I'm from Columbus, there is nothing great about *ichigan. The whole state sucks.</br>  <br>i will try and look for it.

No joke.</br></br>  <br>Clearly you've never been to grand rapids where founder's is located. Don't get me wrong michigan has some really shit areas but grand rapids makes some fine beer</br>  <br>right on, the good shit</br>  <br>With mercury levels that will kill you. By all means drink up.</br>  <br>Rate beer has let me down before. I really need to take a trip and check it out myself. I frequent RRB a bit and the seem to consistently make great stuff.</br>  Mill Street coffee porter  <br>this!</br>  Step up nigga  <br>No I've been there, is far as I'm concerned Canada can have you.</br>  <br>What's your poison anon?

Suburban Ohio fag go home.</br>  <br>Doood, that shit is scary.</br>  <br>You have noticed the population of your state is rapidly falling, umm why do you think that is.</br>  <br>Well at least Canada's not filled with judgemental pricks who can't admit when they're wrong.<br>Go back to fucking bald eagles and Huntin' either way it'll never make your parents proud</br></br>  <br>Well anon, I'm taking a drink for you, I hope you can do the same for me. May our pain end in a wonderful end of consciousness for us both.</br>  <br>My old man's favorite beer right there</br>  8 PM- 12 AM EST I was drinking Patron<br><br>Present moment: Kahlua <br><br>I'm pretty fucked up. It's good though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The Upper Peninsula shouldn't even be considered part of the state. You only got it because you lost a border war with us and congress felt sorry for you.</br>  <br>See not even Canada want you.</br>  <br>Thanks for the honesty /b/ros. I drink to relieve the anxiety and to pretend to be social. And bc I can't stop.</br>  Homebrew pale ale courtesy of my uncle. Tastes quite good considering he doesn't drink, though I'd have preferred more foam.    <br>Best IPAs and maybe sours</br>  <br>Me neither. Nice dubs. I'm serious anon. Guess what man, this faggot loves ya. Because you're honest. More than I could have asked from my ex fiance. We will either die or we will learn and grow out of this numbing pain of drinking to forget. So for now, live it up. I believe in you more than I believe in me anon.</br>  <br>Bullshit and you know it. But you have a point, I lived up there for a few years and they aren't like us trolls (live below the bridge). I even saw a few coins the UP minted</br>  Got a keg of two hearted ale.. awww yeah  <br>Don't feed the trolls.<br>Michigan won</br></br>  Step up, you edgy faggots.  Stuff's good as fuck.  <br>Not bullshit but I appreciate your honesty. That we can at least drink to.</br>  <br>Amanda? Is that you?</br>  <br>Nope we fought over Toledo and we won.

Thanks for being there.</br>  <br>Love founders. We're just getting them in sweden. The centeniall ipa and the all day ipa, both are some of my favorite ales.</br>  <br>Definitely part of it. Makes for some great football though.</br>  <br>And for you. I hate these but the words are true.</br>  <br>Odell's 90 Shilling is damn fine. As is the Levity Ale. Top 15?</br>  <br>Oh no you're mistaken I'm not saying we won that war I'm saying that we won in the general scheme of things. Because unlike you we don't keep pointing out the past and trying to live present day victories through past ones. We also are able to stay on point and not talk about something no one gives a shit about in a thread that had absolutely nothing to do with the past and some war no one cares about instead we are focused on the present.<br>And how much better of a state we are. Through our beer which is what I'm drinking right</br></br>  <br>...now</br>  <br>Word. Trips don't lie. MI fag still here</br>  <br>Trips <br>Ohio<br>Does<br>Suck<br>Dick</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Haha detroit area code 313. Rekt</br>  <br>I goofed</br>  <br>And Michigan's pretty alright if you get past Detroit and flint.<br>Definitely better then ohio</br></br>  <br>Ummm Ohio State is the national champions in football. Your state is losing population rapidly because it sucks. And your beer must be cool-aide because you're high.</br>  <br>Ale, ginger ale.</br>  <br>Unfortunately they're true. That doesn't make believing them any easier. <br>In all honesty I joind the army (being deployed in two weeks), so that I could feel like a part of something again. Its kinda worked. But I picked something as an MOS that's equally scuicidal and useful in the civilian sector. This way I'm equally prepared in either area. Anon, I hope you chose a better path than me. I got through based on a foundation of lies. For your sake I hope you find the truth. I've been able to find purpose through kids far better than through truth and its not a good way to live. Find yourself the leave that I've never been able to.</br></br>  Flintoid here  Some gin and tonic, stuck in the bathroom shitting a storm so might as well enjoy myself  <br>Working on it man.

I like pussy juice</br>  Don't let this die /b/ros  <br>The trips have spoken</br>  <br>And also my trips have spoken, fuck *ichigan.</br>  <br>Neither do I. But anon, not to put pressure on you, but I intend to die in my deployment. I'm going to be in a wartime area. Im going to look out for my new brothers and sisters. But Im not going to look out for myself. Anon, you need to look out for yourself. I'm not worth it. But you are. Regardless of what you may think, you're worth it. Find what you want, and fight for it hard. No matter what it is.</br>  <br>Forgot to tag post. Flint is pretty bad, I live here. Used to have hope but no.</br>  <br>okaye</br>  <br>I think you gotta lookout for your sake and that of your team, you're no good to them dead. And I have those relationships problems like you, odd.</br>  I'm sorry but why isn't Ohio state on this top list but michigan state is?<br>Maybe academics mean more.<br>Ohio state ranked at:154<br>University of Michigan: 45</br></br></br>  <br>What trips are you talking about retard?</br>  /b/, seeing that most of you have some very distorted ideas about the Malvinas/Falklands deal in Argentina, i'd like to clear things up a bit.<br><br> Argentina wanted to fight Britain for malvinas. <br>How retarded do you think we are? "Hey guys, i know we have the shittiest military equipment available and our navy sucks, but let's fight one of the worlds strongest military powers!" No.. just no...<br>A dictator started that war with two intentions:<br>1-To rally the argentinos to his side under the threat of a common enemy (Failed)<br>2-To send the (Possibly)revolutionary demographic to die.(Worked)<br>Here there was obligatory military service for men ages 18-21 for up to 2 years. This allowed the dictators to send a bunch of poorly trained possible insurgents to die, while pointing the blame towards the brits. Previously these dictators would litteraly make you dissapear and never be seen again, but it was causing too much trouble to do it that way.<br><br>My parents count by the dozens the amounts of friends lost during this period, especially since we are from La Plata, the city that saw the worst of it.<br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/628730630#p628730630">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  How many people on /b/ actually have autism/aspergers? This is a legitimate question  I got it.  This isn't gonna be a Bad Boy Bubby thing is it?  I have been professionally diagnosed with aspergers  My sister has it....  <br><br> Proud to be obselet </br></br>  Well according to our statistics....  <br>ADDfag here</br>  <br>I am objectively better than you</br>  <br>Mild aspergers here. Diagnosed late in life... explained a lot.</br>  Im normal as fuck, the fags ITT i hope you dont think you are a norm cause you see other retards  Filthy aspie here reporting in.  I have been diagnosed with aspergers.  pls let that cat go  nice  Professionally diagnosed when I was 4... Not all that bad.... Just not to open to change in my life out my surroundings.... Sadly I have no thought to speech filter. But I can learn to do almost anything... Well so far I've got a large list of things I'm good at.... Ooh and funny thing... I can't give a compliment to save my life...  <br>I was diagnosed with autistic spectrum disorder. Not entirely convinced I have it. The doctor gave me the paperwork so I can start collecting my autismbucks so im not going to argue.</br>  <br>If you talk like you type, it wasnt that hard to diagnose it</br>  Even if I act 99% of the time like a total Celeri, and that I have the attention span of a Fruit, Im not diagnosed.  Everyone.    Not me, but my bro. Respect.  <br>Are you that retarded to be in denial</br>  <br>Fuck off man. Nothing's wrong with the way he types.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>wwtf mate</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks :-P I'm on my phone... I just don't see the need to use proper grammar with you fucktards ;-)</br>    <br>Its not the grammar. You stutter when you type. Whats up with that</br>  <br>6</br>  <br>Wow thanks! A true /b/ro!</br>  <br>:-P</br>  <br>  :-P <br>  ;-) <br> aspergers confirmed </br></br></br>  <br>I just like the ellipsis....</br>  <br>That film is pure evil, god why did I saw it</br>  <br>you realize ADD isnt even close to autism/aspergers in effect or severity right? (normie here btw)</br>  <br>Are you gonna strangle the cat or what? Maybe water board it in the toilet?</br>  <br>I think i have autism but when i tell people they just laugh and say that i am definetly not autistic</br>  I was diagnosed with ADHD at the age of 4, then Assburgers at 6. Hyperactive, talkative, and very obsessive with my interests. It wasn't until I hit my teens that I began to settle down and take my life more seriously.<br><br>I'm a relatively simple man.<br><br> don't talk to anyone <br> mind your business <br> stay at home so you stay safe <br> NEVER message people on Facebook, unless they message you first <br><br>I'm comfortable this way.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who?</br>  <br>so basically just a normal person?</br>    I literally have Aspergers Syndrome. Super non-severe. AMA.  <br>I would say yes but if you were to talk to me irl you'd be able to tell I have something up. I don't make eye contact for more than three minutes and I talk really low.</br>  <br>I have it...</br>  <br> having a facebook account <br>normie</br></br>  <br>I have alcoholism, does that count?</br>  I was diagnosed with mild to moderate autism a few months ago at age 22. Still seems kind of bullshit, but hey, who am I to argue with the experts? <br><br>Also isn't Aspergers technically not a thing anymore?</br></br>  <br>kärlek är som en vässad kniv</br>  Probably not many. Social anxiety, alcoholism, and depression would be off the charts though.  <br>3 minutes? that almost an eternity. I can barely handle 3 seconds.</br>  <br>most of /b/</br>  <br> I don't make eye contact for more than three minutes <br>I can't make eye contact with videos of people looking into the camera. Eat a dick, anon</br></br>  <br>what the fuck. not only is the legitimacy of that "disease" questionable, it contributes absolutely fucking nothing to the thread. kill yourself. its not a real disorder you attention seeking slut.</br>  <br>I have been aspergers professionally with a diagnosis. I also do the biggest cums</br>  <br>Yeah it now falls under Autistic Spectrum Disorder</br>  <br>My autism score is 4i</br>  <br>dude...normal people cant maintain eye contact for 3 minutes wtf. its just uncomfortable. and the talking low could just be a lack of confidence.</br>  <br>Freak</br>  <br>if younger sis, i feel bad for you. shit must be annoying as fuck</br>  <br>this</br>  <br>How is it questionable. Studies have shown that there are physical differences in the area of the brain that deals with self control in people who have ADHD compared to people that don't.</br>  <br>This is me in a nutshell, though I was diagnosed a bit later. <br>The biggest thing is the not talking to people on Facebook. I've never been able to initiate conversations.</br></br>  <br>Im bipolar, diagnosed by a psychiatrist.<br><br>Does that counts?</br></br></br>  <br> implying typing like an aspie is wrong <br>dude you are worse than fucking Autism Speaks.

Don't think of it as a handicap. At least not debilitating. You seem pretty cool. My brother has ADHD, he has trouble sometimes with his emotions, but he has lots of friends. My best friend has it, hes stubborn as fuck though. Another good friend has it, he harnesses it to be hilarious and is everyone friend. <br><br>Learn to use it to your advantage. Treat it as a Balloon. Fill it with helium and it will help lift you. Fill it with water and it will weigh you down.</br></br></br>  Anyone know any tv shows that'd be good to fall asleep to cause I have ADHD and it's hard to focus on one thing while I sleep.
