But you know what I like a lot more than materialistic things?<br>Knowledge. In fact, I'm alot more proud of these 7 new bookshelves that I had to get installed to hold 2000 new books that I bought. Its like the billionaire Warren Buffett says "the more you learn, the <br>more you earn".<br>Now maybe you've seen my Tedx talk where I talk about how I read a book a day, you know I read a book day not to show off, again it's about the knowledge.<br>in fact the real reason I keep this Lamborghini here is that it's a reminder, a reminder that dreams are still possible because it wasn't that long ago that I was in a little town in a little town across the country sleeping on a couch in a mobile home with only $47 in my bank account. I didn't have a college degree, I had no opportunities. But you know what? something happened that changed my life, I bumped into a mentor and another mentor and a few more mentors. I found 5 mentors and they showed me what they did to become multi-millionaires.<br>Again, its not just about money, its about the good life, health, wealth, love and happiness. Now this isn't a get rich quick scheme. You know, if they say things sound too good to be true, they are too good to be true. I'm not promising you that tomorrow you're going to be able to go out and buy a Lamborghini, but what I am telling you is that it can happen faster than you think if you know the proven steps.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Roll</br>  <br>Reroll</br>  So, beautiful, do you want watch a movie tonight?

The system thinks im legit and eligible for upgrade to W10<br><br>My question is now that i have authentic W10 upgrade running from pirated W7 (ISO plus daz loader) can i do clean install with the new product key it generated via the upgrade? by downloading the W10 ISO from MS site<br><br> tl;dr  <br>Whats the easiest way to do a authentic W10 clean install upgrading from Daz loader copies</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>no<br>just upgrade to win10 and do a "reset this pc"</br></br>  <br>windows 10 is free<br>you need no product key</br></br>  <br>free if you have computer with a product key of window 8/8.1 embedded into bios</br>  <br>But that doesn't do clean install all it does is deletes the old folder... I want to completely wipe the HDD and start from scratch. I will get a W10 key, many people with w7 running daz loader reported to having successfully upgraded to authentic W10 that means they got their own W10 key generated by the system</br>  <br>Windows 7 is included as well.. please read the OP im not asking that<br><br>I already know im elegible to upgrade to W10 going from my Daz loader activated W7 OS<br><br>My question is.. once im up and running W10 can i do a clean install using the ISO from MS site with my new product key that appears on MY PC</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Download windows 10 from piratebay</br>  <br>NO i want legit copy</br>  I was also running a pirated version of W7.<br> Download the .ISO <br> Burn it to a DVD <br> Launch the upgrade process <br> "Upgrade this PC" <br>Then when you log back into your upgraded W10, wait a few minutes for it to activate.<br>Then;<br> Launch the upgrade again <br> Reset this PC <br> Product key? "Skip" <br> ??? <br> Profit <br><br>I fucked this up the first time when I tried to do a clean install on an new SSD. I had to upgrade first for W10 to activate. <br><br>Google "clean install windows 10"<br>They all pretty much say the same thing.

I think I remember you from /an/ a while back  <br>are people not afraid its a tiger or some shit? will they not shoot it down? also does it go outside?</br>  How big is it/will it get?  <br>Why not ?</br>  <br> <br>They usually run up a bill of about 6k to 10k<br><br>Mine was 7k<br><br>He cost me a pretty penny.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>30 to 40 pounds and can stand about 4,6<br><br><br>Mine is only 2 years old though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Majestic, post more pics</br></br>  <br>do you live in the states? if so, how easy was it to get one? and i assume you require an exotic pets licence? <br><br>my uncle lives in TX and owns a cougar, it used to come onto his property and fuck around with his dogs, was apparently pretty friendly, as it was very young, but he was told that he needed a licence to own it and had to go through a pretty long process of applying for it.</br></br></br>  does a stitch in time, save nine?  <br>Is he cuddly or semi-feral standoffish?<br><br>If he's cuddly, does he do normal cat shit like want to sit on your chest and nuzzle you (crushing your ribs in the process, obviously)?</br></br></br>  <br>Why on earth would you pay that much for a cat? Anything special about it? Temperament?</br>  My grandfather has one, he's beautiful. He can jump so high its amazing, truley an amazing creature.  <br>I'm not OP, but I'm pretty sure it just acts more like a dog, more friendly, learns tricks easier (I think) and looks cool.</br>  <br><br>No, in my state/city you need to be out of the city limits in order to own a Serval.<br><br>They made sure before i got him that i had an outside cage all set up and things servals need. Pond/Trees/ things to jump on and explore.<br><br>I'v seen some people on youtube who has there Serval just running around in there house.<br><br>But like i said, in my town you need to be equipped in order to own one..<br><br>so that no it can not go outside.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How much did you pay for it?</br>  <br> so that no it can not go outside. <br>oh ok, otherwise people would lose their shit right if they saw that? in my country hunters kill everything that moves, cats rabbits, everything.</br></br>   Ask a Guy any thing who owns an African Serval <br><br>Where did you learn grammar?</br></br>  <br>Hâve you named it Babou ?</br>  <br>I think it has more to do with it being really fast and kills alot of animals.</br>  where and how much/often does it take a dump?  Is it a friendly cat or more of a wild cat that's agressive?  <br>that country is Arkansas</br>  <br> taxidermy display </br>  <br><br>I live in the out skirts of midland Tx.<br><br>So only out of the city limits i am able to own my kitty.<br><br>And honestly, getting this cat was fairly simple.<br><br>The only hard part was making sure i had an outside cage all set up to meat requirements and few other miscellaneous things etc etc.<br><br>And that's pretty cool about your uncle! <br>Cougars are pretty neat!<br><br>all places are different.<br><br>They didn't make me own a Permit/LC<br>But if it was a Tiger or a Somethig along those lines i'm sure things would be different</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>enclosure pic?</br>  <br><br>Sorry about my typos, i have jittery fingers.<br><br>Also it's not so much people would lose there shit but's it's more along the fact that they are not native to Tx.. so letting to many except could be bad.. <br><br>Also if i somehow lost my Serval they did make sign a paper saying something along the lines of.. if i don't take care of this exotic/wild animal i will not be able to legally ever purchase another Wild/Exotic<br><br>So they are pretty strict.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  do you enjoy buying new furniture once a week due to that fucker destroying it.  <br>yeah, i don't know a lot about the details of what my uncle had to go through to own one, but he lives just outside of city limits of dallas, didn't even know that there were many wild cougars around there, <br><br>but he lives on a very large piece of land and has no neighbors for quite a way, and has an outdoor enclosure for it, but says most of the time that it just sleeps in the house with his dogs and goes outside only for exercise/to piss/shit.<br><br>I also live in TX and have always wanted to get one, where i live definitely has enough room, but i'm more concerned about the costs of owning one, how much are they overall (food, vet fees, licences, etc.)</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this</br>  <br><br>Are you me?</br></br>  <br>Did you name it after a Pokemon</br>  <br><br>Yes</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>No pics of my enclosure on my phone,<br><br>and i am actually out of town, so that's the only reason i am not 4Chan, just killing a little time.<br><br>If you guys have a kik or a skype i can add you and i can show you when i get back?<br><br>Sorry.<br><br>My skype is ClukCanBoo</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>No, why do you think that?</br></br>  <br><br>He was De-Clawed almost as soon as we got him.<br><br>The only thing he dose this pisses me off.. is when he sprays the house.<br><br>So he really stays outside most of the time.<br><br>Like right now i am out of town, so he stays outside, but i have a friend who is checking up on him 3 or 4 times a day.<br><br>And yes it is a pain to be out of town.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Totally misread that. Could of sworn it said "several africans"  <br>You majestic little beast. I would ride it to battle. Dammit OP post more pics</br>  when are you planning on coming back to the UFC?  <br><br>I love big cats.<br><br>But my Serval by any means isn't a huge scary cat.<br><br>But he dose have a diet of raw meat.<br><br>And we both know meat can cost$$<br><br>So what we do i has a fridge dedicated to frozen meat, so it keeps us from running to the store every day.<br><br>We spend around or close to 4 to 5 hundred on food. And right now he's at that age where he needs allll the calcium he can get to make him bigger and stronger.<br><br>But a Cougar probably would eat 2x as much.. so.. over the course of his life it will be sorta costly.<br><br>I am not sure though.<br><br>Because some people who have tigers or lions have like deals with local farmers who sell to them in bulk for cheaper.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Also sorry for my typos, typing on my phone sucks</br></br></br>  is he cuddly?  <br>Underrated post</br>  <br><br>Very.</br></br>  <br>:)</br>  <br>yeah, i also love big cats, fascinated by them, and think that it would be great to own one, but i'm conscious of making sure that i can actually provide a good environment for it to live in, without it getting distressed, etc.<br><br>i'd probably be looking at getting a smaller one, like a serval, bobcat, lynx, etc. whichever is easiest to get in my area. <br><br>do you just feed your serval grocery store meat? or do you buy meat purposed for feeding big cats? i know that my uncle gets some special stuff from the dallas zoo that he buys from them every few months, and keeps it in a refrigerator in a shed next to his cougar's enclosure. apparently the meat has extra nutrients, etc. for the cat, is that necessary or just optional?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> any thing <br>What school did you not go to, fuckwit</br></br>  who'd win out of a fight between a Staffordshire Bull Terrier and a Seral?  <br>That FUCKING filename.</br>  <br><br>I go to my local H-E-B G/Store to and buy raw steaks/chicken/turkey you name it.<br><br>I'll bring home an ass load of meat and stuff it all in the meat fridge. <br><br>When feeding i'll start by thawing a piece of chicken and a leg or two and clean it thoroughly.<br><br>I have been told that they also get extra nutrients from guts and all.. but i don't do that because i am a little leery of viruses.. <br><br>And the last thing i wanna feed my Serval is a bad chicken.<br><br>So i always clean mine.. but some people just buy the whole chicken and let them chew on it.. no cleaning.. guts and all.<br><br>And if these cats where domesticated then you could just feed it kibble and be fine. because they are pretty far away from there wild side.<br><br>But since Tigers/Lions/M.Lions/And servals are all wild animals.. so you can't just feed them food from the pet store.. you need to prepare your food for the cat every time.<br><br>It's not really easy.. but you do get in a regular routine</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You can't take it outside? that's stupid. Servants aren't even as dangerous as dogs.</br>  <br>okay, thanks for all the info man, i've been toying with the idea of adopting one for a while now, will look into it some more and see about getting an enclosure set up, <br><br>two final questions : how much exercise do they require? would a serval be content with just having a few toys, pool, etc. in its enclosure, or would you need to take them for a jog for example?<br>and finally, are they okay with other animals? i own a pretty big dog (lab/border collie mix), he's very good natured and would likely be fine around a big cat, but would the cat get aggressive around other animals?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Tough to say really. The terrier was bred to kill large prey by going for the throat, hence the big jaws and hind legs. The serval is an awfully small and quick target though, far more so than all the other things it was bred to kill. I'd still say the terrier though, because even if it doesn't hit the throat a bite anywhere would be pretty devastating.</br>  <br><br>  He was De-Clawed almost as soon as we got him. <br><br>"I'm a cunt who wants a badass feral cat but I take away his most important tool to do all the shit that makes him feral. I have Down syndrome and I love cock."</br></br></br></br>  <br>On second thought, the serval mainly hunts frogs and rodents. The terrier would win, no contest.</br>  <br>It really is a fucked up process. Imagine someone just cut off the first joint of all your fingers.</br>  <br>Man it appears you treat the animal right and know about his needs, but how could you declaw him? It´s like cutting your distal phalanges.</br>  <br>Timestamp or gtfo</br>  <br><br>Introducing a Wild animal any kind really needs to start when they are younger.<br><br>I am not saying you (Can't) do it when they're older, but it's a hell of a lot easier.<br>And each cat is different and has it's own quarks. <br><br>So for my Serval he's been with my Lab and my other two normal house cats since he was born.<br>So they get along really well.<br>But i do know Wild animals don't really like sharing what they own.<br><br>So a different litter box is mandatory.<br><br>If one of your other cats tries to use it, the Serval will never use it.<br><br>So he kinda needs he's "Own" stuff, toys,food, that sorta thing.<br><br>As far as &gt;Exercise goes, keeping them active is completely up to the owner.. you can't just hand them a toy and go back into your room and forget about them for a few hours. you need to keep them active, because<br><br>if you don't they will start spraying everything and destroying stuff.<br><br>Keeping a wild animal happy/active will play a big roll into his/hers health.<br><br>It's a job, but if you love them enough you never feel like you do enough for them.<br><br>It's like owning a child, but you'd never give him up for anything.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/staffor<wbr>dshirebullterrier.htm<br><br>Alparently those Bulldogs only get up to like 38 pounds. If servals really do weigh up to 40 pounds (doubt it though. That's how big Bobcats usually are) the cat would wear that dog out in no time. Even if it only weighed 30 pounds. Generally, a cat half the size of a dog/wolf will fuck it up to the point where the canine says fuck this and bails. They use their claws and speed to tear shit up but probably couldn't kill the dog.<br><br>But not op's cat. It would get wrecked because he's a pussy and declawed it.</br></br></br></br></wbr></br>  <br><br>Also the cage doesn't need to be Zoo like, but cage about a hundred feet in each direction would be ideal.</br></br>  <br><br>I really didn't like doing that to him, but when he plays.. he likes to play rough.<br><br>And If he had claws i would be a very cut up person right now.<br><br>He still bites, but i could ever play with him like i do if he still had claws.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Moar pics?</br>  <br> Introducing a Wild animal any kind really needs to start when they are younger. <br>yeah, if i were to get one, i'd definitely get it as young as possible, and have a cat that goes outdoors to do its business, so no litterbox for it, same goes for my dog, so getting the big cat stuff of its own wouldn't be an issue, and i take my dog for a run twice a day, once before i head off to work and a second time in the evening, i'm sure that i could incorporate a big cat into that somehow, but would definitely need to take a good amount of time to look into it and see if it's viable for me to own one whilst also owning a dog and occasionally having to make business trips. <br><br><br>space isn't an issue, i live in one of my mom's houses, she now lives in long island and so i stay at her house which is outside of grand prairie, has a lot of garden space and a swimming pool which never gets used, i'm sure that without much work i could turn it into quite a large enclosure for the cat, easily 100x100 +<br><br>thanks for taking the time to answer all these questions, a nice change from the usual stuff you see on /b/</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Seriously. Cats use their claws for everything. Climbing, self defense, hunting. When cats get pissed, what do they do? Swat the fuck out shit. When your cat tries to bite, it doesn't just snap at you, it tries to grab your hand with its paws and bring it to its mouth to bite. Not to mention the fact that you just took out the end portion of its bone. Surely that has some effect on its running and balance. Id understand it if you bought a pussy ass house cat and had to keep it inside. Cool.<br>But damn op just dropped 7 grand on a fucking cat for the sole purpose of having a pet that was the closest thing to feral as possible.... Then he made it so the cat couldn't do a lot of the shit he bought it for. Derp</br></br>  <br><br>Anytime, ^^<br><br>Also if you have anymore questions you can add me on my Skype<br><br><br> Clukcanboo </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>noted, will be sure to add you if i ever have any more questions! <br>thanks again!</br></br>  <br>Is this you?</br>  <br>But it's a badass cat regardless</br>  <br><br>  And If he had claws i would be a very cut up person right now. <br>  He still bites, but i could ever play with him like i do if he still had claws. <br><br>Nigga just throw on some leather gloves and a carhart. <br><br>  I bought a beach house but I keep getting sunburned. <br>  sunscreen? <br>  no I think I'll just stay inside </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How much did it cost and how much does it cost to maintain? I fucking love those animals, I wanna have one someday.</br>  <br>Read the thread twink. 7 grand and a couple hundred on food a month. Plus average vet bills and the cost to make the enclosure which was probably a couple grand.</br>  <br><br>I payed 7 grand.<br><br>And i spend about $400 to $500 a month on him. <br><br>And it's nice to see people interested in Servals.<br><br>I don't recommend faint of heart.<br><br>But if you got the time, they can make for an amazing family member.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why did You allow this creature to become fat?<br><br>I sincerely hope you're not American. It's irresponsible fuckers like you that are killing our nation, and making those of us that aren't hams look bad by association</br></br></br>    <br>Found the fat ass</br>  <br><br>Trying to fight trips with those singles?</br></br>                        I am not a robot.  <br>I love how op is conviently avoiding your question<br><br>Allowing children/animals that are under your care and don't know any better to become fat is abuse, plain and simple.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Good job on being samefag.<br><br><br>I don't respond to questions that have no base interest.<br><br>You're just trying to make me eat your bait.<br><br>But by the looks of it, you've already done that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Does he love you?  <br><br>He is very affectionate.<br><br>He's a little leery of strangers, but full of love.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Also what is your occupation</br>  <br>Is his purr insanely deep?</br>  <br><br>I don't work. <br><br>I play the stock market enough to get by.<br><br>I was also lucky enough to have land with oil rigs that where passed down to me.<br><br>So i honestly have a lot of time to my self.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I wouldn't say so.<br><br>He loves to purr though.<br><br><br>And bite.. haha</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hahaha<br><br>Your animal is fat, and you denying it is a bad sign for its future</br></br></br>  <br>Good job on being an abusive owner fuckwad</br>  <br>how do you feel about f1 bengals? have one</br>  <br>Cheryl had an ocelot</br>  it's too fat OP  <br><br>No, i never really though about a f1 Bengal or a f1 savannah.<br><br>But from what i know f1 savannah can cost around 15 to 20 grand.</br></br></br></br>  <br>heres my bengal and f2 savannah,</br>  <br><br>Wow! Very pretty cats! How much did you pay for both if you don't mind me asking?</br></br>  <br>Where english you did?</br>  <br>they're just normal cats</br>  <br> "meat requirements" <br><br>Do you have a third grade education OP?</br></br></br>  <br>Ha you got me, i didn't look at the pic very closely.</br>  <br><br>Have you ever tried typing on an I phone?<br><br>It's hard as fuck.<br><br>Fuck off.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>see<br><br>The rules are very strict and requires that the animal be kept in good health and blah blah so they probably check up on him from time to time as well. If the serval gets loose, then he'll probably get his license revoked and the animal will be found anyway, hopefully without being harmed. The guy should be able to play with his giant cat/dog bastardization as long as he's able to take care of it appropriately, he dint do nuffin.</br></br></br>  <br>the savannah was a little under 2k and the bengal was 3</br>  <br>here's a pic of a lion i bought, cost me around 50,000 but was well worth it</br>    <br>they look like normals cats to me too, i guess im just used to it</br>  <br><br>Hey let's point out about something OP said for no reason.<br><br>How dare you miss spell a word OP.. you're going STRAIGHT to hell!! Besides /b/ is VERY strict about grammar, because secretly 4Chan is a spelling /b/ee</br></br></br></br>  <br>You de-clawed your serval...great. why not just stab his fucking eyes out, smash his teeth in with a hammer and cut his nose and lips off whilst your at it?<br><br>You fucking bastard. I'd like to declaw you with a fucking angle grinder you fuck.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Is that here or to go?</br></br>  I needs this cat    <br>Bones nose</br>  <br>Is he cuddly?</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>Didn't someone already ask this?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is actually a good question<br><br>OP, would you care to explain?<br>You could ignore me, but I'm genuinely curious; it must take effort and money to get a naturally fit cat fat</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes. I mad...<br><br>All cats NEED their claws. Any cat that has been declawed will basically be a depressed faggot.<br><br>I bet OP doesn't even buy live game for his Serval to hunt and kill every now and again...</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> being this upset <br> ISHYGDDT </br></br>  <br>Isn't it obvious?<br><br>He's an irresponsible owner. He fucking declawed the poor thing for christs sake.<br><br>When he isn't ignoring questions that don't validate him, he usually cries out "samefag1!!1" as a way of avoiding it altogether.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>not op, but fuck off, i bet you're anti-vaccination too.<br><br>while i've never owned a large cat, i don't imagine that it's a painful process, and the cat definitely doesn't need fucking claws when it's living in some dude's back yard. the claws would be used for hunting/climbing and general survival in the wilds, but that is irrelevant when you're living in the US and getting fed regularly.</br></br></br>  <br>Hm. <br>Well at the risk of him invoking his defensive "samefag" response, is like to Hear it from him, himself.<br><br>But i believe your rationale is correct. It's likely that he himself is overweight and leads a sedentary lifestyle based on what I've read in this thread. Shame he had to bring his animal down with him though.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't know why people keep asking.. and i am not sure if it's the SAME person.<br><br>But i'll go ahead and explain anyways.<br><br> 1: THIS IS NOT MY FUCKING CAT, Mine is back home but i am currently out of town, i am using this serval as a reference. <br><br><br> 2: I don't know about you guys, But Servals grow to be large cats and to me the pic of the one i posted just looks like a bad picture of it. <br><br> 3: READ 1 <br>This site sometimes i swear..<br><br><br>IF YOU WANNA SEE MY SERVAL...<br><br><br>ADD ME ON SKYPE.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Skype name?</br></br>  <br><br>It's Clukcanboo<br><br><br>Like i said i am out of town, add me on skype and when i get back i'll show you around cam if you're nice enough.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Calm down sir<br><br>If you do a quick google search, you'll see that cats are likely to get depressed when their claws are removed<br>Also, declawing is the equivalent of having the top digits of your finger removed, so it has to affect you to some degree, whether you need them or not<br><br>Also, I fail to see how vaccinations are even relevant in this discussion. It's pretty clear you're just trying to dismiss my argument with non-sequitur points, which won't really make you feel any better</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, I'm actually not the same person if that needs to be established. <br><br>Also, thank you for answering my question, albeit in a hostile way.<br><br>Something needs to be done about the cats weight though. It's harmful for it, and irresponsible to the highest degree.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh, sorry i didn't know. but the picture of the cat you posted is a fat fuck.</br></br>  <br>OP<br><br>You said you would fall for the bait.<br>...<br><br>But you did.<br><br>It's pretty clear that it was just shit posting, but you folded to it.<br><br>All respect is lost.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Nice same fagging fat ass<br><br>If you weren't a complete lard, then why the hell are you getting defensive?<br><br>Oh, right. It's because you know your personality and lifestyle is shit, but are doing fuck all about it.<br><br>Eating angrily eating lard fatty</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Holy shit it's warm in here.<br><br>Time for a winter break.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br> Being this Summer </br></br></br>  <br>This thread must have multiple idiots then<br><br>That's reassuring</br></br></br>  <br>You see, you try to be clever, but it completely fails when it makes no sense, kinda like now.</br>  <br>You're wrong on so many levels. Big Cats, like servals, aren't meant to be domesticated. They need enrichment in their lives, like small animals released into their enclosures to give them exercise. They need a balanced diet and plenty of room for running and playing. When you own a big cat, you need to be able to provide that for them, not frozen meat and some pitiful occasional attempts at playtime. This guy declawed his serval, which is inexcusable to ANYONE who knows ANYTHING about big cats. Not to mention, the first thing that comes up when you research owning servals, is that they are STILL wild animals and they spray indoors often. This asshole is acting like he had no choice but to handle these things, like they were unexpected. He didn't have to get a goddamn big cat, spend all that money, just to gimp a beautiful animal and relegate it to living off shitty food in a backyard enclosure with no training or enrichment. OP is the reason why Big Cat Rescue has so many servals. People buy them without ANY research because they have money, and then abandon them the second they behave like the creatures nature intended them to be.</br>  <br><br><br>Checked and Rekt<br><br> 333 </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh look, another idiot</br>  <br><br>Ooo.. You didn't half to slam him that hard did you?? Brutal as fuk</br></br>  <br> African Serval <br> that furniture <br><br>Are you perhaps into gays, OP?</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not your fault.<br><br/></br></br>  <br>It's also an unpredictable, dangerous wild animal. The only people who buy exotic cats like that are either edgelords who want to feel special or someone with way too much money to know what to do with.<br>Or both.</br></br>  <br>Do you even have an exotic vet on call in case your Serval gets sick? or is your plan to leave it by the side of the road the second you decide you weren't prepared to own one and just impulse bought it with no consideration for its own well being. Since it's declawed, you've already selfishly crippled all of its natural ability to hunt or survive. If you'd done any research at all im sure you wouldn't have purchased it. You would have been better off with a Savannah since you seem to be unable to cope with a big cat being itself.</br>  <br>This?!</br>  <br><br>That's funny.</br></br>    <br><br>Calm down, the cat is very loved and i am a very loving owner.<br><br>Before owning an Exotic/Wild Animal you need to leave near a vet that is specialized with Exotic and Wild Animals,<br><br>It wasn't a matter of good call, it is mandatory that i live close enough to a specialized vet or i couldn't keep him.<br><br>I have Monthly check ups to make sure he is running 100% puurrrfect.. Sorry.. i had to.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Sorry i mean LIVE near a vert**<br><br/></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>VET***** I FUCKING HATE THIS IPHONE</br></br></br></br>    <br>I'm glad to hear your serval is in good hands. But you cannot say you're a loving owner having declawed it.</br>    my pets need more attention    <br> owning a serval <br> midland <br>Give me an oil job faggot.</br></br></br>    <br><br>I am sorry if it bothers you, but i had to make the call.<br><br>It was recommended from other Bigger cat owners. <br><br>I can't have him ripping up the couch or ripping me or anyone else up.<br><br>He may be a loving Serval, but if he had claws he would dig into your soft skin.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> upside down :/ </br>    <br><br>Seral and terrier become friends...DBB</br></br>    <br>Are you a rich bastard living in Dubai?</br>  <br>eats them both like a lunchable.</br>  <br><br>Midland Tx</br></br>    <br>Who did you ask, Whitetigerblack jaguar?! The only big cat owner who would ever, EVER, recommend that course of action is one that hasn't done research as well. You can tape their claws, use aluminum foil, TRIM them for gods sake. Or you can train your serval properly. They're very smart, and you can find guides online to help you out. If you'd researched servals, you would have no doubt seen the horror stories that come from declawing as well as possible solutions. You can spray cats with water, citrus spray; discipline them when they spray, don't just throw your hands up and say "golly oh well, nothing left to do". get a properly sized cat tree or scratching post. Jesus christ, own a cat before owning a Serval. redirect the problem, don't remove part of their phlanges.</br>  <br><br>Babou?<br><br>Not a fucking ocelot</br></br></br></br>  <br>Own some rigs?</br>  <br>underrated post</br>  <br><br>Are you trying to say i am Unfit to raise my Serval? Do you know how many fuck wits just give up on there Wild/Exotic animals just because they thought they where cool then they relized they bit off more then they could chew?<br><br>Many, MANY people have even normal cat there nails removed.<br><br>HE will never be in the wild again. <br><br>I doesn't matter if he had his nails or not, he would die in the wild if they where born into a home insted of the wild.<br><br>FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!! i prepare his food! He never has to go catch a bird to eat.<br><br>The fact he is being treated like a king he will never know how to hunt like a warrior.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Several.</br></br>  <br>Why's it so hard to get a job down there? I've been applying and have experience, but nobody bites. Just lots of guys applying?</br>  <br>You can't be serious. Your attitude is incredibly ignorant. I AM aware of how many exotic animals are abandoned; that's why I am so concerned by your responses to my other questions. Those MANY MANY people who have their cats claws removed are wrong for having done so. You have no concept of how much damage this does to an animal, do you? And I understand that your serval will not live in the wild, however they are still wild and undomesticated. They can be taught to live in the confines of a home or enclosure, but they need enrichment. They need to hunt in their lives, they need to play and run and develop their skills. If a serval can't sniff out prey, or jump, or pounce, then they aren't doing what they were meant to do. Treating your serval like a "king" is NOT an excuse to neglect their needs. LET him catch a creature, LET him learn to climb, LET HIM BE HIMSELF before you clip his claws and never let him do so again.</br>  <br><br>We are now at an all time low, the boom is 100% dead.<br><br>Wanna make some money? Invest in oil stocks and land out here while you can.<br><br>Shit out here is going to be so cheap it's sad.<br><br>Not many people have much money to spend since no one is buying around here.<br><br>People are getting laid off left n' right at the moment.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes<br><br>And most likely not fit to live your own life too, given how fat you are</br></br></br>  <br><br>Stop trying to make something out of nothing, he will be forever loved until his very last breath.<br><br>If you have a problem why not call the police on me being such a evil person.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm about 4 hours from the Bakken.
