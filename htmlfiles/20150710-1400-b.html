Maybe a Prelude?<br><br><br>Excellent! Yea I think the Boxster/Caymans all have three 'circles' where the 911's have five, but they all have the tachometer in the center. The SUVs were are what I'm not familiar with and the Macan just came out (and that center LCD screen looking dated), I figured Cayenne.<br><br><br>At least you got the Yamaha bit right, but no.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kek</br>  <br>nope</br>  <br>Some old ford. Taurus?</br>  <br>No to the Prelude.</br>  Ford Taurus  <br>Agreed with <br>that is looks VAG, but I don't know about Volkswsagen in particular. Perhaps some Seat or Skoda we don't get stateside?</br></br>  Closest thing I have and I don't feel like going outside and taking a new one. From a watch thread a while ago.  <br>Correct!</br>  <br>nope, but I have a clue fot you it is japanese car...</br>      <br>Thats tough. I dont recognize the font on the gauges at all</br>  <br>You drive a faggot mobile that needs gas</br>  <br>Looks like something old, but the miles are low....</br>  <br> it has Porsche lights in the dash to remind you how much money you wasted compensating for your small dick </br>  <br>Ummm it is a 2015 model :3</br>  <br>2001 model.</br>  was originally going to put in the time to repair this one's faults but upon finding out the extent of them have decided to just ride it till it dies (routine maintenance only) and then buy another one in better overall shape.  <br>You think they own that car....</br>  <br>That there is a Saab. Maybe a 9-5.</br>  <br>You are correct sir.</br>  <br>pre-gm saab turbo</br>    <br>I chuckled</br>  <br>M37</br>    <br>Volvo. Maybe an S60 or V70? Probably mid nineties?</br>  <br>No one still has this.<br><br><br>I'm still lost man. Is it some funky Toyota? I'm thinking it has to be funky what with the colored plastic around the instrument cluster.<br><br><br>No sure. Old motorcycle with that font?<br><br><br>No clue. Infiniti?<br><br><br>At first I was thinking old GM, but that LCD screen on the bottom looks a little too sophisticated for them back when they made dashes like this. With that, I'll go wtih Japanese. Maybe, Toyota? Perhaps an old Avalon?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>      <br>Looks like a volvo s70. I know another with about the same amount of warning lights on</br>  <br>Its a Volvo. No idea which one.</br>  <br>XBone</br>    <br>From the first motorcycle picture guy, I'm going to go with Suzuki Boulevard?

A4 perhaps?<br><br><br>No clue but it looks really nice.<br><br><br>Yamaha S40?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>God no, though i guess the displays are similar</br>  <br>LOL i just posted my dash, thats the car i was loaned by my mentors bro while here until I got my current.
