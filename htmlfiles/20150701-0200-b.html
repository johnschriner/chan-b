[ So about a week ago I went to a ghetto ass campground in the sticks with my family and I was bored there and decided to go swimming in the pool at the campground. Well I got a huge chlorine rash that has covered a huge part of my legs and my torso and has spread to my Cock. Can any one give me a good way to make the itching stop?? Also the pic is my leg  put a base on it, baking soda.... milk of magnesia..  <br>Your 'chlorine rash' looks an awful lot like poison ivy</br>  That's poison ivy  <br>It can't be, it has spread to even high areas like my face and my cousin got it but me and him were the only ones to go in the pool.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ZRf<wbr>RITVdz4k</wbr>  [ ]</br>  Need to fill my reactions folder<br>Dump reaction pics here</br>                    Havea sweet OC that I made.

Just went outside in the city and saw so many black man/white girl couples. why are they popular with white girls nowadays?  cuz muh bbc duh    <br> blacksonblondes <br>I guess once you go black so does your hair?<br>Wut</br></br></br>  <br>Think about it. Where do you see the most interracial couples? Answer: The media (music and film).<br><br>The music and film industries are both run almost entirely by jews. Jews are pro race mixing in the west, however back in Israel their race relations are fucking terrible.<br><br>go figure</br></br></br></br></br>  Probably because they do more with their lives than sit inside on 4chan all day<br><br>More fool them</br></br>  <br>For the same reason that Islam is the fastest growing religion in the world.<br><br>Islam will take over and reclaim the holy land within a few years.<br>The poor jews will become extinct because they are all cuckolds.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They are whores and need to feel sub human. Society accepts this</br>  <br>Because they are much more cleaner and bigger than white man</br>  <br>Islam is great, the Islamic State will unite all of arabia once more.<br>We will allow the jew to live in walled settlements, though they are forbidden to carry arms and will not be self governing.</br></br>  <br>You're so right, I'm Asian and I am strongly against RACE-MIXING.</br>    just went outside <br><br>  The stories and information posted here are artistic works of fiction and falsehood. <br>Only a fool would take anything posted here as fact.</br></br></br>  <br>because they share availability. <br><br>Women don't have jobs, stay at home. Niggers don't have jobs, stay at home. So while white man makes the bread, these two hook up behind his back.</br></br></br>  <br>Fact and science.</br>  <br>kek</br>  <br>underrated ost</br>  Actually its because girls want anything " different" put a healthy white Englishman in an American bar and whatcha him clean up. Its not about how great bob is to bill but the fact bob spells his name with a silent "q" ..because womem are shallow .. After this bitch fucks this gentleman she doesnt tell everyone she fucked Bobq and he was smart and compassionate she just says i fucked a black guy  it's the lower-class white women that do it, the ones that have been marginalized by respectable, white society. They aren't accepted by decent white men so they turn to the only ones that will take them, blacks. Most respectable white women would never do it, only the lower classes and the liberal-hippie-commie-hpv sluts.  <br>Oh, it's this thread again....<br><br>Go to sleep, jew.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I've wondering... you guys doing the black niggers acceptance brainwashing are on a payroll or you do that for the cause? Just' asking....</br></br>  <br>Got any more like this?</br>  <br> slow clap </br>  <br>see:<br/></br>  <br>Hi Schlomo, I talked to a lot of black people lately after seeing you jew all the posts on /b/ like this. I told a lot of them how they were enslaved by you and the jews before the European did it. I also told them how stereotypical and rude the heathen trouble making jew is to the average black.Schlomo I think your Jew women are in trouble now, I told them to go bang all of them because it is more of an insult to the jews to get banged by a black than it is for a white to do the same. good luck schlomo, the zoo is coming for your kafilta fish women</br>  <br>because your stuck in on /b/ discussing it rather than being out there getting the girls you covet</br>  <br>All women fantasize about this, but most will never admit it</br>    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=DNP<wbr>uXcN9QhY</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Nigs know whats up</br></br>  <br>ew wtf gay</br>  <br>also these dudes have like 7 inch dicks, Schlomo just got good with a camera and camera tricks and smoke in mirrors. cause when you put a 5 foot tall person next to a 6'4 person with a 7 inch dick he is going to look like he is 10 inches. but when a white girl goes to see for herself and sees the same 6 inch dick on a white guy on him she will be let down. honestly it's the same with Criss Strokes, they portray him as a 9 incher but he is really a little over 7. which is still big but with the same smoke in mirrors tricks hollywood uses for their films schlomo does the same</br>  <br>Do you understand English? The meaning of gay? Me thinks not</br>  You know it's funny you should ask, pretty sure this is exactly what my ex wanted.  These threads are so interesting to me. I live in a medium-large city in America (~1 million people including metro area). I see plenty of interracial couples, but it's mostly asian females with white males, latina females with white males, latino males with white females, and occasionally blacks males with white females (small but notable number of black females with white males). But the other couples always have mixed kids, except the black male/white female couples, who always have clearly white kids. I don't think white guys are cucking black men, so are black men just taking care of white women and the babies they made with white men? This seems so opposite from what I read on this site but it seems like a pretty consistent pattern in my experience.  <br>you got issues bro<br>7" = big<br>seriously how small is yours</br></br></br>  My wife is crazy for black guys. It bothered me a little at first, but now I secretly like when she gushes over black guys.  <br>Sorry pal, but 7" is at the top of average size...8" and up is big</br>  <br>They are divorced women who are desperate for a man, that they will stoop so low as to date a black man.</br>  <br>How long have you been married?</br>  <br>golly that looks delicious</br>  <br>I went outside as well but i haven't seen a interracial couple in months.</br>  <br>4 years. Why?</br>  <br>Lol Americans and their so called problems. Isnt there a school shooting going on for you to watch tv?</br>        <br>If by meaning of gay, you're referring to yourself. Whoever the fuck still uses "me thinks/methinks" just needs to get with their times. The fuck you playin, fuckin dungeons and dragons, shakespeare ass bitch</br>  <br>Just wondering. I broke up with my girlfriend yesterday after she brought up the idea of cuckolding, and I'm about 90% sure she wanted the choose a black guy.</br>  <br><br>That's kinda what I figured. I have a friend who is black that I go running with a lot. We're both pretty fast and often go 1-2 in local 5k races, so I have gotten to know him pretty well. His gf is white and has 3 kids from a previous marriage to a white guy. They seem like a happy loving couple, and he has a good job, so he takes care of her and the kids. His brother is married to a white woman, and they have one kid from her previous marriage and they adopted a second kid (also white). I know it's anecdotal, but I feel like none of the black male white female couples I know actually have mixed kids, only white.</br></br>  <br>You like women sucking on poop?</br>  <br>Damn. Aren't you insecure. Why didn't you just say no?</br>  <br>The conditioning isn't working</br>  <br> Just went outside in the city <br>In Europe people aren't prudish at all</br></br>    <br>I think the majority of women fantasize about it, some secretly go and fuck black guys and a small percentage get pregnant and say oh that's what I wanted all along, meanwhile they know they fucked up</br>  <br>I wish that were the case... I see far too many mongrel black/white bastards that I am genuinely concerned for the next generation, some with their bi-racial parents, but most just with their race-trading mother who got knocked-up. That, and beat-up white women with a black guy, raising his all-black children.</br>  <br>yeah</br>  <br>We weren't dating very long so I said let's just end it before this goes any farther. Now she can fuck any guy she wants and I wont care.</br>  Hmmm...  You fucking pussy britfags wouldn't know a manly sport if it hit you in the face.<br><br>Rugby &lt; Football</br></br>   European "men"   :)  <br>and yet football fags wear tons of protection because theyre pussys, cant even take a hit</br>  <br> calling it handegg <br> doesn't look like an egg </br></br>  <br>LULzed</br>  <br> football players <br> pussies <br>You wouldn't say that if you were face to face with a football player, you eurocuck<br><br>Pic related. JJ Watt would make any rugby player look like a pussy</br></br></br></br></br>  nuthin to add  <br>fucking kek<br><br>americuck handegg "athletes" might as well just play with those plastic bubbles around them</br></br></br>  <br> Eggs are wider on one side. <br> Footballs are pointy on each side. <br>I never understood why insecure eurofags called it that, it's like they can't into shapes.</br></br></br>  rugby players where a mouth guard and maybe a hat.<br><br>murcia wears padding. Its like the difference between a flat chested lady and a big ole titty bitch.</br></br>  <br>good thing this thread was here yesterday</br>  <br>This is getting as stupid as those religious fags</br>  <br>See </br>  <br>and now this thread is fucked</br>  <br>How did this pussy break his nose with a fucking helmet on?</br>  <br> rugby players wear 2 things, a mouth guard and a hat <br> football players wear 1 thing, padding <br>So football wins?</br></br></br>  <br>considering he broke his nose while wearing a helmet it takes a special kind of pussy to do that</br>  <br>Hahaha</br>  <br>the hat is optional</br>  <br>he intentionally did it to cover up that bright red lipstick</br>  <br>If you can design it so it comes in a one piece you have have that one :)</br>  <br>hahahahaha. this is Sébastien Chabal. he would eat and shit any and all fucking queer amerifat football players without breaking fucking sweat. sit the fuck down you soft, weak little bitch.</br>  <br>acting in bad faith detected</br>  <br>It's just proof of the European education system.</br>  <br><br>and that only protects against cauliflower ears</br></br>  <br>Isn't he an open homosexual? Dude you are using a bad example.</br>  <br>it amuses me that rugby players don't even wear shinpads while "sawcerrr" players do</br>  <br>well he's gay, now he can pound your ass even harder</br>  <br>that makes it a better example, even gay rugby players are more manly than football players</br>  <br>your faggot dreams</br>  American Footballers wear the padding because the kind of tackles they do in american football are illegal in rugby. In rugby you go after the ball, in American football you go after the player  I've played both sports.<br><br>Football is way tougher. The hits are simply more brutal. The hits in rugby are more like high speed hugs to be honest</br></br>  <br>that's the point. this euro fag rugby dude would destroy every single fucking amerifat football player with ease. just imagine what the players for tonga or hell the kiwi all blacks would do to them.</br>  <br> Sébastien Chabal <br><br>I don't know but in my opinion some anon mothers would be delighted<br>to be ultra deep banged by him</br></br></br></br>  <br>"lets wear body armour so we don't get hurt"<br>"yeah, that sounds sooooooooooo manly"</br></br>  <br> You go after the player <br>doesn't that defeat the purpose of the ball</br></br>  <br>american football players literally hold the ball and throw it for 99% of the match, game still called football. I would rather not know the difference between an egg shape and a shape very similar to an egg than not know the difference between a foot and a hand like most americunts</br>  <br>you're so full of shit i'm surprised you don't burst. fuck outta here with that utter bullshit faggot.</br>  <br>kek, I found the special snowflake</br>  <br>Using a gayspiclord as an example<br>The european mentality of communism and sucking each other off at work ladies and gentlemen</br></br>  <br>have you ever even played a sport</br>  <br>This</br>  <br>let me guess, you played them both in america, where the american football standard is top class and the rugby standard is worse than the average U15 squad</br>  <br>no cause you still score with the ball</br>  <br>FYI They still use their feet. Just sayen</br>  <br>oh plz you american fags use body armor and protection, aussie football and rugby use no armor</br>  <br>then why go after the players when you have to go after the ball</br>  <br>rugby for 5 years in school. next question you fucking limp-wristed faggot.</br>  <br>hence me saying 99% of the match dipshit<br>I am fully aware they kick the ball once every few hours</br></br>  <br>Gonna go ahead and clear this up for you fags. I don't care about this argument cause its bait. But the reason it's called football is because just like soccer, it was one of the first sports not played on horseback. This is why the three sports are officially called. Football, gridiron football, and rugby football.</br>  <br>American football players take bigger hits</br>  I played football in middle school and rugby in high school and for 3 years in college (had to sit out my senior year because of a torn ACL)<br><br>Rugby is much manlier. The hits hurt way more and the game is much more fast paced. I challenge any football faggot to fight me. I would beat the shit out of them.</br></br>  Britfag here.<br>Rugby was invented so rich English schoolboys could "wrestle" their muscled friends in the mud in public. <br>Basically, it couldn't be more gay if the US Supreme Court legalised it.</br></br>  <br>what position</br>  <br>our fag rugby players destroy the best amerifat players. destroy. them. it's not even close. hahaha holy shit you amerifat retards suck.</br>  <br>They also take bigger dicks</br>  <br>I think Rugby might have an argument if it wasn't just mostly them in a big pile somewhere on the field.</br>  <br>they'll fight you but only if they get to wear all their pussy padding</br>  It's called football because it developed from rugby football which developed from real (association) football.<br><br>Who gives a fuck what it's called, it's a game for pussy yanks who seem to stop every two minutes to say a fucking prayer.</br></br>  <br>Football in middle school</br>  <br>Then you just invalidated your stupid ass argument.</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>Implying that either sport trains you to fist fight.</br>  wait, whos the one wearing armor? oh thats right, amerifag  <br>tfw this is the best argument eurofags have against America.<br><br>1. Kinder Eggs<br>2. Football armor</br></br></br></br>  <br>no. no they fucking don't you clueless twat. they hit faster, not harder. the armour those fags wear is specifically designed to absorb almost all the impact. to compare a fully armored player taking a hit at speed with a dude taking a hit at speed with just a fucking mouth guard is typically ridiculous american pigshit.</br>  <br> college rugby is tougher than middle school football <br>No shit retard</br></br>  <br>B..bro.. relax.. stop being so mad.. stop shaking in anger bro.</br>  I can swear that none of the people who are in this thread have never tried both rugby and american football so everyone should just shut the fuck up about it  <br>See, what I don't get is, this shit is posted everyday and no-one complains. But if you post the Childlike Empress and ask about Atheism, everyone starts complaining. There's just no constistency here.</br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br>not op but i dunno... get hit by some fag jock who wears a full suit of body armor or get hit by some dude who loves to wreck other people with nothing more than a mouth guard.... hmmm that's a hard choice... WAT.</br>  <br>Implying you actually have any argument. <br> bigger hits with armour </br></br>  What an athlete  <br>you are right. i should realise by now americans are basically sub-human scum and nothing they say should ever be taken seriously.</br>  <br>He'd still fucking destroy any rugby faggot</br>  <br>I bet you like getting wrecked by other dudes. It's a hard choice, but I support you all the way. Come to America, you can get married here now.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Any idiot who wants to run full speed at eachother and permanently damage themselves rather than wear protection to ensure they live longer and without disfigurement should be called a boy not a man. Because only a boy would argue the semantics of how manly you are by intentionally making it sound like if you aim to get hurt that you are manlier. By the logic emo kids are manly as fuck cause they intentionally hurt themselves all the time. The reason rugby players don't wear pads is not to be manlier, it is so they aren't restricted when it comes to their athletic abilities.<br>  hurr durr racing without breaks makes you more of a man  <br>That's what you fucks sound like.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This</br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br>come to america? no thank you. i don't wish to travel to any 3rd world countries.</br>  What's wrong with Americunts?

Most NFL quarterbacks make about $20 million per year. Rugby players don't even make close to that much because their job is much easier than a football players job</br></br>  <br>I'm not saying either are more manly fuck wit. I'm saying you can compare the sports in that aspect while talking about pads because the only reason rugby doesn't wear them is so that they don't hinder their natural athletic ability. I think rugby is the manlier sport but I'm not saying anyone can play football either. I'm thoroughly sure that both athletes could play the other sport easily however.</br>  Yup American football is for http://m.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Ss2dn_<wbr>QI5kE</wbr>  [ ]  <br> football players have harder jobs than infantrymen and military in general </br>  AMERICA FUCKING SUCKS.

I've been to a few live matches and holy shit is it boring, you get maybe 20 minutes of actual play time in the 2 hours you spend sitting there. Like holy shit why the fuck do you need to stop play for 5 minutes EVERY SINGLE TIME SOMETHING FUCKING HAPPENS.<br><br>It's like you took the game of Rugby and decided it was too interesting and fast paced to watch and added a shitload of convoluted rules designed especially to stop the flow of play at every available moment. Only very rarely do you actually get "interesting" plays, it's mostly just the same shit over and over again.

Lel try AFL - no paddig, Rugby/Rugby union - No padding. NFL - A whole costume to protect their little bodies. Toughen up Amerifats. Aussie out.  <br>those boots tho</br>   these are considered top tier "athletes" in american handeggball   <br>I enjoy watching the sport anon. If anything you found it boring because you had no idea what was going on. I would most likely find rugby boring for the same reason. Don't be ignorant because you are this emotional about such a menial part of your life.</br>  https://<span>youtu.be/B1zkDi5<wbr>SkWs</wbr>  [ ]  <br>It's not about "not knowing what's going on", it's about the game literally not being played half the time you are watching it.</br>  <br>see<br><br>stop trying to sound smart when your autism is showing.</br></br></br>  <br>And in saying that, rubgy is already a moderately slow sport, to make it slower is torture</br>  <br>modern American football has its origins in traditional ball games played at villages and schools in Europe for many centuries before America was settled by Europeans.<br> Wikipedia </br></br>   this thread <br> guaranteed replies <br>Pick two</br></br>  <br>you must not watch much football</br>  It takes a man to play either sport or else everyone would be playing it. Most of you asshats have probably never played either of them. Some of you have probably never played a sport since youth leagues. There is probably even a few fucks here that have never even played a sport. You're all faggots argueing on an anonymous image board about a sport none of you probably even really care about.

Thats ok though hes not even tired because half the time hes not on the field and theres a break every 10 seconds anyway because amerifats get too tired too quickly. Looking lovingly into his teammates eyes as he thinks about the fuckings he will both give and receive in the locker room, their skin still baby soft due to the candy ass armour they wear to avoid getting hurt.  <br><br>Seems legit</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> American's not pussies? <br> need a gun to defend themselves <br> have to wear armour for a full contact sport <br><br><br> 2015 <br> still treating Europe like one homogeneous territory <br><br>This is why the world views you as ignorant.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nigger you sit down. I'm from Germany anyways.</br>  <br>You're right, I dont. I have zero interest in watching fat fucks in plate armour play for 2 seconds then rest for 5 minutes, repeating for 6 hours straight</br>  <br>Have you seen baseball or fucking cricket. Now that is some boring shit right there.</br>  <br>Because you're drinking and eating your double cheesburger, chilli fries, hot dog and ice cream entree.<br>Every play they stop the clock and sit and talk about their feelings. Rugby just goes for it. Fucking crushes it.</br></br>  <br>If you haven't watched both American football and rugby, you can't be in this argument.<br> Pro Rugby Anon </br></br>  None of you have any idea what you're talking about and are arguing for no reason because you have nothing better to do at the moment except be a faggot  <br>Femanon here, ive dated a footballer and a rugby player and the American was the one who made me peg him.<br><br>Just sayin</br></br></br>  <br>/thread<br><br>if i was running around in full plate armour, i'd be starting fist fights as well</br></br></br>  <br>taxi driver was a good american made movie</br>  <br>Yah your a girl. It's not pegging if 2 dude are fucking its called being a faggot.</br>  <br>This overused stereotype is as stale as your argument. I know you have no idea what you're talking about and are just trying to enrage me because you yourself are already angry. To help you out a little bit in your endeavors. They don't stop the clock in football every play. There is a system on when and when they do not stop the clock. For instance if the last play resulted in the ball going out of bounds. The clock is stopped. If someone runs the ball and gains five yards then the clock keeps running unless this resulted in a first down or the player running out of bounds.</br>  <br>Shut the fuck up neckbeard</br>  Wow. All these newfags.  <br>This attempt was a poor one.</br>  <br>You're about to start a completely different argument.

But now, here's a BRAND NEW EPISODE OF THE SIMPSONS! </br>  <br>Finally someone said it</br>  <br>He has a wife and children</br>  I just got hired at a Starbucks in an affluent white suburb of a large Midwestern city. I start next week. Any advice? Work stories thread?  Fellow managers, I need some advice.<br><br>How do you deal with a subordinate with a condescending attitude? The kind that always points out when you're wrong or making a mistake, the kind who seems to laugh at you or make you a joke, the kind who (for lack of a better phrase) seems to slyly pick on you?<br><br>Things that I don't think can work:<br><br> fire them <br>Yeah, I can't fire someone, and besides "they're laughing at me" isn't a good enough reason for termination.<br><br> write them up <br>For what? And say what? "Hey, you're picking on me, and I don't appreciate it" doesn't seem like a good idea, at all..<br><br> reduce their hours <br>Can't do that either. One, I don't control hours, and two, they've been at this business longer than I; they kinda have seniority, amongst the other non-manager co-workers.<br><br> kill them with kindness <br>Been trying that, doesn't do any good. My kindness seems to have zero affect on how they treat me/talk to me/act towards me when others are around.<br><br>ANy help/advice would be a great help.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>First of all<br> The kind that always points out when you're wrong or making a mistake. <br>Do your job properly.<br>Other than that I dont know. I have a manager who has absolutely no idea how to do her job. When we're working together I actually have to tell her what to do so that we get some work done and do it properly. She has been in the job for twice as long as I have but she is completely clueless.</br></br></br></br>  bump, only to save this from the usual a/b/yss  <br>Yeah I don't mean that kind. Like, smaller mistakes. In general: anything done "wrong" to get a point-and-laugh going. I am human, I err like any other. I don't try to come off as perfect, nor do I expect perfection, but they have this agenda of pointing out my mistakes. I don't do that to my subordinates, I mentor/coach them to do better, usually 1 on 1.<br><br>Also, I am fairly new to the job and position. so mistakes are going to happen (not making excuses, just stating the truth). I don't mind the bumpy road while learning/shaping/growing, I just wish it wasn't filled with bumps from a subordinate purposely out to make it so.</br></br></br>  Well what kind of business are you in?  <br>Cont.<br>P.S. not hating. <br>I'm just saying that they've worked there longer than you and you sometimes stuff up. You arent perfect neither are they. If its bothering you just talk to him/her about it. Not in a 'I'm your manager and I'm telling you this . . .' Kind of way. Just day that its bothering you, you're only human, you're going to make mistakes and you would appreciate it if they didnt mick you for it. Tell them that you respect how long they've been in the business, but they also need to respect you. Blah, blah, blah.</br></br></br>  <br>Posted this before I read<br><br>This.<br><br>Nevermind.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What state do you work in? Most states don't require just cause to fire someone. <br><br>Also, have you given them shitty reviews in the past? That helps.</br></br></br>  <br>Bullying is a fireable offense. Report his shit to HR to get the ball rolling on his dismissal. How the hell did you even get this job without any kind of management experience or education?</br>  <br> subordinate <br>Who's being condescending?</br></br>  Reduce privileges/responsibility. Give one of the less 'senior' employees more. Not to be a prick but to reaffirm the chain of command. Make him earn them back.  <br>What other word would you prefer? It's not an offensive word, it's a word describing position..</br>  <br>Give them all the shitty jobs till they either shut up or quit. When they confront you tell them to los3 the attitude towards you and maybe their life might improve</br>  <br>What kind of "mistakes" do you mean?<br>Can we get a more specific example?<br>Like greentext the latest example</br></br></br>  <br>armyfag here. They don't respect you, because you wont call them on their shit.<br>Also try and work on the team mentality and dont refer to them as subordinates</br></br>  <br>No. When you want specific examples, you tend to try and remedy those individual situations, or re-think/re-play them out.</br>  <br><br>You're the fucking manager, you tell them straight up that you don't like their attitude and that it's unprofessional. You make a corrective action plan with them that involves them watching what the fuck they say or else more drastic measures will be taken.<br><br>The best part about being a manager is that your word is valued more than your employee. If they try to talk back, tell them to start looking for another job then and that this is how it's going down.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shirtfront the cunt</br>  <br>I'm not OP. I was stating a fact.<br><br>Still haven't answered the question: what other word would you prefer?</br></br></br>  <br>either make want to quit<br>or talk to them - read this book 'how to get trough to anyone' (pirate it ofc)</br></br>  <br>Punch them in the balls. Or cunt if you have the misfortune of having female employees.</br>   Talk to them <br><br>The hell you want this anon to say!?<br><br>"Listen (employee), you're picking on me, and I don't like it (read: I can't handle being picked on)."</br></br></br></br>  <br> misfortune of having female employees <br><br>You have no idea...</br></br></br>  <br>Then I can't give you any advice more specific than stop making mistakes and call them out if they're acting unprofessionally.</br>  <br>Colleague? Coworker? <br>If my boss referred to me as a subordinate I would be a dick to him.<br><br>OP, just humiliate him in front of the whole office. Beat him at his own game so he knows you're not to be fucked with.</br></br></br></br>  <br>no,say<br>"I don't like how you behave, is there a reason for it?"</br></br>  <br>this. in so many words at least. get rid of any attitude you may have that could taint the conversation and just talk to them straight up. point out the behavior, detail how that behavior will impact them; job stability, advancement and $, then make a plan with them outlining what it is you expect. this would be normal cya paperwork anyways should you move to allow them the opportunity to pursue other avenues of interest. also, as military fag pointed out, everything is about the team.</br>  Many states have a very broad definition of harassment. In Nevada, this behavior is a form of harassment and is applicable for write up and termination if not corrected. I would look up your states law on harassment and see if it is valid. If so, write ups are a good way to start a paper trail and if unchanged could lead to termination. I call it "employees firing themselves ".  <br>What's the difference between a crying baby and a manager?<br><br>The baby eventually grows up.</br></br></br>  <br>Just throw us a bone and give us some vague idea what kind of mistakes you're talking about. Would you rather have overly specific advice or more of the overly general advice you've gotten so far?</br>  <br> Colleague? Coworker? <br><br>Why would you call someone under you a co-worker or a colleague? Do they not teach a chain of command in the military? A private isn't a colleague to a sergeant/NCO - they are a subordinate.</br></br></br>  <br>Yet the whole situation wouldn't exist without the various unique ones.<br>You're keeping it vague by not addressing the specific ones.<br>You're a manager, not a psychiatrist. Let us decide how to asses your specific situation or the whole bunch if you ask us for advice.<br><br>This attitude is what gets you picked on. You're being a little bitch even about such a little thing.<br>Man up.<br>Some people are pricks, it's not about countering them or making them change their attitude. They want to be pricks. Let the try to change them to some idealistic lads that are trained for that.<br>The point for you is to be not bothered by it. That's not about their attitude or about your subordinates, it's about you dealing with it. Because sooner or later you meet such people and you're just the perfect target.<br><br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/624946736#p624951416">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Just overwork them and wait for them to fuck up.
