What you want to do is study Order Of Operations. Also look into the “Distributive Property”, as well as Implicit Multiplication, and Juxtaposition. Research what the obelus is and means (÷). Define the “Terms” of the equation. Read up on Algebra and what Parentheses are used for. Research “Factorising”. Now that I have stated all the actual Mathematical principles, let’s prove what the answer is.<br>====================<br>For starters: What does 1/2x mean? It clearly means 1/(2x), but we just write 1/2x. It does NOT mean (1/2)x or “one half x” since the notation would clearly be x/2 for that.<br>So 1/2x = 1/(2x), just as 6/2x is 6/(2x). When x = 2+1, the answer is 1.<br>====================<br>Method 2: Let’s take the number 6. Do you agree that 6 = 4+2?<br>Now what is a common factor of 4 &amp; 2? 2 works. So factorise the 2 from 4+2 and you get 2(2+1).<br>6 = 4+2 = 2(2+1). When we do math, we all know you have to use the WHOLE term, and not a portion of it, with an operator. Therefore, 2(2+1) is an entire term with a value of 6, and you cannot use a portion of it with another operator, such as doing the 6/2 =3, and them multiplying by (2+1). That is incorrect.<br>Therefore, 6÷2(2+1) = 6÷6 = 1.<br>====================<br>Method 3: Distribution. Similar to the above but a different principle;<br>a(b+c) = (ab+bc). 2(2+1) = (4+2). Notice how all these math principles are proving the SAME thing?? 6 ÷ (4+2) = 1.<br>====================<br>Method 4: Using parentheses as grouping. Think about this equation as a real world problem. I have 6 apples. i want to divide among 2 groups of children, each group with 2 boys and 1 girl. How many apples does each child get? Now look at the question again, while thinking of that situation: 6÷2(2+1). They each get 1 apple.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>?</br>  Can we wrap this up please? I wanna go smoke a cigarette, but the butthurt is too good to miss a second of  <br>Method 5: Juxtapostion. The 2 that is “in front” of the brackets is there by this principle and some say this holds a higher precedence than explicit multiplication (and division). Answer = 1.<br>=====================<br>Method 6: The “obelus” ÷<br>While researching the exact meaning of this, I found these results. The ‘dot’ on the top of the symbol represents the dividend and the bottom dot represents what comes after the ÷. The 6 precedes it, and the 2(2+1) comes after it. Again ,yielding 1.</br></br></br></br>  <br>12 is still in the parenthesis, so it's 48/2(12) parenthesis must be solved first, or is someone implying the parenthesis dissapear?</br>  <br>Yes, we've already found that "?" is the answer, it says so up there.

Let me repeat the 2 outside of the parenthesis follows the distributive property of multiplication and must be factored and simplified before performing any other operations on it. You do NOT compute this expression from left to right until you use Algebra to simplify the statement 2(9+3). <br><br>So this can be rewritten as: <br>48 / (2*9 + 2*3) <br><br>Which leaves us with <br><br>48 / 24 = 2 <br><br>Answer = 2. <br><br>Lastly for those using Google or any other online calculator. These do not understand many theorems or properties so you must explicitly explain what you mean. There is a difference between 48 / 2 * (9+3) and 48 / 2(9+3). The first notation reads 48 / 2 * 1(9+3) while the second reads 48 / (2*9+2*3). Be very careful with your signs.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You got me for a second anon.<br>Then I realized.

Tell me how you would fuck her and why.' then the loser starts posting pic after pic of her. it just so happened that I actually had photos of her and I at a party/get-together taken a while back. So I compared the photos to make sure and it was her. Now I know she doesn't have any siblings so right away I called the fucker out. I wish I had taken screenshots as proof. I said 'this is illegal and just plain wrong. You can't fuck with people's lives like this! You're a grade A creeper!' that piece of shit stopped posting real quick. Then I see these other comments about teen girls and they say shit like: 'that's a nice slab of worthless fuckmeat right there! Good job, anon. or 'she would look great with cum on her face. wtf, man. What if that was your sister or your daughter? I get that most of you hate females for whatever you may have experienced with the few in your lives or because they don't like you, but damn. You guys are just a bunch of angry woman haters. I know it sounds gay, but no girl will ever like or love you unless you start loving yourselves. Not just girls but anyone.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  What's her snap?  <br>Dappyhays</br>  <br>:^)<br> being this new </br></br>  <br>Dappyhays</br>  https://twitter.com/clerklol<br>goddamn</br>  <br>  replying to pasta <br>hello new budy</br></br>  <br>Tl;dr: I'm a faggot.</br>  It's all fake guys, she wasn't crying rushing into a police station like you've probably heard.<br>She was injured at a party and went to hospital.</br>  <br>B-but my dubs anon</br>  <br>Please tell the story,just hearing this for the 1st time</br>  <br>url, please.</br>  <br>tl;dr</br>  <br>SMOKING WEED CHANGES EVERYTHING</br>  <br>  followed her <br>fag</br></br>  savaged is part of lizard squad? and also a faggot lmao smh what's lias snapchat name?    <br>What <br>It's fucking snapchat it should just be on your phone</br></br>  <br>jeez</br>  <br>??</br>  I knew this thread would be here  <br>It's a phone app</br>  <br>Is she secreting corn syrup?</br>  <br>I think no one was surprised</br>  <br>can i not use a pc to see it?<br><br>this damn world is chainging too fast!</br></br></br>  <br><br>Good ol' grool.<br><br>Nectar of the gods.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not Lia.</br>  <br>You can't haha</br>  <br>dappyhays</br>  <br>It's way too early in the day to be using this much bait</br>  <br>  nectar of the gods </br>  <br>no fap for me then. oh well. <br><br><br>i'll give that a go.</br></br></br></br>    <br> not sjw <br> straight male <br> doesn't like dicks in ass <br> women are people too <br>please go back to reddit you summerfag</br></br></br></br></br>  What Is lia snap ??  <br>She posts amazing pictures man</br>      <br>Someone wrote it already</br>  <br>keep postin</br>  <br>dump 'em!</br>  Just go to her Instagram<br><br>https://instagram.com/liamariejohns<wbr>on/</wbr></br></br>  context?    please give her snap  <br>What's the blur there for?</br>  <br>Of the real mean, not faggots like you who love cock.</br>  <br>dappyhays you stupid fuck<br><br><br>it's a fake blur over her top</br></br></br></br>  <br>Real men* oops</br>  https://twitter.com/clerklol <br>Hacked...!</br>  ITT; 14 year old faggots that cant use google.  Who is she /b/? How did you meet? Are you still together? If not what happened? Any good stories?  Her. I met Her in the second panel.She wrote her name all over the walls and left me. Sorry, no good stories.  <br>My best friend's girl. Never together with her because I won't try to break them up. I met her first but was already with someone so I didn't try. Now it's a year later and I wish I had but I keep quiet and play along.</br>  <br>She was in my class 3 years ago, broke up about a year ago, she's fucking another dude atm.<br>Wish I never had feelings for her to be honest.</br></br>  I met up with this fat bitch who catfished me on tinder about a year ago. She brought her cute friend along though and I've been with her ever since  <br/>   How? <br>Facebook group. 5000 members. In that group we organized a Skype conversation where the active members could talk to each other. 40 people are in this conversation. Someday we talked about exams and then she added me. We wrote everyday. We planned visiting Gamescom. I was pretty shy and had nearly no self esteem so i was scared of the first meeting. She really wanted to meet me so she said we should meet even earlier to break the ice so we can visit Gamescom without being scared or something. Both went pretty well and after Gamescom i fell in love with her. Told her 2 Months later but she couldnt really handle it so things got pretty messed up. Writing was awkward and our frendship nearly got destroyed 2 times by that.<br> Still together? <br>Since a month now. I love her, she loves me, everythings perfect. LOL.</br></br></br>  <br>She used to be my best friend for five years prior to dating her for three, almost four, years. She didn't want to make me wait for her,so she called it off. It's been 9 months, feeling like shit. But I want to see her happy, so I let it be. I miss her daily.</br>  <br>She has a boyfriend and doesn't know my name.</br>  <br>Good for you bud. Wish you the best.</br>  <br>Happy for you anon! Dont you let her go!</br>  2 random people working a temp job, different shifts. Never met until our employer took us all out for dinner one day.<br><br>Getting married to her next year.</br></br>  I'm married, she's married. <br><br>Met her at work before she was married, hung out all the time, fooled around a lot, slept at her house, she slept at mine....<br><br>Still talk to her every day, shit is so fucked up.</br></br></br></br>  <br>thanks man<br><br>I would never leave her, but if she doesnt like me anymore i would let her go. Sure i would fight but i wont do anything against her will.</br></br></br>  <br>cute girl in my gym class, too good for me, i know my place.</br>  Her name's Beth, We met in AP History in High School, we started dating 3 and a half years ago and still are to this day. I love her with all my heart and just last night we talked about how amazing it is to be with each other.<br><br>I am going to propose here in a few weeks when we take our vacation up to tenessee. I'm so scared but excited at the same time, I know she'll say yes because we've talked about it many times before. I just got a promotion and for once things in my life are looking great. I love her so much and don't know what I'd do without her. I hope you guys one day (If not already) can feel how I feel now.

Honestly, I don't know anymore. She changed, a lot. And I feel so lost, and confused. She stopped caring about me, but I never stopped caring about Her. We live together, but she's never home. She blames it on her job, but I know it's not because of that. I can't leave her though. I'm too much if a coward, and she was the only person to love me as much as she did. It's been almost a year of her being like this, and I wait and hope she finds a reason to love me again. I wait, but all I get is a silent house with only me in it.  <br>my little girl runs into me on a fantasy convention. she broke up with hin asshole of boyfriend and now we life together for about 6 years.<br>We are happy and we will always be.</br></br>  <br>That's rough man.</br>  <br> le airport <br>Will you please go on the bombing trip your girlfriend has gone to in spain or fucking kill yourself by Sepukku or some sort of self mutilation until you bleed to death.</br></br>  My story:<br><br> Saw her at University last year, very nice looking girl <br> Only looked at her from a distance, too afraid to talk to her <br> fast forward to next semester <br> group project <br> guess who is in my group partner <br> I thought fuck it and messaged her <br> she is actually very nice <br> we met up and shortly after that we were together <br><br>We have been together for a few months now and despite having some ups and downs I am very happy with her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  She left a week ago.<br>We both changed, and what do you expect. <br>We were together for five years.

Seems like your anger is forced through something you're trying to tell yourself, maybe sometimes during the week or maybe once every few months you lie in bed and just think for even a few minutes how you miss someone. Wish someone was there beside you to lay down with you and comfort you. Just someone to love and connect with, to talk to late at nights. Why are you so angry with others trying to move on?</br>  <br>Lol</br>  <br><br>sorry anons, thats just a stupid act of nature</br></br>  <br> LOL <br>Is that laughing because of other peoples misary?<br>Asshole</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>i think you all need someone to talk to.</br></br></br>    ▲<br>▲ ▲<br> mfw I can triforce, but no gf </br></br>  <br>LOL because of the bullshit that happened before we were together. So many fucked up things happend and now everything is fine. Asshole.</br>  <br>You cant triforce</br>  <br>i think you need someone to CHECK EM'</br>  <br> Asshole <br>What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.</br></br>  What would be more painful for a women?<br>- Having her breasts sliced off<br>- Having a broom shoved up her ass<br>- Having her labia removed<br><br>inb4 edgelord</br></br></br></br></br>   Having a broom shoved up her ass <br>That would kill her.</br>  <br>make her eat her own cooking</br>  <br>i dont know, but post photos when you do it</br>  so whats /b/'s hobbies? mine is drifting<br>Pic Related, its me</br>  <br>in the picture i was running n9000, they're quite expensive but they make a shitload of smoke though.</br>  <br>thanks for answering. if money was no object or you had a sponsor, what would your ideal tires be?</br>  <br>Get a v&amp; yet? Certain amount of bullets and you go on a list.</br>  So this pic came across my newsfeed on FB. A friend of my younger sister from some small hick town in Ohio; she's in South Carolina with her family for summer break.<br><br> posts this photo of them eating out for dinner <br> her bitch friends from Ohio jump in and say that it's too much for a girl her age and size <br> she gets upset and agrees  <br> her family jump in and defend her saying its a normal portion for a girl <br> dad goes full blown CYBER POLIZEI BAKTRAKING CONSEQUENCES <br> she messages my sister saying she is having a shit summer and her 4th of July is ruined <br><br>Is this really a child's/girl's portion in the US? I mean she ate it all and was happy with it, so no problem there. I couldn't eat all that in one sitting though. Could you? What exactly do you feed a pre-teen girl to keep her healthy?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>these aren't from her facebook, are they? they can find her profile with these pics</br>  <br>I don't give a fuck about the girl, what kind of food plate is that?
