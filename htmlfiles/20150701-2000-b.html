Not to mention all the exclusives</br>  <br>right if u got time to go to some 1 , u rather go outside with your friend and do something active, not sit at home and play video games. you can play video games alone online with your friend when the time is limited</br>  <br> 2015 <br> Still doesnt have an XB1 <br>are you poor or just retarded?</br></br></br>    I use to be a die hard Xbox fan, I hated PS3 fags and shit so of course I got an xboxone but man is that a pice of shit the apps close randomly sometimes when I try to turn it doesn't won't to and I have to click the button 10 times before it does also the controller feels fuckin retarded you should just get ps4    <br>Best part is, you want a console game pad? Which do you prefer? There'sprograms to make the playstation work for it, and the xbox is just plug and play, no software required</br>    <br>Good answer.</br>  <br>rofl stupid casuals don't know that being a upbeat faggot, decreases ur preformance, and focus</br>  <br>Best answer</br>  <br> i even watch anime <br>besides, youre literally sitting in front of a shitty 20ms ghosting television, pixels as big as my fingernail alone playing games WITHOUT THE ABILITY to watch chinese cartoons in the background<br><br>stay pleb you dumbass</br></br></br></br>  PS4, but lack of games as of this moment.

But when I used to play strictly console, my friends would come over and have to BRING THEIR CONSOLES TO PLAY GAMES<br>So basically, nothing changed except better graphics, frame rates, resolution, ability to share files, modding, etc etc.</br></br>  GET THE STEAM MACHINE<br>BASED NEWELL<br>IT'S LIKE A PC BUT BETTER</br></br>  <br>Sweet. Can it run Bloodborne?</br>  Honestly OP, I have a PC that I love playing games on but while you're playing you can just get distracted so easily but consoles get you really invested. I got an Xbox one when it came out and played a couple games like Shadow of Mordor and Sunset Overdrive(which is one of the best games I've ever played) and I played them for hours on end. But really check the exclusives and their reviews. If you get an Xbox, then get Sunset Overdrive.

Xbone's flagship titles don't have splitscreen: Forza horizon 2, Halo MCC, Gears 4, and Halo 5 all don't have it. PS4 has more splitscreen games this gen and better hardware so third party games look better on it. The only reason to buy an Xbone would be to play 360 games when BC comes in. And even then kind of sad to buy a new gen console to lay last gen games don't you think?</br>  <br>I don't have any kids, you fucking ape.<br><br>I just used to make their fucking toes curl.<br><br>The fuck does that have to do with anything?<br><br> getting facts from the movie idiocracy <br><br> trying to school someone clearly smarter than they. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What's the point of these threads?  <br>arguing.</br>  <br>How in the fuck could consoles get you more invested than pc's?
