Most of those introverts you see in school are the kids that grow up to have a shit load of potential. <br>Extroverts are people that use their wide variety of a social life to help benefit them, (Which isn't a bad thing, but to be honest people aren't that reliable). <br>The difference:<br>Extroverts - Rely on people<br>Introverts - Rely on themselves</br></br></br></br></br>  ENTP-A  INTJ here<br><br> Muh 2% </br></br>  <br>Who cares, the test is complete bullshit. It's the homeopathy of psychology</br>  <br>Who said it had to be about psychology? It's just another fun away to describe yourself through means of biased online test.</br>  INTJ-T. Now i get to read how 1/3 of /b/ also types INTJ, which is one of the most commonly misstyped and rarest personalities. Let the shit posts begin  <br>Ayy</br>  <br>MBTI is more bullshit than astrology is, and that's saying something.</br>  INTJ  <br>It's not an accurate description, and it claims to be a psychological test.</br>  <br> astrology <br> More bullshit than a personalized test that describes someone through a means of what their personality type is <br> Compared to something that bases your personality off of what month you were born in <br><br>That's something I actually didn't know.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>usually get INTP too</br>  <br>MBTI is *the* textbook case of confirmation bias. It is absolutely more bullshit than astrology, because most people know that astrology is bullshit.</br>  <br> people aren't reliable <br>Which is exactly why introverts rarely blossom to their full potential. They don't even know how to socialize.</br></br>  <br>eeyyy infp</br>  <br>INFJ<br>It is right about my sense of morality. I've always been a moralfag.</br></br>  <br>The fact that you support you opinion with, "People know that astrology is bullshit however because they actually believe that MBTI can be accurate that makes them more stupid." is flawed in its logic.<br><br>Who says they don't know how to socialize? What difference would it make if they did it frequently? Hell, what difference would it make if an extrovert stayed alone frequently? No see the whole point of introverts is that they DO blossom, but alone.</br></br></br>  Oh joy, another test to remind me of my shitty personality.  <br>MBTI is more bullshit because people believe it. It's like, Mormonism is more bullshit than Scientology. Anyone with a brain knows Scientology is fake. But Mormonism is still conisidered truth by millions.</br>    <br> Implying there aren't infinite different ways to interpret a natal chart's aspects, and relationships between two different charts. <br><br> 12 signs <br> 36 decans <br> 10 planets <br> 12 houses <br> 6 major aspects <br> 4 elements <br> 3 modes <br> ascendant based on minutes <br> lunar nodes <br> geographical location <br> fixed star qualities <br><br>You do the fucking math, Einstein.<br><br> Would rather categorize myself into 4 autistically oversimplified binary umbrella generalizations <br><br>Then you get retards like this  that think 'muh introversion' doesn't require relying on others. Also, "I get to choose my personality!" Huh, reminds me of everything else special snowflakes like.<br>It's misinformative, illusionary, and fucking stupid.<br><br>At least astrology is aesthetically pleasing as a psychological artform.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Shitty <br>You make me laugh, anon.<br>You could be using your mind to do great things if you wanted.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh really, and what sets astrology apart from being more bullshit?<br> Hur dur muh birthdate </br></br>  <br>Yes, and be miserable the whole damned way. I'm a mechanical engineer planning on starting a buisness. But I hate living because I can not understand people, I mean I can interact with them to a point at which it isn't a problem. But god, it sucks</br>  <br>Ayy</br>  <br>^this<br><br>At least astrology has enough complexity to leave open to interpretation, and relationships in interactions.<br><br>MBTI is literally<br> dude i'm a 0100 <br> oh man, i'm a 1001, i heard we don't get along <br> yeah, but in a year or so i'll become 0101 so it's ok <br><br>How is that any different than astrology, besides astrology not allowing you to be able to 'choose' certain things?<br><br>Kinda reminds me of all the special snowflake gender faggots. Guess people hate being born a certain way. Life is russian roulette, deal with it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I've taken this test 5+ times and I've always gotten ENFP. I just took it again and got ENTP. Dear God....  <br>Please shut up, you're wasting space on an already shitty board with total nonsense. Stop trying to win a worthless argument by "playing smart"</br>  <br>Lmao</br>  <br>You're a fucking natural problem solver, faggot, I figured out the answer a long time ago, didn't make much of a difference in my life. Who says that you have to understand people? (Yes it's a part of life ect ect), but lemmy help you out here:<br>The only way to truly understand people is to first understand yourself.</br></br>  <br><br>Proof that I'm shit on a screen.</br></br>  <br>It's not just about birthdate. I'm going to humor you here, because I have a mild enthusiasm about the topic.<br><br>There's much more involved in astrology than the 12 signs, and what stupid fucking modern-age internet gipsy horologists (or retarded social media quizzes/lists) would have you believe.<br><br>It's like an art. Think about this, there are 12 notes in the traditional music scale, are there not?</br></br></br></br></br>  INTJ    Doesn't matter when or hoy; I always get INTJ.  ENTP forever and always  <br>Oh joy, an epic journey of self discovery. I can hardly wait. Even though I already hate myself enough to being with.</br>    <br>You're a special kind of weapons-grade autism, aren't you?<br><br>Anyways. No, I won't waste my energy in providing anything worth talking about to people that are generally shitty, can't see past their own Poe's Law, and don't actually want to converse about anything that is either outside their comfort range or too involved to entertain their OCD-fueled ADHD.<br><br>Enjoy your shithead genetics, fucktard.</br></br></br></br></br>  ENFP here<br><br>I can shiggy diggy<br><br>tfw covered in introverts though</br></br></br></br>  <br>I wouldn't know, I'm not a musical person.<br>But I can kind of see your point of view.<br><br>Normie<br><br>Most INTJs I meet are dicks to me for some reason, ignore me a lot even when I attempt to get into philosophical discussion.<br><br>ENTP's are cool, my best friend is an ENTP and I fucking love getting into arguments with him, just the other day we got into an argument on whether or not gelato is an icecream or not. (It's not, by the way).<br><br>Why is it that you hate yourself?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You do realize I say this because you are, 1, preaching to a wall that won't listen, and 2, are making a ridiculous argument that a system based off of personality generalizations that obviously exist is less valid than astrology to determine personas.</br>  <br>Not to mention you immediately start calling people who disagree with you autistic. Very mature.</br>  (INTP-T) reporting in  <br> obviously exist <br>Enjoy your fantasy world, where everyone is either "introverted" or "extroverted" with no actual descriptors or narrative for the dynamics involved.<br><br>You wouldn't know a personality if you had one, drone.</br></br></br></br>  Fourth time I've taken this, fourth time I've gotten this result.  <br> weapons-grade autism </br>  <br>I dislike the fact that I really can't relate with anyone at all. I wall up in my own little corner in life and just stay there. I don't really know how to reach out of it. And whenever I go anywhere, everyone starts praising me as some kind of genius, and not as someone who's relatable at all. I know this makes little sense, but the android keyboard isn't exactly helping.<br><br>I just have a lot of trouble getting along with people, and I push them away. So I'm lonely and have very mixed feelings about that.</br></br></br>  <br>got intj last time this time i got istp.</br>  (ENTJ-A) Here  <br>raresy over here</br>  <br>real faggots often are pretty extroverted<br><br>part of being a man is knowing when to shut up</br></br></br>  <br>That's why it's not binary, its a spectrum. Are you blind to the brightly coloured percentage bars in the images? No one is black and white in terms of personality. But in order to categorize anything you have to draw a line of generalization somewhere, and this system does that reasonably well.<br><br>If you'd be so kind as to get off your high horse, you look a ridiculous as the emperor from the "emperor's new clothes" story</br></br></br>  <br>Fellow mobilefag</br>  <br>It sucks, but I'm not getting my computer at this point</br>  ENFP<br><br> be extrovert <br> be on /b/ <br> mfw </br></br></br></br>  <br>See the fact that you even care in the first place shows that you have a deep empathic connection to yourself and the others around you. It shouldn't be about the answers when your trying to connect with people it should be more about the feeling. (That's why so many extroverted people feel it easy to connect with others). So you see, anon, the deeper you try to see through people the more questions there will have to be answered. The easiest way to alleviate yourself from your problem is to first find your strengths and weaknesses, then learn about... You. Only then can you experience clarity in trying to seek out your answers.</br>  <br>It's not any more bullshit than most of psychology or psychiatry.<br><br>The only time psychology isn't bullshit is if you can physically measure something in the brain, and even there, the way a person chooses to see the world has a lot to do with what happens in their brain.</br></br></br>  <br>I just prefer mobile because I'm such a shit typer on pc.</br>  <br>ayyy</br>  <br>lmao</br>  <br>Incidentally, he was INFJ too.</br>  Entj-Estj  Guess I'm a dick...  <br> implying your personality can be compiled into 5 bars. <br><br>Fucking morons. You are who you are.<br>Putting a label on it isn't going to make you part of some special society.</br></br></br></br>    The circle jerk for INTJs is kind of annoying, but what ever.  <br>You're probably right. Although I really don't know where to start. This doesn't strike me as a very methodical thing to go about.</br>  intp masterrace  <br>Funny, I thought the same thing until I took the test a couple of times. I kind of feel like it's something that personally describes me as a person. But yes, you could easily say that.</br>  Your Leader Coming In Faggots  <br>Mah nigga!<br>I thought I was the only one</br></br>    <br> i post an image of a monarchical figure <br> makes an 'emperor's clothes' insult <br><br>Wow, you really are creative aren't you? What a truly special snowflake!<br><br>Yeah, and I already know this confirmation biased-based test is flawed. Shit, they had to add another letter because it was shitty for the very reason (oversimplified) I said!<br>But guess what? That, and the biased resulting spectrums provided by way of a deterministic (and human-designed) algorithm doesn't change the fact that it's STILL SHITTY, and STILL based in confirmation BIAS.<br><br>Do you really think you understand how you influence others? Can you fucking read minds?<br><br>No, you can't understand exactly how you are placed in others' perspectives, at least you can't communicate about this with everyone you meet.<br><br>Therefore, it's deceptive to believe you know how your personality impacts and is perceived by others. This is much more important than what you think your personality is personally. You can't just act in accordance to a system that's built on confirmation bias, without outwardly expressing that bias.<br><br>Therefore, astrology makes a worthwhile counterpoint against MBTI, as it holds the classical method of time-deterministic, event-based personality types and influences.<br><br>MBTI is for metrosexual roody-poos.<br>For instance, how is observance antonymous to intuition?<br>Reductionism at its finest. You wouldn't even care to give it half a contradiction. Nope, just gotta vacuously listen to the modern written word!<br><br>What a joke. And you have the audacity to point and laugh at someone that can postulate.<br><br>Don't you have a fucking You Banana You Lose thread to make?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You don't strike me as a methodical type of guy, that's fine, a good start is evaluating what you're good and bad at. Maybe read up a little about your personality, that's always good.</br>  <br>You are not alone.....<br>No one is alone...<br><br>SONDHEIM REFERENCE<br><br>No, but I'm a leader because I am a descendent of Napoleon</br></br></br></br></br></br>    Beep beep master race coming through  introverted fags  <br>It depends, some things are best tackled when you have a clear plan in mind, and I realize that. Other times a go with the flow approach is best, although that has the potential to get sidetracked all too often.

You think whatever it is that you want too think, and I'll keep my train of thought. Your really fired up about this, and I understand that feeling, but I really don't share your enthusiasm. I disagree on the grounds of astrology being unscientific in nature, but if you believe in its other aspects, so be it. I'm not going to debate further because we're obviously two walls pushing on each other. You being a particularly edgy one.</br>  <br>Finally, another one.<br>I thought I was alone.</br></br>  <br>its sad to watch someone give this much effort towards something that doesnt matter, trying to impress people that dont care</br>  <br>Although it just makes me even more disappointed, because I always look at the negative aspects first, and that goes for my persona as well.</br>  <br>[citation needed]</br>  Am I the only one?  I got JSRF, what does it mean?  <br>Exactly, it's down right pitiful.</br>    INTP-A<br><br>Right with you OP.</br></br>  <br>Who said the negatives needed to be negative? No see, they should be used as a tool to HELP you with self evaluation.</br>  <br>Nah, me too.</br>  <br><br><br>Are you fucking retarded?<br>I'm arguing for astrology as the Devil's advocate.<br>You couldn't understand what I'm getting at if you re-read my statements 50 fucking times.<br><br>I said it's a fucking counterpoint.<br><br>MBTI is NOT fucking SCIENTIFIC YOU FUCKING ANUS.<br>IT'S NOT EVEN PSEUDO-SCIENTIFIC.<br><br>You just fucking lost all reputability right there. Congrats on being a cuck to some faggot's "self-actualization" ponzi structure for personality.<br><br>That's why it's fucking worse than astrology. At least when a horologist tells you something, you can tell them they're full of shit.<br><br>MBTI masquerades, and mongoloids like you can't see past it.<br><br>Not like I give a fuck.

It's silly but enjoyable. But the point in mentioning it is the main character, Bojack. He's a washed up 90s TV star living a bumbs life. But more than that, he's a broken person who doesn't really understand how broken they are. He wants to change, but he has no idea how, he keeps searching for it, and usually just finds a new low by doing so. <br><br>I know its ridiculous, and not totally the same, but I can really relate to that. Seeing that there's something wrong, something keeping you from being happy, and wanting to fix it, but being clueless as to how to do it. Also realizing that as you go about it, you risk breaking things even more than if you had left them alone, all in an attempt to right whatever's wrong.<br><br>Idk, its been years since I've really felt good about myself</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It says here so was Ghandi.</br>  <br> minecraft <br>kill yourself</br></br>  <br><br>I got Defender as well.</br></br>  <br>Then you really should ask yourself, "what changed?"</br>  <br>The fact that you are making such lengthy, heated responses obviously indicates that you care.

There was a swift invasion there as a result. Intel describes the alium beings as evolved to be very cute, sexually attractive biological war machines, with naturally weaponized bodies, the likes of which humanity has never seen. They can shoot laser beams from their eyes, they can launch missiles from their ears, and can stop hearts telepathically. Reports also confirm that the aliums possess kawaii weapons of mass cuteness, housed in silos within their rainbow colored spaceships.<br><br>It is also apparent that the aliums are interbreeding with the Japanese population. The aliums procreate through excreting their feces into the mouths of the opposite sex. This is the cause of the rampant scat sex fetish in Japan. It is not just a fetish, this confirms the aliums' sexual domination and subsequent control over Japan. And they are planning world conquest.<br><br>May God have mercy on our souls.

Gonna upload the right vid this time.  <br>touché</br>  <br>Moar of the tater plz</br>  <br><br>KEK</br></br>  So I am very high. Ask me questions and I shall shed light upon your earthly queries.  What do you believe is the best way to walk down a set of stairs?  <br>  Do you think girls ever forget to wipe front to back? </br>  is it...or it is?  <br>The best way to walk down stairs is to crab walk. Your hands and feet are then on equal terms.</br>  <br>DO YOU SUCK DICKS!? ARE YOU A PETER PUFFER?!!</br>  <br>Alas, I am not a Peter puffer. I am simply a high man answering your mortal questions.</br>  High upon the mountain, cross-legged, free from mortal coil, you hear a divine sound. What is it?  <br>It is the sound of a thousand voices crying out into the night that justice has been brought down to the world, and peace has been made.</br>  Where do you think is the absolute best place to eat a nice chicken dinner?  What makes a boy become a man?  <br>The absolute best place to have a chicken dinner is the top of a waterfall with your loved ones. Then you can throw the bones over the falls and feed the fish.</br>  <br>A boy becomes a man when he realizes that one day he will die. Upon this realization, he knows he is mortal and will then strive to make his life worth living; ideally.</br>  How should one walk upon an open road?  <br>One should walk upon an open road with grace. Make sure there are no cars or trucks, then astonish viewers with your crossing.</br>  What makes one truly free?  <br>Either love or death is what makes one truly free. Both are powerful and life impacting and with them you shall feel at one with the universe and at ease as you have never felt before.</br>  What makes a woman beautiful? What makes a love to be true?  <br>A spirit is what makes a woman beautiful. A caring spirit. Does she love you in return? True love is when two spirits entwine and you feel completed by the other person. They challenge you and you challenge them. You compromise, and talk, and are loyal. Etc.</br>  What is the gateway to one's own soul?  <br>Blunts, papers, or the steam roller for my next smoke?</br>  Does the self persist? Does the self exist?  <br>The gateway to one's own soul is existential introspection. You will see who you truly are, and like it or not, you will be able to mold your future life around what suits you.</br>  <br>I'm feeling blunts calling to me.</br>  <br>Good call. Thanks OP <br><br>Youre still a fuckin faggot tho</br></br></br>  <br>The self does exist, though in a different way than the spirit. The self feels pain and joy and desires, whereas the spirit is simply the true self within that is released upon death. The self does exist; it has needs to fulfill.</br>  What is something beautiful that you have seen?  <br>I saw the shimmering flanks of a horse as it galloped across a field to approach me, it was a chestnut colored horse, with dashes of white. I stroked it's head and it trotted away to my neighbor's field.</br>  Good night stranger.  <br>i smoked weed a little over a month ago. will i pass my piss test?</br>  Adult girls who wear diapers turn me on. Thoughts?  <br>Goodnight sweet prince.</br>  <br>Yup</br>  <br>Indeed you shall, worry not my child.</br>  <br>OP all your answers have been great so please answer this question.</br>  <br>I think that you are an individual with individual tastes. This is what makes us human, be proud that you are different. Do not shy away from the masses, but rather rejoice your non-conformity.</br>  OP, are you happy?  <br>Did Jesus really die for our sins?</br>  Is it bad for one to worry too much, or is worrying, while unfavorable, a nonetheless necessary part of living our lives? Or is their a balance in between?  Dubs decide what i will do with this wild Animal i found  What is a Blender, dont know hohe to use a Dictionary  <br><br>The only thing that would destroy your anus<br><br>And this time is not your uncle's dick you abused child</br></br></br></br>  get a refund  gf is asleep, trips deicdes<br><br>OP will delivar</br></br>  <br>http://<span>youtu.be/VLnWf1sQkjY  [ ]<br>Cant cum on command?
