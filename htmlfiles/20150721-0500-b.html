You're fucked.</br>  I visited the site to see if there was a message or anything from the hackers to the public. I don't have a profile, but the site and my computer crashed immediately. Must be under a DDoS.  <br>Give me a $1000 and I will delete u from the list</br>  This is great!

It's not a secret.</br></br>  <br>Am I fucked? Used fake names and friends cc info</br>  <br>Im supposing not every wife in America is going to go browsing through 5 million profiles to see if they can track down their man. Otoh, if some blackmailer threatened to send her an email with the info...</br>  <br>Believe me, some wives/husbands believe enough on their partner to even bother on looking on these things.</br>  <br>If you're okay with being cheated on your a beta cuck. Period. By the laws of nature, you are a failure.</br>  <br>If you used credit card/have photos, yes you are.</br>  While it'd be hilarious to see the entirety of the data, just a text file dump of the user list (real names and a city) would satisfy most peoples' curiosities.  <br>That's why someone will create a site with a search</br>  <br>Do you think that they would really get rid of their hardware for you?</br>  It's like wikileaks....except with lulz  <br>It's my friends cc not mine</br>  IT'S TIME<br><br>So where's this leak at?</br></br>  <br><br>Nah. I just don't spaz out over it like betas, who cling to the only girl who will ever fuck him.</br></br>  <br>Done. Give me your pay pal.</br>  Ask a Jehovah Witness anything    <br>Anything?</br>    <br>Yea</br>  Why would Jesus choose to rule invisibly over the earth and allow atrocities like both of the world wars to happen when he could have just initiated the rapture and killed all the Jews himself?  <br>Do you like fluffies?</br>  <br>Do you have time to talk about our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ of Nazarath? Please, take this free bible! Those are wonderful children you have, they must worship the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ of Nazarath!</br>  <br><br>To prove humanity wrong that it couldn't rule over itself properly...</br></br>  Bumping    <br> let people die to prove 'em wrong <br>Sounds like an asshole tbh</br></br>  <br>Have you actually witnessed something?</br>  <br>No just a name</br>  <br>What's it like knowing that you weren't part of the original congregation so you won't be allowed to enter into heaven, but instead have to settle with inheriting paradise earth? <br><br>Do you feel slightly cheated? Do you think it's the same love Jehovah God has for you that he had for the original congregation? Or is it something less, more like a step-father?</br></br></br>  why no celebration of holidays?    <br>1/5</br>  <br>2/5</br>  <br>3/5</br>  How can you be the "chosen" religion when JW's were started in the 1870's?  <br>You think i want the responsibility of ruling over millions of humans? No thanks i'll take my perfect wife ,life, and free land any day thanks.</br>  <br>4/5</br>  <br>Do you have to pay for the literature out of pocket or does the watchtower provide it free of cost at your meetings? <br><br>Do you have any "dues" you must pay, aside from time? Like the way Christians and catholics have the collection plate?</br></br></br>  <br>5/5</br>  Why the fuck are you so annoying?  <br>Started with the jews B.C.E.</br>  <br>how do magnets work?</br>    <br>Free all free, supported by donations</br>  <br>What do you think of Cloud?</br>  <br>because</br>  <br>I DONT WANT YOUR FUCKING HANDOUTS FAGGOT</br>  <br><br>have you ever really witnessed Jehova?</br></br>  <br>Search Results<br><br> So magnets are made by putting a magnetic object under a magnetic field, this makes all the domains spin in the same direction, which is what defines a magnet. Also electricity running through a wire creates a magnetic field because it has a flow of electrons in one direction.</br></br></br>  <br>Strife?</br>  <br>Can you kill yourself?</br>  <br>Are you seriously a brother OP, we should try not and come back here ever again, also im gonna need you congregation name and DOB- just to prove your a brother</br>  <br>You dont have to take em...</br>  <br>Do you have many worldly friends or do you mostly socialize with other JW (excluding work life or school)? <br><br>Follow up question: If you do have worldly friends, do you ever speak to them about the literature? If so, how long do you wait before bringing it up? Do you ever invite them to your meetings? Do you allow your children (if applicable) to have worldly friends? Do you ever feel sad knowing that your worldly friends can't enjoy life eternal with you and your family after the rapture?</br></br></br>  <br>Ok the reason for the name to clarify is we're supposed to be witnesses of god in a "court case" against satan.</br>  Why does the bible not mention dinosaurs? why did the 'faithful and discreet slave' get it so wrong in predicting armageddon in the 1970's causing thousands of witnesses to sell there homes and give up jobs? Then when it didn't happen, they decided it was 'the flock' that got it so wrong, not them....???  <br>What you think we don't use google?</br>  <br>I've tried bob saget, I've tried</br>  <br>What do you go door to door selling religion?</br>  <br>Hence why i'm anonymous, and yes i should never be here in the first place. I will never tell you my congregation and dob because they can look you up... I'm not stupid</br>  <br>0<br>nope<br>nope<br>nope<br>n/a<br>nope<br><br>I'm not exemplary at all, I struggle to even go out in service</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I know that Jehovahs Witnesses are major supporters of the right to free speech <br><br>And also as a group responsible for many advances in modern medicine due to their "NO BLOOD" policy <br><br>But what other important achievements has the faith contributed to American Society that it doesn't receive credit for?</br></br></br></br></br>  How are you a jehovah witness if you have never seen him  <br>You say you are married? <br><br>Has your wife ever performed oral sex on you? Have you ever requested it? <br><br>If yes: how difficult was it to convince her?</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Why I don't know...</br>  <br>Have you ever done a YouTube or Google search for "jehovahs witness" and read past the first five results?</br>  <br>Was he mediocre?</br>  <br>Understandable.. but come on, your baptized obviously, and so am i, 95% on anon won't even understand where were coming from, you know the truth and know right and wrong, I'm in the same boat obviously.We shouldent really be here, we should try and make a goal to not come back</br>  <br>why is the christian god evil enough to commit all 7 of the deadly sins in the old testament?</br>  <br>Matthew24:14 says this good news of the kingdom will be preached and then the end will come.<br><br>Does this mean if all witnesses stop preaching, the organization can postpone armageddon indefinitely?</br></br></br>  <br>"(2) Do you understand that your dedication and baptism identify you as one of Jehovah's Witnesses in association with God's spirit-directed organization?"Watchtower1985 Jun 1 p.30<br><br>We're watching you both</br></br></br>    STOP FUCKING KNOCKING ON MY HOUSE AT 3PM EVERY FUCKING SATURDAY TO GIVE ME A PAMPHLET AND NOW YOU GUYS ARE USING LITTLE BLACK CHILDREN TO "GUILT" ME TO ACCEPT THE FUCKING PAMPHLET I'M ANSWERING NAKED NEXT TIME I SWEAR  <br>Lol I'm baptized and haven't been to a meeting in 20 yrs.... So many holes in all of the teaching, deep down inside you 2 other JW's know it too. All scare tactics.</br>  <br>i just counter by teaching them the good word of satan</br>  <br><br>Been to a few meetings. Everybody is so nice. Is this real? It sometimes seems to good to be true, but in the other hand they do preach a lot about love and caring for one another.</br></br>  Here comes another inactive claiming the truth has holes, Brother if you truely feel that way, then go ask a local congregation your concerns, as for the other brother on here, you helped me not want to come back here  <br>I'm not personally JW. <br><br>But two very good friends of mine are. And in an effort to be allowed to socialize with them, I have spent much of my free time researching the organization (the outside and the inside view) and I occasionally browse through the publications online. <br><br>I find the structure of the whole thing absolutely fascinating. So well done. And the way the literature is written is VERY powerful. <br><br>But for a religion of people who know they are saved and have an entire earth to themselves, why is there so much depression and suicide in the community? Why does the watchtower put out so many publications that specifically talk about feeling sad, alone, cut off or just generally depressed?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I am in love with A Jehovah Witness... She's two years younger than me and things have been going on for two years.<br>She loves me with all her heart aswell, but fights with anxiety and such.<br>Her mother doesn't let us be together at all and it really hurt. <br>Any tips?</br></br></br>  <br>It's real, psa:34,18 says test and see Jehovah is good, , you gotta take a bite of it first before you can taste, dont you?</br>  <br>How's you creepy ass cult. Also, if one of you motherfuckers comes to my door during dinner again, I'm going to throw a piss balloon at them.</br>  <br>Who is Jehovah, why did you witness him, and will you guys be riding down the highway to Valhara together,</br>  <br><br>Was at a JW convention/congress, how come there are so many hot women there? A looot of could looking people!</br></br>  <br>would you like some toast?</br>  <br><br>I love the teachings of Jesus and the moral standards of JW's are probably my favorite of all religions I've learned about so far. Been to a few meetings, great people and vibe, but I could never join because I don't believe in the paradise part amongst a few other super natural things. What should I do?</br></br>  <br>Omg bro me too I'm in the same boat. <br><br>We talk in secret through texting. I have been allowed to hang out with her by making sure I'm clean shaven, neatly combed hair, and I always wear dress clothes when I go pick her up. <br><br>Always knock on the door, never wait in the driveway. <br>Always have conversation with her mom (who only speaks Spanish and my Spanish is terrible) <br><br>I also make home cooked meals for her mother once in a while, and help once a month with yard work. <br><br>We've only hung out twice though. After the second time her sister told her mother that we were having sex in the back seat of my car behind a dominoes because she was angry she wasn't invited. Her whole family ignored her for two weeks until they finally believed her that it wasn't true. <br><br>She gets panic attacks all the time. Only sleeps 3-4 hours a day. She's really skinny already, but still starves herself. And recently she's started running to the point of complete exhaustion cause she said it helps her "forget"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm inactive because it is a joke, My dad was an Elder I was in it for a long time until I started to think for myself. As for you not wanting to come back here, GTFO you shouldn't be here anyway... Bad association spoils useful habits. Now go secretly jerk off to traps or cheese pizza.</br>  All the real JWs have left the thread guys. Being on /b/ just isn't worth the risk  <br><br>Been researching it too, especially cause I've been to a few meetings on invitation of a good friend. What it your general opinion as of now? There's a huge stigma on JW, but when I meet them and talk to them I can't help but just really like them all, including there life view etc.</br></br>  <br><br><br/></br></br>  Does it suck that you can't celebrate anything? I mean how fucking pathetic can you be to listen to a region that stupid?  Being a JW is the only thing dumber then being a Christian  <br><br>..stupid...region...<br><br>facepalm</br></br></br></br>  <br>How does it feel being a mindless drone to the watchtower? You can't even play chess because of their stupid rules. google it.<br><br> Both Ben and I received a request from a reader to blog about the dangers of playing chess. We’ve seen that handball is not allowed if you’re a Jehovah’s Witness, but did you know that playing chess is equally as bad? </br></br></br>  <br>They're really cool people. The younger ones are especially helpful and friendly. <br><br>It's once you get introduced to the home life that the story changes. <br><br>Once you start to abide by the rules of the watchtower in addition to the Bible. <br><br>I'm not gonna put any opinions out there cause I don't wanna influence your experience. But I say look into the life outside the church doors, because that's where most of your life as a witness will take place. See if you like that first.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you for real? <br>I met her through her brother, whom I became very good friends with. <br>We talk everyday, and "sneak snuggle" everytime I watch a movie at there place. <br>Her parents really like me, im a nice guy. but still we're not allowed to be together... It's bad</br></br></br></br>  <br>OP ? no answer?</br>  <br>He felt convicted and had to leave this cesspool of depravity.</br>  <br>Yeah man dead serious. This girl of mine is 23. <br><br>"sneak snuggle" I like that. Took me 6 weeks to get a hug from this girl myself. After several months of gentle reassurance I have built her confidence up enough to where she doesn't constantly slouch and mumble. She's becoming very strong and confident (I'm also her manager at work so I have tons of time to give her encouragement.) <br><br>We're supposed to be hanging out tomorrow actually. Alone. At my place. She says she has some things she's "curious" about. <br><br>Pretty excited dude. Never seen a real Virgin before</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Jehovah Witness are a mind-control organization, on the same tier as Scientology. <br><br>Don't like something you're told to do/think? Your whole family will shun you to coerce you into the herd mentality.</br></br>  <br> implying all religions arent mind control </br>    <br>Any belief, given to you by someone else, is, by definition, mind control. <br><br>They said that he said that God said I can't. <br><br>Even laws are a form of mind control. There is no such thing as morality at birth. This must be learned, imprinted on you by the society you live in. <br><br>If humans were born with morals then we wouldn't have need for religions or laws because we would all "govern ourselves accordingly" from day one.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Ok, here's what you have to do. You'll need to get the most bumpy twig you can find, and make sure it's dirty. The what you'll want to do is coat it in both cold cream and pepper spray on one end, and gasoline or any highly flammable liquid on the other. Now pay very close attention to this part, as it's pivotal. you'll need to shove the end with cold cream and pepper spray up your ass. When it's in there, you'll know what the bumps are for as it, "balances the humors." Anyway, make sure the other end is very noticeable in the way it protrudes. You will now pull out a lighter and your cellphone. set the end sticking out on fire, and call your mother. Keep the stick up your ass as you wait for her answer. When she does, you must immediately scream "mom, you raised a complete faggot!" As loud as you can. Then you drop the phone, find the most sturdy cable or rope you own, and you will hang yourself.</br></br>  I actually am a JW (parents are, want to leave but I live with them 18 but going to College neer house) i go to there meeting and could actually answer some questions about them if you guys want  <br>True enough, I'm atheist.<br><br>I just see that some religions are much worse than others. JWs brainwash their kids into growing up with a distorted view of reality.<br><br>I used to be great friends with a JW girl. She was slowly forced to give up most of the things she enjoyed. Her family would just harp on her until she gave in every time.<br><br>She was an avid chess player, but her father thought it was bad because of that Awake article.<br><br>She was into martial arts, her father made her give that up too.<br><br>She briefly had a boyfriend, but that ended because her family didn't approve of him.<br><br>She eventually stopped talking to me, when I asked her about why she couldn't play chess, etc. She told me I should visit a temple and learn for myself, and I wouldn't.<br><br>Fucking bullshit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>If you leave, they'll stop talking to you, and quote some bible verse about not eating from the same table at one who abandons the faith. <br><br>Fuck, they make me so pissed.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes plz<br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ha. My buddy tried "dating" a JW girl. It was so cute because you could tell they genuinely cared for each other. Such good chemistry. <br><br>But he told me he kissed her once before dropping her off. And she pushed him away, said "we can't do this cause you're not a witness" and got out of the truck and walked the rest of the way home alone. <br><br>They didn't talk for 4 months. And now they only text occasionally. So sad.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br> Was at a JW convention/congress, how come there are so many hot women there? A looot of could looking people! </br></br></br>  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criti<wbr>cism_of_Jehovah%27s_Witnesses</wbr>  <br><br>I love the teachings of Jesus and the moral standards of JW's are probably my favorite of all religions I've learned about so far. Been to a few meetings, great people and vibe, but I could never join because I don't believe in the paradise part amongst a few other super natural things. What should I do?</br></br>  <br>Yeah basically only reason i pretend i like going is so i can stay with my parents and not be shunned. Ultimately once i graduate i will leave and never be able to talk to my parents (they have already shunned my older bro so will be me next)<br><br><br>Ive wondered this too but in the end they say that god is in charge of their preaching and that if they stop god will find another org like JWs to take there place in preaching<br><br>I have but we are not allowed to and we could be considered apostates if we are caughts (shunned)<br><br>Trust me they are only suppoters of free speech when they benifit from it if you try to speak freely around them they will call you an apostate and... surprisingly shun you</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watch<wbr>_Tower_Society_unfulfilled_predicti<wbr>ons<br><br>The Watch Tower doesn't make as many clear predictions anymore, because they know they won't come true, and that hurts the faith.</br></br></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>what happened ?</br>  <br>How is it that they expect you to devote a significant amount of time to "bible study", but if you read any other material that would induce critical thinking, you're an apostate? That doesn't sound like "studying" to me, just brain washing.</br>  <br>I've seen it to but most of them will leave in the end. I know of the 10 teens in my congratulation at least 6 will not be there for long. <br><br>Everything is really perfect and great at first but once you get to know them they are HUGE hypocrites and will not be afraid to show it. I would advise that you thread carefully while you are there<br>Because they can and in my presonal experiences have been some of the worst people i have ever met</br></br></br></br>  <br>In the end it is. You can only have a "bible study" with verified JW teachings so they know there is nothing that will make you question it and when you are new to it they want you to have an experienced member so that you cant stray off of their path</br>  <br>I was once invited by a couple of JW to coffee and talk.<br>Before I went I asked them if they had any pamflets on scientific issues. They gave me one with DNA, biology, genes and evolution.<br><br>I went through it. 80% accurate surprisingly. What happened was, every time the articles in it got to a point where evolution could be considered proven and accurate, they would either quote some seriously ambiguous source, some non-published "doctor" or straight up WT publications.<br>It was obvious that whoever wrote that possessed the logic and knowledge to understand what genes are, how they work etc etc. Which made it hard for me to believe that they dropped the ball right at the end and went "therefore GOD!"<br><br>I made a few notes on the pamflet and went for coffee with JWs. Nice people I have to admit! Religious issues aside, they were pleasant to talk to and be around.<br><br>They didn't even take offence when I pointed out they were knowingly spreading lies, which happens to be a sin.<br><br>They did invite me to one of their meetings, and I agreed to go under the condition that at least one of them would read some blah blah science book, Darwin or some such. They declined, and so did I.<br><br>My question still stand though. Why do JWs KNOWINGLY spread lies to other people pretending they try to save them?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't know if it's 'knowingly'. The author in this case probably believes the bible so much that they try to make the science fit in their believe that the bible is the only truth.</br></br>  <br>I asked one about this kind of behavior.<br><br>She asked me, "If you saw someone trapped in a burning building, wouldn't you save them?" <br><br>So basically, they consider everyone that isn't a Witness to be doomed, and the ends justifies the means in order to save the person.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses are established by the Governing Body, without consultation with other members.[308] The religion does not tolerate dissidence about doctrines and practices;[138][309][310][311] members who openly disagree with the religion's teachings are shunned.[228] Watch Tower Society publications strongly discourage followers from questioning its doctrines and counsel, reasoning that the Society is to be trusted as "God's organization".[311][312][313][314] It also warns members to "avoid independent thinking", claiming such thinking "was introduced by Satan the Devil"[315][316] and would "cause division".[317] Those who openly disagree with official teachings are condemned as "apostates" who are "mentally diseased".[318][319][320] </br></br>  <br> Only reason i pretend i like going is so i can stay with my parents and not be shunned. Ultimately once i graduate i will leave and never be able to talk to my parents (they have already shunned my older bro so will be me next) <br>-Been there, started learning philosophy and biology and by the time I was 16 I quited that religious bullcrap.<br><br>Dude, just be honest, tell your parents, explain to them why they are retarded, show them any Richard Dawkins video, what's the worse that could happen?</br></br></br></br>  <br>and this kinda answers my question here <br><br><br><br>he gets shunned?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah... they're definitely brainwashed by stupidity</br>  There's also that whole child-abuse sex scandal thing.<br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehov<wbr>ah%27s_Witnesses%27_handling_of_chi<wbr>ld_sex_abuse<br><br>Basically, their religion prevents them from testifying or accusing other Witnesses, so when Elder Diddles buttfucks your kid, you can't do anything.</br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>Ayy lmao</br>  <br>dont come to my door ok?</br>  what's it like not standing for the national anthem?<br><br>i remember whenever we had a substitute teacher we always said the jeahova kid was lying and the sub would try n make him stand<br><br>top kek</br></br></br></br>  <br>Y'know, I hate the Witnesses, but I also hate the national anthem in schools. <br><br>Every day, we have to indoctrinate all of our kids by forcing them to swear allegiance to our country? And what's with the "under god"? Fuck.</br></br></br>  <br>love it or leave it fag</br>  <br> Standing for the national anthem <br> Being a J(e)W <br>Both are autistic</br></br></br>  <br>Don't forget the swearing on the bible shit</br>  <br> Hurr durr, Witnesses are brainwashed <br> Hurr durr, I pledge allegiance, to the flag.... </br></br>  <br>I don't hate them, they are infected with the religion virus, and they keep infecting more people with it</br>  <br>Yeah sure and then be kick out of my house and have to pay for dorms when i live 20 mins. From campus. They have removed every sign that my older bro ever lived there in fact most people in our congregation dont know about him.</br>  <br> He gets shunned <br>Well who gives a shit about those dumbasses</br></br>  <br>I have a serious question. There is a Gilead Instructor , Mark N. In PA or N.Y. I forget. How can I contact him. TY! I was groomed too be a Bethel Bro. in the 60's and 70's and knew Mark in N.J.</br>  <br>Damn, they're really fucked up. Just as a nazi obeying the führer. they are just obeying orders, they think they're doing good things</br>  <br>Well, assuming you want to survive, just keep pretending you like it till you find a way to get the fuck out of there</br>  <br>Why u keep knocking on my door op?</br>  <br>The do, but only one ... sort of like Passover but it's about the Last Meal,the bread and wine stuff.</br>   As 1914 approached, excitement mounted over the expected "change" of anointed Christians.[4]  <br> Early that year some Bible Students, convinced the end of the world had arrived, began distributing their material belongings, abandoning their jobs and eagerly anticipating the future.[20] <br><br>Lol. The world's ending! Here everyone, you can have all my stuff!<br><br> 6 months later <br><br>Spare change...?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because they don't celebrate anything that isn't god.<br><br>The bible only makes one mention of a birthday celebration, and it was a dick Pharaoh who made everyone celebrate it, pissing off God. So that's out.<br><br>Most of the other holidays are either bullshit anyway (Mother's Day, etc.), are patriotic in nature (they don't believe in getting involved in "worldly affairs"), are stupid (like Jesus was really born on December 25th), etc, etc.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We're ALL brainwashed. That's why you're now are programed to love gays and Bruce Jenner's new tits and wig. ANd Blacks are merely misunderstood and they need and want you help and money.</br>  <br>Hah, I saw someone that vandalized a mailbox with "black lives matter". Real great, commit a crime to demonstrate that black people aren't assholes.</br>  <br>All the adults are already brainwashed but a lot of the kids give me hope because they are very smart on how they hide themselves not liking to be there.<br><br>I have for my whole life it sucks though that i have basically been restricted to such a little wrold my whole child hood since my parents didn't let me go on the Internet or watch almost any show on tv because tv shows came from satan (could only watch it when they where around) untill i got a job and got a computer and now pay for my own Internet but i still have to be quite sniky so i am not caughton things like 4 chan or "devil stuff"</br></br></br>  <br>Go take a pic of that mail box. That's awesome!!</br>  <br>where you from bro. i kinda fell off too. was in a hindi group but struggled with the language and ended up missing a ton of meetings. moved back to an english hall that my brother is in, and been trying to do better. still struggling with going out with this new hall. <br><br>weird coming from such a small group and now a huge hall.</br></br></br>  <br>There's a whole vandalism movement going on, you can google image search that shit.</br>  <br> Why does the watchtower put out so many publications that specifically talk about feeling sad, alone, cut off or just generally depressed? <br>i think its because those are things that people in general deal with and struggle with. and they want to help.</br></br>  <br>Congrats! Dubs AND Trip!<br><br>As for the vandalism crap, be sure to keep the C02 tanks for your paintball gun filled. :) Do a little vandalism to the vandals.</br></br></br>  I'm a brother too. The fact that we're even on 4chan could get us into serious trouble.  <br>just start studying with one of them. you dont have to believe everything at once. knowledge takes time, and be honest with them about what you dont believe. thats my suggestion.</br>  <br>I was too.... in the 60's and 70's True. Pioneered each high school summer breaks. Took 4 years of Spanish to work towards to got to Bethel and then be sent to TX to help set up congregations on the TexMex border.<br><br>I still have JW friends but the Organization ...*</br></br></br>  <br>right..</br>  <br>Then clearly you don't buy into their bullshit, and yet you hide what you do out of fear.<br><br>Great organization, asshole.</br></br></br>  <br> . She told me I should visit a temple and learn for mysel <br><br> no temple....they'd melt before saying that<br> Kingdom Hall</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, whoops. I always forget the name, because it's so stupid.</br>  <br>You will find that the PEOPLE are very good people. But, eventually the ORGANIZATION does not allow free thought. If it's not in a JW book or the Watchtower or Awake! you can not entertain outside thoughts or opinions.</br>  <br>Why do you think that the origin of black people is when the people had to choose between god and the devil that the neutral people were "cursed" with dark skin?</br>  <br> god will find another org like JWs to take there place in preaching <br><br>Never have said that.<br><br>I have but we are not allowed to and we could be considered apostates if we are caughts (shunned)<br><br>also not true.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're right. I don't really mind though.</br>  <br>mom-anointed-fag here<br><br> "fucking finally!"<br><br>I really like how JW society works in a way of reading the bible and TALKING about what they read.<br><br>I really hate that the meetings are for indoctrination, and not free dialogue about the bible.<br><br>I really hate that the faith is driven by a dude named Rutherford who was a secret egyptologist and numeroligist and basic asshole, and died and saddled millions with the results of his hostile takeover of the governing body and organization practices.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes they say that gods plan will move on with or without the org and the parents at my hall are told that if they find their children to be searching through things like that then they must contact the elders immediately so they can make sure they haven't been "contaminated" by worldly belifes</br>  <br> inb4 determinism <br> Hurr durr we have free will </br></br>  <br>you cant get into trouble for being on here. probably just counseled not to be on this kind of site, but even so if you are not view porn and stuff then there isnt anything wrong with it. <br><br>I am a regular on /sp/ nothing bad there.</br></br></br>  <br>please ignore this</br>  Ask a recovering alcoholic anything.<br>10weeks sober and feeling it</br>  what's wrong with you're doge?  <br>That's not doge, it's giraffe. moron.</br>  <br>how are you "feeling it?" WTF does that mean.</br>  <br>Drank too much</br>  Would you fuck my sisters titties?  <br>lol, i recognise her!</br>  <br>Would you fuck those titties?</br>  <br>noodz?</br>  <br>Post moar</br>  OCD Thread  <br>ITT OP is a fag</br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br> triggered </br>    <br>fag</br>        This is JP-8 Jet Fuel. <br>Dubs says what i do with it.<br><br>INB4<br>drink it<br>rub on *body part name*<br>because i have already done both.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd be down to work on a U-2 though. Shit would be cash.</br>  <br>Sit on my ass all day for that stupid bicycle plane? fuck yeah. we have some guys that were u-2s. they say its easy as fuck. like being a f-35 crew chief. you just plug in your laptop and refuel it.</br>  <br>I've heard there is another opening to cross train to F-35s coming up soon.</br>  Family fap thread. Post em!! Pic related: aunt.  <br>Here.</br>  This has to be one of the most retarded threads I've ever seen.  <br>How is that relevant to anything?</br>  So I recently started binge watching Pax DnD I was born in 92 never had enough friends that played DnD never played I got a gaming manual for this game called rifts or something never played. Does anyone play or know anything about the game?<br>kik xHydroDankx<br>if you don't mind answering any questions or just share some stories about your favorite games.</br></br>  <br>Yeah Perkins is the guy who does DM for pax east right?</br>  <br>it might work. but id rather play with people in person. id recommend stoping by your local comic book store or game shop and asking if they have any meet up dates, thats how i got into this.<br><br>my buddy was at a magic tournament and we were going out after that. so i was hanging out reading comics. looked at some DnD books and the worker said they meet up on Wednesday. or you could reach out to facebook. join some groups that are local.</br></br></br>    no porn webm thread? porn webm thread  <br>Ned mire of her. Anyone know who she is? Where to find more?</br>    <br><br><br><br>Hello my friends. It's Anabelle Pync</br></br></br></br>  General Stoner thread also wondering on some growing tips thinking about planting some bush just would like to know details   <br><br>how about sunlight and everything, Like i have never grown any before, so its all new to me</br></br>  <br>It may work, when they get big they definitely need a lot of water. I guess it will depend on the soil and the climate.<br>Moist is really all they need, to soil does not need to be totally wet or saturated at any time, constantly moist is actually the best.</br></br>  <br><br>Polymers don't work really well in my opinion, they hold water well but dont release it at a high enough rate. However they still do help</br></br></blockquote>]
