For me. Because I like Peridot. And vaginas. And anal.</br></br>  <br>Ruby and Sapphire are the main reason this show spiked in popularity last year.</br>  <br>i also thought this, i was like "ehhhh whut, thats a little graphic for a kids show but i can fap to this"<br><br>they were basically necking, which is all nice and good in my book. if people wanna draw two alien psuedo-girls fucking then by all means, draw away.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah its a trend nowadays, soon pedos will find aceptation as homosexuals do. That said im not against the queer love, just flowing with it...</br>  <br><br><br>Alright, alright.<br><br>I guess I can sympathize with your lust for gem cyborgs.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>don't need trips, already got quads mein neggar</br></br></br>  <br>great<br><br>do you at least agree that that's not the plot to an episode of something worth investing 30 minutes in?</br></br></br>      <br>As a guy who grew up in a christian family, this is pretty all you can do.</br>    <br>to each their own anon,<br>some people get off on watching girls shit themselves, some people like cartoons that don't really make alot of sense.<br><br>why question it?</br></br></br></br>    <br>Like I said last thread, Lesbianism is a very risky step for a children's show, but inevitably, it makes the show more popular in both good and bad senses.</br>    is being forced to fuse considered rape in SU ?    <br>Genocide anyone. Its the only respectable thing to do at this point.</br>  <br>No point in questioning something that won't change, you know?</br>  <br>I believe that 11 minutes isn't enough time to be able to fully explore some deeper concepts and character developments<br>As for emotionally unstable space rocks being lie-raped to, 11 minutes is a good amount of time to kiss and make up</br></br>    <br>because cartoons that don't make sense have fans that i know and it aggravates me when those fans pester me to watch a stupid fucking cartoon about cartoon women teaching a small cartoon boy how to be a lesbian<br><br>I would just like some insight. What do you guys see in this?</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>this and last thread started in theory discussion and is slowing drifting into a rule 34,<br><br>thats why i always come back to /b/.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Except it is all tumblr bullshit.</br>  <br>Considering the material given behind fusing in the form of dialogue and dances.<br>I'd speculate it being similar to both rape and body snatching.</br></br>  <br>That's actually a pretty interesting question, Satan.<br><br>On the other can, is it even possible to force someone to fuse? Since an elaborate dance and teamwork is necessary.</br></br></br>    <br>ah, no, we promote casual conversation and discussion WHILST posting porn</br>  <br>It drifts back and forth.<br>Just trying to "liven" the place up.</br></br>    <br>The beauty of /b/.</br>    <br> being forced to fuse <br>I'd consider "forced fusion" parallel to rape<br>so far there's been no "forced fusion", however some heroes have reluctantly fused and other less important characters have been lied to in order to fuse</br></br></br>  <br>Pretty sure Jasper forced Lapis into fusion. . .</br>  <br><br>You guys don't post in many of the other threads on /b/, do you.</br></br>    <br>hahaha, "woman teaching a small cartoon boy how to be a lesbian" shit made me laugh,<br><br>the main character is very relatable, he struggles trying to figure out what he is and shows a good amount of emotion. <br><br> trying to find yourself out <br> lesbianism <br><br>you won, you figured it out. +1 internet<br>as for understanding it, that episode you explained isn't a very good one to start on, but you would have to keep an open mind.<br><br>some people like to just dive into a story without questioning it, some people like to be challenged. its all a matter of perspective.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>poe's law is strong whitin this post</br>  <br>i've seen the creator actively fight off tumblr bait at cons and AMAs on reddit, i don't assosciate fandom with the work/creator.</br>  <br> What do you guys see in this <br> mfw randomly watching an episode before knowing what SU really was </br></br>    Lapis r34 please  <br>I post in a lot, actually. Near exclusively posted on /b/ before visiting /co/ during the last stevenbomb</br>  <br>Lapis went along with it fully aware of what she'd do.<br>This also proves that you can fake emotions for the purpose of fusing, as Pearl stated you need a "positive" bond.</br></br>  <br>Well if you rape someone he/she doesn't agree with that. If you force someone to fuse, they agree to fuse although they don't want to.</br>        <br>for the record, the first episode I watched was about making waffles. good hook</br>  <br> some people like to just dive into a story without questioning it <br>That means autism.</br></br>  <br> Cluster </br>  <br><br>yeah the hook was shit. sorry, like i said, perspective and personal taste.</br></br>  Last one.<br><br>That's all the Peridot smut I have.</br></br>  <br>Paz Ortega, vibes.</br>  <br>MLP isn't a bad show too.<br>BUT IS FOR FUCKING CHIKLDREN.<br>Just like this show there is nothing that can make you think or learn somethink important out of it.or at least make you laugh for christ's sake.</br></br></br>  <br>and i've been saying all night, the fanbase is full of auts baby boi.<br><br>and if i'm labeled as an autist for liking a cartoon at 21, then so be it. some fucking losers on 4chan think im shit.<br><br>oopsy doospy don't really care.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yes, please understand, I was being completely sarcastic. I truly meant 2/10 made me post. I can't stand this fucking show</br>  <br>you make a good point and this anon<br><br>makes a good point<br><br>I'll concede that Malachite was forced, but only because Lapis had the plan to trap Jasper and save the CG<br>The Cluster, however, is more akin to rape. Fusing the gem shards without their consent.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Good work.</br>  <br>i recall laughing or at least chuckling at some parts, and some people would take the "subtle lesbianism" as a learning experience, introducing to people as "normal"</br>  <br>You're an autist,we all agree on that.<br>BUT DON'T FUCKING MAKE THREADS TO SPREAD THE CANCER</br></br>  <br>With gay marriage being legal?<br>I give the normalization process 20 years.</br></br>  <br>again, OOPSY DOOPSY dont fucking care. enjoy your rest of your life fag.</br>  <br>while I do want to stay on a nice discussion of Steven Universe, Lapis r34...<br>1/7</br></br>  <br>But being a faggot or a lesbian isn't normal you mongoloid.</br>  <br>It's people like you that ruin /b/.<br>Go back to tumblr you fucking rape victim.</br></br>  <br>matter of perspective baby boy,<br>also mongoloid? hahahahahahahahahahahah cute.</br></br>  <br>lol someone sounds mad baby boi, i've never been on tumblr and don't start on planning.<br><br>does the idea of someone liking a cartoon you don't like make you shit the bed baby boi?</br></br></br>  <br>Not that guy, but he's technically right.<br><br>Homosexuality is pretty rare and therefore outside the norm.</br></br></br>   all these flavors, and you choose to be salty   <br>Yeah, like I said, the public view is gonna change because of nonsensical reasons one way or the other.<br>Nothing I can do to change it.</br></br>  <br>meh, i'm not gay so i don't care, but like i said and this is how i see it,<br>its a matter of perspective. do whatever the fuck you want, just dn't fuck with me.... and don't fuck me....</br></br>  2/7  <br><br>Stfu or take this somewhere else.</br></br>  <br> newfags trying to be edgy <br> summer </br></br>  <br>Sorry I don't watch this show.

Well i just got into MTG and i need help building a deck. I started off by buying the Dragons of Tarkir fat pack.  <br><br>just buy singles, if you have a store they will probably give you free land. I never saw the point of fat packs.</br></br>  <br>Kek <br><br>Retard doesn't like it because it's too complicated for his tiny mind. MTG is the reason games like Pokemon and Yu-Gi-oh exist. It set the bases for so many games.</br></br></br>  <br>Fat packs weren't too bad. Cheaper than buying the equivalent amount of boosters also loafs of free land and good storage for cards. <br><br>Also I'm pretty sure you generally get better cards in fat packs</br></br></br>  What is wrong with chinks bros? <br>I feel like I'm the only one who is creeped out by chink people's lack of emotion and moral values. They could have no soul maybe?<br>The only thing they seem to love is torturing their food before they eat it.<br>They walk on by people in distress, they toture their children in education, they execute each other over drugs and small offences, force abortions and have a weird as fuck porn industry, full of rape a peado fantasies. <br><br>I'm convinced these people have a separate hell and are not part of the human species.<br>Also all that Bruce lee shit is gay as fuck and would be totally useless when fighting irl...</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Yes  100% agree except about Bruce Lee. Any martial art will improve a novice's fighting skill.  <br>I bet animals think we have no emotion..<br><br>We actually think before doing things (sometimes)<br>They mostly act purely on instincts and do whatever emotions tell them to do...<br><br>So they look at people as emotionless maybe..<br>So maybe chinks are actually so evolved that we are like animals to them</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Agree especially the food part<br>Saw a vid on here the other day of asians eating live frogs as sushimi, fucking twisted gooks</br>  It's just a cultural difference. If you're indoctrinated into a cannibalistic society you'll see eating humans as the norm. To everyone else it's fucked up though. There isn't anything objectively wrong with them. Except all of their womentire are hideous, that's objective.  <br>They're realistic. They don't waste time believing in a fake god. They know their mortality. They know their time here is short. They simply want to get things done while they're here.<br><br>I'm American.</br></br></br>  <br> asians dont have gods <br><br>the fuck kind of education did you grow up on retard?</br></br></br>  <br>They don't base their existence around them, faggot<br><br>nice try at attempting to appear intelligent, though.</br></br></br>  I grew up and live in San Francisco. There's definitely something wrong with that culture. I mean, it works for them so whatever. But they're the world's largest ant farm. Individuals don't matter. They put tons of pressure on their kids to succeed and make a lot of money but very little emphasis on having a good heart or being a spiritual human being. Only the Tibetans are enlightened and the Chinese are super mean to them. Plus the spit everywhere, push and shove and don't queue up in lines. They gamble, smoke, cheat, are always looking for advantage, etc. Not a great culture overall. There are definitely things about them that I also admire. The kids are generally far more polite and less violent than some other groups we're all aware of. They're disciplined, save their money, encourage education and respecting elders etc. But they also rove around in gangs late night chewing with their mouths open at various noodle and boba tea joints, smoking cigarettes, racing around in Hondas pretending that they're corvettes, walking shitty little dogs, I could go and on. Also they paint the houses here fucked up colors for luck or whatever. All this being said, it's better to have Chinese neighbors than black neighbors.  <br>Sounds like a bunch of fedora tippers</br>  <br>At least you know the nigger is there to steal your hard earned valuables, a chink could have a lifesize custom waifu of you that he jerks off onto...</br>  all i see are fags jelly that asians get shit done and they dont <br>P.S. Bruce Lee would kick all of your asses</br>   They walk on by people in distress <br>In China, if you help someone in distress, they turn around and sue you, that's why!<br><br> they toture their children in education <br>True, some asian countries<br><br> they execute each other over drugs and small offences <br>Drug dealing or possession of amounts that are not for personal use<br><br> force abortions <br>Explain?<br><br> weird as fuck porn industry, full of rape a peado fantasies <br>Japanese you mean<br><br>  very little emphasis on having a good heart or being a spiritual human being <br>China was a third world country until recent times</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>As a Jew I can't relate to this comment. Because no one gets shit done like us. But I see your point. As I said, Asians tend to have pretty bitchin work ethics.</br>  <br>The Jews get shit done but it doesn't mean they won't burn in hell...</br>  <br>We don't believe in hell. Well, there's hell on Earth. Anyone who has been to Fresno can attest to that.</br>  <br>China is still pretty much a third-world country. There are places so polluted that their life expectancy is cut like 20 or 30 years</br>  <br>Daaaaaaaaaannnnngggggg. Check em</br>  <br>Agreed, they also live under communist rule from the forties, along with famines, state control, injustice, so they don't know any better</br>  <br>They definitely don't know any better. My Chinese friend Alan says half the people that emigrate over here were basically living in little villages in the middle of nowhere until a decade ago. It's still a huge peasant population full of superstition and simple living.</br>  thats cause they got dem priorities in check unlike white people amirite?  <br>I want to believe that every human reaches an age where they understand what is right and wrong, immoral an moral, but chinks crush this hope<br>It's easier to think of them as alien creatures.</br></br>  <br>Decline of Western Civilization down to 'tough guy' rapping and the film 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High'</br>  ITT: we make make statements and state opinions about groups of people we've spent very little time with  <br> China <br> communist <br><br>kek</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah maybe you've spent too much time chilling with Asian American chinks who are the only ones with any humanity instilled into them. It's not wrong to stereotype and group the bad ones together when they are in the tens of millions either, political correctness can't save the 10 year old chink workers and it won't save you</br>  <br> Asian American chinks <br><br> implying i'm American or what to part of your brainwashed, propaganda fuelled, police oppression Orwellian nightmare of a country </br></br></br>  <br>Sorry, westernised chinks to be exact</br>  Probably easy for you to say Bruce's fighting style wouldnt do anything behind your compooter.
