Okay, rule 34, see if you can handle this:<br><br>A chick getting fucked in the ass...<br><br>AS SHE GIVES BIRTH!<br><br>Does it exist?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i agree</br>  <br>have seen some fakes</br>  bump  <br>Physically impossible. Read a book, dumbass.</br>  <br><br>How is it impossible to stick a dick up her ass while she craps out a kid? Please explain; I'm genuinely curious.</br></br>    Women and their bastard baskets. So cute.     yfw if you fuck a girl early enough in pregnancy your seed becomes part of the growing baby. Kicker is that it can change the genetics completely yet its barely detectable. <br> yfw the white girls that spit out black babies to white men and DNA says 98.2% accurate match and its a "genetic throwback from tens of thousands of years ago" are bullshit. </br>  Love giving it to my pregnant wife. There's a sweet spot in the pregnancy when she's super horny and just wants to get plowed. Woke her up one night doing some fondling and she ended up begging me to give it to her harder and harder. Hottest sex yet, get hard still thinking about it. Of course there's also the after pregnancy phase when you get blue-balled for weeks watching those breasts fill with milk but she wants nothing to do with your cock.  <br><br>jewish propaganda fuck off</br></br>    <br><br>Have you never DP'd a girl? Shit's tight. Now imagine instead of a cock in the front cunt, it's a baby's head. Shit's impossible.</br></br>  <br>did she do anal?</br>    <br><br>Dude, I've seen a chick get fucked in the ass with three fists in her vag at the same time. Absurdly tight? Yes. Impossible? No.<br><br>If there's anything the Internet has taught me, it's that anything is possible.<br><br>I've never DPed a chick, but I have fucked my wife in her ass wih a huge dildo in her pussy.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Who is this?</br>      what about the kids... imagine them seeing this      why is this fetish not more popular??????  <br>No idea anon. An attractive woman becomes 10x hotter to me when she is pregnant. I love drinking breast milk.</br>  <br><br> three fists in her vag <br><br>doubt.jpg</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Shit is not just possible, it's probable, literally. Women regularly shit themselves while giving birth. If shit can come out, a dick can go in.</br></br>  <br>the thing is that even rather unattractive women suddenly become extremely hot though you exactly know they weren't without pregnancy</br>    <br>I wouldn't go that far. An average or even slightly below average woman looks better but when I see an ugly preggo, I feel ill.</br>  <br><br>Dude, there's one vid out there of some German guy (of course) taking *four* fists in his *ass* at the same time. The vagina is larger and more flexible than the anus. Trust me, it's been done.</br></br>    How does one go about hooking up with a pregnant woman? Maybe this is the wrong place to ask :/      <br><br> If something is pushed out by pressure, you can obviously stick something in there. <br><br>Are you even listening to yourself?</br></br></br></br>  <br>this</br>    gf is pregnant. Her tits are fucking a-ma-zing !<br><br>Her belly isn't too fat for the moment so she's smoking hot like this.</br></br>  Wife is currently pregnant. Thought I would be put off by it... Her massive hard nipples... Plump pussy and firm belly... it's amazing.  <br>Lots of single (about to be) moms on Craigslist. You're most likely going to have to give up some $ but it's worth it.</br>  <br><br> The vagina is larger and more flexible than the anus <br><br>Nope.avi. The vaginal opening is limited by the pelvis, the anus isn't, it's why babies are born so retardedly underdeveloped. If they were born later it would most likely kill the child and the mother because the little cunts head would be too big.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I really want to be around when that kid in her belly is seventeen years old and comes across that picture.<br><br>The Internet never forgets.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Absolutely not, there are no children involved.</br>  <br><br>The point being that if the anus can dilate sufficiently to expel faeces, it can also admit a foreign object. This isn't neurosurgery here.</br></br>  <br>Snicker.</br>  <br>Thought exactly the same</br>  <br>Your best bet would be websites like www.abfsingles.net and anrdating.com. I know that at least a couple of pregnant women have registered on there to find a guy who would like to suck their breasts.</br>  <br><br> Dilate sufficiently to expel feces. <br> I can push playdough through a small hole, therefore I could put my dick in that hole <br><br>You do realise that shit is squishy, right? that it can be deformed by pressure and come out in a less than pristine state?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The pelvis constitutes a limit, yes, but that does not mean that the vagina is necessarily less flexible than the anus. It is evolved for birthing, after all.</br></br>  <br>I fingered her ass some afterwards but didn't actually fuck her ass while pregnant. Love giving her some anal lovin though.</br>  Any pregnant creampie vids/webms?    <br><br>You do realise that some guys have small dicks?

You meat-eating faggots contribute to more animal cruelty than the piece of shit dentist. Go ahead and pay someone else to ruthlessly slit the throat of a fully conscious, unaenethesized animal and claim yourself at the "top of the food chain". Can't even do the deed yourselves. Calling yourselves "carnivores". If you're a fucking carnivore where are your carnivorous teeth and your claws used to hunt down your prey you worthless bipedal asshammers. Let's stick you unarmed and naked in a pen with a 300 pound pissed off pig and see who is "top of the food chain". Hypocritical fucktards.  <br>You do have to supplement though, I guarantee it.</br>  <br>I ate halal meat yesterday. Don't even know what the fuck that is but they just tell me it's halal at that place</br>  <br><br>I'm just going to say that the dentist, who causes pain for a living, paid 55 large to poach a lion. It's not surprising.<br><br>Vegan is the future of human kind. We will eventually stop causing needless torture to those animals less intelligent than us. We do not need meat to survive. You can eat a healthy, delicious, balanced plant based diet. <br><br>Those of you who are defiant, you simply aren't informed. You've grown up in a culture that has glorified the atrocity, and no one can tell you a god damned thing.<br><br>Your grandchildren however, will look back at our barbaric ways, as we do those people in 18th century london who would light cats on fire for "fun".<br><br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/631652353#p631661298">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  /b/, post that ONE song that you can't stop listening to right now.  <br>That girl is a terrible rapper</br>  <br>me too but i think people are trolling with the heavy metal shit</br>  <br>Knocking on heavens door - Guns &amp; Roses.</br>  Easiest way to get gay/shit pics right here.  <br>kek ok</br>  <br>Thanks m8!</br>  <br>anything else m8?</br></blockquote>]
