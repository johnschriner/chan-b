It's funny, and informative. He's making some good points. We are catering to the 1% of fuckwits which is sad, and unfortunately if guns are banned the bad and the crazies will still obtain them in one form or another.</br>  <br>That and the fact that the government makes money off of people dying etc. Ayy lmao u dumb amerifags think your government is protecting you but they don't give a shit about you as long as they are in power, have money, and the people are complacent enough to control</br>  <br>what kind of world do you live in where you're constantly worried about your house being broken into and your family/gf raped? Sounds like Iraq or Afghanistan.</br>   Guns murdered   <br>however it would make it harder and more expensive for them to attain</br>  <br>That means the US still has a gun death ratio 8 times that of Canada though.</br>  <br>USA 0.00004 (4 0s) <br>Canada 0.000005 (5 0s)<br>Canada 0.000001 (5 0s)<br>So amerifags kill ~10x as many amerifags than hosers kill hosers or nazis kill nazis.<br><br>So the real trend is amerifags can't be trusted with guns. tbh I wouldn't trust them with scissors.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe not Russian mob bosses. But it just may stop Darnel from getting a pistol when he can't afford to eat out 2 nights a month. Illegal weapons quickly become very pricey when you can't get a 50-cal from Toys-R-Us</br>  LOL @ Guns did this!  <br>"No logical defense"? Seriously, you want to use that line in our nation's (USA's) line of politics? You ever follow the line of thinking of those who make laws, speak and even make policies here in the USA? You have the right wing who are Anti-Christ in the biblical way recruiting Jesus Christ followers to their side through capitalism and you have the left wing... everyone else as having the least power over the USA because they speak the mind of everyone... but most are not registered to vote because most hate the government and the elite (although most want to be them).</br>  <br>America. Where fuckwits roam free. Lets give niggers free money for their 11 kids, they buy an illegal firearm, kill a family of four for their money so he can fund his dream of owning a "tap house". <br><br>Our government is fucked and we know it, some cunts don't which is irritating as they are the ones that's running us into the found.<br><br>Not true. I actually went to Australia for a year after high school just to explore the world and even with exchange rates i could still purchase a .45 for under $1000 USD. Its easy no matter where you are.<br><br>Fuck off canada is a bunch of french pussies. "oh sorry didnt mean to look at ya sur have good day" It shows nothing. Crime rates in america are high due to many things, one is like i said government funding those in poverty. <br><br>Which country do you live in by chance? I'm sure your police force must be absolutely amazing, much like ours! There are more cops killing civilians now than ever. Months ago we passed last years cop kill count and we are on the verge of tripling it. So yes, fuck you and your pussy country.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Am I the only Australian that read this thread, and was surprised that there was actually 35 guns here??  <br>Its too fucking early to argue and spellcheck. Eat my proud American dick</br>  <br>Or you know... just avoid the niggerish areas, then you should be all goods</br>  <br>So much this. Lived in one of the "worst" areas of a city in AU, literally never feared anything enough to need a gun in my life. The idea of every "lawful citizen" having the power to kill scares me a fuck load more than ever getting broken into and gang rapped.</br>  Also, just saying this because i know it's true, im not going to change any of your minds. I know this. But open your eyes.<br><br>Great argument. Don't get shot by avoiding poor areas. Which, coincidentally, is being made more popular by the democratic government with welfare, food stamps, housing, etc. They are controlling us more than ever because people dont want to work for their money. Just my 2 cents worth here. Take it how you will.<br><br><br><br>Dont forget how your country came to be. It was literally founded by criminals. What's your argument now</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>like if you agree</br>  <br> 'knows' It's b8 <br> takes the b8 like a whore. </br></br>  <br>1) Guess<br>2) No it's corrupt as shit (clue #1)<br>3) Data pls<br>4) Data pls<br>5) You're proud to be an americunt? Wow. You shouldn't be.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>for a country founded by criminals there sure isnt a lot of gun deaths. Perhaps its our sane weapons laws?<br><br>Also seriously. You havnt got a pistol strapped to your leg 24/7. If niggers bust through your door (which statistically, should be pretty rare) i doubt youll have time to whip put your piece before you and your family are beaten to death</br></br></br>  I'm Canadian and I have a few guns I use for hunting deer/coyote. I don't know how easy it is for Americans but here I had to go through a paper/hands-on course, criminal background check, the whole 9. Would many Americans be against this process? If so why?  <br>Not trying to sound all "poor me" but when i was younger i was mugged with my family in a major city. (Pittsburgh) Three men with knives demanded everything we had, clothing too. A passerby saw it, and he was a concealed carry permit holder, he pulled out his gun and the men fled. Had it not been for him with his GUN i may not be alive today. So yes i am a supporter of the second amendment right.<br><br>We do have background checks, for responsible owners. Criminals get them from the black market, which will never be stopped.</br></br></br>  <br> in one year <br><br>What year? The year could be 1999 and have nothing to do with nowadays?<br><br>If the year is even figured out, want to give us some statistics on how many people were killed by stabbings?<br><br>The UK has gun laws, and people get shanked, stabbed, and murdered all the time. Gun prohibition won't solve violence, it just brings a different kind of fuck up.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I do know its bait, however just because Australia was dumb enough to eliminate guns doesn't mean he should shove his gunless dick down our throats.</br>  <br>im sorry for your experience. However, i do feel safer knowing that the majority of this populace does not have easy access to firearms. <br>Here, the only people that feel the need to arm themselves are criminals, and that's to combat other criminals.<br><br>There hasn't been a major firearm related massacre in Australia since Port Arthur (1996), and that's entirely due to the government stepping in and passing sensible weapons licensing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If they're getting them on the black market why do them libs want new gun laws? Or are they just plain retarded</br>   This entire thread <br><br> "Im european look how progressive i am jajajajajajaja xD" </br></br>  Hahahha fucking rednecks... I can walk around any area in city I live in ... In Australia... And not even have to carry a knife for protection. Only protection I carry is a condom... Just in case I run into a scared little american that feels lost with out his gun. Bunch of fags  <br>I do understand those statistics. Do you ever go shooting? Like on a firing range? It is genuinely fun. Its not completely about home defence and self protection, but it is a large part of it. Hunting can also be put in the category of fun, whether for sport or for sustenance.<br><br>kek</br></br></br>  <br>You're a fucking idiot, we don't have the massive nigger problem in Aus or as much mental illness. <br><br>Shall not be infringed Ameribros</br></br></br>  So many Australians giving that americunt shit in this thread<br><br>lovingit.jpg</br></br>  <br>I was in the ADF for 4 years out of school and loved going to the range. I have nothing against firearms or legitimate firearm owners. <br><br>I think our weapons laws arn't perfect, but they do seem to do what was intended : keep weapons out of the hands of the crazies.</br></br></br>  <br>Much love Ausbro.<br><br>And that's the sole problem, I do truly believe that every single gun owner in america should be required to take a mandatory psych evaluation to see if they are competent to own a firearm. Sure this wont stop all criminals, but at least it will cut back on mentally ill psychos from being able to purchase one</br></br></br>  <br>No they don't <br><br>Perhaps you remember the bikie war 2 years ago? Every major city had fatal shoot outs except Perth and Darwin<br><br>Or how about the lindt cafe? How did that crazy get a gun?<br><br>The fact is gun laws only prevent law abiding citizens from getting guns, the exact people who should get guns</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe try banning/removing dindus instead, I bet the murder rate would plummet.</br>  <br>You have a fellow Aus on our side. Rekt cunt</br>  <br>right because all of those involved massacres...<br><br>I lived on the Gold Coast during the 'bikie wars' and the most violent event (royal pines shootout) didnt even kill anyone. <br><br>The Lindt cafee ordeal was completely blown out of proportion by the media. Only 2 people died and 1 was shot by the cops.<br><br>check your facts m8</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>No facts to be checked, There were murders, with guns, from a country with a gun ban. Need i say more?</br>  I recommend watching these<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=9pO<wbr>iOhxujsE</wbr>  [ ]<br>There is three in the series</br></br>  <br>Sounds like how it is here in Ausfailia, fucking retarded. There is a few minor political parties/lobbyists pushing to have it changed so you can lawfully defend your self when threatened on your own property, but they just don't have the numbers/power to get anything done.</br>    Wow you think guns shouldn't be banned? OKAY let me get this straight: if there was no guns; so many people would still be alive. Fuckin guitarist Darrell Dimebag died by someone bringing a gun to his concert and shooting him!<br><br>So if you want to kill someone it is more fuckin personal rather than just pulling a fuckin trigger at them and BOOM they are dead without you thinking if you "should" kill them or not.<br><br>1 second it takes to kill someone with a gun, more than a minute to strangle someone.. btw as for being in army/military thats a different story..<br><br>So bad people won't have guns/good people won't have guns. Either side will have to accept the consequences for their actions than using a 1 second killing thing.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I stand by my original statement.<br><br>Crims use guns to kill crims. That happenes everywhere, regardless of firearm laws. <br><br>Australia hasnt had a massacre since Port Arthur due to sensible weapons licensing.<br><br>Anyone that says different is a peanut and belongs in the 'should not be allowed to own a gun' category.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A fellow Aus also can't do basic maths? There's a fucking surprise.<br><br>Go finish elementary school retard.</br></br></br>  <br>Proly because we know all to well in Australia how well gun control works. Thanks Howard, you stupid cunt, for wasting all that tax payer money on useless buybacks that did nothing to quell crime.<br><br>Sure is nice to be constantly shit on by the media and law enforcement for being a law abiding gun owner, meanwhile in Perth, criminals just make their own fully automatic sub-machine guns not giving a fuck about legislation. Criminals gonna criminal.</br></br></br>  i think trying to remove guns from Americans is not a great idea. I don't understand the culture or how dangerous and easy it is to be killed over there, so I can't really say, but I would still think that minimalising the guns people actually have access to would help somewhat. Have a sidearm for protection, sure, but I don't see the need for semi-automatic assault weapons and the like. That's just my perspective. Frankly, I don't give a shit if the law changes or not.  <br> muh feelings <br> I'm scared <br><br>This is the basis of all leftist policy.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Only 2 people died  <br><br>the one that was shot by the gunman was the only one who tried to do anything to stop him the other was shot by the cops and you're saying it's a good system<br><br>bunch of pussies in this country <br><br>Also Pt. Arthur was a psyop</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>lol<br>  You: "did nothing" <br>  OP: 35 gun deaths / year </br></br></br>  Stupid Murican trying to hold his 2 hot dogs: "The gun statistics of USA are a lie, much less people have died then they say!"<br><br>You seem to ignore the Australian gun statistics, with how little people have died and do die every every year compared to America.<br><br>Anyway governments do want to minimize population control anyway..</br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope you get the chance one day to be a hero. Im sure many people will mourn your death.<br><br> Port Arthur was a psyop <br><br>Tinfoil hat detected.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You've made no logical defense for changing gun laws, you british piece of shit.</br>  <br>The majority of gun crime is done with handguns, you just bought into the "scary assault rifle" propaganda</br>  <br>You nigger can't count. Merica still has 8 times higher gun death ration than canada. Faggot.</br>  <br>How many people is "many people" though? By that definition two is many people. We are both, believe it or not, on the same side. (Keep guns out of the hands of crazies)<br><br>Exactly, and look at our pops. We have a much higher population, therefore it would be counter productive to rid of guns.<br>Unrelated, the captcha's with the fucking street signs are really shafting me</br></br></br></br>  <br>Again, look at the population difference.<br>MORE FUCKING STREET SIGNS FUCK</br></br>  <br>So what?<br>You ignore your own numbers. Its normal that more population means more gun-deaths. However, Murrica's gun-deaths are abnormally higher than the average, PER FUCKING CITIZEN you nigger. Stop baiting me you whore.</br></br>  Guns should be legal because I should be able to collect anything I want.<br> I have a collection of alcohol bottles.  <br> I could break them on peoples' heads then stab them with the shattered remains <br>Whether or not it's a "deadly weapon" isn't the issue.<br>it is absolutely wrong to take my guns from me; I would never use them to kill, just as I would never use my bottles to kill.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Being this retarded must be painful.</br>  <br>I was trying to appeal to the masses of 'sensible' Americans but I guess there's no safe fence to sit on in a gun debate. I like Australia's gun laws whereby rifles and shotguns, large and easily detectable and identifiable weapons, are the easiest to get and handguns are strictly for use by security guards and police.</br>  <br>Its genuinely not b8 m8. If canada had a pop of 320mil then your rates would be exactly the same. No argument needed. Its society now you cannot stop it</br>  <br>Why don't you actually look into it. <br><br>The only 2 police officers within responding range were called away to investigate "jars of heroin" on a beach less than hour before the shooting occured.<br><br>Did Bryant set that up?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They're not wrong. <br>STREET.

Just my opinion.</br>  <br>Re: point #3<br><br>Better recheck that maths buddy<br><br/></br></br></br></br>  Since assault weapons are such a huge problem in america why don't we do this instead!<br><br>The fingerprinting smart guns are a good first step, but they still leave open a lot of room for abusive by an authorized user. I propose that guns should not only need biometric unlocks, but also that the user should need to call up 911 and have the operator remotely unlock the gun for use it they concur the user is in a legimate life threatening situation. Also, mandating cameras attached to all weapons, especially concealed carry ones, which record and transmit to a cloud storage.<br><br>Guns should also have a feature whereby they can only fire if they are pressed against the target. This will prevent mentally unstable men from killing children at long range.<br><br>Magazine limits are common sense, but also the first round loaded should be required to be a warning foam round. The foam rounds used by police forces are effective, but still require training to use safely, so the mandatory civilian foam rounds should be much less dense, and not designed to inflict pain, but to make sure an attacker 100% knows there is a gun present and give them a chance to flee- thus reducing overall gun deaths.<br><br>We should should also license free thought and speech. We can control the spread of bad ideas by putting biometric scanners on all computers, cell phones, video game consoles so that certain ideologies cant spread.<br><br>Obviously dangerous speech and ideas are easily concealed in various ways, so all information about our populace will be public record and searchable.<br><br>All people should have an override put into their voice box so that they can have their voices muted if they start saying something potentially hurtful or expressing dangerous ideas.<br><br>Help me come up with some progressive ideas that will help me target the greatest killer of this or any other century.

It's becasue of the Johnnys that we need laws in the first place... Society is only as good as it's weakest link  If we didn't have so many blacks and Mexicans there would be even fewer gun deaths. White america isn't the problem, white america needs to be armed against these minority pieces of shit.  Yeah white america needs to shoot up churches and cinemas... Your point?  <br>exactly</br>  If you didn't have so many readily available guns in the population... You would not have such a big problem... But hey... I can't see how american logic works.  <br>so true<br><br>Only the police and military should have cars</br></br></br>  <br>If that's what you think I am saying then you don't understand what gun control is in the first place you knobjockey</br>  <br>not in this statistic: the number of lives saved or defended with weapons.</br>  <br>no your argument is flimsy. you lack the basic understanding of human nature.</br>  Hahaha... Nice anon  <br>A rose, by any other name, would throw the country from a capitalist utopia into a socialist hellhole where feelings have value.</br>  Why the fuck does anyone have the right to tell me what to do? If we got rid of the niggers and low intelligence people, brought back eugenics, the world-and humanity could be amazing.  If guns are outlawed only outlaws will have guns.  <br>9484 of which 9000 were nigger ghetto gangbangers. <br>Pretty decent considering it's the only country where you can actually own a gun and defend yourself with it. <br>I'd rather see an increase in gun related incidents than take away the ability of law abiding citizens to defend themselves with guns. <br>Laws have consequences, yes there are trade always offs, but hey, who gives a shit about reality, when there's a nirvana fallacy to peddle.</br></br></br></br>  I still don't see the flimsy argument... U.S.a ranks up there with shittiest 3rd world countries with gun deaths... So either the us is a 3rd world shithole or your people need to sort out gun control  <br> spot the edgy kid </br>    <br>Newsflash. The government does not care about you. The government is comprised of individuas making decisions to improve their specific welfare.<br> Muh conspiracies <br>It far more logical that people are dumb, and are not in league with one another.

Yet you lot do not see this even when saying "I need a gun to protect my self and my wife from the rapist blacks and spics". Seems the blacks and spics could do a great job on fucking the us. No need for the euros  <br>Wrong on EVERY count.<br>But you won't factor that in, will you?<br>Obama wants to kill your grandparents!!</br></br></br>  <br>So it's up to individuals to protect themselves<br><br>therefore they the right to arms<br><br>checkmate gun-control faggots</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gram gram should have worked harder in her lifetime instead of pushing out 8 kids.<br>Or married better.<br>It is your family's fault.

But you don' NEED a gun to protect yourself. It's just the best damn hand-held weapon in existence for self defense. Let's outlaw them, though. Hundreds of years of tech should be disregarded.</br>  Yeah just give everyone a gun to protect em selves... That will fix it   tfw anti-gunners always "forget" about Switzerland.   <br>bullshit<br>Australia doesn't have that much people killed by guns<br>The only thing we have to worry about here are sharks.</br></br></br>  <br>In retrospect I'm thinking it would be better if the can said like "high octane" and looked like oil. Right now, to me, it looks like Europeans hate their own threads and drink the cum of an American exporter.</br>  <br>For civilians yes... But not for people who should actually need them to police and protect. Problem is now... Too many fukn guns in america... So they won't ever ban them for that reason</br>  <br>Yeah, for like two weeks the murder rate would skyrocket, but it would taper off once our lower class kills itself off.</br>  <br><br>Brainwashed amerifucks</br></br>  <br>That is logical thinking... But could solve all the problems if it wasn't for nutters with guns</br>  <br>This (object) is more lethal in the hands of an uneducated person than in the hands of an educated person, assuming they were sane.<br>This is true for a fucking pencil, let alone guns.<br>Just educate the populus.Too many dumb fucks think that killing gets them anything but enmity with their fellow man.</br></br></br>    <br>you just outed yourself faggot<br><br>only foreigners believe the "beseiged by deadly animals" meme</br></br></br>   implying only Americans own guns.   <br>True, there are higher-class psychos. I imagine they are either better controlled, or better at staying hidden. So I can't imagine anything left would be anything but isolated incidents that would occur, regardless of the weapon choice.</br>  <br>Idiots like OP don't understand:<br>Changing gun LAWS doesn't stop the gun violence being done by law-BREAKERS.<br><br>It's not rednecks killing people on the streets, and it sure as hell isn't anyone getting guns legally in the first place.</br></br></br></br>  <br>American murder statistics include gun-based suicides.

Shit's hilarious.<br>We have rehab here, but only of you're worth something.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The problem is niggers, if you removed nigger and latino gang violence from the US gun violence statistics the rate of violent crime would be on level with western European countries.</br>  Gun control is a farce. Laws like the 4473 allows a crazy person to lie on the form to get a gun because it for some reason puts the faith in the purchaser that they won't lie. Bad people exist believe it or not.<br><br>Gun free zones is another farce. Someone with the intent on murdering someone isn't gonna be deterred by a sign that will add a misdemeanor charge when they plan to commit multiple violent felonies. It puts people in a false sense of security and unarms the people with good intentions.</br></br>  <br> missed the point <br> missed the point <br> Correct, but how many times a day do you reference Pluto's size per day? (missed the point again) <br>It shouldn't be punishable. People are worthless. You just want them to be worth something. Your life is worth the exact same as a worms on the sidewalk.<br>So then outlaw bows, too? How about knives. Those are small and easily used.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah and they cant even maintain the gun laws they do have, so what makes people think more laws is gonna help?<br>Make it mandatory for doctors to report mental illness so people can't get guns when they are obviously crazy.<br>Oh wait, they were already meant to do that?<br>Oops, i guess hundreds of doctors just "forgot" to fill in the form.</br></br></br></br>  <br>So just because laws work in other parts of world, they somehow wont work here cause merica.<br> your point <br><br> rehab if worth something <br><br>Thats not a rehab, thats called buying freedom.<br><br>Rehabilitation for all is whats the point here.<br>And why are you even talking about it, if you dismissed Im changing topics.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I proposed two different scenarios woth you on the street, and you called them both a gun control zone. How is the control of guns at all relevant when each and every person could possess a gun at any moment, regardless of laws. You just want your false sense of security.</br>  <br>You're entitled scum. Where do you think this magic rehab zone gets it's resources? I'm sure everywhere on earth has an equal chance at the resources for rehab, and no conflict will ever arise again.</br>  <br>Also there's no such thing as freedom. Like infinity, there is no real application of the concept.

Are you aware how much of the world he saved?</br>  It's kind of a soylent green situation. Where the results of his actions were a net positive for the world, the actions themselves were on a level of immorality that trumped the good that he did.  <br>You have to understand that morality is based in a sort of social contract. "I won't do this, if you won't do it to me". Yes he reduced crime by a shit ton, but people will naturally be more concerned with the fact that he can kill anyone he wants without any real restriction</br>  <br>Please know the difference between "bad" and morally wrong. We define what's "bad" based on our laws. Personally I think the death sentence is an appropriate punishment for life-destroying crimes such as rape and murder. But the death-sentence is seen as "bad" because it's against the law (in most places). <br><br>I agree with you for the most part and think that Light was being morally correct in executing criminals (though murdering people for pettier crimes such as theft is a tad overkill in my opinion).<br><br>However it's against the law to kill people, so it's "bad". The creator of the manga portray Light as "bad" but made us question his morality. The police had to stop him because their job is to fight what's "bad".</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>nice trips</br>  Well, they make it easy to see him as evil when he starts to kill to punish even minor crimes. Before that I was thinking like OP. Anime would of been even better had they not made judging him so easy. Well, at least until the second half when the story went down the shitter with Melon or whatshisname.  <br>I think the Mello and Near stuff was quite nice. L's death was what stopped my friend from watching the anime, but personally I'm glad I sticked with it. <br><br>And throughout the series, I found judging Light quite easy, but at the end when he died, I didn't and still don't know how to feel about him as a character.</br></br></br>  <br>  <br> Yes they do when on a global scale you took down crime rates by 70%. Are you aware how much of the world he saved? <br><br>Well, the world would be much better without US /b/tards..</br></br></br></br>  In real life, governements kills 50 child to get one terrorist because they calculate this on a basic formula : if People saved MINUS Potential victims &gt; 0 then we saved people.<br><br>If someone like Light does it in real life, he would be executed. Governements do it every day.<br><br>Think about it.</br></br></br></br>  Thats like saying why was the empire evil for blowing up Alderaan. All the other systems fell in line because they were scared but crime was down 70% must be good right?  This anime is to old to be relivent  <br>How do you figure?</br>  <br>Don't mind it, it's just trying to be edgy.</br>  <br>Yeah I agree mostly. I didn't fancy the time we had with Mello and Near as much as my time with L, but Lights death was done really well and was a high point for me. Watching him break and go crazy after he gets shot once was just devastating to watch.</br>  <br> relivent <br> relivent <br> relivent <br><br>FUCKING LOL<br><br>an hero you uneducated shitstain</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>03 man that shits old news</br>  <br>It's old, but in what way is it dated now, but wasn't back in 2003?</br>  <br>this anime should have ended halfway through the second have was lame as fuck compared to the first half</br>  'took down crime rate'<br><br>he was the most prolific and large scale serial killer of all time lol, you could say he increased the crime rate</br></br>  <br>Tad upset are we?</br>  <br>Really? Got anything to back that up? <br><br>In Sydney Australia of December last year, a terrorist had about 15 people held hostage in a cafe. Government and police did shit all when they could have busted in there and lost a few of the 15 hostages. I don't think your little formula holds up, m8eo.</br></br></br>  <br> lol <br>Go back to tumblr.</br></br>  <br> is here</br>  <br>(n)edgy(n+2)me</br>  that's like saying that hitler did nothing wrong because he rid the world of 6 million dirty greedy jews and singlehandedly saved world economy  <br>plus we get this.</br>  <br>I think the series lost this holmes/moriarty feel after that point which is what I liked the most. On the other hand, it gained a punk-ass opening -- which fits to the perceived change in the series' .. feel, lacking a better word.</br>  <br>This shot was retarded. Especially once her starts slaughtering anyone and everyone close to sniffing him out. Fucking stupid</br>  <br>While they're on 4chan, they might want one of these.</br>  <br>Are you TRYING to get v&amp;?</br>  <br>I'm just trying to make these death note fans freak out. Like this guy<br>Death note isn't edgy enough for /b/<br><br>I actually love the show the mind games with L is mind blowing. <br><br>Just want to see if I could piss people before I go to work. <br><br>Have a good day Anons</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He went batshit later on and admitted that ending war and stopping people from killing each other would not be all he would force people into later on. I don't think his original idea was bad, it may be achieved through fear but if he stuck to his original plan, all people would have to do to live without fear is to simply not fucking kill anyone on purpose. How hard can that really be?<br>Too bad he was too young and immature when he found it, he fell for L's TV trap, if that wouldn't have happened, nobody could have ever found him<br><br>... Y-you fucking anime FAGGOT.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Look at cops in the USA today. By killing niggers they are keeping the crime rate down in the future. They sill lose their jobs for it.</br>  <br>worst moment in the show imo, light was supposed to be a genius and he falls for that like a bitch, never would have been caught otherwise</br>  <br>Says the btard who is probably worse.</br>  You want edgy anime? Go watch elfen lied or higurashi  He killed people that already were assassin's or that wouldn't hesitate to kill others had them a death note (except for a few, for his own survival) I'd rather have him doing god's work knowing that I can keep on tipping my own fedora in peace than not have him in the name of some morality that doesn't exists for everyone.  This is edgy AF  <br>Go read some leaked documents from Snowden/Wikileaks.<br>You'll learn a lot more things about your governement.</br></br>  <br>That fucking puppy scene. Watch that shit when I was 15 still see it in my mind</br>  <br>What are you talking about?</br>  <br>Same here bro<br> Had me crying</br></br>  <br>Oh and btw I was refering to drones "sniping" terrorists which is a colder situation. Human mistakes can be done with hostages.</br>  <br>Fuck!! now I'm currently re downloading it. You asshole anon I don't want to go through those emotions again.</br>  <br>Wait. Did you mean this puppy?</br>  <br><br>I was 25, not 15, still same effect.</br></br>  <br>Well yeh but you know the scene were it gets beat to fuck and what's her face goes ape shit crazy and merks everyone</br>  <br>Oh yeah. i read the manga and saw a select few scenes of the anime. Higurashi on the other hand i watched and read fully</br>  <br>And when she gets beat to fuck when the OP vector hoe... the feels really hit for me</br>  <br>I actually liked the anime better than the manga. The somewhat open end fits well, and the plot in the manga that goes beyond the anime is just.. wtf okamoto</br>  <br>Have to agree to that. But i really dont like gianax endings and that anime ending totally was. Well we cant have everything</br>  Some of you are saying there's a distinction between good and evil people. As if they're two separate breeds of dog.<br><br>Firstly anyone is capable of great good or great evil. Good and Evil entirely are subjective to the person who sees it, meaning their definition changes from person to person. <br><br>Only when there's a big enough force can that group label the definition of what Good and Evil is because they have the power to decide for others at that point *I.E* The Fucking Government.<br><br>Light having the death note made him above them because he had power even they didn't. He could slaughter anyone he wanted, thus was a god and thus was the Law.<br><br>Just because you don't agree with him, you still live by the rules of Good and Evil and how the bigger power controls their definitions. Light had that power, and could do as he pleased. He just got too cocky, but he wasn't wrong for doing what he did. But that's me, you think he's evil because you agree with the government and not with him and that's your own thoughts</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>True, although that bound and shot at with metal balls stuff was slightly worse imho.</br>  <br><br>Holy fuck I got eleven twice its gonna be a good fucking day.<br><br>I'm actually gonna miss my bus now.<br><br>Have a good one Anons if I remember il start a Elfin thread later so we can discuss if we had those power whid we merk.<br><br>Adios fellow b/astards</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Many people have tried to define good and evil in a sane way throughout history, and many say that ethics must not come from emotion. However, I think that ultimately there is no other way for us than to trust our gut feeling on what is right and what is wrong, since all rational definitions fail at the point where there is no god and life is ultimately pointless.</br>  <br>you too /b/ro. And I'm late now also.</br>  <br> mfw it exacerbated the rebel cause <br> dumbass </br></br>  This show got significantly more retarded half way through.  <br>Excuse me, if life is pointless to you that's OK. But seeing as "meaning" is something only the living can define, it doesnt makes sense to live without a point, unless you've already given up on living and is currently just rotting slowly because you declared yourself dead, in your mind</br>  <br>[spoiler]when L died it went to shit[/spoiler]</br>  <br>of course making the whole human population live in fear of any wrongdoing under your anonymous dictatorship is ethical as fuck</br>  <br>This, those with power tend to abuse it. By the end if the series we see light clearly willing to kill anyone who would get in his way, regardless of whether they were a criminal or not. That's why he needed to be stopped in the end.</br>  <br>Not going to try and convince you otherwise because that would be trying to make you miserable without a point.</br>  <br><br> When a typo triggers your period <br><br>ahahaha</br></br></br></br>  <br> this </br>  Because you're on 4chan on a Monday.
