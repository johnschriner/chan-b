There were lasers shooting everywhere. <br> Then out of the blue super cheese the wizard and the boy fired their ultimate weapon the destroyer beam. <br>Then they fired it at the stinky cheeses ship and he went flying into outer space never to be seen again. <br> Or maybe not. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dan the sandmans hand were crayons on the sand.</br>  Dan sounds like a fag  <br>if you don't know what to do there you shouldn't even go there</br>  op you cant just be a begging little bitch with nothing upfront to interest us, that being said<br><br>I was on a forum on some site in the deep web like 3 days ago, on a thread they were talking about the sickest videos on the web. I looked through it and found a video with no preview posted only with the comment "this will make you stop your search". I clicked the video and it opened to a dog with 3 of it's limbs cut off, covered in blood, and still alive. a barefooted women then proceeded to saw off it's last back leg as the dog whimpered and tried biting to no avail.</br></br>  <br>The sand spelled Dan and I ran.</br>  <br>I died as a consequence of deep Web viewing. But for some reason I resurrected 3 days later.</br>  <br>I ran from the sand that spelled Dan.</br>  <br>damn son that harsh</br>  <br>Nope. I have posted the hidden wiki uncensored and xplay.

It started out as me being cool because was able to access it or whatever when I showed my friends. Also to look at drug prices on different websites.<br>Anyhow, eventually I discovered the CP network. Well, as a horny teenage boy, I started visiting the chat rooms pretty often. Didn't say much, just watched pedos talk about different things. Sometimes there would be link dumps of HUNDREDS of different CP. I tried to resist from it knowing it was wrong... But I didn't hold out to long with my tendencies. I started visiting the rooms more often and getting to know more of the people on them, hell, even started talking to a few. I can't remember when... But one day I was talking and a guy asked me how old I was... I don't know why I didn't lie and tell him 49 or something , but I said 15. Welllllllllll he just so happened to have an interest in me... We talked some more.. And then I realized I had kind of a fetish (at the time) of maybe being handled by an older man... I ended up sending a few pictures to him (no face obviously) and he got off for the night. A few more people messaged me the next night... And the next... And so on. I probably sent hundreds of pics and some videos of me using a shitty webcam I had. I talked to some of the darkest and most hated people on the earth and didn't think twice about it.<br>It all came to an abrupt end when my PC died and I had to wait a couple months to get a new one. I had thought about it a lot and decided it wasn't best for me to be doing that (duh) and didn't install the next update to the deepweb browser... I have never been able to tell anyone this due to its nature, but it feels good to get it off my chest.</br></br>  <br>also read a bunch stories on Scream, Bitch! about people who were or were related to people who were murdered, raped, and kidnapped</br>  <br>are you a boy or a girl?</br>  <br>The only reason proxys worked was because it made the goons jump through a lot of hoops, IE asking the proxy provider for your info. Chinese proxys are probably where its at now, since they tell the US to fuck off in copywright cases, no problem with any thing else.</br>  Link to the uncensored wiki anyone?  <br>B8/10?</br>  <br>no it actually happened, although going over it i realize it is kinda written like b8</br>  <br>i talked to a dude at my school who did that exactly, do you feel anything about it? like guilt or something?</br>    <br>Congratulations your a faggot. Kindly bend over and take cock thanks</br>  Does anyone have any legitimate pictures?  <br>No, i mean, i gave them entertainment and i enjoyed it atleast a little. maybe they watched me do something instead of support other, much worse cp</br>  <br>Few minutes ago</br>  ERP thread, catgirl edition.   original neckbeards rping guy reporting in <br> YFW YOU FAP TO NECKBEARDS RPING <br> YFW YOU FAP TO NECKBEARDS RPING <br> YFW YOU FAP TO NECKBEARDS RPING <br><br>YFW YOU FAP TO NECKBEARDS RPING<br>YFW YOU FAP TO NECKBEARDS RPING<br>YFW YOU FAP TO NECKBEARDS RPING<br><br>YFW YOU FAP TO NECKBEARDS RPING<br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/629631250#p629635602">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>      s/fur one more time    <br>I wonder what your flavor is.<br>Could it be vocaroo?<br>Could it be sweet?
