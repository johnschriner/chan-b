Pretty good</br></br>  <br> Jack Torrance, The Shining.</br>  Emperor Leto II, not bad  <br>American Sniper - Chris Kyle<br>It's time to piss some liberals and be a bit of a douchbag.</br></br>  <br> talented writer <br>cool<br><br> serious anger issues <br>uhh<br><br> alcoholism <br>dang</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Parker, I would be alpha and bad ass as fuck. I recommend this to all noir, hard-boiled fans.  <br>An immortal wizard from the Raymond E Feist books. And not the 'Arry your an faggot kind, but one that battles inter dimensional beings and travels trough time traps to before the big bang. I'm ok with this</br>  Phileas Fogg  <br>Jorg is badass most relatable realistic character i've read in a while.<br>Only the ending kinda sucked, why did he have to sacrifice himself to save the world would have been better if he ruled the empire with an iron fist</br></br>  I am the only one who get piss by people changing the cover of the books, by the movie or the serie based on it ?  I am literally Julius Caesar when he becomes a total douche and gets assassinated so I'm probably about 96% fucked in the ass with a brick sideways, but at least I get lots of parades and I get to bang Cleopatra   Colin - An Abundance of Katherines <br><br>Not much different from who I am now, actually.</br></br>  kek   fiction / fantasy book reader <br> literate </br>  <br>I don't care.</br>  <br>it used to bother me when i was a teenager and i cared what was on the cover<br><br>now i just buy whatever is cheapest. no fucks given</br></br></br>  <br><br>Not that I know of, from wiki theres some info that Etienne participated in the Commune and finished deported in New Caledonia from "Docteur Pascal" novel.<br><br>This is truely a masterpiece, I was completely traumatized by reading "l'Assomoir" in highschool (frenchfag here) so it took me a long time to get back to Zola. I'm trying to read the whole Rougon Macquart cycle now, every book is good so far but Germinal was certainly breathtaking.</br></br></br></br>  Kvothe, Kingkiller Chronicles  Issue 43 from the 2008-2012 series. I guess I win.  <br>"How to Win Friends and Influence People" by Dale Carnegie<br>...<br>I should be a pretty likable and successful person.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes but you constantly get fucked over by damn near everyone you even look at</br>  <br>The firstv trilogy ius awesome the second great the third kinda good but its only one book in so far.<br>Im hoping she sets a tale a century or so forward with new characters , a descendant of Fitz, the Dragons a fact of life and The Pirate Kingdoms playing a role</br></br>  <br>The Dice Man, not too bad.</br>  <br>yeah, i fucking hate that too. It's just a sad attempt to sucker in the fools who watched the series/film and will buy the book but never finish it.</br>  <br>Great gatsby <br>Yes I'm fucked</br></br>  i think im Dr.Halsey. if not, im some retard stuck in cyberspace.  Mother Fucking Achilles??? Fuck this gay war I'm gunna go fuck bitches.  <br>The last book I read didn't have any characters.<br><br>Is this death?</br></br></br>  So, I'm the leader of se third reich!<br>Last book was mein kampf</br>  <br>you're a frenchfag?<br><br>could you recommend maybe 4/5 other titles to a person who was blown away by Germinal?7<br><br>britbong here. there's a lot of brilliant british literature obviously, but our system is very biased toward only giving us American/British lit. you have to go out of your way at university to do EU/non-English speaking lit.</br></br></br></br></br>   Thomas of Hookton <br><br>Aight so everyone I know is dead, and every one is trying to kill me, but I am super strong and handsome. Also I am the son of a priest, and found La Malice, and the holy grail. Cool.</br></br>  I dunno, i still got 8 1/2 books more to go to find out.<br>If you're asking specifically about the last book, well he got laid so he's got that going for him.</br>  <br>The Wart in "The Sword in the Stone"<br><br>Niggers, I'm gonna go on transformation adventures and then become king of England.</br></br></br>  mfw i'm now a god and a worm living more then 3500 years ... t t thanks 4chan  <br>Mah nigga. Looks like both of us are Reacher</br>  <br>I need to read those again....</br>  <br>Stephen hawking? A Brief History of Time?</br>  <br>true... that wouldn't be much different than real life tho, at least as Parker I'll get some revenge and not mope around in my room.</br>  <br>Why did you write it then?</br>  Naked lunch. What the hell? Am I heroin? A mugwump? Dr. Benway? I don't even want to know.  <br>you absolute madman</br>  <br>The man who does not read has no advantage over the man who cannot read.</br>  <br>ffffffffffuuuuu<br> last book was 1984 <br> I'm now brainwashed supporter of big brother </br></br></br>  <br><br>I really don't know, because the book takes a lot of different POVs, and there are at least 3 main characters. The 3 main characters are all kind of fucked so..<br><br>At least I'd get to see rocking magic-cannons facing off against WW1 era artillery, that'd be dope to see.</br></br></br></br>  <br>kek<br><br>meep morp cyborg<br><br>Britbong who sold out and got an American accent<br>FUCK HAWKING</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Book about Hitler suddenly showing up in modern day society. <br><br>I'm ok with this.</br></br></br>  A song of ice and fire, book 5 (the last one). Who the fuck am I?  I'm Lyra Belaqua. I have a panzerbjørn.  Friday. Heinlein. Could be worse, getting made pussy/dongs  <br>Pretty much the same though. Every tard I've met who claimed not to read couldn't write for shit. Hell, english isn't even my native language and I correct english speakers from time to time, for fuck sake.<br><br>Also, pic related, doesn't feel to bad to rule the galaxy with my snackbars.</br></br></br>  <br>I saw a documentary and hawking has people looking after him 24/7, looks like it sukcs, but loads of people suck up to him and complement him, plus he gets teaspoon-fed wine, so that's cool I guess.<br><br>lmao</br></br></br>  <br>Plus you either look like Mel Gibson or martin Lawrence, so there's that.</br>  <br>at least you got some poon in the forest before you were tortured in 101</br>   Artyom. <br> Haven't finished the book yet. </br>  <br>I'd say Sauron. Its a tragedy if you consider it from his perspective. Frodo is a malicious half-man and Gandalf a vindictive vengeful asshat.</br>  <br>Stop being an illiterate dumbass and pick up a goddamn book. Literally everyone you've ever met probably considers you an imbecile.</br>  <br>Aloha from Hell, main character is a Nephilim who has a Jade as as fuck toy,.<br>Imokwiththis.jpeg</br></br>  <br>Hey you.<br><br>You have good taste. Asimov is best. It is nice to see someone else appreciate the most awesome sci-fi books. I just finished the Foundation books, I read the Robot books awhile back, and now i'm on to the 'Second Foundation' trilogy which is cool. Hope you enjoy them too!</br></br></br>  last book : Narn I chin Hùrin -&gt; it's ok for me  <br>It was The Murders in the Rue Morgue... B-But I haven't finished it. What happens to me, Doc?!</br>  <br><br>I dunno man, I'm mostly a science guy, only got to read more recently... You'll probably know all the books I'll list here...<br><br>I think the classics from Zola (l'Assommoir, Nana, la Curée, l'Oeuvre...) are pretty good. Also le Rouge et le Noir, le père Goriot, Madame Bovary, les Miserables. I also loved every Dumas Senior novel I readin a more easily readable way (Monte Cristo, Les mousquetaires, le collier de la reine...).<br><br>Oh and I forgot, Voyage au bout de la nuit. Best XX century novel for me, I don't know if the english translations are any good because the style is very important but shit its god tier.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Cambridgefag here<br><br>You see him driving around every once in a while, though less so in the past few years. He always has a couple of nurses with him, and he's SO easy to spot because crowds part for him and it's a big scene.<br><br>He's an old horndog, too. His nurses are fit as fuck, and whenever he is invited to a University dinner he only accepts on the condition he can arrange the seating plan. It always comes back with him surrounded by the youngest female students.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So technically, first and last book you read.</br>  <br>Uh oh.<br><br>It's Poe, you know you're fucked.</br></br></br>  Do Choose Your Own Adventure Books count?  <br>Then I would be Jezus now, because I read the bible last...</br>  <br>merci beaucoup<br><br>Madame Bovary was a good one I did get to read at Uni. Didn't hit me much while reading it, but when I started to talk/think about it I realised how great of a novel it really is.<br><br>Also Flaubert's use of language was stunning, even in the English translation I read. Simply beautiful</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fellowship of the Ring<br><br>I can't carry that burden.</br></br></br>  Do the pamphlets at planned parenthood count?  Rick Grimes  pavel korchagin<br>well interesting...</br>  <br>but wat if we never red books?</br>  <br>That's pretty cool, man. Obviously he's a great mind, but with the state he's in, and how long he's lasted, I really wouldn't be surprised if half the talks he give out at classes are really meta and pretty useless.</br>  The alphabet of manliness. I guess I'm Maddox. Could be worse.  <br>I guess I'm a motherfucking Warlord Titan. Couldn't have been better. Run heretics, ruuuun!</br>  <br>I don't know anything about that, being a literature Cambridgefag - I'm only going by what my physicist friends tell me. But yeah, he's a pretty impressive guy even if you take away all his intelligence. He should have died a long time ago, but he keeps fighting on</br>  <br>All true for the first six and a half books. The ending sucked sigh.</br>  <br>Cause of they do imma mothafuckin' superhero.<br><br>If not I'm a witty news reporter who lives with his cat. (Speak ill of the Living)</br></br></br>  <br>I know. Shit, I know. No one in the story should get too suspicious of the swap. I'm a North Carolinian, we'll act about the same, though I am a remarkable pervert.</br>  <br>I remember when /b/ had a Maddox thread every week or so. I haven't seen him talked about on here for years.</br>  Kylara Vatta.<br><br>Female starship commander, am doing alright!</br></br>  Danielle Moonstar. <br><br>Could be worse. I'm am a human being, a mutant, a Valerie and I have a penchant for skimpy clothes.</br></br>  <br> The ending sucked sigh. <br><br>Said everyone who ever finished a Stephen King book<br><br>He's one of my favourite writers of all time, for sure, but I gave up on ever getting a satisfying ending out of the guy a long time ago.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The Sixth Extinction<br>so i guess i am biodiversity and pretty fucked</br></br>  <br>Yossarian from catch 22. I'm a borderline nut bag with no respect for authority. Don't want to drop any spoilers so I'll leave it at that</br>  <br> tfw read a warren buffet book </br>  <br> primal blueprint diet book <br>i guess i am a fitness guru that eats shitty donuts</br></br>  ITT: we name things we think only we do in the bathroom. <br><br> I put toilet paper in the water before I ever sit down so water doesn't splash my asshole.
