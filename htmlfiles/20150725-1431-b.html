I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.  <br><br>What could he possibly say?<br><br>¿Has conocido a mi esposa?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sanders' hair is pretty wild too.</br>    <br>I don't "hate" Bernie. I'm sure he has good intentions. But good intentions and happy words don't fix a country. His policies rely on punishing businesses and corporations by raising minimum wage. People think this will bring low wage impoverished people out of poverty but in reality it will just hurt them more and the big businesses will adapt, leaving small businesses unable to keep up with them and die out.<br><br>Socialism is a scam, it only feeds the mouth of government, which shouldn't have any control over how one lives their life. It's theft to require every citizen to pay for things they don't need or want to pay for barring military upkeep. Most of the money going to government from taxes is going straight to social security, which again, is a government construction that has repeatedly failed and will be obsolete soon. Our dept is still skyrocketing even after raising our budget every year.</br></br></br>  <br><br>is nice<br>have an enjoyable election.<br>just don't come crying if you elect a retard (again)</br></br></br></br>  I'm not gonna lie I'm voting for trump to see if a president can actually change the United states.  <br>when we start caring what people living in 3rd world shitholes think about real international politics, we'll let you know. <br>stay fag and buttmad till then.</br></br>  <br>I'll say Trump seems a wee bit smarter than Reagan, but hasn't his business been going through serious ups and downs in the past few years?<br><br>Politicians and Businessmen aren't that different anyway. The Federal government is a business.</br></br></br>  RICK SANTORUM 2016  <br> trump <br> make america great again </br></br>  <br><br> words don't fix a country.  <br><br>How can US currency be "fixed"?<br><br>Maybe Hillary would just bust out?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Rik Sanatorium 4 president.  <br>so he's the best chioce</br>  what's the site that helps you to see who you agree the most with?  US politics have become a form of entertainment.  <br>I'd vote for George clooney/Ben afflek.</br>  <br>Jesus, that guy would die of old age before he ever became president.</br>  <br>Kek, that's what they said about Paul both times he ran.</br>  <br>i dont understand? isn't is a world view that the jewish are greedy untrustworthy subhumans?</br>  <br>Well, fix is subjective. If you think the US in its current state is "good", then it doesn't need fixing, in which case Sanders is the worst choice by far as his policies are the most radical. <br><br>I lean more towards libertarian so i agree with his social policies like legalization of drugs and such, but his economic issues are completely opposite mine. People always depict corporations as evil since they always try to "buy" politicians or political power, but what pushes them to do that? The fact that we have a big government with power to give, thats what. If we let the people of this country decide how they want to spend their money or how to live their life, wealth will flow naturally. There's always gonna be rich people and poor people, but in a totally free society, determination is the most powerful, not big government to give you handouts that only sustain your poverty.</br></br></br>  <br><br>checked.<br><br>Then who? Who does the multi-cultural USA support? Can't find any? OH. Maybe should have kept nations separated by culture? Could there be some problems finding accepted leadership? Hmm? Or do we get somebody in there who talks out of multiple sides of the same mouth again?</br></br></br></br>  <br>so... late 80's<br><br>that's not too bad considering computers were pretty new to the public by then</br></br></br>  <br>Are you retarded? or did your mom drop you?</br>    <br>same goes for you.</br>  <br>How's that debt collection going?</br>  <br>https://www.isidewith.com/</br>  <br><br>http://www.usdebtclock.org/<br><br>Is it like this because of greed? Did we solve at the cause level?<br><br>Is it possible for somebody to solve? Actual solve not "we will focus on" not "we will work on". Is it even possible before they run their lips about it?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br/></br></br>   Trump <br> comb-over <br> fake tan <br> fake teeth <br>Fake President.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The only way to solve it is to take the pain America needs (the pain happens to be the medicines in this case). It is as if the united states economy is a car sliding on an icy road with a wall at the bottom. we can either raise interest rates and crash into the side of the road, getting injured, but not dead. our second choice is to keep inflation going and do nothing to raise interest rates, then we crash into the wall when the government bubble burst. we are fucked either way, it just depends how fucked we are.</br>  <br><br><br>Why don't you guys present a counter argument instead of being name calling faggots.</br></br></br>  Remember kids if you vote for Bernie you're a fucking commie piece of shit and should move to Sweden  <br>because my age ends with -teen.</br>  <br>Not all people want a Comcast that will throttle Netflix and ruin their movie experience, but without a government that has agencies that can step in you can't stop shit like that. People would choose another ISP so that the "wealth will flow naturally" if they could. Some areas only have one choice and that choice is Comcast.<br><br>Regulation is needed for these cases and should be aimed towards bullshit like that. Not all big companies are evil, just greedy individuals with an idea to make more money.</br></br></br>  <br><br>40's plural.<br><br>it it were 40.0 it would be 27 years ago. 1988<br><br>if it were 45.0 it would be 22 years ago. 1993<br><br>if it were 49.0 years ago it would be 18 years ago. 1997<br><br>And I don't think she went on to study network protocols or she would have set up her own private email server etc.<br><br>So she started word processing maybe or watching .wmv videos between 1988-1997<br><br>In charge of federal agencies. Seriously.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The debt is so high because the government takes in more money than it spends. The shit that we spend it on is our bloated military and social security, which we're now even taking money out of. The system is fucked, no amount of raising taxes is going to fix this, only cutting what we spend.</br>  <br>Paul got cut out of some important debates thanks to his own party fucking him in the ass, so a lot of potential voters never got to hear him speak on the issue. It'll be different with Sanders since he's Clinton's only challenger. People will get to hear him out. Hopefully it'll be enough to swing the undecided voters.</br>  <br>Also, this is all the cause of the federal reserve created in 1913. That was the year capitalism ended in the united states. and it happened to be created by the jews. the federal reserve has caused basically every economic crisis since 1913.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>...<br>A man who isnt even capable of showing us he's bald cannot be a reliable leader for the most powerful country on planet</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>First Santa claus, then the tooth fairy, now Donald trump? What the fuck!</br>  Tempted to vote for Trump just because he's all but blatantly declared himself a super villain and future dictator of the world already.<br><br>I would vote for him and then kill myself to avoid the horrors all would suffer under his tyranny.</br></br>  <br>I don't blame you for caving to the rhetoric and endorsing the same policies that have landed you in your current situation. Socialists like Sanders promise bread and circuses - it is an easy trap to fall into and I don't fault you for your desperation. As someone who is desperately poor myself I find it tempting to vote for a Sanders or a Warren who talk big when it comes to helping the poor.<br><br>Sooner or later, though, you will realize that it is empty rhetoric, and people like Bernie put high-level Union officials and special interest groups above the interests of the common man.<br><br><br>The best way to help the poor is to create an environment in which they are given opportunities to lift themselves out of poverty, not make empty promises of monetary compensation to them. We are already $20,000,000,000,000 in debt - just how much gibs me dat do you think is left in the Federal Reserve's QE or the Federal budget? We've already drained the public trough dry with handouts to niggers and old people.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You painted a very narrow set of possibilities. That analogy fails.<br><br>Interest rates are only one of many factors.</br></br></br></br>  Is the Trump family connected to the cabal?  <br> wealth will flow naturally <br>kek</br></br>  <br>Haha! You have no idea what Communism is yet you use it as an insult because you heard other people use it like that!</br>  <br>faggot, it would be funny, vote for fucking trump. NOW</br>  <br>Dr. Evil for President!</br>  <br>i was just trying to put it into simple terms. the analogy does not fail at all. we are in such a big government bubble right now that it is impossible to get out of it. 18,000,000,000,000 in national debt is also another problems. we need to set a flat tax and get rid of the federal reserve and IRS right now.</br>  <br>I see what you're saying, but look at the esrb game rating company. They're a private company non regulated by the govt yet they are the industry standard for game ratings. Why? Not because they have a chokehold on their market, but because they do a good job. In a much more free economy, devoid of all of these govt restrictions, another company would challenge their hold on their customers by offering better service/cheaper service. Profit dictates what a company is doing right, and people always buy the best deal. Competition in business is needed and good for everybody.</br>  <br>Why wouldn't it?</br>  <br>your dubs don't hide the fact that your a faggot</br>  <br>You don't need to know what communism is to know that it's bad.</br>  <br>Enjoy forcing business to leave our nation you mongoloid?</br>  EXCUSE ME<br><br>IT WAS A DISASTER<br><br>I'VE HAD GREAT SUCCESS<br><br>WE HAVE LOSERS<br><br>PEOPLE LOVE ME<br><br>I KNOW HOW TO MAKE DEALS<br><br>I'VE BEEN DEALING WITH POLITICIANS MY WHOLE LIFE<br><br>THEY'RE ALL TALK, NO ACTION<br><br>I WOULD BOMB THE HELL OUT OF THEM<br><br>CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ja ja the jews are to blame</br>  <br>finally someone who isn't a complete faggot and knows what is up. my nigga.</br>  <br>rand paul</br>  <br><br> The debt is so high because the government takes in more money than it spends. <br><br>wut.<br><br> The system is fucked, no amount of raising taxes is going to fix this, only cutting what we spend. <br><br>Take in more than you spend is the simple way. The Ron Paul way, etc. Factor in investing and borrowing and it's more complex. Factor in producing and it gets more complex.<br><br>You have to literally solve each problem the wisest possible way to end up with the wisest possible outcome - since there are many problems.<br><br>immigration - gtfo<br>meddling in every other country - gtfo<br>taxes - rich people chip in til it's fixed and don't be greedy next time etc<br><br>etc</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>tell me how does the government spend money on social security? when social security is a separate entity than what the IRS collects</br>  <br>If people always buy the best deal then explain the success of Apple computers.</br>  <br>rand paul</br>  <br>Communism was created by America. Communism = socialism = communism. The U.S. has always created our own enemies since becoming a superpower after the Spanish-American War. International bankers are the ones funding communist and socialist countries, which is basically consolidating all the finances so that the bankers can owe them debt. Learn more about the history of international bankers and communism and socialism. The truth is there to see, it's heavily documented, it's not a secret. And it's not necessarily a Jewish conspiracy, although most of the international bankers are "Jewish." The international bankers are usually atheist Jews who have been manipulating the Jewish people far more than gentiles.</br>  <br>You should always know what you're talking about before joining in on an adult discussion. There's no excuse for ignorance in this day and age where information is at your fingertips.</br>  <br>Not as good as his father. But by far the best for 2016.</br>  <br><br>You have to solve each problem simply, there are many. Massive tax increase to pay off 18 tril + (big) interest has downsides. You have to solve each extraneous problem as well. When people bitch, oh fucking well they can bitch until it's fixed.</br></br>  <br>I still live with my parents. I'm 20, struggling to pay for school, and the chance of getting a job right out of college is dim. This isn't becuase we need more socialism, its becuase govt has forced minimum wage higher without letting the market dictate what a good wage is. And hang in there man.</br>  <br>  <br>Looks like socialism is working for them in mexico.<br><br>I love how dumb these minorities are. They run from shit government in their own country and try to start the same shit over here.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Your tinfoil is showing.</br>  <br>yes yess...blame the jews for all your problems...let you never figure out it is your own fault</br>  <br>Actually there is a excuse, it's called a free country. If you don't like it then you can git out. Vote trump!</br>  <br>You know any good books about the federal reserve and its creation by the jews?</br>  <br><br><br>People know about Jeckyl Island, Federal Reserve Act, sneaking it in on Christmas holiday all that shit.<br><br>Is Bernie the Jew, the new anti-Jew though?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They're not buying the best deal there, they're buying a polished product. Apple gets away with higher prices because of smart advertising and because they created something their consumers like. Simple as that, and before anyone says <br> applefag detected <br>I own an android.</br></br></br>  The Top4 are Hilary, Sander, Paul, Rubio  <br>Your ignorance is showing.<br><br>Is it a tinfoil conspiracy that The U.S. trained the mujahideen and Jihadists who are now our enemies in Iraq? Learn history and quit being a parrot, saying things you heard other people say.</br></br></br>  <br> all your problems <br><br>You have a vast misunderstanding of the situation cunt bag</br></br></br>  <br>Kek, I fucked up that first part, its because we SPEND more than we take in.</br>  <br>Sanders, only acceptable choice.</br>  <br>massive tax and interest rate will lead to an immediate crisis. either way its a crisis. a flat tax should be put in place after the crisis.</br>  <br>or maybe it's because you went to a college you couldn't afford, are majoring in something with a low demand job wise and have a shitty gpa. Or you're just too pessimistic. If you're having trouble paying for school, why don't you ask your parents for money? <br><br>Idiot.</br></br></br>  <br>but what I just said is true?</br>  <br>Everybody pays taxes to social security. That fund is to remain separate from any spending money the government uses. However, recently, the govt has even been collecting money from social security to spend on other things. In other words, that fund will dry up eventually.</br>  <br>I'd vote for him just for the keks.</br>  <br>Yes, but don't get caught up in focusing on the Jews who are involved. Just like how American slavery had white and black slavemasters, whites can't simply be blamed for slavery, but everyone involved because it wasn't just whites. Credibility is lost when the focus is on one particular people. The Jews that are involved in international banking are not real Jews, they are atheists, secular, they are the ones that created the abomination in Israel right now. Real Jews don't support a Zionist secular state of Israel.</br>  <br>Even Jews hate Jews.</br>  <br>Bernie is 100% in on it. He wants socialism.</br>  <br>You know nothing. The wages for working people have been stagnant for decades whole executive pay has skyrocketed. The cost of living has home up, wages haven't. The Minimum Wage is still below where it should be when you compare where it was 40 years ago. Stop listening to conservative propaganda, they aren't on your side.</br>  <br>Why is Hillary on that list?</br>  No intelligent people want either trump or hillary. Bernie is another story, and I think jeb has no reason to be running. Only repubs worth mentioning are ted cruz, ben carson and rand paul.  <br>B sanders</br>  <br>whats there to misunderstand shit muncher?<br><br>you blame the jews for things that you, as a probably fat ass white male in his late 40's, have the vast majority of a say in<br><br>But you rather sit around a pick your toe cheese and say its the jews fault, you might as well tattoo fail on your flabby forehead</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>and because Apple computers don't get viruses. Pcs are for old people and nerds. Bill gates is a nerd that wouldn't know cool if he saw jay-z get shot by Kanye west.</br>  <br>My parents pay for my room and board and I'm attending college with wages from my pocket. Shut the fuck up you no information having cockass.</br>  <br>like this guy.</br>  <br><br>The Top4 most likely to become President</br></br>  <br>who in their right fucking mind would vote for another bush or that miserable failure hilary?</br>  <br><br> I fucked up that first part <br><br>gnomesayin<br><br>For consistent risk, you take in more than you spend. Faggots whine about parked money doing nothing. STFU oy vey bitch.<br><br>For greater risk, you invest/loan what you take in that you don't spend.<br><br>What you don't do is spend spend spend loan loan loan, then later say wow we need to take in more.<br><br> tfw shit ain't kosher </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So you think freedom gives you an excuse to wallow in your own ignorance?
