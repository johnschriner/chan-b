No wasting.<br>Ive had some nasty baked weed before. For some reason I decided to eat the weed after I has extracted the thc from it so I could "not waste any". God it was terrible.

Burroughs</br></br></br></br>  Shrooms, candies, every week or so  <br>yeah it's true. unfortunately im still in an oppressed state where it's illegal and i no longer have a steady dealer. I wait till my friend from work sees his friend (who I don't know and who is not a dealer he just buys a shit ton of weed for personal use) and he buys some of his extra and gives it to me. <br><br>not the best system but I don't have to deal with a dealer or go out of my way to find weed. hopefully its legal here soon. signs are looking very good</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>meant for him. whoops lol</br></br></br>  <br>Share the story.</br>  <br>#legalisegayweed2015</br>   DXM by far <br> every 3 months or so <br> sirp, or gels when I can get them </br></br>  pot/benzo crossfade, sometimes a little liquor thrown in after peaking<br><br>once a month, haven't done it in awhile though<br><br>take a hit or two from vape, chase a bar of xanax down with a weak cocktail, finish bowl, smoke more or wait for xannies to kick depending on mood</br></br></br></br>  <br>Just do Triple C's, homeskillet.<br>I used to do at least a box a day.<br>They're easy as hell to steal if you know where the security tag is.</br></br></br>  <br>How is it for you? Curious<br>Also, do you have a plug or do you just sr to get it?</br></br>  <br>I'm not a retard, fegt</br>  <br>I'd like you to elaborate. Intended recipient here.<br><br>Alright all of you faggots, here's how my retarded college friends managed to waste a quarter of weed.<br><br> be me don't fucking judge my existentiality <br> over at friends house, we'll call him Dan <br> other friend is over but Dan isn't, other friend will be called Isaac <br> Isaac and I play SSB for Wii U <br> Isaac's a fucking faggot that practices this game all day everyday and I don' have a Wii U so in no time I'm done playing <br> Dan calls and wants us to take his quarter ounce of weed and make cannabutter <br> Isaac decides he's calling the shots on this one when I actually know how to do it right <br> Isaac take the weed and puts it by a pot <br> um Isaac we haven't decarbed the weed <br> Isaac has no idea what I'm talking about <br> "Isaac, we should decarb the weed first. Get a cookie sheet and distribute it. We also need an oven thermometer." <br> start listing things we need in order to do it right, strainer, sheet, thermometer, etc. <br> "dude, we don't have that." <br> "Then we're not cooking weed, let's just smoke it." <br> dude goes full on Veruca Salt <br> BUT I WANT IT <br> fucking hell <br> RIPweed.gif <br> He starts estimating the appropriate amount of butter with a normal spoon <br> "this... might be the right amount... idk" <br> puts it in the pan <br> decides he's going to put water in a bigger pan and put the pan with the butter inside of that pan <br> wtf <br> This nigga is going off-book hard <br> decides that we're just going to have weed and butter sitting in a pan being boiled by another pan with the water in it for 3 hours <br> 3 hours later <br> Doesn't look like anything has happened <br> They decide the best course of action is to put some of the buttered weed into glasses, mix with water and cocoa mix, and *drink* it. <br> mfw it didn't work <br> mfw we could've just smoked it and gotten baked off our asses </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  weed <br><br>all fuckin day</br></br>  Heroin. Been clean for over 2 years. Used to inject it. The urge is still there every single day. No other drug compares to it.  <br>Neither am I, bozo.<br>I just know how to get fucked up for free.</br></br>  <br>I lucked on and got a dealer for almost every halli/discoaitive<br><br>Although it is far more intense and individualized experience when compared to LSD. the duration is a mere fraction so its less of a strain mentally on me.<br>LSD messed me up in the head alot and stopped being fun a long time ago<br><br>it is a unique experience, and very intense<br>you get almost mental super powers during the duration, for me visualizing concepts ect.<br><br>100% a drug to try in your life time<br><br>even if you gotta cook it yourself, it isnt to extreme to get</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Heroin<br>Multiple times a day<br>iv</br></br></br>  <br>Stay strong, faggot</br>  <br>Good thing you're clean. It ain't worth it, bruh. Not for a fucking second.</br>  2 15 mg oxy's and a blunt or 2 joints of some loud, do this about once every 3 days or so  <br><br>A tale of two extremes.</br></br>  <br>I'm sure you wouldn't get addicted again if you just did it every once in a while.<br>That is, if you even know how to get it still.</br></br>   your favourite drug <br>weed<br> how often you use it <br>once every 1-2 weeks<br> how you do it <br>usually smoke doobies but recently have been smoking bongs to get mcfuckity upity</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Triple Cs are a great way to end up in a body bag, do your research</br>  <br>oooo, edgyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy</br>  <br> ruining your life this much </br>  <br>Try dabs. I did half a gram of dabs and after one more hit I started inexplicably laughing my ass off hard. My friend got worried. Best night ever.</br>  <br>You say that as if it's a bad thing.</br>  <br>Question about quitting real quick. What's worse, the WDs or the boredom that comes once you arnt sick anymore?</br>  <br>favorite is weed by far<br><br>smoke it everyday<br><br>bongs, bowls, blunts. Bongs are best imo</br></br></br></br></br>    <br> 4-methylmethcathinone <br><br>haven't used since 2012 mostly cause it got banned, partly cause it's probably way cardio-toxic, really cause i love it so much</br></br></br>  <br>Continuing, just know it just isn't worth it. If you've been addicted you know that marijuana or anything else will never compare like how it use to before the heroin use. Stay strong to everyone that struggles with this very issue. I've lost a lot of people to it and that's the main inspiration to stay away from it.</br>  <br><br>Oh, hey Mom and Dad.</br></br>  <br><br>acid is fucking impossible to find nowadays. shit sucks.</br></br>  <br>Le marijuana.<br><br>Every single time I'm not stoned.</br></br></br>  <br> dmt<br><br>whenever i can these days which isn't often, haha</br></br></br>  <br>come to me will cook it together</br>  <br>Go on</br>  <br><br><br><br> mfw use heroin for years(not regularly of course, only retards do), not addicted and have great job and family. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Boredom for sure. Especially since all the music I listen I to reminds me of the times I've used. But it gets so much better after the first two weeks of withdrawals. It's not impossible.</br>  Any eurofags out there that like speed paste as their number one?  <br>Might want to go see an ortho. I had migraines for as long as I remember. I recently got braces to correct a bite issue, and 6 months in: my migraines vanished. TLDR: teeth pressure can cause debilitating migraines.</br>  <br><br>Alcohol.

It's non prescription and it eliminates bipolar mania, if that's indeed what you are suffering from. Also you can't overdose on it unless you deliberately take more than the recommended dose on the bottle.<br><br>Do note that it won't cure depression though. You'll need anti-depressants for that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You should find another job and get treatment. Being a crazy asshole isn't gonna help you</br>  Too many drugsters in here.<br>You start on drugs and you'll rely on them....be hooked for life....just do the meditation one...i would recommend finding a good teacher.</br>  <br><br>Shit like this makes me wonder if its even worth it, but the highs and lows are pretty hard to control. <br><br>SO if I go to mexico and buy the meds they give me the script and I have no problem coming back to the US right?</br></br></br></br>  <br>those are some droopy titties, I guess I'd like her suck me off but only if I was desperate</br>  <br><br><br>BTW lithium orotate isn't a drug. It's a mineral supplement.</br></br></br>  ayahuasca  Everyone is Dr Phil in this thread.

I suffered from ultradian cycling which means super fast up and down mania almost every day of my life for as long as I can remember.<br><br>I took two lithium orotate pills and within about 5 hours my head started feeling freaky but in a good way.<br><br>By the next day 99% of my mania was gone for good and I've been taking it ever since, for a few years now.<br><br>About a year after I started on the lithium I finally came to terms with the fact that my depression was just as bad as ever. I went to a psychiatrist and he gave me a daily dose of escitalopram which is generic lexapro. After three weeks of taking it my depression lifted and has been 99% gone ever since.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're a fucktard. Antidepressant therapy is generally contraindicated in bipolar disorder and can induce mania. <br><br>Self medicating? It will be expensive. Olanzapine HCl 5mg at bedtime and Divalproex DR 500mg at bedtime. Standard first line treatment, but know that you may experience side effects and doing that is a bad fucking idea in general.</br></br></br>  <br> In my field of work I cannot have any mental or personality disorders. <br><br>If you were never diagnosed before getting employed, they can't let you go if you are diagnosed after they hired you if the condition does not impair or reduce your ability to do your job.

Levels need to be monitored if used as a mood stabilizer. Not a self-med. <br><br>If bipolar depression is the diagnosis, Lurasidone would be preferred but it's on patent.

They're testing for illegal drugs/alcohol, not medications.</br></br></br></br>  <br> so lithium orotate over the counter, and escitalopram/lexapro, and your better? you don't have mania or depression anymore? ever? I wonder what that feels like. <br><br>I still get occasional "pangs" of mania or depression but they are nothing like what I used to get. Nowadays I might have one small bout of depression in 2 or 3 weeks that lasts maybe half a day then is over. Whereas previously my life was literally just overwhelming sadness and suicidal thoughts almost every day of my life.<br><br>The occasional mania also isn't bad because it doesn't usually strike when the bits of depression strike. And mania without depression is not actually emotionally painful. I just get hyper and excited but I also notice that I'm becoming manic and can usually calm myself down.<br><br>I buy the lithium orotate on amazon btw.

Have you seen what a concerted effort from well armed pissed off guerillas does to a regular army. And the US army might have some big toys, but the government is too scared to use them. You don't live here, you have no reference for this. Imagine the people in Baltimore got bomed instead of kinda stopped by police. That would turn a local uprising into a national insurrection with much of the military fighting against the government. <br>2.Free Healthcare isn't really free, and it wouldn't be free here at all.

The first people on Earth were black. They should be saying white people have black features. White people try to look black everyday by tanning anyway. As I've said, the first people on Earth were black. They are the original humans. White skin is nothing but a sick mutation. Are white people just envious of black people?  <br> White skin and strait hair are de evolutions... becuase they dont protect from sun and dont help keep warm or cool as needed like the naked aborigines in new zealand <br><br>There is no such thing as a "de-evolution"; any change due to the enviornment is considered evolution. You're scientifically illiterate.</br></br></br>  <br>This is the most idiotic article I have ever read. Adaptations can occur over a very short time. Take dogs for instance. Forcible selection can completely change a species gene pool. Mutations are what allows species to evolve, white skin is a mutation but all mutations ARE NOT bad. If no mutations ever occurred we would still be single celled organisms on the sea floor. So the argument that white skin is a mutation is actually a compliment.</br>  <br>White people are more evolved than you filthy monkey looking bastards.</br>  What is it about interracial couples that throws so many people on here into a frenzy?  <br>frenzy?<br>the cucks make more of a fuss about it than the anti cucks<br>no one gives a shit</br></br></br>  <br>bastard whore</br>  <br>So anons can rip me apart for looking like a thug.
