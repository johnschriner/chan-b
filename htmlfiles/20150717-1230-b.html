Wondering how far I can push it...  <br>I ordered a GTX 980 Ti and it was meant to be delivered on the fourteenth then they said it was late. Was meant to come today and I get another e mail today saying its coming next week tuesday. Fuck me sideways, cant wait.</br>  <br>i really hate so much this trend to make gaming pc so white that looks like ghetto shit</br>  <br>too bad bitch i have the ftw acx 2.0 version. get on MY level</br>  consoles are so much fucking better lmfao  I use a Nickel  <br>760 GTX 4 gig Evga</br>  <br>Gigabyte HD 7850 OC Edition.

Good for you. you bought a 350-400$ graphics card<br><br>only a few billion people can do this do.<br><br>do something worth being proud of, like a college degree, faggot.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I have both ps4 and xb1, the PC is better. <br>Sorry console baby.</br></br>  <br><br>$270</br></br>  R9 390 non X version.

How do you think he got the money to pay for that? Did the money fairy give it to him? No he probably worked hard for it and buying something with your hard earned money shows plenty worth and he should be proud.</br>  <br>Got the 970 as well<br><br>Very happy with it so far</br></br></br>  <br>fried my gpu this week.<br>Refuse to buy a new one because they all come with a free copy of Batman which I really dont want.<br>Going to wait till december and hopefully get hitman with it.</br></br></br>  Intel 4000 Integrated  <br>Yeah, I got the h100i for $50 bucks. Great deal. If you have the stock fan, you can OC a bit if you lower the voltage, as voltage is the main heat thing. What case do you have, and how much are you willing to spend? There's some pretty boss quiet air coolers that can do as well if not better than AIO's.</br>  <br>He's actually right on some games. My 970 doesn't run ark very well at all (30-40) maxed out</br>    <br>get watercooling, fans just don't cut it for some good ol' overclocking</br>  <br> The color white is now ghetto </br>  <br>480 x 2 sli nigga you just hitting my level from 5 years ago</br>  So many 970's in this thread<br>Enjoy your 3.5 GB vram fellers ;)</br>  <br>Not OP but I never had a degree in my life.

The 970 is 2gb not 4gb.</br>  <br>That's because it's a shitty game</br>  <br>I'm looking at it myself. <br>I too am looking to upgrade</br></br>  <br>Or he stole it from some poor autist</br>  Palit GeForce GTX 980 Super JetStream <br><br>suck muh dick faggot</br></br>  I have an evga gtx 960 ftw.

Bout the only fun thing is pvp</br>  If you are not rocking 980's in SLI, you aren't trying.  <br><br>Thanks bros got a water cooling system on the way anyway, German made or some shit should be good. AIO water system that uses two fans. Using Aerocool case, not that quiet but had no problems with it so far</br></br>  <br>I've got the same card, gives some great performance to price</br>  <br>white is ghetto since rap videos</br>  My poor ass upgraded from a potato to a carrot...  happy with my GTX 750  <br>Why jetstream?</br>  780Ti Classified.<br><br>Come at me, scrublord, I'm ripped.</br></br>  Hey PC Fags help me please.<br>What can I do to upgrade my shit.

I just had it longer than the computer.  <br>Thats not the fault of the hardware, but the fault of poor optimization and software. Not even a titan can run Ark well.</br>  <br>Defiantly could use a better Graphics card in that, other wise it doesn't look like anything else would boost performance that much without a new GPU.</br>  <br>Use MSI Afterburner and pump your gfx to 110% power limit, +150 core clock, and +250 memory clock. These are safe on every 970, you can probably pump core and memory higher. Run Unigine Valley in the background to monitor it, keep pumping it higher until your get artifacts, then drop it down. You can get that sweet 60 FPS in every game.</br>  <br>fuck I dont remember Im at work right now reccommendations on what to do with my processor? I know its an I7 i just dont remember what type I built this rig actually with the recommendations from another /b/ro and took me like a year</br>  <br>i got gtx 970 gigabyte and i still can run max batman arkham knight on full HD fucking game.<br>Also those fucking fps drops in LAGMOBIL</br></br>  <br>Looks to me as it's the beastiest of the beasts out there, though some fags argue that the Fury is better or the R9 390 (or whatever it's called)</br>  this beast right here  http://speccy.piriform.com/results/<wbr>T5CEgEHw0BTgcqTZr2ytoyL<br><br><br>My build.</br></br></br></wbr>  <br>Not necessarily if its a decent brand.

Really great and reliable card for a laptop.  got the 970 also. the only game that gave me a little trouble was rust. could'nt do ultra 60. but other then that super happy.  <br>Arkham Knight is a shit</br>  <br>Haha, your PC's are just a bunch of overpriced bullshit anyways.</br>  <br> GTX970 <br>stay pleb</br></br>  EVGA GTX 760 2gb SC  MSI GTX 970<br><br>Waiting patiently for Pascal</br></br>  <br><br><br>Thanks bros.

If you had no frame time variation you would end up with perfect 16.66ms frametimes at 60FPS for example. What can happen is that one frame takes longer to render, e.g. 50ms. Even though you'll still get your average 60 FPS the game won't feel as fluent when your frame times are fucked up. This is one of the reasons why SLI/Crossfire sucks, although you get high FPS it doesnt feel as fluent.</br>  <br>AMD R9 270x, cheap and nice little bugger, runs all my games at max settings with the exception of a few (mostly because they were built around or optimized for nvidia)..<br><br>Thinking about adding in a second one for crossfire or just upgrading to a single new one.. just weighing the pro and cons of crossfire, if I decide to go for a single I'll be digging my friend out of the deep trench of console gaming with a donated card as a starter...</br></br></br>  <br>I got one too. You'll love it till you get the electricity bill.</br>  <br><br>im the guy who posted 20% and at the time before 970 driver optimizations it was true, googled it now its a smaller gap but its definitely there.</br></br>  Using a titan black, because niggas run faster  <br> unironically using gpuboss </br>  <br> Thinking about adding in a second one for crossfire or just upgrading to a single new one <br>You don't want to crossfire two midrange GPUs, trust me. If you have the option to get the performance you need with a single GPU card, dont bother with multi GPU setups. It's not worth the hassle.</br></br>  <br>With all 3.5GB of VRAM</br>  <br>as i said above, im the one saying 20% not the one you're replying too. and yeah it was 20% at 970 release with the shitty driver optimisations but apparently that gaps closer to 8% now but either way 780ti on clearance is still the same as a 970<br><br>proof? i paid less 260 quid for this in november<br>oc's like a god compared to 970 too which is important to take into account.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>NEver even heard of this bran.<br><br>Is it this bad ? A quick google search shows no horrible reviews.</br></br></br></br>  I just built an fx6350 with an R9270. <br><br>I am so happy with this $600 build. I'm good until 2017, at least.<br><br>Man, $150 GPU'Z Were NEVER this good. I just upgraded from a core2duo with a 7950gx2. Fucking lasted over 5 years!!</br></br></br></br>  <br>but not talking about the actual graphical results i posted next :^)</br>  980 Ti here, just got it today, must say i dunno i dont feel so good about it as i thought i would.<br><br>got the Gigabyte G1 version which supposed to be an OC beast, does 1450-1490mhz boost in games but semi noisy so not that happy about it. Looks nice with the lighting and stuff though, but ima return it get another version or just get stock and slap AIO water cooler on for less noise.</br></br>  <br> and hopefully get hitman with it. <br><br>You'll have to go for AMD then...</br></br></br>  I have a Wii U, because I really don't care about any of the games on the PC, Xbox one, PS4. Exclusives can suck it and any other franchise I don't give fuck about.  <br>Fucking seriously.. my case unfortunately came with LED fans and I've been wanting to replace them for months.. but the two front ones are stuck infront of the drive cage and I couldn't be arsed to bother taking that out..</br>  <br>palit zotac and galax get bad press, realistically they have better warranties and usually better silicone to make up for there smaller brand size. <br>i've had much worse experience with xfx than zotac and i've had 10+ zotacs for various builds</br></br>  <br> gaming benchmarks <br> N/A <br><br>What's to talk about?<br>You just listed a bunch of useless shit</br></br></br></br></br>  Can I ask, is the nvidia geforce gtx 660 any good?  <br>the MSI Gaming is the best aircooled model if you care. The Inno3D X3 is a bit more silent, but with VRMs sitting at a comfy 117°C under load...</br>  <br>for 1080p with a single card thats not even an issue</br>  Still rocking a 560ti, folks.<br><br>I don't see the sense in updating before DX12 starts going into full swing.<br><br>Most of these shitfuck cards you're posting won't even handle 4k gaming now. Let alone when better looking games come out. Idiots.</br></br></br></br>  <br>bait</br>  <br>depends on which price you get it for. here in my country you'd get a stronger R9 270(X)/R9 370 for the same price....</br>  <br><br>260 sounds a nice deal. Where did you get that ?<br><br>Waited for sales ?<br><br>Also, maybe I'm a retard but I only "trust" "premiums" manufacturers for my GPU.<br><br>By which I mean I don't buy MSI &amp; Co.<br><br>I tend to stick to Asus for GPU, G.Skill for the RAM etc...<br><br>(But it's been a long time I didn't build a computer, my rig is 7 years old, and the last update was the 570 &amp; 16 Gb of RAM to upgrade from my Gainward 4870x2 &amp; old school shit ram)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's aging for sure</br>  Does anyone know why I can run Witcher 3 amazing! But GTA V makes my PC overheat ? I have an FX6350 With an r9270 and 8gb ram, and I can't even play without constant stuttering? What the fuck can I do guys? It's been like this for like a month. I literally bought GTA V for no reason  <br>yeah, because there are no unoptimized games with trashy streaming enginges that choke up immense amounts of VRAM. Oh wait, there are.</br>  <br>ARK isn't optimized yet</br>  <br>Turn the settings down till it runs smooth?</br>  <br>the fucking reply moron. it gets a higher score in actual graphical fidelity according to several benchmarking sites like the one i showed in the reply to the post with the gpuboss results which realistically where a joke</br>  <br>that's a nice way to describe "broken"</br>  r9 270x 2gb... and I play most games on ultra for hundreds less  <br>and half a gig will make all the difference for a trashy unoptimised game? knock shadows down a setting and no problem anymore, jesus fuck</br>   pc gaming <br><br>really?<br><br>what fun exclusives are you guys playing these days?</br></br></br></br>  I already turned down all the settings and nothing.<br><br>This sucks ass. I can't believe my two week old PC can't even play a fucking a game that runs on an xbox360. Now I know why people complain about games being optimized so much. fuckingbullshuit</br></br>  a got a r7 260x  2-Way SLI EVGA ACX 980's.  <br>GTX 980 4GB SLI. Scrub.</br>  <br>MSI r7 260x because I was on a $500 budget when making my build, I might upgrade some time later.</br>  <br>The 970, 780ti, 290 and 290X are all within a few frames of each other depending on the game<br><br>Buy whatever you like<br>There discussion over</br></br></br></br>  gtx 690 still going strong, though 2gb is starting to limit performance on new games  <br>im still using a GTX760</br>  <br>Little dated but you get the point</br>  gtx970 sli<br>get on my level</br>  <br>go down to 720p?<br>gtav runs on my laptop beautifully (at low, but im just surprised it evens runs), while i cant get anything playable on witcher 3 unless i go down to 720p.</br></br>  <br>GTX580 3GB</br>  <br>if your game needs more than 3.5GB, yeah, every fucking MB will make a difference.<br><br>Also this is only half of the problem. The game can't see that 512MB of the cards VRAM are actually not suitable for use. Currently nvidia can avoid that problem via special driver care, with Vulkan/DX12 that won't be possible anymore.</br></br></br>  <br>The new Asus Strix looks sexy as fuck aswell, i dunno was looking at the EVGA Hybrid one, but its so overpriced compared to the fact i can just buy a reference and slap Artic Hybrid II on and save over 100 dollars.</br>  980 K|NGP|N checking in.  <br>bought it in a sale on overclockers.co.uk because they where getting the "beast edition in <br><br>Zotac have 5 year no quibble warranties and perform outstandingly from my expereince i got very lucky with my oc too. <br><br>msi is a premium manufactorer by the way, a lower fail rate * on motherboards * than Asus. However i've had an msi board fail but never an asus, so perhaps that contradicts my above statement. G.skill are a fairly new ram brand - all my ram is g.skill too but i'd say crucial and kingston are the most trusted brands for ram. <br><br>i wouldnt use xfx or palit though, for gpus that is - they have a bad rep. even though xfx is fairly big.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's what I've heard but I wanna get a better monitor as well and have the new one and my current one running together and from the benchmarks I've been finding online the graphics cards that I'd be willing to buy (due to their price ranges) either only run just above or just below the benchmarks for my GPU setup in crossfire.. and I don't know how big of an issue of Driver errors or software incompatibilities would be for me.. AMD releases driver updates like every other fucking week and I actually have a surprising amount of fun trying to fix issues on my computer.. <br><br>Either way it's still completely up in the air at this point and I probably won't be getting a new GPU until late October to mid November, if I even decide to get one..</br></br></br>  <br>why the fuck would you sli on a 970? the vram is too low it fucking chokes it</br>  <br><br><br>How do I turn it down to 720p?</br></br></br>  <br>in the settings - resolution</br>  <br>Dont forget your plane</br>  <br>i dont sli on 970, i dont even have a 970<br>just referring to OP's faggotness<br><br>he knows there are people on here with much more powerful gear and yet he's like a spoiled kid</br></br></br></br>  Just to let everyone know the whole "I'm going to wait 3 months until the next GPU" well, Newsflash folks, if you keep up with that mentality, your going to have the same PC for 4 years. I see it happen all the time.<br><br>Stop waiting for the next.</br></br>  <br>fuck hybrid cooling, either go full water or air, but that's just my opinion.<br><br>If you don't care for an aftermarketcooler, dont want to SLI and dont mind getting a different cooler for your card you might want to look into the raijintek morpheus. Got one for my 290, overclocked to 1200MHz core. should suck well above 300W like this, got two noiseblocker NB Black silent Pro PL1 700RPM on the cooler. Dead silent and card never breaks 70°C...</br></br></br>  <br>Get a better computer or components faggot.<br><br>I'm playing any game current consoles can play at max settings usually on 60+ fps, only using the card in OP's pic.<br><br>Maybe you need to get good?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i haven't got many new games recently so could you actually list some games that require more than 3.5gb for 1080p so i can avoid them then?</br>  <br>  calling people scrub <br>  2015 <br><br>Were you born autistic?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nvidia GeForce GT 540M <br>:(</br></br>  Two Graphics cards, one a GTX 780  <br>What the fuck did you get good at? Letting mom or pop buy you a gaming PC.
