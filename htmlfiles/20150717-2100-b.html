Did it really have distorted audio on purpose or was that my end fucking up?  <br>No, normal as hell, you must be on drugs!</br>  Its one of those movies that was fine as a book ... probably should have left it at that  I couldn't finish this movie after watching it for the first 15 minutes. Waste of my time  op you huge fucking faggot this movie is great  <br>fuck your discussion OP. Fuck off.</br>  <br>Is it just me, or is Johnny Depp a shitty actor?<br>He only has one role that he does in every movie he plays in.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>You are all wrong this movie is great</br></br></br></br>  <br>K</br>  <br>Agreed. I had to watch it in short intervals</br>  <br>yeah it was crappy, on weed the first time, then sober, both times sucked</br>  <br>2deep4u</br>  <br>Straight edge faggot you can jump right off the nearest cliff</br>  Watched it beginning to end at least three times. Great movie to enjoy a drink to.  <br>You fuck how was this a shit movie, a timeless classic that fucked with your head but it was still great.</br>  <br>The book is pretty great, and seeing the movie afterward gave me a much clearer idea on what exactly the main character's inner machinations and visualizations were. Just my opinion though.</br>  <br> do a lot of drugs wow so edgy look crazy things happen when you get high aren't drugs cool look at my big suitcase full of all different kinds of drugs listen to me say silly things about bats am i a cool guy yet? <br> deep <br><br>pick one<br><br>p.s. Hunter S. Thompson was the prototypical edgelord. When he realized nobody thought he was cool, he killed himself. Life wasted, nothing to see, please move along.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Good im not alone om this</br>  <br>Anything is going to be shit when you get to your level of autism and look that far into it. Just because you were stupid enough to watch this trip movie sober, it doesn't mean you're right.</br>  wow man.<br><br>in the 60s and 70s all people did was drugs.<br><br>This movie is about that.<br><br>Everyone here is just dumb or underage.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> underage </br>  <br>that was just old internet lingo.<br>testing the age of everyone.<br> confirmed b&amp; </br></br></br>  <br>Also, what a terrible meme.</br>  <br> Assumer assuming assumptions <br><br>Wasn't sober at all the two times I've watched this movie. Doesn't change the fact it was much less entertaining than many other movies I could have watched, and Hunter S. Thompson spent his entire life trying to shock people with his edgy behavior, failed miserably and killed himself as a result. I don't mind people using drugs, however people who make it their identity are invariably insufferable twats with no redeeming qualities or skills. Hence their desperate need to latch on to using drugs as a "lifestyle".</br></br></br>  <br> I explain the film in a sentence. <br> i did it well because i'm AFUCKINGGENIUS <br> Get called a tard. <br> Good job, summer. </br></br></br></br>  It was so full of shit it started to seep out of depp's mouth.    <br>If you thought I was calling you a tard and didn't catch that I was referring that you nailed it with the underage thing, maybe you really are a tard</br>  <br>Agreed</br>  <br>Yeah sick, I'll just go watch a movie based on someone I've never met but hate with a passion. I'll report back with findings, faggot. God you're insufferable, I bet you watched this alone, too.</br>  what movie is this  <br>OP you're full of shit</br>  <br>No it doesn't. Discussed.</br>  <br>thinking you're meta is a sure sign of underage fuck off</br>  We were somewhere around Barstow on the edge of the desert when the drugs began to take hold  What even is this movie? Should I be glad I haven't seen it.  <br>Didn't get it.<br><br>It's about making doing drugs one's lifestyle because it's fun to live that excessively.<br>Not because people gave two shits one way or another - TODAY yeah, people would show someone the attention they want. In the fucking 70s no fucks would be given.<br><br>It displays the border on madness that high powered hallucinogens create.<br>It then completes the cycle by showing how insane normal life is.<br>Then it attempts to deify everything in the ending sequence; ultimately displaying the shamanic trip one can go on if they go to the fucking Andes Medicine men. <br><br> protip:hardmode: pay close attention to everything they get for free versus have to pay for. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> i just realized how over your heads this is gonna go. </br>  <br>Didn't hate him, didn't know anything about him. First time I saw it, I smoked some weed with friends, they turned on the movie, waxed on about how great it was, and I was quite unimpressed. Ended up falling asleep about 20 minutes before it ended.<br>Second time, I did watch it alone while smoking, to give it a fair shake since I had been watching it with friends who were the "wait for this part its so crazy, look, did you see that, let's rewind it, ha ha" type of movie watchers that mess up the flow of the movie. Still was pretty bleh, later learned a lot about Hunter S. Thompson from another friend who thought he was the shit, and it all clicked. Anyway, have fun assuming all your assumptions, you'll need some more practice if you want to be a true assmaster someday.</br></br>  <br>This wine fucking sucks</br>  <br> smoked a few weed. <br><br>/a/ is calling.</br></br></br>  <br>your mum sucks <br>discuss this mofucka</br></br>  <br>What is this movie even called ??</br>  <br>With retard friends like that f.e but here is your main problem<br> smoked some weed <br>Yeah nah, nah.</br></br></br>  <br>Or I could just watch a better movie and not obsessively take notes on a movie about some edgelord and his edgelord friend doing drugs in Las Vegas when they're supposed to be getting work done. <br>At the end of the day, Hunter S. Thompson was a burnout loser and this book/movie is about him being a burnout loser. This is why most of you teenagers and early 20's folks are so into this movie, because you have yet to realize how completely hollow and silly this "lifestyle" is. <br>Like Hunter S. Thompson realized, before he blew his brains out.</br></br></br>  <br>Are you high yet?</br>  <br>Reading comprehension is not your strong suit, is it, my dyslexic friend?<br>Try re-reading what I posted slowly, using your finger to trace the words as you go along. I find this helps beginners to follow the sentence structure more effectively.</br></br>  I did not realize i had done so much acid because i had done so much pcp.<br><br>This movie was on.<br><br>I've been some places, man.<br>Places, man.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can bet that its you the one that sucks, faggot.</br>  It has cool scenes but yeah it's overrated. Still decent but not great in any way.  <br> not obsessively take notes on a movie about some edgelord and his edgelord friend doing drugs in Las Vegas <br>But you're obsessively pointing out how bad of a movie it is, while admitting in the same breath that you smoked weed while watching it as if that would alter anything, you're hopeless.</br></br>  <br>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</br>  <br>One of the only people in this thread that actually knows.</br>  I enjoyed it, it was pretty funny and overall an entertaining movie<br><br>It wasn't the greatest movie ever and anyone who treats it as such, or tries to gain any "deep insights" from it is a fool. It's just fun and entertaining <br><br>Inb4 HURR DURR MUH SYMBOLISM MUH NIXON YOU DIDNT GET IT, that probably comes from the fags who fell asleep half way through 2001: A Space Odyssey and haven't watched a Kubrick film since</br></br></br></br>  <br> This guy disagrees with my taste in movies! <br> He is hopeless! Try in vain to convince him how deep and edgy the movie is! <br><br>How're those drugs working out for you?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought it was OK but loses some tempo along the way making it feel just a little bit too long.<br><br>Over all, 7.2/10</br></br></br>  Watched the whole movie without checkin how many times left, so a good movie  <br>He's just making fun of you.<br><br>I'm just making fun of you.<br><br>This is the internet.<br><br>That's all that exists here.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I watched this while checkin ma dubs</br>  <br>I'm not even defending the movie, I'm saying that you're a hopeless faggot for smoking weed and watching it. Were you twelve at the time?</br>  <br>You realize that tribal life throughout history has and still today revolves around potent hallucinogens.<br><br>Are they hollow people too, anon?</br></br></br>  Its a funny movie <br><br>I get high outside tho</br></br>  <br>never seen it</br>  <br>kek not paying shit and completely destroying 2 vegas hotel rooms</br>  <br>He's a straight edge faggot, doesn't have the slightest clue about anything past weed. Let him live his truly hollow existence.</br>  <br>You're not required to reply to threads</br>  <br>You've killed them, op<br>The only sound left in the thread is the wind whistling over their tweenage corpses</br></br>  saw the film, 9/10, read the book 10/10 both are da best  <br> Tribal life etc. <br><br>Yes, I am quite certain you are an expert on tribal cultures, since you yourself have lived amongst them for many years yourself and just recently emerged from the virgin rain forests of the Amazon to educate the denizens of this fine anonymous image board on the vastly superior hallucinogenicentric culture you are a representative of.

I should take pictures of this and show it to a bunch of chucklefucks on my favorite anonymous imageboard! They'll get a kick out of this!".  <br> proceeds to take multiple pictures of bloody anal discharge in the toilet bowl and on toilet tissue with his phone, then uploads them to his computer and posts them on 4chan's random board. <br><br>You must live a really wonderful life, OP.
