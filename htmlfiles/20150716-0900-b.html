I hate being manly.<br><br>I want to be a girl. I want to think like a girl, act like a girl, feel like a girl. But no idea where to start.<br><br>Am I strange? Am I alone?</br></br></br></br>  Go to tumblr, they're experts on hating men  <br>I don't hate men. I hate being a man.<br>Not quite the same.</br></br>  <br>just come out asap<br>to friends, family, whatever<br>source: me</br></br></br>  <br>whybdo you hate being a man</br>  <br>But I'm scared to admit this to anyone in person.<br>Maybe my psychiatrist?

I feel like I'm not the person I could or should be. And when I picture my ideal self, I do not picture a man. Maybe hate is the wrong word.<br><br>It's weird.</br></br></br>  <br>I honestly don't know. Although tumblr fags say being a women is hard, I feel like there's more options for you if you're a girl.</br>  <br>seems to me you have been indoctrinated to not understand yourself as a male, in society and universally, but rather that younmodel yourself off feminine tropes.</br>  <br>well, thats definately true.<br><br>women are extremely privileged, whereas men are disenfranchised, reviled and disregarded.</br></br></br>  I just wish I can change back and forth between genders. That way I get the benefits of both..... I secretly want to bate as a girl  <br>Should I speak to my psychiatrist about this?<br>He is sworn to secrecy. But I just feel concerned about getting judged.</br></br>  <br>they get so many people they don't care if one guy wishes he were a girl. Or just become a girl.

If she was hot enough yeah for sure  <br>im to young for this</br>  <br>i'm already dating your mom so yeah</br>  fuck no  id probably financially support her in exchange for sex, but i wouldnt get in an intimate long-term relationship with her.  <br>REKKKKKKKT</br>  <br><br>Depends on what the situation is. For example my general policy is no because I don't know what the status with the ex is. See at this point in my life the kid doesn't scare me its the dickhead lurking around.<br><br>So, I once met a woman with a kid. Started as just friends until I found out her situation and that is that her ex was a total nutjob and just disappeared. Him gone permanently with no chance of reconciliation equals play ball on my end.</br></br></br></br>  Used goods, shows she's worthless and loves to fuck around. Side bitch only  well, if she had that child with nobody, if is just "puff" happend, yes i would.  2 pussies better than one  Not even if it was my own  <br>-I did<br>-I'll never do it again</br></br>  <br>Rekt<br><br>and yeah OP, I would. <br>Wouldn't get too commited though, maybe a few fucks</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Might wanna look up child support laws there bud, you'll end up paying it without even being the father when you leave her.</br></br>  What a stupid question, OP.<br><br>The child is proof that she sucks at making good decisions.<br><br>What more evidence do you need?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Wait when is summer over again?</br></br>  <br>I'd rather be alone most of the time, don't want to raise bastards. I would consider adopting child more than dating woman /w children. ( Unless she was a widow)</br>  <br>DAMN !!<br><br>And yes dear OP, if she is hot, why not?</br></br></br>  <br>If they were older and established yes if they are just some chick who got prego early nope, I have banged many of them though</br>  <br>What if previous partner got killed through no fault of his own? Like a drunk driver ran him over or he got stabbed by a mugger?<br><br>Sometimes shit happens.</br></br></br>  <br><br>It means she fucking puts out for real, no doubt brother.</br></br>  <br>No. I'm not one for playing baby daddy.</br>  <br>Summer is a myth you know.</br>  <br>All the cucks in here wanting to raise another's child and getting a rekt gaping pussy after popping out a kid.</br>  <br>No</br>    <br>It's like buying a game on a flea market, and resume playing on the former owners save. No thanks. I would not.</br>  I've banged a few single moms all between the ages of 18-24, but no I would not get in a long term with her BC I'm not taking care of someone else's kid  <br>You watch too many romance movies</br>  <br>pretty sure my lawyer and history of dealing exclusively in cash will make a mess out of that.</br>  <br>No</br>  <br><br>No.<br>I did'nt get a vasectomy for nothing.</br></br></br>  <br> waiting used goods  <br><br>no thanks i'm not a cuck.</br></br></br>  <br>sure. but I wouldn't let it get serious. there's no way I'm taking on someone elses baggage.</br>  <br> banged a few single moms <br> mfw its a fleshlight </br></br>  <br>Depends how old the child is. Nothing over 6 I reckon.</br>  <br>Make cps think mom is crazy.<br>Put the child up for the adoptions.<br>Build mom back up, but no refunds.<br> make new ones.<br>Good to go</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck? Yes.<br>Date date as serious business? No.</br></br>  <br>underage B&amp;</br>  depends on if the kid is gonna grow up to be a sex kitten... fer saaax...  <br> Haters gonna hate us cause they anus </br>  <br> some girl had a kid 5 years ago <br> she hasn't dated anybody in ages <br> somehow, fucking her makes you a cuck <br><br>I don't think you know anything about anything.<br>Get out there and stick your dick in places. It's fun.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you are literally retarded. adopted children are bastards too.</br>  <br>and by that, i mean the child</br>  <br>yes, as long as were not merging our assets or living together. Time and emotional energy is one thing but I'm not going to actively invest my money in someone else's kid.</br>  <br>yeah, but i understand why a lot of anons wouldn't</br>  <br><br>Definitely. If she's got teenagers stay the fuck away. Remember what a fucktard you were as a teen. Yeah, who wants to listen to some little shit disrespecting you and telling you that can't do shit cause you ain't their daddy.</br></br>  No, especially if it's mine.    <br>Is it my child?</br>  <br>on the other hand, you then get to give her a spanking :3</br>  Leave before the kid calls you daddy  <br>OP said date not fuck, learn to read fucking retard.</br>  If the kid was a nigger, no  <br>Games don't work like that. Its more like buying a used console that's been duck.</br>  <br>That's like playing another dude's savegame</br>  1 chold yes. 2 no. Every woman I've slept with that had more than two the inside of their pussy is a gaping hole. The sex sucks. You can definitely tell a large object was in there  Boy, no<br>Girl, yes...but only if she's really young...like before they can talk.</br>  <br>dont know, didnt had a threesome yet</br>  Sure, why not? Seems like /b/tards only go for girls who are, like themselves, virgins.  <br>the one you want to date or the child?</br>  <br> Games don't work like that. <br>I guess you were not around for the cartridge eras</br></br>  <br>You're fucking retarded, I've banged chicks that have had 3 kids with tighter pussy than those with none. Its about muscle control and kegals. My ex had three kids, but she had the kung fu ninja grip with the pussy. You're dating lazy chicks or have a small dick.</br>  <br>At least you're playing a game.<br>If we're going for the game analogy, why only play one game?<br>Play allllll the games</br></br></br>  <br>why not both?</br>  <br>I 2nd this.. I dated one for 2 years, fucking nightmare. Don't ever think for one sec that seeing a single mother is a good idea. Guys listen up, she's gonna try and suck up to you on a level you've never seen before to make you 'buy the used car', don't. This bitch sucked my dick like she needed it more than air. She cooked well. She did everything to try and make the sale. None of it was worth the shit I had to deal with. I'm out now and look back and wonder what the fuck I was thinking.</br>  <br>this <br>wife was a horrible lay before the kid. After kegels she's tighter than ever and we can do a lot more positions since it does not hurt her anymore. I swear she could crush walnuts.</br></br>  <br>What are you? 12?</br>  <br>Well no one is being specific.</br>  <br>Nah man. If we're doing this, then let's do it. There ar ehundres of games out there that are terrible and not even worth looking at, let a lone playing. I don't play shitty games at all.<br> I will fuck literally anyone though. </br></br>  <br><br>Holy shit this is exactly what I was going to write.<br><br>She had two daughters 15 and 14.<br><br>She sucked the living life out of my dick, took it in the ass and let me fuck her anywhere. But fuck me the baggage was unreal</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>sure, but not for the mother :^)</br>  <br>from the context of the original statement he could have only been talking about a cartridge with internal memory. (n64 GBA some snes and sega games)</br>  <br>Fuck you kid. COD is the only thing worth living for. BattleToads and old cartridge game are horrible like sex with you mom, but I still hit it just to let you father watch me cum on her.</br>  <br>Fine, play alllllll the (worthwhile) games (that you can afford)<br>Including the oldies but goodies. N64 anyone?</br></br>  if depends if i have to hang around the kid, then no fucking way. if i dont have to see that shithead then sure. <br>i fucking hate children.</br>  <br>literally the worst system! That's like the asian hobo category of sex</br>  <br>Well, you got me.</br>  <br>in principle, no.<br><br>if she's very special, the kid is alright and there is no asshole father interfering, maybe.</br></br></br>  <br>worst system was GBA without a doubt. 90% of it's catalog were movie games and stuff on par with flash games. Only a handful of decent rpgs and most of them were not even localized.</br>  <br>Koptek</br>  <br>Obviously never heard of Panasonic CDO...</br>  <br>mine had a boy 8 and girl 11. No one in that house knew how to communicate without screaming, besides me. From the time they'd wake up until they went to school it was everyone screaming at everyone. 'YOUR GOING TO BE LATE, HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU!!'ect. I learned to stay in the bedroom in the mornings because I couldn't handle the noise. One of the worst parts was her parents lived on the 2nd floor so they'd come down three times a day have their nose in everything. Couldn't mind their own business for a single day. They slowly started loosing respect for me for not 'laying down the law and yelling at the kids'..as if that was my job.</br>  <br>B-b-but i like asian hobos...<br>God-tier bang. if you've never had your dick chomped down like an egg foo yung for 5 dorra I would highly recommend the experience.</br></br>  <br>lost</br>  <br> No young mother has ever lost a partner. <br>What world do you live in?</br></br>  I would think to myself, 'she's a lot of fun to fuck and hang out with but her kids are always around and that sucks' then it hit me like lightning..I fucking hate kids. Life has been better after I realized and accepted it. I always disliked children, I was just in the closet about it for years. Now that I openly talk about it, people look at me like I'm a monster, but at least I'm not living a lie. <br><br>Had a conversation with a friend of mine a few days ago and he admitted I converted him. He said 'last time we hung out you said kids should be banned from all bars and I didn't agree with you, but the other day I had a incident and now I totally agree with you'</br></br>  <br> tfw love of life is coming back into picture and might want to rekindle things but she has a kid now <br>wat do?</br></br>  <br><br>Maybe. Not sure though.</br></br>  <br><br><br>some dank memes guys good job</br></br></br>  <br><br>How old are you?</br></br>  <br>I did for a little while, it sucks.</br>  <br>move on, she'll use you until you're dry and move on they always do. At least find something that has a lower overhead.</br>  <br>i would rather date the child</br>  <br>nope. any bitch dumb/crazy enough to get knocked up and end up single aint worth any man's time. raising another man's kid is cuckoldry.</br>  <br>are you nuts?</br>  <br>stay the fuck away. delete all contact information. The best way to get her out of your head is to get something new. Learn a few magic tricks online and head out to the bar with a deck of cards and pick up some strange. Leave your ex to the hell she's created. The best revenge is just to do well. Fuck some hot single childless strange and live your life. Don't be that guy that picks up other peoples trash. If you don't listen to this advice and you involve yourself, your going to have a new example of what regret means.</br>  <br>Currently dating a girl, who's son's father died before he was born. drunk driver.</br>  <br>Nope. Her mistake isn't mine.</br>  <br>31 now, was 26 then</br>  <br>why is that?</br>  <br>I'm not dating your mom</br>  <br>Everyone hear that? Get out your pencils and paper, this is called self respect.</br>  <br>especially the ones who live on welfare and still post on facebook about how having the kid was the best thing they ever did</br>  <br><br>Yeah, kinda feel this anyway, keep sort of hoping someone is going to tell me something that magically makes me feel OK about raising some loser's kid but it ain't happening.</br></br>  <br>Fuck no, you'll just get stuck raising some other asshole's brat, and their lives are usually a fucking trainwreck by this point.</br>  <br>he was drunk driving or he was killed by a drunk driver?</br>  <br><br>See I guess your set then.<br><br>When I was 25 I thought the same way but I'm now 31 and have warmed up to the idea of kids.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nope the fuck out, Bitch didn't want you before and went and got a kid with some other cunt which means they're still in the picture somewhat. Nah mang, drop that shit and find someone better</br>  <br> house on fire <br> married parents die while kid stays at grandparents or friends <br><br>I admit, it is not likely, but it can happen.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, tried it twice, it doesn't work<br><br>#1<br> meet girl when out drinking <br> we start dating <br> "I have a kid but my parents look after it" <br> I can believe this, we met in London, she was a work addict, and when we aren't working we are out drinking <br> her kid is 4, she barely sees it <br> it doesn't even call her mum <br> she doesn't even have a picture of the kid <br> dating for a year <br> she wants me to meet her parents and her kid <br> we visit them <br> kid is not fussed about her arriving <br> all get along, kid seems a bit off with visitors <br> go home to London <br> "Anon I think we should settle down in a town or something, maybe have a family" <br> we are are a pretty good place with our jobs why the change of heart? <br> "I want to be a mother to Tommy" <br> uh oh <br> "Can we settle down Anon?" <br> I wanted to work for a few more years before I settle down <br> she goes loopy <br> starts screaming all sorts of shit, asking if she isn't good enough because of her c-section scar or because she is "used goods" <br> I try to calm her down <br> "Anon I will make it straight forward, either we have a baby or settle down or we are over" <br> I choose the latter <br> she goes crazy <br> we break up <br><br>#2<br> dating for 18 months <br> "Anon I want you to meet my family" <br> go to meet them <br> kid runs up to her and calls her "mummy" <br> I'm pissed that she hid that she has a kid and never told me <br> "I didn't want to tell you because you would never date me" <br> turns out her baby daddy lives next door to her parents and has a good relationship with her kid <br> she is also good friends with him <br> I never knew about her kid or ex <br> we argue <br> "You are being unreasonable Anon what does it matter?" <br> we nearly bought a house together, another bullet dodged </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And the grandparents and no other family won't take them and they end up in the system? What a dumb comment, of course there are 4 children in the whole world who are in the system who are not bastards. Your right.</br>  <br>and you're saying we SHOULDN'T fuck these women? sounds like they're awesome</br>  <br>scenario #1: you take her back and raise her kid='fail'<br><br>scenario #2: You stay away from her and never talk to her again='pass<br><br>scenario #3: You talk her into giving up custody of her child to her parents for you and you live with her without the kid='Bonus level'</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Jesus fuck. #2 is my worst nightmare.</br></br>  <br>You're a retard if you continue with this relationship. She will eat up your financial, emotional, and mental resources and then leave you... possibly after shitting out a kid of yours that you're stuck paying for. Run Away. <br><br>On a related note- I am currently talking to a 37 year old married milf. Waiting for a good time for her to sneak off and get a hotel for the weekend. I fully intend on fucking every hole and cumming inside her.</br></br></br>  <br> learn magic <br> try to pick up girls with it <br>You're a special kind of loser.</br></br></br>  <br>the driver was an alcohol</br>  <br>Real talk if you just go in with the right frame of mind you can love that kid. But it seems like your problem is that your bitter about being scorned by the woman and are projecting that onto the child. Get right with that and you can make it work.</br>  <br>the older the get, still single, the worse they are. always.</br>  <br>Dating=fucking, dipshit.</br>  <br>I had my feeling set in stone from a early age. Grew up poor with a dad that barely made ends meet yet continued to have kids at a alarming rate. Found out when I got older it was because he had a fear of dieing alone and wanted to make sure a large family was at his bedside. Meanwhile he couldn't afford all these kids so my child hood was spend being dirt poor.<br><br>My dad was married 3 times and I have 2 brothers and 5 sisters. Lesson was learned. Having kids is the biggest mistake one can make. My gf saying 'i'm pregnant' is like your doctor saying 'you have aids'. I'd say by the age of 10 I knew I wasn't going to have kids or get married. Nothing in my life ever changed that point of view but then I can't see how anything would after watching my father.</br></br></br>  <br>Absolutely not. Children are one of my deal breakers. I'm in my thirties, too, not underage b&amp;. I just hate kids.<br><br>I will fuck a bitch with kids, just no relationship.</br></br></br>  <br>No, I would date her on my own.</br>  <br><br>Really depends on the actual situation, but I'm pretty sure I wouldn't get familiar with the specifics soon enough so the answer is a resounding NO</br></br>  <br>virgin detected</br>  <br>my childhood chrush got one and i still would date the shit out of her. and her child too</br>  <br><br>I have. Dated a chick who had a 6 month old. It was so hot to have her ride me, all the while I'm sitting up, biting and sucking on her nipples, drinking her breast milk.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;628145650 <br>gonna have to stand up and clap at my tv now</br>  <br>I would date the child</br>  Probably. <br>Usually there needs to be room for one more. <br>Bringing up ONLY somebody elses child is to beta, even by my standards.</br></br>  <br>well it's easy to do which is why I recommended it. Also it works, well.</br>  <br>I learned a little more about cyber stalking from it<br>Google their name in quotes with facebook ie<br>"Anon Anonson" facebook<br>and find their comments on groups, mothers can't resist posting on groups related to being parents, also find their posts relevant to other shit, they might bitch about an ex and use a group to complain about being left with a baby, you would be shocked how much people over share online.<br><br>Every girl I had a date planned with I pretty much did a background check on her, turned down women on/after first dates if I found out that they had a kid ("A friend of mine knows you and said you have a kid? I don't think you mentioned that"), many would be upset and demand to know who I know, then I met my wife, we got along fine and she didn't have a kid, either that or she has hidden it well.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Date? Yes. But not marry. Date just long enough to watch her breastfeed while I masturbate, then dump.</br>  <br>Nope. Unless it was mine of course...</br>  <br>just remember to take the used condom with you because these bitches use what ever tactics they need to these days.</br>  <br> hidden it well. <br><br>shovel with fresh dirt stuck on it?</br></br></br>  <br>spit coffee</br>  <br>it's all over at solid food. No thank you. Them nips get real dark and huge.</br>  Date/Fuck, but that's where you have to draw the line.  Ive been dating a 38 milf with 3 kids (18,17,12) and im 22. Shes the best girlfriend ive ever had. Much better than anyone around my age.  <br>Why didn't you fuck her daughters?</br>    <br>No, because a girl with a child is like playing off of someone else's save file on a game. You wanna start fresh.</br>  <br>How many times has that worked you? Honestly. That's like a cliche for bad pickups.</br>  <br>Nah I've got no inherent problem with the kid, or her. It's just a fuck load of extra problems. I'm still young enough to have my own version of it. I'd let it all go years ago, and come to terms with the breakup until a mutual friend said he spoke to her and the way she spoke about me made it obvious I could get her back if I wanted.<br><br>I actually broke up with her, but over the years never met anyone nearly good as her.</br></br></br>  I kind of feel like the men that are taking on these single mothers secretly think that what they're doing is heroic and one day someone is going to metal for it. Meanwhile they're ruining their lives and no one is going to pat you on the back and tell you what a good person you are. It's going to be wasted years and you'll wake up one day and think about the life you could of had if you left her alone. If your that board then take up a hobby. I fly remote controlled helicopters.  <br>honestly 14 and 15 is a decent age, they start to become self dependent and shit, its not like a damn 4 year old...</br>  I already have, I'm 18 and roughly 2 months ago I was fucking a 28 year old, she had 2 kids, one of them was 4 and the other was 6. It ended after a month since she wanted a serious relationship instead of just fuck buddies. :^(  <br>Don't be silly. It's just kind of sick to molest your own children, that's why we do it.</br>  <br>lost</br>  no way, single mothers are trash   if she is still lactating <br>yes<br><br> if she is fat <br>no<br><br> if she's ghetto <br>no<br><br> if she only has 1 child <br>yes<br><br> if she hates video games and anime <br>no</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Never again. They're cheating sluts.</br>  <br>If she let me suckle too</br>  <br>Yeah, means she's been up for the old in/out at least once in her life</br>  <br>lol something is wrong with her, what 28yrs old girl wants a 18 yrs old boy to be with.<br><br>gg tho, keep fuckin dem milfs</br></br></br>  Hell no. I'm not trying to shop at the goodwill  <br>Honestly, it works well, I don't wear a cape and walk in the bar and release birds. I don't even mention it for the first hour. I'll already have been talking with someone for awhile before I start to make things vanish from the table. For me it's about being subtle and not flashy. I was on a date one time and I was making small thing disappear from the table, then I held up a beer bottle and said, you want to see this vanish? She said 'if you toss that across the room I'm walking out'. They love it because they are all over grown children.</br>  yes but my standards would be WAY higher for her, like almost impossibly high  <br>dont do, its her bastard child, not yours</br>  <br><br>nice</br></br>  <br>I'm dating a woman with a kid. Not because I'm trying to provide a father figure to the child, or help the woman with a heavy burden.<br><br>But because she sucks my cock enthusiastically, cooks well and does anal. I'm going to marry this slut and put my seed in her. Fuck your remote controlled helicopters</br></br></br>  <br>post pic of yourself or stfu. You're probably just good looking.</br>  only a cucklord would date a single mother and raise another man's kid<br><br>leave single mothers to starve and die with thieir shit child</br></br>   nigger child <br><br>Fuck no. Never gonna raise a nigglett again. Worst experience in my life.</br></br>  <br>wise man, she tried to play her hand and you walked. She'll try and ease into it smoother with the next guy. Makes me thing of the mother walking around the park with the stroller, shamelessly looking for new daddy. 'Hey world!, I farted out this problem because I have poor planing and decision making skills, anyone want to help out? '</br>  <br>but but what if that was your child, and you didn't get on with the mom?</br>  I did. She was a crazy fuck. Didnt give two shits about her kid  <br>"date"? As in go for a drink or movies, then fuck? Yeah, sure.<br>Form a long-term relationship? naaaah</br></br>  <br>Not in a million years or for all the gold in china.</br>  <br>im not some degenerate that would do that. I don't knock up girls at parties or whatever, I wear rubbers with girlfriends. if somehow a girlfriend did get pregnant and doesn't want to do an abortion id get a paternity test and then raise my child if it were mine</br>  <br>I wish you had my story<br> Met my gf 17 months ago <br> Dated 2 months <br> cuddling one night I get kicked <br> femanon, I was just kicked <br> no you weren't, that's impossible <br> we lived a ways apart so I knew nothing about her lack or periods. <br> mfw 6 months of dating and she pops out a kid <br> mwf my daughter calls me kitty instead of daddy </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>don't know how to remove EXIF data and it'd take too long to read about it and do it to post so I just don't. I'd say I'm about a 7/10. I'm very introverted so my whole thing is when I'm out and doing tricks it's sort of like a character I'm doing. Kind of like when you do a impersonation of someone. I'm doing a impersonation of a confident guy making jokes while doing crazy shit with cards.</br>  <br>dis</br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>top fucking kek</br>  <br>This</br>  <br>nigger what the fuck are you doing, don't even think about it</br>  <br><br>This is true. If you've been in the kid's life long enough, a judge can force you to pay child support.</br></br>  <br> marry this slut and put my seed in her. <br>Fast forward a few years from now. Your at home and this baby is screaming it's head off, your wondering where the fuck she is because you know she got off work a few hours ago. She's out slutting it up at the club with her whore friends because she needs validation that she's still hot shit.<br><br>Simultaneously, I'm miles away in another state in a open field flying my Blade CP pro because I have all the freedom I want. Also I have all the money I need because I'm not spending on some shitty kid.</br></br></br></br>  <br> dating this beta fag <br> hate my life every moment im with him <br> fuck this im leaving <br> find a nice alpha <br> fuck him daily <br> love it so much <br> im going to marry this guy <br> get preggo <br> alpha leaves me <br> whatdo.jpg <br> who would help me take care of this baby? <br> Oh, beta will because he would do anything for me <br>This is what is happening</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nailed it, and it needs to stop. These single moms are raising the people that are going to car jack me when I'm 50. We should start a movement to publicly shame single mothers. They should be treated as 2nd class citizens kind of like pedophiles that get out of prison.</br>  <br>This. Jesus, how fucking gay are some people.<br><br>Personally, I wouldn't date a girl with a kid. Not for some bull reason, just I'm 24, have a decent job, and currently getting in better shape (was never at neckbeard levels).<br>Why date chick with a kid when my dates are solid looking, and soon will be better looking.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Married to one.</br>  <br>Weren't they already treated like that before the 60s?<br><br>God damn hippies</br></br></br>  It'll be a cold day in hell when I decide to become what I hate most; a step-parent.<br><br>So fuck no.</br></br>  <br>I admire men who are unable to produce healthy semen. God I would have loved to lived this life firing blanks. Instead, I've had tons of pregnancy scares 'some real, some were just shit test', and I've had to pay for 3 abortions.</br>  <br>If you read my other posts you'd know I broke up with her and also I could get get back from him if I wanted</br>  <br>good point. Can you imagine living in the 50's? My dad told me a story about how my grandfather punched my grandmother so hard she was bleeding and called the police. He said when the cop got there, the cop said to my grandmother, 'why aren't you minding your husband'? God fucking damn it I'd kill to have those conditions today. As a added bonus, blacks kept their fucking mouths shut and respected people.</br>  <br>must have been wonderful. Can't understand how anyone in their right mind can say we have made "progress" since then.</br>  <br> fast forward a few years <br> she's at home with a crying baby most of the time, being a mother because she still believes in gender-based roles for the most part <br> she spends her nights cooking dinner, playing games or reading because she doesn't have any girlfriends as I've dragged her away from her friends and family into a new city/state where she knows no one <br> she works a part time job and it's her only exposure to people outside of our house, but she's introverted and closing in on 30 so slutty girls don't want to drag her to a club because it's an inherent cock-block <br><br> Meanwhile, you are sticking tiny propeller blades into your urethra on live cams because you're bored. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd say his is more accurate than yours. Enjoy your impending misery anon.</br>  Na, not raising some whore's bastard spawn.<br>Would you tend your neighbours garden while yours is a barren wasteground?</br>  <br><br> raise my child if it were mine <br><br>You say this now, but how ready are you to just drop your current lifestyle and raise a kid?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Never wanted kids, hooked up with a chick with 2, biological father out of the picture, in jail, or dead, fuck if I knew, chick was fun. She was the perfect gf. Sex was phenomenal. Feisty, submissive, and all was well until I realized what I was unintentionally signing up for. Someone else's problems. I liked her a lot, one might even say that I loved her, and it broke my heart to break up with her because deep down, I knew I never wanted to be anyone's father. Broke her heart too, really bad. And I regret that but I can't pretend I'm not who I am. Our relationship ran its course. There were some great times. But she was alone with those kids and I would have had to be their father. So I left her. That girl loved me...she needed a hero to take care of her and those kids and that wasn't who I wanted to be.<br><br>My advice anons, unless you are certain you want children, and you can fully accept raising another man's children...and in many cases, that'll be all because chicks like that don't want to have more, so with the prospect of raising kids that will never be your blood relation, and you're okay with that, never, EVER date a woman with kids. Not seriously. Hit and run, gents. Take my word for it, once you figure out that you don't want to be responsible for some unless shitcan's seed, it'll hurt when you move on more than you would ever know. <br><br>Best not even get involved.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you see how my version doesn't require anyone to do anything for my happiness..see how your version requires people who are not yourself doing things you need them to do for you to be happy? 30 is the rough patch because that's when the looks start fading and they go out and test the field to see what they can still get away with. it's like 'o shit, I'm getting older, better go fuck a stranger from the bar so I can feel young and hot again', all the while your on the side lines with her kid wondering what the fuck. Watch dude, from 30 to about 34 she'll be running circles around you because her clock is ticking away and she's freaking out that her pussy is no longer the free pass to life.</br>  Only if she is exceptional and only single because the father died.  <br>Thats good advice. Sorry to hear about your broken heart</br>  Done it. Biggest mistake of my life.  <br>Good advice. It just seems like everyone is so fucked up these days. Even if the women has no kids most of them are fucking nuts anyway. I've dated about 20 women in my life and I don't feel like a single one of them had their head on strait. I've never dated someone from another country, maybe I'll give that a try.</br>  <br>Me too. Doesn't end well</br>  It's good when these threads pop up because I have a huge opinion on this topic and it's not popular. This kind of gives me a outlet to type it out, also it's nice to see other people that think the same way for once.  I'm actually dating a girl with two children so yes  <br>unless it was my child, no.</br>  <br>rekt</br>  <br>That depends, are you a child OP?</br>  <br>Do they call you daddy?</br>  <br>Please don't get back with her, she will not put you above her child. Especially because you are not the child's father and you were not her first choice to have this kid.</br>  <br>Single Mom Syndrome (SMS). I won't be there to see how right I am but trust me, it isn't going to end well. How would you say it's going so far?</br>  <br>Just don't. It will save you some grief.</br>  <br>I see, anon, but your entire version is dependent on conjecture, thus you have to generalize, because you don't know the girl. I do. I know her thoroughly and the reason she is in the place she's in right now. I know enough to feel confident that I know how to make this work.<br><br>You got me in the money department, though. Then again, she'll be pooping out my baby soon so I'll be paying that money anyway...</br></br></br>  80% of you tards will end up raising at least one bastard and not know it.<br><br>The other 20% will eventually figure out that you and your wife should not have a Black / Hispanic / Asian baby and will bug out</br></br>  <br>Lol. I banged all my girlfriends without condom and they never got pregnant</br>  <br>your right, I don't know her but I do know women. <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=BtY<wbr>IyLE7QFs</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>Im dating a girl with a kid, he's 3 years old, and she said that she wants to have another child with me</br>  No.<br>Only start long-term relationship with virgins, or at lest not a slut fucked &gt;3 guys.<br>If you mean hit and run, then what ever</br></br>  For anyone still on the fence, there is no need for you to ruin your lives to gain first hand experience. Watch other great men fall and learn from their shatter lives. When the next sexy women comes around trying to trick you into thinking you have a unicorn, remember this.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=SaC<wbr>-2lj6HNg</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Some 32 year old with 2 kids died from a heart attack playing hockey with a coworker of mine. Sometimes shit happens.</br>    <br> she said that she wants to have another child with me <br>Translation: she wants to lock your ass down. You can leave at the drop of a hat right now so she has to keep on her shit to keep you around. Once she obtains a hybrid of you all bets are off. Once that kid pops out, your sex life is over, her weight balloons and all of the sudden your needs don't seem to matter. It's a power move, please tell me your not considering it?</br></br>  There are only 2 kinds of women with children<br><br> Sluts <br> mothers <br><br>Sluts go clubbing and leave their friends to watch their baby.<br><br>Mother's take care of the baby and place its needs above her wants.<br><br>If you can find a single MOTHER I'd imagine many of you lonely neckbeards would have more chance than you think. Here is a woman who is vulnerable and more than likely has experienced the true cold nature of our world for the first time. If you can make room in your white armor for a baby I can guarantee you will have a very humble and grateful woman on your dick. <br><br>Nothing good comes without sacrifice, and the only think you have to lose here is some time raising another man's baby. If you can look past his/her origins and give the child a new future, mom eill do anything to secure it. Consider it supply and demand.<br><br> single mom's in low demand <br> single non black men in high demand <br> take your pic of the litter <br> ?????? <br> profit <br><br>Plus all the bills for the child are paid for by government subsidies (amerifats) until you say "I do"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'll give you that, but it's the acceptation. 90% are reckless fucks. Most of these women decided from a young age that they were going to get married and have a large family and be a mom because they romanticized the idea of it. Well when no one would marry you because your a hollow piece of shit then they decide they'll get that baby no matter what.<br><br>If she decides she wants a baby, she's getting a baby, one way or another. Doesn't matter who the father is, doesn't matter if she has income, doesn't even matter if she has a place to stay. They have this idea that it'll work itself out. I'm suppose to feel bad for these people? I'm suppose to help them? When you make choices that are so poor that it causes a 18 year financial problem, maybe you should kill yourself, because the alternative is to continue living and creating messes that other people need to keep cleaning up.</br></br></br>  <br>Dude, you go to properties and remove details. Also, nobodys gonna dox u cuz no vagina.</br>  <br>Lol just after you say 'i do' all kind of laws will on her side. The services is only to make you take the bait.<br>Im not saying all , but almost all single mom are like that</br></br>  <br> Sluts <br> mothers <br>the only difference between then two is where they are at in their lives. Sluts turn into mothers after they have worn themselves out and are looking for stability. Always remember to check the 'hoe-fax'. 18-30 spend fucking and sucking everything that gives your crotch tingles, then 34 hits and they want to act like saints and talk about forgiveness and leaving the past in the past,<br><br>You know who talks about forgiveness the most and the loudest?.. it's people who have a lot that needs to be forgiven. People who have done unspeakable shitty things in the past promote the idea of forgiveness harder than anyone. It's like people in Scientology yelling at people 'what are your crimes!'</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Prenuptial agreements prevent that bullshit. Any single mother won't be bitching about that if you're taking her little shit under your wing. Make sure the kid is like 5 or older before considering it though. Babies are sex killers for like 3 years until they learn that you can in fact make it from night to morning in one long nap called going the fuck to bed lol</br>  Certainly.<br><br>It would "slip in the bath" soon after.<br><br>How sad.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Everybody has mothers bro.<br><br>I'm sure your mom did risqué stuff growing up too. Every generation thinks it invented sex and the deviance/kinkiness that follows. There isn't anything new under the sun bro. All women come with flaws just like us. Eventually one will prove to be more positive than negative, or you'll become lonely enough to settle.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't trust that for a sec. seen too many lives ruined on this site. sux because I always want to contribute to the 'faces of /b/' 'battle stations' 'pets' 'You want you loose', too many sneaky assholes. It isn't all the things I know I could do to hide personal information, it's the one thing I didn't think of that'll bite me in the ass.</br>  <br>Not unless I had a kid myself.</br>  <br> Would you date a girl with a child? <br><br>no women.<br>no kids.</br></br></br></br>  <br>  acceptation <br>  your  <br>  it'll </br></br></br>  <br>Depends on the girl, the child and as others have mentioned, what involvement (if any) the ex has. I generally would not have an issue dating such a woman but there'd be exceptions.</br>  <br> I'm sure your mom did risqué stuff growing up too <br>yeah no shit, and when I was old enough to reach the pull cord for the attic I found the photos to prove it. I don't think I'll ever settle for anything. The fear of loneliness is enough to push a lot of men into arrangements but that isn't a fear I have so that exploit doesn't work on me. I say exploit because women bank on that fear all the time. That's why when I speak openly about this topic I get a lot of hate. Women quickly start to realize that there is nothing to be gained from me so I become worthless to them. That's a good thing as far as I am considered. I don't want to be a resource for bitches.<br><br>If you won't give them a baby, won't pay for dinner, won't pay for their rent, then your not a good resource for them. Time to move onto the next sucker because my wallet is shut tight and my time is extremely valuable to me because I have self respect.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I dated a slut with a kid. She only cared about getting some D.</br>  <br> grammer nazi <br> taking issue with spelling instead of engaging topic <br> perception of 1up-ing me by pointing out errors </br></br></br>  <br>underrated post. i lold</br>  <br>top kek</br>  <br>too bad more and more of these are not honored in court. There are a shocking number of examples where the prenup is tossed out. The most air tight prenup can be worth shit if the judge decides it. Divorce court is a racket. It's all about getting a much money out of the two who are getting the divorce. No thanks.</br>  <br>Uh oh looks like the dummy is upset</br>  <br>faggyjunk pls go</br>  <br>if the child's hot</br>  <br>no, but you want me to be upset, not sure why. 'hey I made a guy upset on the internet today!' well then it's lunch on me!</br>  <br>The old prenups are shit. They didn't cover enough bases back in the 90s and 80s for a modern court.<br><br>Now they're more advanced, closing coercion loopholes as long as you have a good lawyer who doesn't take shortcuts.</br></br></br>  Dear single mothers- It was all cool before then you had to go and fuck it all up..and for what? Because your crotch and instincts over write your logic, because your not in control of yourself and your actions? What if I had a biological instinct to cut my dick in half? It was fine before, then you fart out a little screaming problem and ruined everything. Now your useless. The only purpose you server is to teach loosers a hard lesson.  <br>Don't accept me to expect you're wrong grammar</br>  <br>Yeah.<br><br>I want kids one day but I would love to skip like first 3 years when they are basically shit and piss factories. It would be like adopting.<br><br>I don't really care about the kid being someone else's, because I'm not insecure. As long as the mother is faithful, of course.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah I was checking legal zoom for a while but then I read some reviews and people were saying it didn't hold up, guess I'm just going to have to go see a layer. Hope he doesn't rob me.</br>  no<br>single parents are too stupid for my taste</br>  <br>Probably not.</br>  <br>absent father?</br>  <br>No, I'm not beta... no need to raise someone else's shitty kids or support his used up whore.</br>  <br>You get hate because your view is one-sided anon, likewise I don't have the fear of being alone, however not because I think women are manipulative demons who only exist to use you, but because I have nothing to benefit from in a long term relationship (I don't like kids and I'm greedy/selfish). But, back to you, you say women use that fear to get into your wallet, but it works both ways, the dude who knocked her up? He likely used that fear to get into her pants (eg. "I love you", "I'll always be there for you").<br><br>I don't know you, but it sounds like you've been hurt before and that's formed your misconception</br></br></br>  <br>Double the fun.</br>  <br>There is a lot that I can read from the expression on this mothers face.</br>  <br>Nope.</br>  <br>No. That's just disgusting.</br>  <br>I currently am, would not do it again if I had to choose.</br>  <br>I had. Never again, OP</br>  <br>When it comes to kids all prenups are shit. The court can override it especially when it comes to limiting child support. Alimony, yeah it will work for that in general. But once you act like a father to a child then you are a father to teh child and on the hook. I think it might be possible for two guys to pay child support on the same kid.</br>  What about a single father?  only if it was mine.  <br>If we were friends and you expected me to accept that bullshit, we wouldn't remain friends much longer. You may need to step off your high horse in order to see eye to eye with these women bro. You show them no signs of having the ability to not only provide them with a stable relationship, but you lack the ability to even entertain the notion of sacrificing a dollar to see her smile. Money can be made anytime and in endless quantities if you're willing to learn how to acquire wealth. Love is worth far more than anything you can buy. Ask any rich old CEO who never married or found someone to truly appreciate them. It's their greatest regret.</br>  <br>Well, whatever education you got was for nothing atleast...</br>  <br>You only fuck virgins? Is it so they don't have any experience to judge your pathetic cock and lack luster fucking against?</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Nothing gets thrown out if it's notarized man. Spend the extra 3 bucks and make sure your shit is bona-fide</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Only correct answer</br>  <br>It depends on how cute her daughter is and whether or not she'd let me mess around with her.</br>  I literally just had a girl freak out and stop talking to me with a kid. I totally had feelings for her but I would have never dated her cause she had a 2 year old kid who I hated how we never got alone time because of it.  <br><br>Not if I could avoid it. I think it played a role in fucking things up in my last relationship.<br><br>I was counting on that for my future. I don't know what I'm going to do now. I can't imagine the future.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Well, sure; I know she puts out.</br></br>  <br><br>God what a nightmare.</br></br>  <br> It's their greatest regret <br>citation needed.</br></br>  <br>Only with mine.</br>  <br> your view is one-sided anon <br>right, my side. I have no obligation to see things from her side. The media and the world all sympathies with women and see it from their angle, to the extent that it excuses away most of their shitty actions and now we find ourselves in the current state. I'm tired of every swinging dick sympathizing with women. This is why women today will not take responsibility for their actions. Everyone is all too understanding toward women and men barely have a voice. As a man, anytime you speak up about unfairness in our culture, the reaction seems to be to always challenge your manhood, shaming tactics.<br><br> I don't know you, but it sounds like you've been hurt before and that's formed your misconception <br><br>Had it right up until the word misconception. We all are a product of our environment. My view comes from being alive for 31 years as a male in the united states who had dated lots of women. It's lazy and easy to suggest that my nasty point of view comes from a fault in me, it negates the truth, which is that my point of view stems directly from dealing with women. Their bull shit has down stream issues, to include but not limited to someone like me pounding out hateful 'but true' words on my keyboard.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK no, OP you are KIDDING yourself if you think you're going to end up in any kind of "normal" relationship.<br>I mean i'm not going to go down the whole slut-shaming, conniving-women-want-to-find-father<wbr>'s-for-their-bastard-babies road, but there is a 0% chance of having a relationship with her that doesn't end in breaking up or making the kid your responsibility. <br>That's just how that shit works</br></wbr></br>  <br>No. You'd have to be a complete idiot to date those women. If anything they are more demanding, trying to attract a high status male with lots of $. <br>They are worse than the rest because they're even more calculated</br></br>  <br> If you won't give them a baby, won't pay for dinner, won't pay for their rent, then your not a good resource for them. Time to move onto the next sucker because my wallet is shut tight and my time is extremely valuable to me because I have self respect. <br><br>It is the desire to be wanted for the person you are, not what you can provide. That's all I've ever asked.</br></br></br>  <br> see eye to eye with these women <br>nah, I've heard enough from them and I'm not impressed. They'd love it if I'd try and 'see eye to eye' because it'd be another change to inject their bull shit. To try and influence me in a way that gains them a benefit. I've listened to women for years, at some point you have to realize that if you just stop trying to understand, empathize, sympathies..stop listening all together, they're lies and tactics no longer work.<br><br>And spare the me whole 'bro maybe your meeting the wrong women'. AWALT. You like to look at things from other peoples point of view then look at from mine. How fucking annoying it is to realize the game that's being played and now that I have a understanding that immunizes me against all the horse shit, people are trying to convince me that what I already know to be the truth is false, seemingly to pull be back into the meat grinder.</br></br></br></br>  Yes. If it's worth it i will do like lions do.  <br>what was the reason she freaked out on you?</br>  <br>#2 gave me cancer<br>Good job you've avoided that, brother!</br></br>  <br>NO. I'd rather be single.</br>  dick rate thread  <br>i'd suck that</br>  <br>me too</br>  <br>Same</br>    <br>Another</br>  <br>Last</br>    If you guys hate niggers so bad...<br>why do you guys wait til you are safe at home to talk shit?<br> Most white boys I see on the regular are scared to even appear disrespectful. .<br>I say put your money where your bitch ass mouth is</br></br></br>  <br>I do, often, and i find if you are as big or bigger than the nigger you put down they walk off...like the bitch ass nigger they are.</br>  Shut up Op, you're being a nigger  If the black don't win!<br>we all jump in!</br>  bump for intrest  theres actually afew good webm's of why, its mainly because niggers are fucking pussies, and travel in packs. We whites are smart enough to not aggravate a pack of while niggers  <br>Wild*</br>  Hatred is a facade for ignorance and fear.  <br>Sure<br>but I've seen white guys in real life act like bitches when the wis only one black guy<br>keep it real with yourself</br></br></br>  <br> Most white boys I see on the regular are scared to even appear disrespectful <br><br>Than why the fuck zoo's keep nigghers free instead to putting them on cage?

May I have it back please. Who are you? Why are you doing this to me, how did you know I was browsing this site? This is creepy.</br>    <br>no one cares</br>  Op got his beta ass kicked by the alpha on the driver's license. Now he came crying to his autistic friends on the internet to exact some cyber-vengence. <br><br>The fuck outta here</br></br>  Bring it on. I will draw all of it! Mwhahaha  <br>Give me one example.</br>  <br><br>Amusement parks have long lines for everything.</br></br>  <br>me<br>post 'em</br></br>  How is this possible?  <br>jesus christ</br>  <br>human guts are 3feet long</br>  This girl is the only one in porn who can do that like this, in an other video she takes the entire arm of a girl in her ass  new tattoos thread<br><br>just got this done two hours ago</br></br>  <br>ok.
