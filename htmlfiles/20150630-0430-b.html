[ Hey /b/ I under stand that this isn't my personal army but I need some help. My friend met some girl on League and before people begin to say League sucks major dick which it does, don't start a damn war over this. She is basically trying to bribe him into getting games on steam. I can't find her skype info. I can't find her steam either since I try adding all the girls he has added on skype and found out its non of them.  <br>name?</br>  <br><br>Nevermind I'm a retard, just noticed file name</br></br>  <br>Need more detail than "Trying to bribe him into getting games on Steam." My first instinct was that's a fucking silly notion but surely there must be details I'm not seeing here... Like is she bribing him to buy HER games? And why doesn't he have the power to just say no?</br>  Bumb  So if gay marriage is ok because it hurts nobody, why should we take a flag down that also hurts nobody?<br><br> inb4 "it hurts some peoples' feelings" ... well apparently so does gay marriage. </br></br>  This fag has a pretty good point  <br>you have the right to marry who you want and to fly whatever flag you want.<br><br>what the fuck are you whining about?</br></br></br>  because the confederate flag has a more offensive history then two dudes fucking  <br>It's the flag of an enemy country and no enemy flag should be flying on the soil of the USA.</br>  <br>We shouldn't. You can support marriage equality and free speech.</br>  <br>So does every other flag that has ever flown over any nation in human histiry.</br>  <br>Same reason Germans can't have nazi shit in Germany<br>Amerifucks want to pretend like half of their country isn't full of fat prejudiced retards</br></br>  thread has potential. bump  <br>It is a great flag.</br>  <br>Taking down the flag only hurts faggots and nobody gives a shit ybout them.</br>  <br> implying I should care about the feelings of baptists and rednecks who think gay marriage is making god angry </br>  Because sage goes in all fields.  <br>Actually this make me feel uncomfortable and a "little" bit disgust</br>  <br> histiry </br>  WAAAAAHHHHHHHH<br><br>My little flag symbolizing a traitorous anti-American country that lost its only war got cucked by a rainbow flag symbolizing gay sex!<br><br>WAAAAAAHHHHHHHH</br></br></br></br>  <br>This tbh</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=o8J<wbr>qKxrloQQ</wbr>  [ ]</br>  the flag celebrates a lot of 'hurting' that was done, being gay doesn't  <br>not pretend we'd just like to forget. but we can't. for some dumb reason these idiots are proud of a country that lasted 4 years, was a shit-hole, kept slaves its entire existence and was soundly defeated in a bloody war.</br>  <br>That's not the way progressive liberals think op. Even though it makes perfect sense, it hurts their feelings so it's bad.</br>  <br>Just because euorfaggots don't understand what free speech is doesn't mean Americans have to follow their facist lead.</br>  <br>It is just a kid m8.</br>  <br><br>the confederate flag is the definition of what it means to be un-american<br><br>they should let people keep them to just so it's easier to spot the idiots and traitors</br></br></br></br>  <br>the confederate represented a nation that went against what the founding fathers wanted for us. a nation divided against itself cannot stand. you moron. the flag is hypocritical to your redneck way of patriotic life</br>  <br>Fucking autocorrect</br>  <br>the pain caused by gays is consensual.</br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br> Same reason Germans can't have nazi shit in Germany <br><br>Because people with hurt feelings ban something out of emotional appeal without considering the historical significance of something like that?<br><br>Are you seriously trying to justify the censorship of historical emblems and memorabilia because you personally don't agree with it? Really?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>another perfect liberal argument</br>  <br>A kid who was corrupted by the ideology of two faggots</br>  If I marry my 15 year old neighbor it's not hurting anybody. When will our love be free too?  <br>Did you mean butthurts nobody?</br>  <br>Because literally the only reason people fly the confederate flag is because of the reoccurring American thing where they're for some reason really proud of something retarded.</br>  <br> you personally don't agree with it <br><br>wow the level of integrity</br></br></br>  <br>we nigga want</br>  <br>yeah you sure got your pulse on what they were thinking back then. pic related.</br>  <br>its the equivalent of hanging a giant flag with a swastika on it on the front of your house</br>  <br> <br>Except they didn't want to be part of that nation anymore, and instead formed their own. You fucking moron.<br> <br>The South was essentially raped and told "hey, you shouldn't have done that, it's your fault you got raped"</br></br></br></br>  <br>bump</br>  <br>do you even merika? I bet you don't even have freedoms. go get your own</br>  I think it's just a flag, a sheet of fabric. Symbolism is subjective. People choose to associate it with an event.<br><br>I seem to have an unpopular opinion about this in my social circle.</br></br>  <br>underrated and true post</br>  <br>Oh look, Yankee doodle cucky thinks he knows who I am. One, it doesn't fucking matter what it stands for. Free speech protects unpopular expression too. Two, what it stands for is a desire for local self governance, which is exactly what the founding fathers actually wanted. Hate to tell you this you ignorant cuck, but there were no "good guys" in the US Civil War. The north was no more anti slavery than the south, and the emancipation proclemation did nothing and Lincoln knew it.</br>  <br><br>If it has SO much historical significance, why isn't the fucking flag displayed in a museum? Hmm?</br></br>  because slavery.  <br>Wrong. The south wanted to follow the path the founding fathers had in mind and not become the shithole the country is now.</br>  <br>they didn't want to be apart of the nation because they were going to lose their slave industry. it wasn't about them becoming a nation, it was about fighting for human rights or enslaving blacks.</br>  <br>stfu retard, you never know what you're talking about and you post all the time.</br>  <br>everything else is. flags are special. when you put a flag in the ground you are claiming that ground for what is on the flag, if it's an enemy country or ideology. <br><br>do you understand that or not?</br></br></br>  <br>i have no problems with any redneck flying this flag. i just don't think it should be flown by any government entity. better?</br>  <br>Not sure what you're trying to say<br><br><br>I like how this strawman comic completely ignores the fact that the flag in the comic actually wasn't used to represent the confederacy for most of the war.<br><br><br>Why wouldn't I be able to? I'm pretty sure all flags are protected under the first amendment.<br><br><br>But it is. I have been to plenty of museums and national parks dedicated to civil war battlegrounds who have used it</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>nah that's about right. anyone that gets butthurt when jethro puts on his overalls and hoists up a red square deserves to have their oversensitive titties in a twist.</br>  <br> germans can't fly the nazi flag <br> Europe is therefore fascist <br>Do you even read what you post ?</br></br></br>  <br>If ye Muricans gonna start using the term "heritage" on flags, you might as well be flying this.</br>  <br>So do you apparently. That isn't even the flag of the confederate states dumbass.</br>  <br>oh yeah you're right. the only problem with this whole comic is it uses the wrong flag. good one.</br>  <br> <br>technically the cross was a battle flag (also adopted by the navy). This was the real Confederate States official flag</br></br>  <br>if you actually read the comic then you'd see they are using it as a battle flag. what's your problem with it?</br>  <br>the flag was used for the armies of tennessee and north virginia, the navy, and was prominent on the 1st and 2nd national flags of the confederacy. the fact that it wasn't ubiquitous in the civil war is irrelevant.</br>  Fuck off you nongayfaggots<br>Protip im not gay</br>  <br><br> Same reason Germans can't have nazi shit in Germany <br>because it's the enemy's flag</br></br></br>  <br>fcuukk offf British fag</br>  <br>because both, legalizing gay marriage and taking down the flag, hurts the feelings of conservatives, who are bawwwing about like anything that changes and shouldn't be listened to.</br>  <br>I'm just highlighting the fact the comic in now way represents how things actually happened.<br><br>Pointing out how they use the incorrect flag to represent their argument further proves the people who made it don't know what they are talking about.</br></br></br>  <br>exactly. and it will be used to ferment rebellion so it must not fly.</br>  <br>it has nothing to do with feelings you faggot. <br><br>We live in America. America already has a flag, it's got 13 stripes and 50 fucking stars. This is the flag that will be flown at American govt buildings. <br><br>If you want to fly the stars and bars in your trailer or across your pick up truck, by all means, please do so. Just like, right now, I could create a flag with purple and green and have a picture or Bea Arthur giving the thumbs up and fly that on my property. <br><br>So relax, grab another beer, turn on those dallas cowboys on your tv.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it's a joke idiot. it points out that the man who designed the flag was not designing it for southern heritage. that's the fucking point of hte comic. holy shit you're so dumb</br>  it hurts me  Being gay does hurt! I can't imagine having my asshole getting ripped open by another mans penis then filling me full of his warm sticky cum  <br> I'm just highlighting the fact the comic in now way represents how things actually happened. <br>that's the point.</br></br>  <br>Speak your own language native american.<br>:^)</br></br>  Well faggots, the Battle Flag is still up in SC, and the nigger that tried to tear it down is in jail. It's going to take an impossible legislative action to have it permanently removed. <br><br>There are literally hundreds of other places to buy the flag online. Besides cucks like Amazon and Walmart.<br><br>There's really nothing to argue about anymore. You anti-flag faggots have lost.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Not even a britbong <br><br>I'm just smart enough to recognize that if it wasn't for the British, your god blessed land of the free would be stinky surrender monkey territory.</br></br></br>  <br>Can someone explain the meaning of the flag, the history of it in a few words?<br>Thanks</br></br>  People want it off government buildings. Why would you fly an enemy flag on a government building? Are you fucking stupid?  <br>The problem is, why are you cherry picking just one flag then? It's one battle flag of many and not even the most important so why is this even an issue?</br>  We're so fucked.<br><br>Not because fags can marry now. Not because the rednecks angry that the flag was banned on government property, but the fact the TPP passed while all you fucking mentally retarded waste of life was distracted.<br><br>Have fun America. You fucking dumb cunts. Damn it feels good to be from Deutschland.</br></br></br></br>  <br>you're the flaggot.</br>  <br>Look it up you lazy mong.</br>  <br> <br>I'm neither for nor against the flag, but I was kind of hoping that nigger woman would set the flag on fire and keep the flag flying just to piss off all the rednecks</br></br>  <br>keep crying you impotent little bitch</br>  <br>we're "cherry-picking" the flag that the idiots who live in the deep south think is the right flag.</br>  <br><br>Murder, rape, slavery, secession, Civil war, Union victory, Dukes of Hazard</br></br>  <br>The flag is just removed from government buildings. You can still fly it on your property.</br>  <br> <br>South wanted their own flag, adopted red, white, and blue of US flag, but with stars for the Confederacy</br></br>  <br>geg newfag doesn't watch news</br>  <br>*Future pedophile</br>  <br>Most Western European countries, including Germany, are more democratic than the US, according to the Democratic Index. Your point is invalid.</br>  <br>It's the battle flag of a division of the confederate army in Tennessee used during the american civil war.</br>  <br> You anti-flag faggots have lost. <br>are you joking? alabama took down their flags and SC is likely to follow suit. major retailers have stopped carrying the flag and the nation has just been reminded that only rednecks care about the flag. anti-flag-fags won dude. this was a major step in moving past this flag culturally, no one is trying to ban it outright, the 1st amendment is still in effect. its about government endorsement of the flag and wider cultural acceptance.</br></br>  <br>That's good, lets create even bigger divides in the country. You do know that after the Civil War, the North let the flags stand because they were trying to heal the country, not tear it apart, right?</br>  <br> I could create a flag with purple and green and have a picture or Bea Arthur giving the thumbs up <br><br>can someone please make this? i need this now, for reasons.</br></br></br>  <br>slavery, treason</br>  <br>even though you shouldn't. it's a flag that you should keep in your basement to remind of you how bad decisions can affect whole groups of people and nearly bring down a country. it should also remind you of how great the USA is and how easily they destroy their enemies. it should remind you of how inferior southerners are to people in the north. it should inspire fear and make you re-think every one of your white trash decisions.</br>  <br>Both are legal. Enjoy life, anon</br>  <br> Why wouldn't I be able to? I'm pretty sure all flags are protected under the first amendment. <br>you are able but you have to live with people thinking / knowing that you're a nazi. Same with the confederate flag.</br></br>  <br> <br>are you talking about the flag with the St George's Cross?<br> <br>That was adopted as a battle flag, because the official flag (  ) was too close to the US flag and was confusing in the smoke and chaos of battle, and resulted in friendly fire casualties.</br></br></br></br>    <br>because it's the only flag that people today associate with the confederacy, and it has historical ties to the klan, rednecks, other white power groups, and civil rights counter-protests.</br>  All y'all are missing a much bigger concept here. I still fly my confederate flag by the way. Come and take it by force. I dare ya. But I digress. The bigger concept here is the use and interpretation of the 14th Amendment that was used to violate the 10th amendment. The interpretation of the 14th from the supreme court basically said that no state has the right to interfere with anyone's lifestyle choices. That means that I can legally carry my pistol and rifle anywhere I want because that's my lifestyle choice. I can fly my confederate flag wherever I want because it's a lifestyle choice. I can beat the ever loving fuck out of any little faggot that I want because it's a lifestyle choice. This is broad spectrum legalization of anything and everything because of the way they worded their opinions.  <br>Nice spin, but the only idiots so far have been the people trying to have it removed because they think it represents slavery.</br>  <br>Why do people think the south was fighting for state rights? <br> south has slaves <br> slaves run away <br> slave is now a fugitive  <br> federal government says that any state of the Union must chase down and return fugitives  <br> north be like, "but there's a fuckton of niggers coming up here. We can't get them all"  <br> north gives up on returning slaves because fuck it, not their problem <br> south gets pissy and bitches about the federal government not forcing the north to catch their slaves <br> war </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  this is the equivalent to Germans fighting their govt to keep nazi flags flying on govt property. <br><br> muh heritage <br> muh history </br></br></br>  <br>Alabama took some down on an executive order that probably won't stand, certainly not past the next governor. Four retailers banned the sale of Confederate merch. There are hundreds more that don't. Everything else you posting is impotent bitching and wishful thinking. Stay mad cuck.</br>  <br>who cares about slavery? it's the flag of a bunch of traitors.</br>  <br>apparently you don't. every american has the right to fly the redneck rag AND to gaymarry.</br>  USA killed a lot of innocent Japanese with nuclear weapons so maybe we should ban the flag of the United States of America.  <br> this <br>Fag or flags, whatever. All of you are getting fucked rotten.</br></br>  <br>And the gay pride flag is associated with AIDS. I guess you really like AIDS.</br>  <br>see<br><br/></br></br>  <br>Now this I can agree with. Too bad people aren't trying to have it erased for that reason alone.</br>  Man y'all can't expect anything to be fair<br>Some things just aren't right, whether you like it or not<br>mail the government if you don't like it.</br></br>  Why do the Fucking liberals care about the flag anyways? They clearly hate our country and make the US to be the bad guys along with white males just look at the media. They don't have a right to way in on this issue.  <br>The flag isn't banned, it is just Jew stores like Walmart decided they are no longer selling them. <br><br>Like the Washington Redskins, this will blow over in a week or so.</br></br></br>  <br>no one wants to ban the sale of that loser flag. and no one is. <br><br>you just shouldn't be able to fly the traitorous flag on government land and soon you won't be able to.</br></br></br>  <br>no one cares about other countries, fuck the world, murica bitch</br>  Because it reminds the world of what a scumbag country the US is.  <br><br>The only losers here are the products of the American education system.<br><br>Because holy shit, this entire thing is absolutely retarded and no one who had a single unbiased history class would think this flag is racist.<br><br>Get your shit together, Amerifags.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It wasn't about slavery you autist.<br><br>They seceded because Lincoln was elected and they thought the federal government would become too powerful.<br><br>If you don't know anything about history, don't post.<br><br> Lurkmoar.pdf <br><br>geg fucking newfag</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this. I don't know why Americunts are so obsessed with keeping their culture...<br> implying they have a culture and are not just a conglomerat of random Europeans that committed a genocide. </br></br>  Rednecks BTFO this week. Your entire lifestyle is so archaic you are nothing but a running gag. Fuck your flags, enjoy your fags.  <br>European nations have sent people to prison for holocaust denial. While denying the Holocaust is retarded, a truly free country wouldn't make it illegal. You don't see Americans going to jail for speech. Your index is an imperfect tool.</br>  <br>Because some people make more money in an hour than you do in a year. These same people love to see average Americans squabble over little things because if were cutting each other's throats we aren't doing things like tax reform.<br><br>And before ya'll hit me with Black Lives Matter last time I checked if you make under $280,000 a year and can't afford to lobby your life really doesn't mean much to most state/federal elected officials</br></br></br>   <br>What the fuck is geg</br>    <br>Because America; 'tis a silly place</br>  <br>I agree with you. Gay marriage should be okay as long as your flag.<br><br>PC makes me want to puke. I hate my fellow liberals for much for this.</br></br></br>  <br>yeah, why would anyone think the flag of a rebellion that broke out due to slavery is racist? just because the klan and other white power groups like to fly it?<br><br>makes no sense.</br></br></br>  Battle flag is still up and not going anywhere any time soon. Chinese are still cranking out hundreds of thousands of them and online retailers are having trouble keeping them in stock.<br><br>Nothing to see here but mad SJW summerfaggots.</br></br>   here<br><br><br><br>If someone flew a flag that resembled very closely a confederate flag, except for one small detail: It was missing a star, would that flag be just as symbolic as the confederate flag? What if it was missing two stars? What if it had different colors? At what point does it lose its symbolism? Is this point inherently agreed upon across all the human race?<br><br>If flags were special, then the flag closely resembling the confederate flag would not share any of the symbolism of the confederate flag. They would be two completely different flags, and the maker of the flag with a missing star would be entitled to assigning its symbolism.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>geg is like gog</br>  <br>keep listening to your dad and internet forums, then when you graduate highschool, reevaluate your life.</br>  <br> The new Constitution has put at rest forever all the agitating questions relating to our peculiar institutions—African slavery as it exists among us—the proper status of the negro in our form of civilization. This was the immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution. Jefferson, in his forecast, had anticipated this, as the "rock upon which the old Union would split." He was right. What was conjecture with him, is now a realized fact. <br><br>- Alexander Stephens, Vice President of the Confederacy</br></br></br>  <br>You're autistic and that doesnt even apply to that post.<br><br> when you get called a redneck and you live on the canadian border <br> geg.png </br></br></br></br>  <br>at least I didn't save a gif as a jpg.</br>    <br>good. spend what little money you white trash have on endless numbers of flags when every time you put one up it mysteriously gets torn down. buy 100 right now, keep it under your trailer.</br>  <br> and soon you won't be able to. <br><br>The impotent wishing of a mad little cuck. Don't come back here crying when nothing happens kid. Oh that's right, by then you'll be back in the 6th grade....</br></br></br>  <br>You are wrong, sir.<br><br>Go do some real history research. Lincoln was a piece of shit politican who USED slavery as an tool to win a war. He never gave two shots about the slavery issue since it wasn't outlawed in the north until AFTER the civil war was over. The central government was pissed that the confederacy didn't want to be under the control of a large government and they wanted to tax the ever living fuck out of the south. The south wanted the 10th Amendment to be upheld to the letter. States had the rights. The central government only worried about national defense. That's it. That's what the real issues were, and Lincoln fucked up the country by severely deviating from the path of the founding fathers.</br></br></br>  <br> a country is fucked up in one aspect <br> so it must be less democratic overall  <br><br><br>Your logic is retarded.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>geg<br><br> actually knowing things </br></br></br>  <br> mong </br>  <br>Lol, enjoy getting shot retard</br>  <br>kek'd and check'd</br>  <br> [Texas] was received as a commonwealth holding, maintaining and protecting the institution known as negro slavery-- the servitude of the African to the white race within her limits-- a relation that had existed from the first settlement of her wilderness by the white race, and which her people intended should exist in all future time.

What I said was that the tool is shit because it clearly ignores people being arrested for speech. Speech is far and away the most important right a person has. If your nation arrests someone for nondestructive speech then you aren't free. So we are clear, destructive speech is calls for violence or deliberately inciting panic. Holocaust denial, while retarded, isn't destructive.</br>  <br>more real than the speeches of confederate leaders and their actual declarations of secession?</br>  <br>  You don't see Americans going to jail for speech. <br><br>Ever heard of Edward Snowden?</br></br></br>  <br>you sound like a gay nigger lover, enjoy that lifestyle.

They all listen to rap which always is mainly about "Fuck 12, Sell Coke" shit. So they try to do that shit and be bold with cops and get laid out.

Fucking liberals</br></br>  <br>stop being reasonable, we are on the interwebs.</br>  <br> You don't see Americans going to jail for speech <br><br>Nope, but I see plenty getting shot because of it.</br></br></br>  <br><br>If you are a pedo you are a pedo.<br><br>The only wy you would think that people could choose if you are a pedo yourself!<br><br>GOD MADE ME A PEDO!!!<br><br>STOP OPRESSING ME!!! I SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO FUCK 6 YEAR OLDS!!!!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well said. This guy clearly knows his shit.<br><br>If that was me, i wouldn't feel like I even had to do anything any more. It's like having a fan.</br></br></br>  <br>So was every other country on the face of the Earth you stupid fuck. No nation has a bloodless founding. You hate America more than klansman hate niggers, and you actually manage to be less rational. That's pretty amazing.</br>  <br> shares an opinion I disagree with <br> must be samefag <br>Fucktarded imbecile.</br></br></br>  <br>Why do you assume this kid was raised by a homosexual couple? Are you mentally deficient?</br>  <br>Well yeah, exactly. A pedo is a pedo. You can't choose that. Do you honestly think you can? Like someone at some point chose to be one?</br>  <br> implying museums aren't also businesses who have to suck dick to get people to visit them because they're barely a step up from what you'd see in a public school textbook </br>  <br>Oh shit, this little nigger can parrot stuff I said. You are one edgy motherfucker, motherfucker...<br><br>Now suck my dick you worthless cunt.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Flag still flying at state houses, people still buying it by the hundreds of thousands.<br><br>Stay mad and impotent cucks....</br></br></br></br>  <br>I support your right to fly whatever flag you want as a private citizen. But public / governmental use is completely different. And what the fuck does gay marriage have to do with flag flying? Gay marriage has nothing to do with oppression or opposition to equality. Quite the opposite, in fact. Not all things that offend people have equal merit. You might be offended that I am allowed to buy Slayer albums, because you object to their anti-religious themes. I may be offended when you pull down your pants and pee on my legs.</br>  <br>Therefore we should let murderers free because they don't choose to be that way.<br><br>Gays became murderers by introducing aids.</br></br></br>  <br>Non sequitur. Fuck off with your idiocy.</br>  <br>I'll take false equivalency for 500 Alex.</br>  <br><br>Yes. I do think that when someone fucks a 6 year old they choose to do it.</br></br>  <br> it clearly ignores people being arrested for speech. <br><br>Wrong.<br><br>It doesn't. It also deals with civil rights, which includes free speech.<br><br><br> If your nation arrests someone for nondestructive speech then you aren't free. <br><br> Holocaust denial, while retarded, isn't destructive. <br><br>That's where your logic fails because it is. Denying the Holocaust promotes anti-semitism because it supports the idea that Jews are all behind the whole conspirancy. And guess what, anti-semitism is destructive. The Holocaust is proof of that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it's about what you're attracted to sexually genius. it's not even similar to murdering or not. <br><br>plus you can want to kill someone, i have, and still not do it. just wanting to doesn't make you a murderer. but just wanting to suck a dick as a guy still makes you gay. <br><br>do you understand it now?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Citation needed.</br>  <br>You word it the same way every time you obvious faggot. "Enemy flag", "planting it on USA soil", "flag of traitors to the USA" - every fucking time, did you think people wouldn't notice you blowing up every flag thread with your shitty pasta?</br>  <br>But a gay mans dick just gets dragged into another mans ass he can't control it at all.</br>  <br> edgy <br>stop using buzzwords until you learn what they mean. also, if you thought the point of the post was the parroting and not the proof that slavery was the cause of the conflict, then you should probably think a little harder.</br></br>  <br>of course, but even when they don't do it they are still attracted to children right?<br><br>we don't have a word for a gay man who never had sex with another man.</br></br></br>  <br>No, the most important right is the right to bear arms. If we the people are not armed, then the other rights don't matter. The right to keep and bear arms is Liberty's Teeth.</br>  <br> It's false equivalency because I say so. <br><br>K</br></br></br>  <br>only people who have lost touch with reality or are close minded would agree with the op</br>    <br>Every bit of "big" news that comes out of North America in the last 10 years.</br>  <br>stfu samefag</br>  <br> "way in" <br>kek</br></br>  <br> we should allow states to fly the battle flag of a belligerent nation <br>top kek<br>btw, I'll giggle endlessly the next time some redneck bitches about someone flying the Mexican flag. The ridiculous irony will be too much for me.</br></br></br>  <br>i like it. someone should go back and touch up every dukes of hazard episode with this. fuck, watched an episode recently. that show is so fucking gay.</br>  <br>I can't figure out what side you're on anymore.</br>  <br>And this is exactly where this issue will go. Because of the way the 14th was interpreted.</br>  <br> facts <br> duurrrr Non sequitur <br> gets even madder, and somehow more impotent <br><br>Sure is fun watching you SJW summerfags lose your shit</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Posting the fact that that "enemy flag" guy has been posting the same shit pasta for a week.</br>  <br> You don't see Americans going to jail for speech. <br><br>Most Western European countries don't monitor almost everything a person does behind a PC or a smartphone. (At least there's no evidence for that).<br><br>The same cannot be said about the US.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>does that mean you're against it or for it?</br>  <br>Yes, non sequitur, because it has nothing to do with the post you're responding to. What part of "fuck off", didn't you understand, imbecile?</br>  <br>That isn't what destructive speech is you fucking moron. Let me clear this up for you, because you don't understand.<br>destructive speech-"Someone should go out and kill minorities. If they did that, I would reward them". <br>non destructive speech- "minorities are inferior."<br>Holocaust denial falls cleanly into the second catagory. You aren't free. You are proudly advocating arresting someone for making a harmless point. Holocaust denial doesn't necessarily lead to antisemitism or violence, which is why you are stupid.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Really? Go ahead and show me how espionage and treason are protected by free speech. Go ahead. I'll wait.</br>   be civil war reenactor <br> be going to Gerrysburg to play the part of a southern soldier <br> be told no Confederate flag my be displayed by any reeactors of the south <br><br>libtard logic.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Assuming you're a troll.<br><br>1) the confederate states seceeded in order to continue the violent enslavement of people<br><br>this is historical fact. The articles of secession state quite plainly they are doing it to keep having slavery.<br><br>2) the flag was created because of #1. The creator of the flag, William Tappan Thompson, said at the time he created it that it was a symbol of the white man's supremacy over the black man<br><br>3) the south lost, in case you didn't notice. <br><br>4) The flag wasn't used much in popular culture until the 1948 Dixiecrat party used it. The Dixiecrat party was created specifically to continue segregation. It was a resurrected specifically as s racist symbol.<br><br>5) black people today (and many people of all backgrounds) find this flag abhorent. It is the flag of those who enslaved, beat, tortured, raped and killed their ancestors. It is a flag created for the purpose of trying to continue enslaving, beating, torturing, raping and killing their ancestors.<br><br>If it were YOUR ancestors you woudln't stand for this flag being flown on government property. You would round up your guns and do something about it, by God.<br><br> it is VERY clear that this is not just playing the race card. <br><br> the real question is why anyone would want to continue to defend this flag being flown by a state government today. <br><br> why? <br><br> inb4 heritage, glory hurr durr. there was no glory in fighting for the confederacy. it was based on an immoral premise. they were on the wrong side. they lost.  <br><br>fly the fucking flag whereever you want. Put it on your car. Fly it at your home. Wear a tee-shirt with it. IDGAF.<br><br> but don't have the government fly it to spit in the faces of the people who are RIGHTFULLY horrifically offended by it. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>oh noes I cant buy mah treason flag at Walmart<br>I is oppressed</br></br></br>  Go on Feb <br> see spoiled jewish new Yorker defending the flags  <br> dude just kuz you grew up in Florida does NOT make you a son of the south. </br></br>  <br>If you're able to read all his posts, do you also not have a life?<br><br>Argue with his point, stop bitching that he's samefaging.<br><br>If you're sick of arguing the sand point over and over, maybe it's time to realize you're pissing into a sea of piss, and nothing you will say changes anything.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The flag is used to incite rebellion and sedition. That alone should should be enough.</br>  <br>Cite one story of a person being shot just for talking. Just one.</br>  <br>I'm onto you samefag. Shill.</br>  <br>Another well reasoned point. Are you posting these thinking these arguments are not going to make sense?</br>  <br>BWHAHAHAHAHA - holy shit, can you get any madder you little cuck? You've won nothing, the Confederate flag is still flying and will probably get flown even more thanks to little niggers like yourself trying to infringe on freedom. Lol, you're so fucked.... No, I'' stay here and keep reminding you that you've won nothing and are a crying little bitch... that is until you have to go back to middle school in a week....</br>  <br>And yet, nobody has actually been prosecuted for speech. We can't say that for people in Europe can we? And you can bet European governments are doing that too. Look at how many cameras are in England. Or the way Russia has used mass texts to suppress protests.</br>  <br>Gabrielle Giffords.</br>  <br>Still non sequitur, retard.</br>  <br>not the same guy, but what is the relation to cuckolding? i don't get it. do you know what a cuck is?</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ULB<wbr>CuHIpNgU</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br> oh noes, I've been discovered for a massive samefag! pls don't call me on it! </br>  <br><br><br>"You aren't free."<br><br>Says a random stranger on the internet. Sure, bro. I'm sure I'm less free than you simply because I'm not allowed to state my opinion on one single matter. It isn't like other things matter, like a DIRECT voting system. <br><br>"You are proudly advocating arresting someone for making a harmless point."<br><br>I'm not. I simply used your logic against you.<br><br>" Holocaust denial doesn't necessarily lead to antisemitism or violence,"<br><br>No fucking shit, but the same thing can be said to "Someone should go out and kill minorities. If they did that, I would reward them", but you still call that "destructive".</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> the same thing can be said <br>Only if you're a blatant fucking retard.</br></br>  <br>ha ha you're fucking losing your mind</br>   tbh <br>Cringe</br>  <br>You're jumping to conclusions. I never said it was.</br>  <br>No it isn't, and no that isn't enough. Tell you what, I will support the ban of the Confederate flag if you also ban the following. <br>Images of Che Gauvara<br>Mao's Red Book<br>The American Flag<br>Every other Flag<br>Every book relating to religion of any kind<br><br>Either it's all okay, or none of it is.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice reasoning you've got there, bro.</br>  <br>Who would be stupid enough to attempt to reason with a blatant retard?</br>  <br>none of these things were used previously inside the USA to convince a lot of dumb people to rebel against the USA and try to form their own country.</br>  <br>Move to Georgia</br>  <br>That wasn't the government. You can't say a nation shoots people for speech because some crazy fuck shoots somebody. She wasn't being suppressed by her government. Try again.</br>  <br>The KKK used the american flag lol<br> libtards </br></br>  <br> No it isn't <br>But it was<br> B-but what about all this other stuff <br>When Images of Che are flying in front of state buildings then you'll have a point.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Let me rephrase my comment again: You said Holocaust denial doesn't necessarily lead to violence, so it isn't (necessarily) desctructive, and yet you called this "Someone should go out and kill minorities. If they did that, I would reward them." desctructive. Just because you offer some reward, doesn't mean it will cause actual violence, you fucking dipshit.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Noone said anything about the government doing the shooting.<br> Try again <br>Nope.</br></br></br>    <br>Then explain how Snowden was arrested for speech. He wasn't. He was arrested for hacking state secrets. Now I don't agree with the state having secrets, but that isn't the issue here.</br>    1: you can still fly whatever flag you want. the government isn't saying that you can't fly it. what people choose to sell or fly is their own choice.<br><br>2: the government is not forcing churches to perform marriage ceremonies. the state/gov now has to recognize gay marriage. churches don't have to.<br><br>literally, people are still free to say / do / fuck whatever and whomever they want. <br><br>have a blessed day.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>no big surprise, just another nigger breaking the law</br>  <br>Still mad as fuck, retard.</br>    <br>He wasn't arrested in the first place, as far as I know. He fled to another country</br>  <br>STFU retard, you're busted</br>  <br>It does if you have some form of influence, or somebody actually acts on it. Getting arrested for destructive speech requires your speech being an obvious motivation for the destruction. Be it by inciting panic or violence. Holocaust denial doesn't say "kill the jews", it says "maybe this event didn't happen, or it didn't happen the way we think it did". How the fuck do you not see the difference? By definition holocaust denial can't directly incite violence because it doesn't call for violence.</br>  <br><br>I think you're missing what actually happened.<br><br> kid shoots up church, kills black people <br> people upset enough to have the southern states remove/call to remove the 'stars n bars' from state government property. <br> all southern states agree to take down sooner or later  <br> meanwhile distributors such as Amazon, Walmart, and Apple(though theirs were third part apps that they eventually put back on the app store, realizing that it's just a few civil war games) decide to remove any memorabilia that has that particular design on them out of respect of the current movement <br><br>So, realize that no one is disallowed to have the stars n bars displayed anywhere they see fit. Just not on state property.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You dumb motherfucker.</br>  <br>It's used in the same way that faggot is. It implies some unwanted characteristic about the other person. When you call someone a faggot, you say that they would like to have sex with a person of the same gender, and when you call they a cuck you're implying that they would like to have their significant other deep throated by nigger dicks.</br>  <br>Holy shit, what a simpleton.</br>  <br>10/10, perfect reasoning.</br>  <br> Implying the confederate flag was never used by the KKK who, obviously, weren't out to give chocolates to black people. </br>  <br>Why don't you cry some more faggot?</br>  <br>good point and that;s one thing that separates the germans from the white trash in the south.<br><br>no german is proud of having killed a bunch of people and using forced slave labor. no germans are proud of having completely and totally lost a war.</br></br></br>  <br>Yup, and this dumb nigger is in jail. Why don't you go try that? Better yet, stop being a keyboard warrior and try taking the flag down from someone's private property.</br>  <br>It was implied. You seriously wanna claim a crazy basted shooting somebody should be used as a way to judge free speech on a national level?</br>  <br>This. Exactly this.</br>  <br>so i grew up in the deep south and the fact people think they can ban this flag is actually funny. if this flag was made illegal more people would fly it taunting on anyone who wants it taken down. like cops and niggers. if you were actually to go onto someones property to remove this flag you wouldn't make it half way across the lawn before being blown to bits by a 12 gauge. i rest my case</br>  <br>so the relation here is that because they want to take the flag down they must like the black and so they must want nigger dick in their SO's? that's what you're saying right.</br>  <br><br>How about this:<br><br> Kid shoots up a church and kills black people to create tension between the races <br> Black people surprisingly react very peacefully. Holding vigils and doing everything they can to avoid increasing racial tension. Instead of the usual chimping out <br> Powers that be are sad because poor whites and blacks arent at each others throats <br> So they ban the flag to cause racial tension.  <br> Dylan roof goes down in history as the guy who got a flag banned. <br> More people copy Dylan to have the same sort of influence and power he was given. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Just not on state property. <br><br>They haven't done that either dumbass. That Battle Flag is still flying at the State House in SC.</br></br></br>  <br>That flag is the flag of a losing team. Sore losers kept getting there Jimmie rustled when their sisters stop fucking them and started fucking the newly freed niggers...just let it go it's because their dicks are bigger. Whitey had a good run but it's now time of the boons! All hail our lort and saver tray boon the master coon!</br>  <br> private property <br>Are you sure it wasn't public property where it was?<br><br>It was, afterall, a PUBLIC monument.</br></br></br></br>  People should be able to fly the Confederate flag if they want. It's a right to free expression, plus it helps us identify assholes. However, it IS the battle flag of a failed and treasonous rebellion based on racism and slavery. It has no business being flown on government buildings.  <br>ok mom, I will stop insulting people because it's illogical<br><br>said nobody ever</br></br></br>  <br> It was implied. <br>Nope.</br></br>  <br>The point is that it shouldn't be illegal. It is a fucking flag. Only as shoes will fly it, but they should be allowed to fly it. Just like everyone else should be allowed to call them assholes.</br>  <br>The whole NSA thing doesn't have anything to do with free speech, and I never said otherwhise. All I said was that it is kinda ironic that you call other countries "not free" simply because of one issue, and yet your countries spies on you constantly for no good reason. I'm not saying you're not free, though, I just think it's ironic.</br>  <br>no, i'm seriously just wondering. i've seen it thrown around a lot on these threads. i dind't make the connection i guess. i don't see cuck as only a black and white thing i guess.</br>  <br>no, i'm seriously just wondering. i don't care if you use it or not. i've just seen it thrown around a lot on these threads. i dind't make the connection i guess. i don't see cuck as only a black and white thing i guess.</br>  Bad mothers threadalso momcest...none of that caption shit...

Not thinking with your dick alone is something that comes with growing up, anon.</br></br>  <br><br> Projecting this hard <br><br>Nigger it's beta, we all know it's beta, if you say it's not then you're the same kind of person who says the cosplay girl isn't dressing like a slut for attention. Just because you put the blinders on doesn't mean it isn't so.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Rplied</br>  <br><br>It's like you pretend to don't be any as you said, right?</br></br>  <br>37 replies<br>Come on nigger</br></br>  <br><br>The autism is strong with you, as is the bait.<br><br>Basically she's saying "Look at my naked body" as if the natural reaction of a man isn't to look, touch, fuck. If she gets raped, it's on her.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Dress like a slut get treated like a slut. If you do not wish to get sexual attention do not dress like you want it. Basic human instinct stuff. The fact that you are a fucking faggit is something else.</br>  <br><br> Growing up <br> On 4chan on a Monday morning <br><br>Nigger pick one.</br></br></br></br></br>  your welcome  <br>Nah. Basically wanting to fuck is a basic human instinct. Primal. So presenting the goods in such a manner will prompt a reaction wherein someone will have a taste. Come on. If she dressed a little less slutty, there wouldn't be such a reaction.</br>  <br>I would have this bitch raped by a nigger gang.<br>You will see how easy girl will learn not to dress like a slut</br></br>  <br><br><br>This bitch is psycho. Clearly. What she is cool with and what could send her screaming "RAPE!" And making a scene is known only to her. I'm not afraid to touch a girl, but I wouldn't want to risk her ruining my time and possibly getting me kicked out of a con I paid money and spent time dressing up for just to put my hand on the bare skin of some scantily clad bitch's midsection.</br></br></br>  <br> muslims </br>  <br><br>HEY HEY HEY....<br><br>....No one said she can't dress that way. But expect a gang bang, yes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You seem to be taking this personally<br>If you need to talk about something, I'm here for you</br></br>  <br><br>And this is why you will always beta.</br></br>  <br>Her face reminds me of G Hanellius.</br>  <br><br>Ok... first of all let me say I'm gay so I'm not trying to protect my machoness or some shit when I say this.<br><br>Hover hand is beta especially if the girl is touching you. Girls are people too, hover hand is a super weird "oh gosh should I be allowed to touch this goddess" attitude guys have because they hold a pussy on a pedestal. If a girl is taking a photo and is putting her arm around her shoulder you should never be embarrassed to fucking put your arm on her should or around her waist. Hover handing is weird and it makes them feel uncomfortable. <br><br>Please note this does not mean you're suddenly dating or she's INTO you. Just letting you pose for a picture. Fucking put your hand on her and take the pic.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   call kids out for being kids <br> kids get mad <br>Don't worry, the real world sets in at some point.</br></br>    <br>Yeah, sure.</br>  Ugh I fucking hate cosplayers that don't live up to their slut selves<br><br>All cosplayers are sluts wanting to go to cons to fuck they just want to play the tease game<br><br>They have no rights</br></br></br></br>  &lt;3  <br><br>Anon-kun you fucking idiot.... SHES FUCKING DRESSED LIKE A CHARACTER<br><br>Jesus fuck there is a difference between dressing like a whore and putting on a costume for a convention.<br><br>Also holy hell she didn't bring the sign with her it's one they put up specifically for people like you who go around thinking "if I see a girls ass I'm allowed to rape, I'm a dumb ass man who cant control myself, bitch was asking for it"<br><br>Seriously grow up.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>10/10</br>  unrelated  <br>0/10</br>  <br>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA<br>"I want to do physical touch with you"<br><br>Fuckkkkkkk</br></br></br></br>  <br>But there are way more, less slutty iterations of this character, she could've been. Therefore, she is a slut</br>  <br><br>You seem like the kind of person who is upset at male sexuality. Many sympathizers for obscure feminist agendas (like being naked to push anti-rape themes) are just an attack on male sexuality. You, like them, want to change the way the things are to suit your own ideals. You simply can't deal with the world you live in, you want to change it to suit yourself. <br><br>Sorry, doesn't work that way, and it never will. This is all a fad that happened before, and 30 years from now itll happen again, but not before lots of girls parading naked get a dick they may or may not have wanted cause they demanded life work their way.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Dont get me wrong anon i love the looks but only if its done privately not in public.<br><br>Its just a matter of time<br>Specially with these trend that is going on nowadays that the shorter the shorts the better</br></br></br></br>  <br>How's living in the desert going you fucking dumb sandnigger<br>learn English</br></br>  <br><br>Grow up</br></br>  <br> <br>You wouldn't get kicked out of a club for putting your hand on her if she's putting her hands on you. Jesus. <br> <br>Ever been to a strip club where you're not allowed to touch? A majority of the girls in there *want* you to touch. They'll take your hand and "accidentally" put your hand on their tits, even if you're paying them the same no matter what.<br> <br>Putting your arm/hand around her waist isn't bad. Just don't slap her ass or grab her tits. <br> <br>This is why you're beta and most likely will always be beta.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Cry more faggot ;3</br></br>  <br><br>0/10</br></br>  <br><br> Being this mad at male sexuality <br><br>Either you're highly beta or a feminist with hairy armpits and nipples.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I've already done 1, 3, 4, 5, and 7.</br>  <br> <br>people in /fit/ are naturally beta</br></br>  <br>thanks vvvortic</br>  <br>drop dat mixtape already nigga.</br>  <br>I don't get why people do this. It's not like she's going to freak out if you touch her. Not like you're squeezing her ass or something.</br>  <br><br> On 4chan <br> Grow up <br><br>Top kek anon, keep it coming.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Cry more faggot ;3</br></br>  <br><br> Male sexuality <br><br>No anon, most guys don't automatically think it's ok to just rape a girl. Sorry but that's not how the real world works.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Everyone knows none of us ever age on 4chan</br>  /B/ros.. After the dump <br>and extensive digging, I found her tumblr &amp; Instagram. <br><br>http://chiakifoil.tumblr.com/<br><br>https://instagram.com/chiakifoil/<br><br>Be warned, I don't think you'll like what you see.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>i dont recall asking you to use your greasy fingers and write some shit i dont care about<br><br>pic or get lost</br></br></br></br>  <br>Bro wtf is thata joke. That's a pretty fucken normal pussy.</br>  <br>Highly beta hairy nippled tumblrina feminist with pit hair longer than gandalf's beard and a cooch that smells like dead tuna.</br>  <br><br>I feel the concept of point/counterpoint is lost on you.</br></br>  <br> Implying king zyzz, wanted that filth on him. <br> implying that whale was worthy. <br><br>Please anon</br></br></br></br>    <br> Being in a public place filled with people with cameras taking pictures constantly of cosplays <br> Dressing up in an extremely revealing outfit with bright-ass hair <br> Is offended that they're getting attention but is clearly fishing for it <br>What the actual fuck? Feminists are fucking delusional.</br></br></br></br>  <br>hairy pits. Called it.</br>    <br> whale <br><br> is hotter than girl in /fit/ pic </br></br></br>  <br>That's actually inaccurate. Males are born with the innate desire to rape and oppress women. That is why transgendered people with male bodies take spiro to atrophy both their genitals and instinctual urge to support patriarchy</br>  <br>Why are you not in the kitchen?</br>  <br><br>Give everyone in there just one stiff drink and see how the hyper SJW attitude changes. Clearly they needed a sign because people are how they are. She simply wants to tempt fate, that's all. There is no where else she could possibly go dressed like that outside some sort of sanctioned event with security where she wouldn't be raped, or at least touched against her will. <br><br>Therefore, asking for it. That's life kid, you can be stuck in your little 2015 hyper feminist fad, but life goes on. A million years of sapiens fucking won't change because you're butthurt.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That picture was for you. To help you. I think you might need it.</br>  <br> I MUST LIFT WIGHTS TO COMPESATE FOR MY LACK OF A PERSONALITY <br>I can get being healthy and I have zero problem with that, but these people who's entire life seems to be lifting weights need to get a real hobby and a personality.</br></br>  <br>I might have forgiven her for being an exhibitionist feminazi if she actually put fucking effort in her cosplay. It looks like she glued mtg deck boxes on a belt and destroyed a backpack. If you choose to dress up and your shitty idea for a costume involves as little clothing as possible, don't be offended when people objectify you - you're already objectifying yourself.</br>  <br><br><br><br> implying this pic is not at least a few months old <br><br>Lurk more faggots. Stop thinking OC is actual OC, because for that we have plebbit and 9fag.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If she starts Bitching and screaming, yeah, you might. <br>Look at her. God only knows what's going on in there.</br></br>  For fucks sake its 2015<br>WOMEM CAN WEAR WHATEVER THE FUCK THEY WANT</br>  <br><br>Life advise and knowing you're a beta are two totally separate things. You're simply adding more examples why you WOULD be a hand hovering beta.</br></br>  <br>  Don't be offended when people objectify you - you're already objectifying yourself <br>Damn son. Those words sounded like Gandi or some shit was preachin em.</br></br>  <br><br>I'm sure that's what you believe but most men have brains and can exercise some control over themselves. <br><br>yfw I hate feminism I'm just afucking logical person.<br><br>If you're saying you cant go outside and see a woman and not instantly want to rape her then you need to be locked indoors. If you're saying ALL men do that then you need to be institutionalized. Sorry anon but you're wrong.<br><br>Incredibly wrong. So fucking wrong that I'm pretty sure you're really stupid or trolling. But either way you're not worth my time. We're done here kid.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I will totally do this if I feel like it</br>  <br>Do you see anyone here telling her to change clothes you dumb harpy?</br>  <br>And yet its a conscious choice to dress up slutty in order to bait a reaction. Aren't there better reasons to dress up like a slut other than "i'm a girl, i can wear whatever i want. Its 2015. Hurr durr, muh patriarchy"</br>  <br><br>clearly whoring herself for attention with the skimpiest costume at the entire event<br><br>she wants the dick, no matter how much she says no</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Thanks for your efforts <br><br>Doesn't really surprise. She doesn't seem to have much else significant going for her except her looks. The fact there's even such a shitstorm about not touching her waist would temporarily numb her sense of insecurity. Feminism and being a SJW probably feeds that too.</br></br></br></br>  <br> pointing with hand like some beta <br> yellow teeth <br> decent hairstyle but poorly done by him <br> dog tag <br><br>That hover hand was bound to happen.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Heh. You're absolutely right. It's kinda ironic.</br>  <br>that's illegal you bastard</br>  <br>Just because a woman is dressed like a "slut" doesn't give you the right to act like a horny ape</br>  <br> 85.jpg (158 KB, 683x1024) <br> 158 KB <br>Zyzz hoverhanded for her safety, better he stay fit and not touch filth rather than going to jail for killing her with awesome.<br>Fuck out of here summerfag</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>If she was raped, no one would question why except for people like you who don't want to accept reality. Sorry again kid, I know life can be ugly and tough...but the only thing more laughable than what you're writing is the idea that if she was lying on the ground filled up with multiple loads from different men you'd be scratching your head wondering why.</br></br>  <br>So you want your dick sucked or what?</br>  <br>From her tumblr.<br>"EMILY, 22, a gay af feminist <br>(basically cis men hate me, i did that on purpose)<br>i ate sausages out of the trashcan in broad daylight once<br>speaks japanese but can't do simple math<br>my blog is trash and most of my followers are only here for my butt<br>*if you need something tagged, please let me know and i will gladly tag it!*"<br><br> a gay af feminist. <br> (basically cis men hate me, i did that on purpose). <br> speaks japanese. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Just because a man is attracted to women doesn't give women the right to taunt their baser instincts on purpose.

Damn, food is tasty. So very tasty. Sometimes, when I tuck into a tub of "cookies &amp; cream" ice cream or a bacon-wrapped filet mignon, I'll pause for a moment and think of other people who are upset by us overweight folk. Their tears add to the delicious flavor.<br><br>Now, if you *truly* hated the epidemic of obesity in your nation, you would do something about it. Targeting consumers like myself shows laziness and weakness. Targeting corporations like RJR Nabisco, Nestlé and Monsanto, however... well, my good friend OP, that shows initiative. Or, you could start a nation-wide campaign to encourage people to eat healthier while showing them the benefits and techniques involved in calorie-burning exercises.<br><br>'Course, I wouldn't expect anything of you.

Plus there'd be less fatties, so win win</br>  <br>she sorta has a mustache if you look at her upper lip... DAMN SON</br>  <br><br>I order a pizza when it was pouring rain, only to recieve a call from a female telling me that she would arrive in 1-2 minute. Quickly I act and tell her that I would come to the car instead of her coming to the door. I hear a sigh of disgust. I pay no mind. As she arrives I make sure to be ready with an umbrella. I walk next to the window, careful to make sure the umbrella was postition to block any rain that may get into the car, she rolls it half way down, it.. it... its 15.69 for the pizza, she says as she looks down at the ground of the passenger side of the car, careful not to make eye contact. I hand her 21 dollars and tell her to keep the tip. Thaa... thaa... thank you. I tell her in a deep voice so she makes eye contact, Hey, it was... my privilege.</br></br>    <br>Greentext it pls</br>      <br>Kek</br>    <br>kek</br>  <br>I'd tell you to kill yourself, but the heart attack will take care of that.</br>  <br>Training in health and human development and i just can't wait for all these fat fucks to try and outdo facts.</br>      fucking hell i hate fat pride, i mean fat people who acknowedge that theyre unhealthy, and try to lose weight, are cool people, but fat cows that say "fat is beautiful" or that they're healthy, makes me want to kick their teeth in  <br>Exactly like this shit</br>    <br>I thought that brush was about to be sucked into her...</br>      <br>this is shopped right?</br>    <br>wtf how can it go so deep</br>  <br>lmao that's the bart!</br>  One day I was at the library, when leaving I notice a girl walking behind me and I open the door to the exit for her, she pauses and fear quickly fills her face. I wait grinning as she stands there. She submits and walks through the door, looking at her feet as she walks through. She says<br> "thaa...thaaa...thank you" <br>I grin even harder as my boner reaches a point a point it has never reached before. As she walks away I say<br> "It was my privilege" </br></br></br>    <br> she looks likes </br>  <br>too bad thats a velma cosplay, that would be amazing if it was actually her</br>  <br>According to the "Chocolate starfish theory" which I just made up, women do not have assholes to shit, which they don't do. They have assholes instead, because they're delicious and a very stimulating receptacle for my dick.<br><br>Both these theories are equally credible.</br></br></br>  <br> does it make you angry that im obese?  <br>no it makes me laugh<br> i can enjoy all the food i want <br>me too but im not a lazy fuck so im skinny still<br> Now, if you *truly* hated the epidemic of obesity in your nation, you would do something about it. <br>we would but murder is illegal</br></br></br></br></br></br>   I order a pizza when it was pouring rain, only to recieve a call from a female telling me that she would arrive in 1-2 minute <br> Quickly I act and tell her that I would come to the car instead of her coming to the door <br> I hear a sigh of disgust.

You go gurl!</br>  When I was at the grocery store, a lady stuggling carrying a pack of water comes up behind me at a register. I instantly get a boner. I tell her <br> "you can have my place in line" <br>Tears begin forming in her eyes as she hesitantly takes my spot. My girth begins to fill the room.<br> she says "Thank you for being a gen.. a gen... a gentlemen" as tears run down her face <br>With a evil grin I lean over and say<br> "It is my privilege" </br></br></br></br></br>      hippocrasy  <br>Your stories suck fuck off</br>  <br>The delusion is beyond my comprehension.</br>    A little humor  long, but interesting  <br><br> i have no rebuttal so I'll just get butthurt <br><br>i love this image</br></br></br></br>    <br>If you can do better I would, until then</br>      <br>Source on vidéo ?</br>    This one is pretty bad.  really long but worth the read      <br>I love these comments, all about her dress, skin, hair and stuff, written by people who mostly are desesperate to avid calling her a fat-thing</br>  <br>I made this comic. <br>Somebody removed my website's url ... Im not even mad.</br></br>  pow right in the kisser    Fem-logic  <br>insight: fat fighters</br>  a tale of win    A cautionary tale  You know who else burned books?  <br>insight: fat fighters, it's on youtube</br>  Caution : This one is going to piss you off. You have been warned.  <br><br>I would assume you are male, and therefore categorically not a tumblr feminist (statistically, anyway). That's the key difference.</br></br>  <br>women are fucking retarded</br>  This one is considered fake, but that is because the blogger disappeared after the post. Make what you will of it.  heh  What's going on with my plant /b/?  Light burn or Nute burn  test the pH  <br>Take a pic of the underside of the leaf please.</br>  <br>It has smallpox. Surrender to the judgement of God heathen, so that you and your decrepit plant may spend your final moments in the glory of HIS light.</br>  My first thought was nutrient burn  <br>How far along is she? Wat you feeding her? What's your ph levels? So many variables anon</br>  <br>wait I had something..</br>  Burnt tips. Uve got nutrient burn. Are y flushing it once a week?    <br>Herpes</br>    <br>I think that is spider mites judging by those black specks, are they moving?</br>  <br>You don't flush once a week faggot, you flush about 3 weeks before Chop.</br>  <br>It's a clone that's been outside for a little over a week. I've planted her in potting soil (has perlite) which is pre-fertilized for 3 weeks. After that I will use Plagron alga grow for veg. I have no means to measure pH right now.<br><br><br> flushing <br>No, I'm just watering her every few days when the soil feels dry.<br><br>By the way: I have a second plant from a different strain (White Widow) and it's looking pretty good. It's only this one (AK 47) that has this problem. <br><br><br>I think that's a bit of soil, I don't think they're moving, but I can check again</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What he really needs is to go to confession and tell preacher about all those rekt threads he's been visiting. It's a blight I tell you, a blight.</br>  <br> I think that's a bit of soil, I don't think they're moving, but I can check again <br>Check very closely and pray it is not spider mites, those fuckers can be very difficult to get rid of.</br></br>  <br>Defo looks like a deficiency of some sort. Pull off the leaves that have it on them, check your ph.. 6.2- 6.5 in soil 5.8 in hydro</br>  <br>Yes, this look like PH issue</br>  <br><br><br>Very common Calcium/Magnesium deficiency.<br><br>You need to add some cal/mag supplement to your feeding. If you cant find grow shops to purchase it, go online and get it. Its not too late, but it will set your plant back a little if it gets real bad.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If it's a cone from someone it may have been infected already. My advice.. a good flush as in giving her 4x the size of pot she's in in water ph,d to 6.3</br>  <br>A good tomato food is fine if you can't get to a grow shop. Just remember to 1/4 the dose it says on the bottle</br>  <br>could be to many chemicals if you are using growing shit</br>  <br>Just checked, they're not moving. It's just a bit of soil that stuck to the leaf.<br><br><br>I'm not gonna buy more fertilizers or supplements. I got a fertilizer for veg, a fertilizer for flowering, and PK 13/14. That's gotta be enough. These things cost enough money already. It really looks like a pH-problem from what I've researched and what people have been telling me.<br><br><br>If it really is a deficiency, what good does it do to remove any leaves? That doesn't make much sense.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  1. Pull back lights<br>2. Switch to hydro<br>3. Easyyyy on the nutes, maybe even start with just water<br>4. Keep ph perfect<br>5. Add more nutes<br>6. Slowly get light closer til you find sweet spot</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I disagree, it's obviously a problem with phosphate (a primary nutrient for plants) in the soil going out of control. The soil your plant is in is too fertile in this sense. there is so much of it that bacteria are now feeding on the stuff, robbing the soil of it's aeration (plants breathe through their roots, as well as their leaves and stems) effectively chocking your plant. All of this is ofcourse bullshit, I recommend you visit your town preacher and tell him all the things you have been doing on and off this site for the last few weeks, this is a blight my friend, divine reckoning on you and your little green buddy.</br>  <br>you don't chop, you dig it out with roots and hang dry it upside - down.</br>  Most defiencies will be gone when you replant her into new shoes. I wouldnt start messing around with additives before that.<br>Could be spider mites as well, that needs to be checked.</br>  <br>checked? checked!</br>  it has a potassium deficiency  its a nutrient burn. not a deficiency. at least a couple people in this thread aren't idiots.  <br><br>All these defs are most commonly caused by too high pH. New soil will be more sour, about 5.8 and will buffer for a few weeks. So maybe just replant a little earlier.<br><br>Also: Checkem!</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>potting up is futile. it is better to pot up young seedlings straight into their final pot, as this will increase the proportion of females.</br></br>  <br>you flush as soon as they start to bud</br>  <br>I thought that's when you use flower fertilizer and PK 13/14?</br>  10/10 women thread???      <br>who is this ravishing beauty and where do i know her from?</br>  <br>Jesus that forehead. She looks like Quasi modo</br>  <br>Maisie Williams, plays Arya in Game of Thrones</br>  <br>newfag</br>   (OP)<br>I don't get all the hatred toward her. I would plow that ass all day long.</br>  <br>she is one beautiful meme</br>  Take this  I like when she's a bit chubby  The only 10/10 there is.  <br>Oysters, clams and cockles.</br>  <br><br>cmon, this bitch is ugly as fuck</br></br>    <br> masculine jaw <br> flat chest <br> 10/10 </br></br></br>    <br>you must be blind, retarded or a faggot</br>  <br>indeed</br>  ARE YOU OUT THERE?          Cara is true 10/10  <br>I have no idea why that nigga posted that picture. Pic related is better.</br>  Theres posts all over facebook linking to maisie nudes but i dont think it looks like her at all, people are convinced though. Does anyone know if they are real?        <br>My friend said this haircut did it for him. Like he wasn't interested in her before this.</br>  <br>Mein nigger.</br>  Any smart guys out there?
