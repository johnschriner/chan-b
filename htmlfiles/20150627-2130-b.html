[ Bismillah-ir-rahman-ir-rahim. <br>Brothers, I come to warn you all today that YOU, the WEST needs to stop attacking the Muslim people. Your corrupted faith offers no laws or punishment for the crime and cruelty you commit and you kill our brethren at will, for material and financial power.<br>Is this how you want to live your life? Your people have been doing it for centuries. I urge you to come to Islam and learn to respect humanity, and accept the idea actions have consequences and that there are rules and if you break these rules, you will be punished harshly. Brothers, Islam is the only true way. It is my duty to ensure that all humankind bears witness that there is no God but Allah, and Muhammad is his Messenger. You attacked us and threatened our lives and people and Allah has commanded us to fight back against hostile disbelievers. You left us no choice but to set forth and conquer your lands.<br><br>Slowly but surely, we are defeating your crusading armies and allies, humiliating them in the process. Heads are rolling daily and soon the blood will flow on the streets of Rome and New York. Insha' Allah, one day, the Caliphate will extend across the entire earth!<br>Subhanallah! Be wary, that this day is very soon approaching. Embrace Islam now to avoid a painful punishment, both in this life and in the hereafter.</br></br></br></br></br>  fuckin goatfuckers  good luck goyim  God and Allah is the same person. You might want to fix your pasta.  Why dont u fuck off and go eat something u idoit    <br>What is your obsession with goat sex, infidel? Sex with animals is forbidden by the Quran. Don't be jealous that most of our goats look better than your women.</br>  Allah means God.<br><br>So God and Allah are the same thing</br></br>  <br>I can't wait until you are all dead.</br>  <br>What do you have against the Muslims fasting? Are you American? Only an obese American will hate the idea of abstaining from food for a few hours with such passion.</br>  Just remember what happened to the last two goat fuckers that started shit in the U.S. We aren't France or the UK sandnigger, fuck around here and you will get shot.  <br><br><br> God == Allah == Person <br> Me == Person =&gt; me == God == Allah <br> Faggot == OP =&gt; OP == faggot </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Slowly but surely? Fucking bulshit we are fucking pushing you back to the mountains you came from , and take your resources you leave behind.. I can't to enlist in the fuckin marines just to see the look on your fuckin faces when we finish with you.</br>  Someone out there made this thread, some fuy literally went on b search tht image wrote those lines and posted it here  Allah is actually a demon who has tricked you all into willingly submitting your souls, you fool, there is no such thing as a deity! Now you are trapped by him forever to be tortured so allah may sustain itself.<br><br><br>As for everyone else, ISIS and the US military get funding from the same place, so fuck off</br></br></br>  <br> YOU, the WEST needs to stop attacking the Muslim people <br> You attacked us and threatened our lives and people and Allah has commanded us to fight back against hostile disbelievers. <br><br> Implying mudslimes are "fighting back" <br>Mudslimes did 9/11. WE are making them pay.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>If serious, you're a dumb motherfucker. If trolling, you're a dumb motherfucker. Well done!</br>  <br>you meant to click on the comment two posts above you right?</br>  <br>Mate we nearly extinct the jews, we can easily extinct your shitty religon</br>      <br> I can't wait until you are all dead. <br><br>This is the difference between the kafir and the Muslim. The kafir is hateful by nature, demanding immediate murder, whereas the Muslim is passive and invites one to Islam, offering salvation, before resorting to war.<br><br>Your statement displays exactly why the kafir will be defeated. We do not get pleasure out of waging war and commiting genocide, we do it as a last resort and a punishment for hostility against us, unlike your kind, who initate war because of inherent hate.</br></br></br></br></br>  of course op is just joking, but i wonder if these muslims realize that if any western country alone, like just france or just britain could completely destroy ISIS for example without the help of nukes?  <br> invites to islam before declaring war  <br> before declaring war  <br><br>so... he asks you if you want to convert to islam and then he cuts your head off?</br></br></br></br>  <br>probably some teenage edgelord<br>that or a trolloller</br></br>  <br> Mudslimes did 9/11. WE are making them pay. <br>So why aren't you invading Saudi Arabia - Islam central?<br>All of the hijackers were Saudi, no ties to Iraq or Syria, yet those are the countries you invade under deceptions and falsifications. YOU came to Iraq and Sham to attack us. Not a single Iraqi or Syrian was involved in 9/11, it was your friends the Saudis. We are indeed fighting back.</br></br></br>  <br>Hahaha. Faget.<br>Look in a history book if you want to know what we westernes do to people we feal threatened by.<br><br>I can already hear the ovens being fired up.</br></br></br></br>  <br>have you seen your women</br>  <br>wikiislam dot net/wiki/Islam_and_Bestiality</br>  <br>I bet he can't, they're always wearing a burqa</br>  Islam is a camel jockey pedophile ' s knockoff of jewish mythology.<br>I urge you to respect humanity through humanism, as was accepted during the golden ages of Islam. Sadly, fundemental Islam is as savage as the sandnigger Mohammed.</br>  <br> so... he asks you if you want to convert to islam and then he cuts your head off? <br><br>No, we are inviting all to Islam all the time, so that you will be a part of the Ummah and not follow the orders of kuffar leaders who want to destroy Islam. If you refuse and choose to continue your hostility, we will punish you. If your crimes and hostility is deemed to be particularly serious, such a gruesome fate may indeed await you.<br><br>This is in contrast to the western Christian ways of simply showing up and slaughtering. Just ask the native Americans.</br></br></br></br></br>  We need another set of crusades  Yeah, no  <br>Can you translate into English? It's hard to understand your message when you're using words from a language I could never possibly begin to understand.</br>  <br>OK, you convinced me.<br>What do i need to do?<br>So far i got :<br>1. give the woman long clothes and a scarf so they won`t get raped by horny Muslims without selfcontrol and selfrespect.<br>2. Put a piece of cloth , much like a skirt, on the backsides of goats so they won`t get raped by horny Muslims without selfcontrol and self respect.<br>3. Having little boys as servants, like in afghanistan, and let them serve you tea and after that fuck them in the ass is perfectly fine because that´s what people do and it´s really normal.<br><br>Am i a good muslim yet?<br>I´m afraid because I do not want to rape litlle boys and i fear that it`s maybe some kind of to do thing like praying and sucide bombing and shit.<br>Did you get raped in the ass before they let you play with a PC on the chans,OP?<br>Did you like it?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Suicide is a sin.<br>Murder is a sin.<br>Learn to Islam you fucktard</br></br></br>  <br>That's how they trick themselves<br>That their hairy she-apes are attractive.<br>There is a reason those motherfuckers started humping goats</br></br></br>  <br> I urge you to respect humanity through humanism <br>Funny how that philosophy was not followed during the crusades. Westerners/Christians are always preaching, never practising.<br><br>Why is it that, when you say "the Muslims wer invading we had no choice but crusades!" it is supposed to be accepted, but if we say " the Christians are invading (Iraq was invaded in 2003) we must "practice humanism"? Typical hypocrite westerner. Not liking it when tables are turned.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Good luck.<br><br>We're waiting.</br></br></br>  <br>Humanists=/=Westerners =/=Christians.<br>ignorant fuck.</br></br>  <br>Again, arrogant westerners expecting everything to revolve around their world. The reason Muslims use this vocabulary in it's original form is because there are sometimes no direct translations to an inferior language such as English. But never-the-less, I shall respect your desire to learn.<br><br>Kuffar/Kafir = non-Muslim person/thing<br>Ummah = the whole community of Muslims bound together by ties of religion<br><br>giyf</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're very misinformed, there are actually few christians here, very small amount of total population, everyone in the USA thinks christians are as dumb as muslims.<br><br>Blaming citizens for the actions of corporations is dumb, and is biting the hand that feeds you</br></br></br>  <br>B8</br>  <br>You won't be laughing when both allah and jesus torture you in the afterlife for falling for their scheme to steal your soul!!!! Ignore this comment all you want, but you'll remember when the time comes</br>  <br>Practice what you preach, blow yourself up, show the liberals who think Islam is a religion of peace what the true nature of Islam really is.</br>  <br>I didn't say that you imbecile, I said that he is preaching humanism as a westerner, as do so many westerners today and they are all thus hypocrites. Lrn2read.</br>  <br>If you're appealing to a Western audience, your presentation should very much revolve around our languages.<br><br>Your terrible attitude is making it difficult to want to convert.</br></br></br>  <br>If you will exterminate the homosexuals, I will help you take over America.</br>  <br>this.<br><br>I thought I was the only one who realized. I was once a muslim, and had a near death experience and met allah; he laughed at me and told me my life was a joke and that i was a fool for believing the words of muhammed, the only dead muslim whos soul he ever released.<br><br>It's not too late to turn back, OP. You can save your soul still. I'm trying to help, and yes, I'm very fucking serious.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>fucking snackbars need to get btfo'd</br>  <br>I am so grateful i came out of my coma. <br>Remember this muslim brothers, a true deity would not need a prophet like muhammed (sorry my english) to spread his word he would make his holy presence undeniable to any thinking being</br></br>  Three threads on islam on /b/.  <br>  there are actually few christians here, very small amount of total population, everyone in the USA thinks christians are as dumb as muslims. <br> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reli<wbr>gion_in_the_United_States</wbr> <br><br>70% of US citizens identify as Christian. Again, hypocrisy. If we were to deem the social ills and military decisions of our leaders beyond our control, we are told that it is our fault/responsibility and that we should "practise democracy better". But when poor innocent "woe is me" westerner says it, we must accept that it is out of their control and not blame them.</br></br></br></br>   trusting mudslims and kikes <br><br>LMAO</br></br>  Hey, I think they'rea bunch of stupid misinformed assholes too, but it's no excuse to go and kill them. You could easily instead educate the world about the US's lies and how they manipulate, providing evidence, but nooooo, you have to lower yourself to the level of those you oppose. How does that make you any different??? And why wont you accept that allah is stealing your soul and tricking you?  <br>First part is true, we and the americans have to stop this immediatly.the west has always been killing people and destroying the earth since america was invaded.I dont care about this allahu akbar shit, no religion is the true one</br>  <br>You would provide evidence of US funding and false flags and financial fraud, but you're part of it, you're another militia created and funded by the US and are afraid to touch any comments here that would force you to admit it. you're nothing but another false flag. I bet you're even an american yourself.</br>  <br>The true nature of Islam is submission to Allah. The reason you seem to hate it is that it allows fighting back against hostile people, and prescribes punishments for wrong-doing. Your western Christian ways hates resistance to your oppression and being held accountable for sins, thus are afraid of a religion that promotes such iudeas.</br>  <br>she is getting older and not as beautiful as she was</br>  <br> You could easily instead educate the world about the US's lies and how they manipulate, providing evidence, but nooooo, you have to lower yourself to the level of those you oppose <br>Most people are aware, but choose to fight for the US anyways. We have no choice anymore..<br><br> How does that make you any different??? <br>See <br>We are still open to forgive if our enemies repent, embrace Islam or leave our lands, but they do not.<br><br> And why wont you accept that allah is stealing your soul and tricking you? <br>It is you who is being decieved. Read up on Christianity and how it was corrupted and modified to suit the needs of those in power.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Allah doesn't want you to realize your potential as a divine being, and thus needs you to submit your soul while confused in this earthly form. Turn back, it is not too late to save your family.</br>  <br>Why is Slam killing children ?</br>      <br>you always try to change the subject or avoid the blame, saying you are forced. but you, and only you, make this choice, a choice made while living in a body blind to all but 5 senses. How could you think making such an important decision while trapped in a human body is wise??? You are being decieved, <br>Christianity is a religion that is also created to steal souls, but was made by a spirit other than allah. Realize your potential as a divine being that is greater than allah</br></br>  <br>It's ok. Gay people can marry now.

Maybe in the future, maybe not. Doesn't matter to me.</br>  <br>Polygamy should be legal. Why should other people get to decide who gets to inherit your belongings/wealth, visit you in the hospital, etc.? That decision should not be a governmental concern. It is a social issue, and like every other social issue, the government can only fuck it up.</br>  <br> *Only when it agrees with my own views. <br><br>polygamy was rejected a long time before same-sex marriage was a thing<br><br>it wasn't gay people who forced the Mormons to abandon it</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm a homo who believes he's god.<br><br>Farthest away from a christian fundamentalist.<br><br> What you just typed <br>I have no idea what you're going on about.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> only gays hate polygamists and incest people </br>  <br><br>yeah, but don't bother telling people the truth<br><br>it's easier to post lies to incite FUD<br><br>people actually think there is a "polygamy orientation" — DUH</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not op, adult child isn't but hey all else goes in USA.</br>    <br>Maybe a sense of morality and ethics?</br>  <br> I have no idea what you're going on about. <br><br>The Holy Bible presents incest as best<br><br>God picked Lot to save from damnation, saying he was the only man worthy of saving in Sodom<br><br>God then destroyed two large cities<br><br>God then killed Lot's wife<br><br>Why?<br><br>Apparently so Lot could fuck both of his daughters and get them both pregnant. When Lot had offered them to be gang-raped in public and the mob refused God had to get more creative.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Polygamy will probably become legal one day, but for now it's not socially accepted enough. <br><br>Incest is unlikely to ever be legalised because of the increased chance of birth defects.</br></br>  <br> google.com <br><br> dictionary.com = lazy asshole who expects everyone to do all his research for him </br></br></br>  <br> the main reason marriage is around is for making a stable family for raising kids, and that includes kids raised by gays <br>But children raised by 2 women are more likely to kill themselves (in a very large number) and use drugs than any other group of parents (heterosexual, single mom, single dad, and 2 gay men).<br><br>So should lesbians be banned from marriage?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Polygamy will probably become legal one day <br>It was<br><br>David had hundreds of concubines and Mormons in Utah had lots of wives</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not enough faggots complaining yet.</br>  <br> But children raised by 2 women are more likely to kill themselves (in a very large number) and use drugs than any other group of parents (heterosexual, single mom, single dad, and 2 gay men). <br><br>nope<br><br>lesbians actually have a slight advantage in success at child-rearing according to the research</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't think the sample size for same sex couples with kids is big enough to draw any conclusions.</br></br>  When someone asks a question like this it should be legal to murder them, they're not doing anything of society    <br>What's a book of make-believe have to do with anything?</br>  <br> I don't think the sample size for same sex couples with kids is big enough to draw any conclusions. <br>he posted BS<br><br>there have been multiple parenting studies and they all find either equal outcome or a slight improvement in outcome for lesbian parenting<br><br>people post a lot of bullshit on /b/ to b8 people</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So then a husband with two wives should be even better</br>  <br><br>oh shiiit i should have seen through that, thanks anon</br></br>  <br>The problem is that people in cults and shit have a habit of brainwashing their kids and inducting them into polygamy cults. If you think that's paranoid all you have to look at his Utah. You have closed of towns with patriarchs raising little hareems. Kids born into those types of families have no prospects outside of their cults. <br><br>There have also been plenty of studies in regards to polygamous culture and crime. Generally wealthy older men have a habit of buying up all the women leaving less for less affluent, less established younger men. All those young guys eventually cause problems. <br><br>Polygamy has very little to do with sex or love and more about power. It makes women subordinate and gives men wealthy enough to maintain large hareems an advantage over younger men as now these younger men will hope to pursue these wealthy older me to vie for his daughters. <br><br>Polygamy has alot of negatives and some pretty shitty human rights violationing shit backed in. It's far from. Harmless.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   heterosexuals and homosexuals exist <br><br> people stupidly don't realize that incest and polygamy are not orientations <br><br> people shitpost anyway </br></br></br></br>  A prurient interest.  <br>Incest is illegal?<br>I thought it was just frown upon... :(</br></br>  <br> So then a husband with two wives should be even better <br><br>polygamy goes beyond the pair bond so it's more likely to have stability problems<br><br>regardless, polygamy is not a sexual orientation so it's not directly relevant to legalizing same-sex or opposite-sex marriage. Marriage is pair bonding based on a person's sexual orientation.<br><br>Polygamy, by contrast, is the redefinition of marriage to move beyond the pair bond.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Faggots  <br>Incest is about loneliness / convenience and Polygamy is about power brokerages... <br><br>I don't know why people equate that shit to homosexuality... <br><br>There are proven negatives to Polygamy and Incest.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  pair bonding is the strongest intimate bond <br>probe it, faggot</br></br>  <br>Except for christian/jewish concepts of marriage, there is no reason against polygamy in either (multiple males/multiple females) way.<br><br>Incest bears a risk of hereditary diseases if repeated over multiple generations, so related couples should check for those before deciding about children.<br><br>Gay marriage still follows the standard scheme of monogamous relation and afaik, no problems with their chirldren are known, so ist is the least difficult alternative to straight marriages.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I don't know why people equate that shit to homosexuality... <br><br>because they're trying to spread FUD</br></br></br>  <br> probe it, faggot <br>reality hurts?</br></br>  <br><br>?</br></br>  <br> Gay marriage still follows the standard scheme of monogamous relation and afaik, no problems with their chirldren are known, so ist is the least difficult alternative to straight marriages. <br><br>it's not an "alternative"<br><br>it's pair bonding for homosexual people</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>FUD? Enlighten me?</br>  <br>We need to fucking set up concentration camps for these faggots and let a mass murder the scale of hitler's reign pour in. marriage is between a man and a woman not this other bullshit.</br>  <br>Uh oh... the gay agenda to destroy marriage has been discovered. Quick anons, who told OP?</br>  <br>I have researched already. Monogamy is not more stable than polygamy. Around 50% of marriages in the US end in divorce. Why? Because humans evolved polyamorously. In societies that do not take a hard-line stance on monogamy, divorce/break-ups are much more rare. <br><br>We are genetically predisposed to NOT fuck people we find familiar. The more time you spend with someone, the less you want to fuck them. This is to prevent fucking up the gene pool through incest.<br><br>Take that, and a hard-line stance for monogamy (any cheating = automatic breakup), and you have a recipe for broken families. People get married, have a couple kids, cheat, then break up. Then start all over again. We are not monogamous-- we practice serial monogamy, until we cheat. And most people do cheat. <br><br>So, really, what's worse? Open polyamory, with realistic adults who all raise children together, or chains of broken relationships, with kids barely seeing one parent--- usually the father? What is more stable?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> FUD? Enlighten me? <br><br>the FUD is the slippery slope nonsense that if one recognizes that gay people exist and thus deserve the right to marry each other that the sky will rain cats, dogs, frying pans, and people marrying toasters<br><br>same-sex marriage is not a definition of marriage but that's what the FUD spreaders claim</br></br></br></br></br>  I don't have a problem with homosexual. or even homosexuals being civilly partnered.<br><br>but why would they -want- to be joined under a god (read; basically any) that despises their lifestyle? they want it because they didn't have it. not because they want it.</br></br>  <br> same-sex marriage is not a definition of marriage but that's what the FUD spreaders claim <br><br> not a redefinition </br></br></br>  <br>Marriage by definition is simply a contractual union of two people. By that definition, polygamy does not fit. Incest is legal in some areas already, and what stops that is biology. Most people can not think of a relative that way at all.<br><br>And before the slop gets even slipperier, inanimate things, animals, and underage people can not legally consent, and thus cannot enter in a contract, so no marriage can happen there legally.</br></br></br>  <br>Bullshit. The highest risk group is kids raised by a single mom. And 50% of hetero marriages end in divorce... so you do the math.</br>  <br>they dont want your dumb ass and your dumb ass sister making double retard dumbass kids</br>  <br> but why would they -want- to be joined under a god (read; basically any) that despises their lifestyle? they want it because they didn't have it. not because they want it. <br><br>marriage is secular<br><br>go to a courthouse and a Buddhist can marry a Muslim</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>1. Marriage does not have to be under god or have anything to do with religion<br><br>2. Not everybody's god despises homosexuality</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh look. A hypocritical fag that want equal rights for everyone unless it goes again their own views.</br>  <br>You missed the sarcasm.</br>  <br>You see only one version of a polygamous concept and you show - obviously, to prove your point - a culture where it created problems.<br><br>One major problem in your view - especially shown in your regard for poorer men - ist that you see the wives als property ("buying up all the women"). Why don't you see the options of polygamy with families of several women with one man (few men can keep up with several modern women around) and other families where just one woman lives with several men in the same area? <br><br>Other polygamous cultures - in the himalaya area for example - had one wife with multiple men. This reduced the number of children in an area where food was scarce.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>actually marriage was created under various religions for said religions.<br>usually a marriage is still carried out under a religion.<br><br>if a Buddhist and a Muslim get married they would have a Buddhist or a Islamic wedding. not just -a- wedding.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why don't you ask for killing all people with an IQ less than five points above your own?</br>  bottom line is:<br><br>there is no incest orientation and there is no polygamy orientation<br><br>as a result, everyone is equally denied polygamy and equally denied incest</br></br></br></br>  <br> more likely to have stability problems <br><br>Where do you get this shit? There is no proof of that. <br><br> Polygamy, by contrast, is the redefinition of marriage to move beyond the pair bond. <br><br>Just like gay marriage is legalized to redefine the original definition including only heterosexuals. Sorry, but the acceptance of polyamory as a legitimate form of marriage far predates the acceptance of homosexual marriage. <br><br>Some people form bonds with multiple people.How is that hard to understand, and why should they receive any less rights than other people?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> actually marriage was created under various religions for said religions. <br><br>I said it doesn't HAVE to have anything to do with religion because it doesn't. Nobody's denying it CAN be a religious ceremony.</br></br></br></br>  <br>save it for your tumblr. i have enough money to support 2-3 wives and theres no cult or power, a person can love more than one person. Polygamy is coming, you better be on the right side of history, faggot</br>  <br>I'm just saying i've never seen or heard a marriage without X god being mentioned.</br>  <br>Yeah, because having a sexual orientation to more than one race and wanting to marry both isn't a thing. /s</br>  <br> There are proven negatives to Polygamy <br> What, exactly, other than the obvious BS cult crap, or BS sandperson harem BS? What about modern, western polyamory, where people aren't treated as property (which is really the actual problem with sandpeople and cults... not polyamory).</br></br>  <br><br>My parents got married by a JP and not in a church. Most people probably do have religious ceremonies, but the OP I was responding to was claiming that gay people shouldn't want to get married because marriage is a religious ceremony and god doesn't like gay people which is completely fucking ridiculous.</br></br>  <br>There is already an option in France for a civil contract between more than two people that gives them most of the rights of a marriage.</br>  <br>why shouldn't they be legal?</br>  <br>Any consenting adults should be allowed to marry. Hetero, gay, pairs, quads, whatever. It;s not the business of the government to deny rights to anyone that can legally consent.</br>  This is more accurate in the 80's. There were no none church weddings back then. Now there are all kinds of weddings. <br><br>I'm not saying this just to spite you. I gate queers.</br></br>  <br>^This. Any consenting adults should be permitted into any legally binding contract. In the eyes of the law, that is all marriage is.</br>  <br> having a sexual orientation to more than one race </br>  <br> Marriage by definition is simply a contractual union of two people <br><br> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marr<wbr>iage</wbr> <br> Marriage, also called matrimony or wedlock, is a socially or ritually recognized union or legal contract between spouses that establishes rights and obligations between them, between them and their children, and between them and their in-laws. <br><br>I don't see anything about limiting it to two people... and there's a whole section on polyamorous marriage. And, hey, polyamorous marriage predates homosexual marriage, too.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> equal rights for everyone unless it goes again their own views <br><br>what equal rights?<br><br>there is no incest orientation and there is no polygamy orientation<br><br>as a result, everyone is equally denied polygamy and equally denied incest.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And yet when you bring up polygamy to the majority of gays they get their jimmies rustled and angrily reply it's not the same</br>  <br>Oh my God. Am I having a stroke? I can't read this.</br>  <br>nope<br><br>marriage started in Rome and the wedding band is the roman slave band<br><br>marriage was pair bonding and was not done for love. it was done for property right.

Here's hoping. <br><br>Still, this ruling makes me happy.</br></br>  <br>What if I'm bisexual and want to marry both a man and a woman?</br>  <br> And yet when you bring up polygamy to the majority of gays they get their jimmies rustled and angrily reply it's not the same <br><br> or they just calmly tell you to get a clue before spreading your FUD <br><br> there is no polygamy orientation. if people want to legalize polygamy that's up to them. but it's not relevant to same-sex marriage legalization </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>beastiality is next</br>  <br><br>Why? If I'm being married by a legal representative of the state, not a representative of any religion, why would it be under god?

Here's hoping. <br><br>pedophiles will be mentally ill regardless of how society treats them<br><br>nice b8, too</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Marriage likely predates organized religion, and was probably used to form societal bonds. So it;s likely more legal in origin. Since marriage predates written history, there's no knowing the exact origins.</br>  <br>Bisexual isn't a sexual orientation? On what planet?</br>  <br>Because most of them are in a relationship that they want a monogamist marriage with... and they feel just as threatened by the aspect of polygamy as the holy-rollers do about same-sex marriage.</br>  <br><br>can your kids marry each other now if they love each other?</br></br>  <br>Who says polygamy isn't an orientation?

Marriage began way before Rome. Every single written and oral history includes some sort of reference to marriage. And the earlier you go, the more likely you are to run across polyamorous versions. Marriage was probably formalized as a legal bond to establish inheritance shortly after agriculture began. In the West, it was still common into the ninth century to have polyamorous marriages among nobles. Until the Catholic church killed off the practice. Rome invented marriage... what a faggot.</br></br>  <br> marriage started in Rome <br>american education</br></br>  <br>Divorce was the first step.<br>Gay marriage is the second step.<br>Incest marriage will be the third step.<br>Poligamy will be the fourth step.<br>And then marriage won't mean anything anymore and you will marry your fish.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>One corruption of an institution by people who don't take it seriously neither excuses nor justifies further corruption and perversions.</br></br>  <br>It's as good a source as any, when defining something that every culture defines differently. What would you suggest? Merriam-Webster, and their highly simplistic and westernized definition?</br>  <br><br>American Christian propaganda. I believed it most of my life too.</br></br>  <br> threesomes and larger have more stability trouble which makes it less reliable for raising kids <br><br>Where are you people (or person?) getting this? It's complete bullshit.</br></br></br>  Laws  <br>don't tell me tell every non-religious person getting married under christianity.</br>  <br>Yeah... gonna have to pass on being French.</br>  <br><br>Try Google Scholar, fuckwit.</br></br>  <br><br>Uhm, what? In what church did you learn this, because you weren't being taught from the Bible.</br></br>  <br>From school and mass media, obviously.<br>They don't realize that humans are in fact polygamous and that children were raised by more than 2 people.</br></br>  <br>Jews will try and push it, but Feminazi's will pushback because it means less Men for them, no one wants ugly old feminists</br>  <br>They both are in Utah dingus.</br>  <br>I had a public American education, and I was never taught that crap. I did not grow up Christian, though.</br>    <br>Parents, bible groups, church camp, etc... places where the adult Christians say things in passing without it being public. Lots of what religious groups do is akin to how hate groups do it... covertly.</br>  <br> mentally ill <br><br>Gays were considered mentally ill as well remember?</br></br></br>  <br>meant legal throughout the national like gay marriage just became</br>  <br> slippery slope argument <br> people falling for obvious troll </br></br>  <br>Also, a man that can marry multiple women is alpha and RICH.<br>I doubt a kid with a broke beta dad will grow better than the son of a rich alpha with multiple wives that can help raise him.</br></br>  <br>It paves the way my friend. Some day we will truly be free.</br>  <br>I could cite studies that support the opposite of your view. All you can do is say "Hur dur Google, buttass." The only contemporary "studies" I have found that support the view of the "standard nuclear family" are Christian-backed, and completely ignore the ridiculous divorce rates in heavily monogamous Western countries. Maybe you need to rethink how much cock you suck in a day... it might be causing brain damage.</br>  <br>The number is below 11%, it hasn't been 50 since the 80s or earlier I believe is when that figure was ever in existence. Divorce rates have done nothing but decline since then. 11% was for couples after first 7 anniversaries by the way. Don't bullshit your facts off hearsay. And look it up I'm on mobile so I'll be a cunt and not cite my shit at the moment</br>  <br>According to that reasoning we shouldn't kill a dog that killed a child because you can't assume he will kill again.<br>Fallacy fallacy.<br><br>Go hang yourself.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That isn't true. The evidence insofar as the literature suggests is the opposite, mainly because children born within gay parent relationships tend to make for better parents as they are more prepared for it rather than heterosexual parents who tend to have children accidently or on a whim.</br></br>  <br> a man that can marry multiple women is alpha and RICH. <br>What are you, 12 years old? Who says there is one man and x women? Sometimes there are a couple of each. Or one woman and a couple men.<br><br>Do you have any sense of economics? If you have four people in a relationship, and a handful of kids, one can stay at home to watch the young ones while three work. Instead of those same people as two couples, where two people work (or worse, they both have to work and pay for daycare).</br></br></br></br>  <br>ITT: People making wild assumptions that they likely have no data to back up. (This on all sides of the argument.)<br><br>In the eyes of the State (this means governmental body in legal terms, so federal and local are both included) Marriage is a social contract, dealing with taxes primarily. In the first line of the first amendment of the Constitution of the United States of America it states that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof" the notion of marriage only being between man and woman is entirely of religious origins, and is not shared by all religions. So barring any kind of marriage between two people is unconstitutional. Polygamy is a different story because it changes the taxes, personally I don't have a problem with polygamy but at least there is some basis for why it would be restricted. As far as incest goes it should be illegal because incestuous offspring are far more likely to be born with birth defects. So by fucking your sister you are potentially ruining the life of another. Every being should have the right to come into this world with the best chance of success, and if you knowingly hinder their chances then it should be a crime just as assaulting someone is a crime.<br><br>TLDR; why does anyone care if Joe and Bob have some governmental paper that says they are together.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> the notion of marriage only being between man and woman is entirely of religious origins, and is not shared by all religions <br>bullshit. name ONE religion that marries same sex couples</br></br>  <br>the romans and greeks. their religious views said nothing about who to marry</br>  <br>That is the next step. The government should not tell you how many wife or husband you should have.<br><br>Also I got a pretty daughter and I could marry her as soon as she hits 18. We already fuck so, wont be a problem. I would create my own "Craster's Keep". Fucking my daughters and make them abort the male babies..</br></br></br>  <br><br>not to mention plenty of splinter christian groups that are ok with it.</br></br>  <br>you are full of shit.

I don't blindly buy into taboos</br>  <br>marriage should be abolished. It's discrimination against permavirgins. (Also why should anyone have to pay less taxes because he / she procreated. That's like giving out medals for shitting. If anything at all these people should pay more)</br>  <br>Oh god, they were gay as fuck in ancient greece and rome.<br>The right to vote was economic.</br></br>  <br> I don't blindly buy into taboos <br>It's not blind<br><br>there are some real problems with both, the largest of which is extreme birth defects for hetero incestuous pregnancy<br><br>also, regardless... neither are orientations</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> why should anyone have to pay less taxes because he / she procreated <br><br>because kids populate the labor force<br><br>old people are more expensive to support<br><br>when people breed they keep young people around to work for the older people<br><br>they also provide young people for military fodder</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> yfw this is what they're actually trying to do </br>  <br>You must be looking at annual divorces per 1000 population. That is about 11, or just over 1% of the population. But that's every year. <br><br>A CDC study in 2012 (using 1995 data) shows that 43% of first marriages dissolved within 15 years. Second (or later) marriages had an even higher rate of divorce. That puts the total divorce rate at around 50%. The U.S. Census Bureau confirms these numbers (a 41%, 60%, and 71% divorce rate for first, second, and third time marriages, respectively). And the National Survey of Family Growth estimates that the lifelong probability of a marriage ending in divorce is 40%–50%, as of 2012. <br><br>This isn't hearsay; this is statistics.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> what are condoms <br><br>idiot</br></br></br>  <br> they were gay as fuck in ancient greece and rome. <br><br>not exactly<br><br>in both cultures what we consider gay (equal relationships between two adults) was part of a subculture<br><br>in ancient Rome if two men of equal status were to have sex it would be scandalous.

This way, everyone felt obligated to support everyone, should any of the men die in their very dangerous jobs. <br><br>And who the fuck cares about non-Western polyamory? It's more akin to ownership, anyway. We are far more likely to have polyamorous groups where members are on equal footing. So why shouldn't we allow them to solidify and legalize this arrangement?
