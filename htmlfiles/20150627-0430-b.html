[ Gay marraige is now legal in all 50 states  What are your thoughts /b/?     Follow dreem   KILL ZE JEwS!   Oh, hey, got dubs.    so, if gay marriage is legal, soon will be pedophilia and zoophilia legal in the US?    No  Honestly, why is that even a question? Is that the only thing people can think of as a rebutle?     My dogs gay (black too) I caught him humping another male dog. he's still the coolest dog I've ever had. He just likes to bark, run and hump another consenting male dog. It's the same way with people. As long as you are with a consenting person there's nothing wrong with a little ass play in between your daily routine.   Thats funny as fuck, mostly because im pretty sure all male dogs do that.    So mean thing that stops those from becoming legal is consent no child or animal can give real consent but two full grown men can.     concensual   Dogs hump each other to show dominance, anon. Doesn't mean your dog is gay.      Fucking libtards    one door is open to pedophiles, good job Amerika.    Only the republican judges voted for it to be legal   If anyone has ever worked in a restaurant they know all the gay shit the cooks like to do. They are cool with it; are we really less evolved than the Mexicans?   He wears a scarf after going to the salon...pretty sure he's gay. Either way still the coolest dog. If someone wants to be as cool as my dog LeRoy then I got no problem with what they do.    when will they let lesbins get married?    When speaking of gay marraige, its addressed as both parties.  Male and females can get married     Gay   A child can give consent you fucking retard. You're telling me a 15 year old isn't aware of what they want or what's going on?    this anon is confirmed 15 pls ban    Murica is now a faglord country. Please evacuate to nearby countries    I'm mad because I'm an edgy contrarian with no friends!  Disgraced to be an American, but then again that's the usual nowadays   don't care.    I said child you fucking teenypopper faggot   I have a boner. A gay boner.  Gay marriage doesn't really change this, so fuck it because either way I could have still bust a nut.       Same reason I hump your mom    ITT: can we discuss Muslims we've actually met IRL? Living in an insular american society viewing the Islamic world through media portrayal it'd be easy to view Muslims with disgust. But when I sit down and think about Muslims I've met, I realize they've invariably been nice people, always inviting me in for tea and shit, telling me it's really cool that I'm from America (which you'll never hear from a European). I'm interested in hearing about other people's interactions with our sandnigger brethren. If you've never met a Muslim, pls stay out of conversation.    Yeah, they're nice people actually None of them wearing that ISIS outfit or something. Some of my best friends are muslim.    I have two cousins married to NE African Muslims. One nice guy, one a dick. Both naturalized regular citizens. One even works inside our defense department.   I only know one. The only way you would know he's a Muslim is if you asked him or offer him a drink at a party.   Have a couple Muslim friends. One thing I've notices is that even the most liberal of their families are still pretty damn conservative. They've stopped my friends from going off to good colleges just because they were too far, and a close friend in particular is moving to Abu Dabi because his parents are.  Taqiyya and Kitman  Wait until they are majority and it is convert or beheaded.     in Syria in 2011   miss bus, have to wait until night for next one   atmosphere on bus feels sketchier than a NYC subway at night   old lady sitting in front of me keeps turning around and giving me weird looks   she pulls out her cellphone and starts dialing   oh Jesus, who is she calling   oh Jesus is she going to detonate an IED   she turns around and hands me cellphone   ...hello?   voice on other end: "hello, do you speak English?"   yeah...   "you're sitting behind my grandmother."   ok?   "she's worried about you."   oh yes?...   "in the village you're going to all the hotels will be closed and she doesn't think you'll have anywhere to sleep. If you go with her when the bus stops, you can come and stay at my family home."  I am still in touch with that family today. Luckily they live in the south.                  The Qur'an: Qur'an (16:106) - Establishes that there are circumstances that can "compel" a Muslim to tell a lie.  Qur'an (3:28) - This verse tells Muslims not to take those outside the faith as friends, unless it is to "guard themselves" against danger, meaning that there are times when a Muslim may appear friendly to non-Muslims, though they should not feel that way..  Qur'an (9:3) - "...Allah and His Messenger are free from liability to the idolaters..." The dissolution of oaths with the pagans who remained at Mecca following its capture. They did nothing wrong, but were evicted anyway.  Qur'an (40:28) - A man is introduced as a believer, but one who must "hide his faith" among those who are not believers.  Qur'an (2:225) - "Allah will not call you to account for thoughtlessness in your oaths, but for the intention in your hearts" The context of this remark is marriage, which explains why Sharia allows spouses to lie to each other for the greater good.  Qur'an (3:54) - "And they (the disbelievers) schemed, and Allah schemed (against them): and Allah is the best of schemers." The Arabic word used here for scheme (or plot) is makara, which literally means 'deceit'. If Allah is supremely deceitful toward unbelievers, then there is little basis for denying that Muslims are allowed to do the same. (See also 8:30 and 10:21)  Taken collectively these verses are interpreted to mean that there are circumstances when a Muslim may be "compelled" to deceive others for a greater purpose.                To be honest, I don't know how many I've met because I think a lot of the ones around here are actually Sikhs.   Never met a Muslim. Come to think of it, never met a black person or an Arab.  Thank you based Eastern Europe    Met a muslim named Barry Soetoro he stunk   You dirty Dhimmi   How does moslem cock taste     I'm an American who's worked in Saudi Arabia. The Muslims I've worked with there were super nice. Both shia and sunni. They weren't judgemental about western ideals. They asked me lots of questions about living in the US and took good care of me during my stays.  BUT...Saudi Arabia is a fucked up place. The land where joy and happiness goes to die. The following things are illegal: alcohol, musical performances, movie theaters, women exposing their hair/body, talking to women you aren't married or related to etc etc. Islam dominates every aspect of life.  I'm conflicted. Are Muslims inherently bad? No. Would I want to live in a society dominated by Islam? Over my dead body.      From the Hadith:   Bukhari (52:269) - "The Prophet said, 'War is deceit.'" The context of this is thought to be the murder of Usayr ibn Zarim and his thirty unarmed men by Muhammad's men after he "guaranteed" them safe passage (see Additional Notes below).   Bukhari (49:857) - "He who makes peace between the people by inventing good information or saying good things, is not a liar." Lying is permitted when the end justifies the means.   Bukhari (84:64-65) - Speaking from a position of power at the time, Ali confirms that lying is permissible in order to deceive an "enemy."   Muslim (32:6303) - "...he did not hear that exemption was granted in anything what the people speak as lie but in three cases: in battle, for bringing reconciliation amongst persons and the narration of the words of the husband to his wife, and the narration of the words of a wife to her husband (in a twisted form in order to bring reconciliation between them)."   Bukhari (50:369) - Recounts the murder of a poet, Ka'b bin al-Ashraf, at Muhammad's insistence. The men who volunteered for the assassination used dishonesty to gain Ka'b's trust, pretending that they had turned against Muhammad. This drew the victim out of his fortress, whereupon he was brutally slaughtered despite putting up a ferocious struggle for his life.            From Islamic Law:   Reliance of the Traveler (p. 746 - 8.2) - "Speaking is a means to achieve objectives. If a praiseworthy aim is attainable through both telling the truth and lying, it is unlawful to accomplish through lying because there is no need for it. When it is possible to achieve such an aim by lying but not by telling the truth, it is permissible to lie if attaining the goal is permissible (N:i.e. when the purpose of lying is to circumvent someone who is preventing one from doing something permissible), and obligatory to lie if the goal is obligatory... it is religiously precautionary in all cases to employ words that give a misleading impression...   "One should compare the bad consequences entailed by lying to those entailed by telling the truth, and if the consequences of telling the truth are more damaging, one is entitled to lie.       That's touching   I knew one from a government club I was in, he was big into martial arts and seemed like an alright guy.      Muslims are allowed to lie to unbelievers in order to defeat them. The two forms are:   Taqiyya - Saying something that isn't true.   Kitman - Lying by omission. An example would be when Muslim apologists quote only a fragment of verse 5:32 (that if anyone kills "it shall be as if he had killed all mankind") while neglecting to mention that the rest of the verse (and the next) mandate murder in undefined cases of "corruption" and "mischief."    Though not called Taqiyya by name, Muhammad clearly used deception when he signed a 10-year treaty with the Meccans that allowed him access to their city while he secretly prepared his own forces for a takeover. The unsuspecting residents were conquered in easy fashion after he broke the treaty two years later, and some of the people in the city who had trusted him at his word were executed.    Another example of lying is when Muhammad used deception to trick his personal enemies into letting down their guard and exposing themselves to slaughter by pretending to seek peace. This happened in the case of Ka'b bin al-Ashraf (as previously noted) and again later against Usayr ibn Zarim, a surviving leader of the Banu Nadir tribe, which had been evicted from their home in Medina by the Muslims.   At the time, Usayr ibn Zarim was attempting to gather an armed force against the Muslims from among a tribe allied with the Quraish (against which Muhammad had already declared war). Muhammad's "emissaries" went to ibn Zarim and persuaded him to leave his safe haven on the pretext of meeting with the prophet of Islam in Medina to discuss peace. Once vulnerable, the leader and his thirty companions were massacred by the Muslims with ease, belying the probability that they were mostly unarmed, having been given a guarantee of safe passage (Ibn Ishaq 981).   CONT               Bait please leave    I dated a Muslim girl before. She was perfect in every way. She then left me because I wouldn't accept god or convert to Islam    Such was the reputation of Muslims for lying and then killing that even those who "accepted Islam" did not feel entirely safe. The fate of the Jadhima is tragic evidence for this. When Muslim "missionaries" approached their tribe one of the members insisted that they would be slaughtered even though they had already "converted" to Islam to avoid just such a demise. However, the others were convinced that they could trust the Muslim leader's promise that they would not be harmed if they simply offered no resistance. (After convincing the skeptic to lay down his arms, the unarmed men of the tribe were quickly tied up and beheaded - Ibn Ishaq 834 &amp; 837).   Today's Muslims often try to justify Muhammad's murder of poets and others who criticized him at Medina by saying that they broke a treaty by their actions. Yet, these same apologists place little value on treaties broken by Muslims. From Muhammad to Saddam Hussein, promises made to non-Muslim are distinctly non-binding in the Muslim mindset.   Leaders in the Arab world routinely say one thing to English-speaking audiences and then something entirely different to their own people in Arabic. Yassir Arafat was famous for telling Western newspapers about his desire for peace with Israel, then turning right around and whipping Palestinians into a hateful and violent frenzy against Jews.   The 9/11 hijackers practiced deception by going into bars and drinking alcohol, thus throwing off potential suspicion that they were fundamentalists plotting jihad. This effort worked so well, in fact, that even weeks after 9/11, John Walsh, the host of a popular American television show, said that their bar trips were evidence of 'hypocrisy.'   CONT            I like in a small college town that from what i heard is funded by the saudis as we have a good population of them. They cause no trouble, friendly as fuck, and smoke weed everyday.    The transmission from Flight 93 records the hijackers telling their doomed passengers that there is "a bomb on board" but that everyone will "be safe" as long as "their demands are met." Obviously none of these things were true, but these men, who were so intensely devoted to Islam that they were willing to "slay and be slain for the cause of Allah" (as the Qur'an puts it) saw nothing wrong with employing Taqiyya in order to facilitate their mission of mass murder.   The Islamic Society of North America (ISNA) insists that it "has not now or ever been involved with the Muslim Brotherhood, or supported any covert, illegal, or terrorist activity or organization." In fact, it was created by the Muslim Brotherhood and has bankrolled Hamas. At least nine founders or board members of ISNA have been accused by prosecutors of supporting terrorism.   Prior to engineering several deadly terror plots, such as the Fort Hood massacre and the attempt to blow up a Detroit-bound airliner, American cleric Anwar al-Awlaki was regularly sought out by NPR, PBS and even government leaders to expound on the peaceful nature of Islam.   The Quran says in several places that Allah is the best at deceiving people. An interesting side note is verse 7:99, which says that the only people who feel secure from Allah are actually those who will perish in Hell. Taken literally, this would mean that those Muslims who arrogantly assume that they will enter heaven are in for a rude surprise (such are the hazards of worshipping an all-powerful deceiver).   CONT            The near absence of Qur'anic verse and reliable Hadith that encourage truthfulness is somewhat surprising, given that many Muslims are convinced that their religion teaches honesty. In fact, it is because of this ingrained belief that many Muslims are quite honest. When lying is addressed in the Qur'an, it is nearly always in reference to the "lies against Allah" - referring to the Jews and Christians who rejected Muhammad's claim to being a prophet.   Finally, the circumstances by which Muhammad allowed a believer to lie to a non-spouse are limited to those that either advance the cause of Islam or enable a Muslim to avoid harm to his well-being (and presumably that of other Muslims as well). Although this should be kept very much in mind when dealing with matters of global security, such as Iran's nuclear intentions, it is not grounds for assuming that the Muslim one might personally encounter on the street or in the workplace is any less honest than anyone else.      It's a fucking shame what's happening to good people in Syria now. You can thank the US, Turkey and Saudi Arabia for helping destabilize the country.    Met 2 in college, Mo and Khayvon  Both super nice, just normal guys really. Played LoL with them, just kinda did normal stuff. Only diff is they prayed 5 times a day and one of them kept Hallal, the other didnt .      Muslim here  I believe in Muslim rights in other countries but it bothers me how Muslims are pressing their stricter beliefs through lobbyism into countries that are mostly non Muslim    Any muslim I've met here has been tolerable at best and everything revolves around their religion, they took offense at anything resembling any other religion and I would not trust them for 2 seconds.  never met one. not sure why.   Ha those christan/muslim chicks that try to bait you into their religion    This is interesting because it directly contradicts at least one passage in the Quran. Not going to bother finding it, but it was explained to me like this:   you're in hospital visiting grandma   you happen to see a friend lying in a bed, dying   friend says, "oh how sweet of you, you came to see me on my deathbed, now I can die happy"   you say "yes, that's exactly what I came here for"  You've just committed a sin         i've only seen muslim men walking down the street with their women walking 10 feet behind them like second class citizens. I've also seen muslim women walking together with their heads covered, but wearing those tight jeans that show off their nice asses which kind of negates the point of wearing that head shit.         <br/>        Muslims are crazy ..they believe in a crazy religion...they believe in jihad which is very crazy ..it is a hateful and violent religion   Fucking sucked. She was 4'9. An artist. Hourglass shape body. And decent sized tits. Probably one of the best I ever had but alloha snackbar was more important   I'm Polish so i didnt see a nigger or a muslim in the last 8 years (i was in greece 8 years ago).   So yeah. No experiences with muslim savages here.  God damn i love my country, and i love that everyone else hates it. There still be 0 niggers here while the rest of europe turns into a ZOO.    Greetings from Poland.  Have a nice day.             There are other Islamic countries that I'm sure are not that repressed. Saudi Arabia probably wasn't the best example lol   Knew a kid in middle school.   Was fat had a bit of a neckbears because its fucking middle school and he was letting it grow. His name was ali. A bit of a bro. He ltold me his dad is a bit of a nut and he had a hot older sister that had a bit of a booty.     AIDF pls go   Every muslim I've met has been cool to very cool.  Britfag here;  Dated a girl from South Africa for 2-3 years, then got engaged for a year before breaking up. She was Muslim (although she didn't practice the religion much herself).   Her parents loved me, was always going round their house to eat, would talk to them, they took me out for my birthday a few times, even took me and the ex out for a meal on one of out anniversaries.  the only thing they didn't like was we moved in together, but by the time they found out, it was to late.   Nice people.          http://www.islam-watch.org/authors/<wbr>138-jake-neuman/1664-the-real-5-pil<wbr>lars-of-islam.html</wbr></wbr>   I don't know any Muslim IRL but one of my gf's friends gonna marry one after a one year relationship over Skype (yes, they never met and know each other only thru computer).   I've met a dude in my class. He's nice. He goes to the corner to say his prayers, but he's a dedicated student with a good sense of humour.  Met a girl the other day, she's was a giggly sort that couldn't stop laughing once she started.     That goes for everything anyone has any kind of opinion about when discussed on the internet. I said IRL.   Equally, I didn't ask about what the Quran says, I asked about how IRL Muslims seem to interpret it. I'd love to hear your opinion, but expressed in your own words. Thanks.       Not all muslims are violent retards, the current estimate based on the number of muslims world-wide vs those in some form of terror/violent group puts the number of those that want (or are at least willing) to kill you at 20%, so 80% of muslims are fine...  ...that said...  Barring other variables, that a 1 in 5 chance of a muslim you meet wanting you dead. And 20% is a minority, but compared to ANY other religion (0.0001%) the number is insanely high. Islam IS a religion of violence and hate and those 80% are the "mainstream muslims" that say they are but don't really live it much. Much like some of those that say they're christian then admit they never go to church and rarely if ever read their Bible.  The most devout of christians are some of the most kind, caring people in the world (Billy Graham, Mother Teresa, etc...), but the most devout of muslims are people like ISIS, Al-Quaeda, Hezzbolah, etc...          secular muslim is fine, chill. neo-converted one is dangerous, he goes by the book and call us "misbeliever".     So I was at university with a Pakistani muslim, called Shoaib. Started hanging out a bit, I thought he was annoying at first but he grew on me. Also there was a weird chinese kid we would hang out with.  In labs he really knew his stuff so I would partner him. Then I'd 'help' him by checking the English in his lab reports...while cribbing his best work for myself. His English was pretty good too.  I was invited out to Pakistan to visit him (Karachi) but never went, we've kinda lost touch now but he was a cool guy. I've got nothing against muslims (I'm Scottish, have worked in an Indian restaraunt and they were pretty sound as well) as in my experience they are just people. It's so easy to lump any big, slightly different looking group together.       I'm surprised there isn't more moslems here, considering mohummad was a peophile.   moslems are subhuman scum. Never met a moslem I liked. Case closed.   My family is mostly Muslims. Only me and my older brother are secretly atheists. You can't really tell if Muslims as a whole are nice or bad. And just because you interacted with a couple of them and they were nice that doesn't mean all Muslims are nice.  Source: my family is a bunch of fucking assholes.     I live in Canada. I used to work with a Muslim when I worked at BK. Around lunchtime he would spend his break in the breakroom laying a carpet on the ground and praying the way they do in Mecca, like I mean the full Muslim way, and it had to be facing a specific way too, which I found interesting. He'd sometimes do this twice during his shift. Whenever a customer wanted bacon on their sandwich, I had to handle the bacon for him because he would refuse to touch pork products even with gloves on.  Other than that, he was as westernized and blasphemous as the rest of us. The duality of his character was astounding.     gr8 b8 m8   Here in the US, Muslims tend to be functioning members of society. It's mostly Arab and Euro Muslims that are a problem.      Look at persecuted religions throughout history.  Their lands and countries were decided upon by white rulers. every elected government they have tried to elect has either been over thrown or undermined by white countries backing their chosen leader. They have been invaded They are bombed or attacked by drones daily  they are used as a scape goat by western leaders/powers.   Can you blame them for growing up hating whites and the west?            I've been anally fucked by one or two   Not a bait.   http://www.thereligionofpeace.com/P<wbr>ages/Games-Muslims-Play.htm  Educate yourselves  </wbr>   /thread   If Islam is a religion of peace, then why is it the only one that consistently produces religiously-motivated terrorist attacks each and every day of the year?   Why are tens of thousands of people willing and able to cut off an innocent person’s head or fly a plane full of passengers into an office building while screaming praises to Allah?   Where’s the outrage among other Muslims when this happens… and why do they get more worked up over cartoons and hijabs?        But when I sit down and think about Muslims I've met, I realize they've invariably been nice people, always inviting me in for tea and shit     I went to uni with one, he was one of the nicest guys I've met. Smoked, got drunk, ate everything that he was'nt allowed to, fucked some amount of girls at uni and did'nt mention anything about his religion said it was all shit. But he said that his family would go mad if they knew he did any of it     the number of those that want (or are at least willing) to kill you at 20%, so 80% of muslims are fine...    You're just so retarded you went around the whole retardation spectrum and became intelligent again        most devout of Muslims  One of my best friends is about as devout a Muslim as you could ever meet. He does the call to prayer for his mosque, is memorizing the Quran, his while life revolves around his faith. He's the nicest guy I've ever met. But when he talks about extremism, terrorism, etc, I see genuine hatred in his eyes. For him, the overriding passage in the Quran is the fact that you're not supposed to kill, period. The passages which talk about killing noon-believers were spoken by Mohammed with reference to specific groups of non-believers whom they were warring with at the time. These passages have been twisted in modern times, but all educated Muslims know better. It's the uneducated, politically frustrated, impoverished Arabs who perform acts of terrorism with religion as a justification. Terrorism is the weapon of the powerless. Of course the Palestinians would use armies and fighter jets, if they had them. So that begs the question, if Islam didn't exist, wouldn't these people still be politically frustrated/impoverished? Without Islam, wouldn't terrorism still exist?     The worldview promoted by islam is hostile.   Any book, movie, etc. promotes a certain worldview. If you support that worldview then you own responsibiilty for that.   The worldview of islam is the following.   "If you're not a muslim then you're not ok and you must change or get gone"   The worldview of democracy is one of tolerance. "I'm ok and you're ok too even if we dont vote the same"   Obviously there will be trouble no matter what. Democrats will pull islam closer until they explode on them. Islam is a new religion and designed itself to be pulled closer. Islam was designed to be offended by Christians so they can claim to have been attacked and then use violence. The idiot on the street thinks now it's 1-1 so now we can expect peace.  But the offense attack of course was fake because they designed the religion to be offended.               Did you see the press conference about the ruling on tsarnaev? That attorney made a nice point about how the bombing had nothing to do with the Muslim religion. And she made a point of saying that it was NOT an act of terrorism do to religious extremism, but through just selfish violence.   I found that to be rather awe inspiring.       http://www.thereligionofpeace.com/<wbr>Pages/Games-Muslims-Play.htm</wbr>  I can smell the tinfoil without even opening the link     I had what I considered a friend who was a very secular muslim who'd grown up in my country from a very early age and was fluent in the language, had gone to school here, had friends here etc, but had contact with relatives in his home country (Iran) and lots of relatives from there who'd move to my country as adults.   He didn't eat bacon, but he did have a drink occasionally, he slept with girls.   But every time he was drunk enough he'd start talking about fucking Israel, and before I stopped hanging out with him, he casually mentioned that he'd import a wife from "back home" because he didn't want the mother of his children to be "some slut who's had boyfriends and wanted a career". Like it was obvious and no biggie.   You can find all sorts of good or bad stuff about the Quran, but seriously, FUCK middle-eastern culture.          Too many dhimmi's in here, they have been hoodwinked   The only Muslim I ever met I almost served him soup with non halal beef in it. We all ate and he had peanut butter sandwiches.   Nice people, just a fucking weird religion.      "If you're not a muslim then you're not ok and you must change or get gone"  Surat Al-Baqarah [verse 256] - There shall be no compulsion in religion. [I.e. god forbids forcing noon-Muslims to change their religion] Oops, looks like you're wrong.        shitskon detected     And you can taste the moslem dick without sucking it    Don't vote for Hillary then. She was key to the destabilization.    Go away Hallie    thats because your country is poor as fuck m8   kek  I have been to  Morocco   western Sahara   Mauritania   Oman   turkey    Malaysia  I've never been mistreated by anyone there. People have given me food, rides, accommodation, even money, usually in the name of Islamic hospitality. The day I meet a Muslim who offends me to my face is the day I'll change my viewpoint about the religion.          And kill them wherever you overtake them and expel them from wherever they have expelled you, and fitnah is worse than killing. And do not fight them at al-Masjid al- Haram until they fight you there. But if they fight you, then kill them. Such is the recompense of the disbelievers.  http://quran.com/2/191       Please shove Taqiyya up your assholes.      only arabs are muslims  how could people be so dumb and still be able to live? i don't understand it.     Is this you?  I'm so sorry      Fight those who do not believe in Allah or in the Last Day and who do not consider unlawful what Allah and His Messenger have made unlawful and who do not adopt the religion of truth from those who were given the Scripture - [fight] until they give the jizyah willingly while they are humbled.  http://quran.com/9/29     Growing up in toronto i had a muslim kid call me pork. My feelings are still hurt to this day. Death to all muslims   Kek, nice pic with a moslem committing Taqiyya    i had few muslim friends. they were nicest people i have ever met.   last winter i was littlebit scared when my muslim friend got mad when he found out that someone killed few muslims in that parkinlot case in america      Yeah in that passage he's talking about *specific people*. Those words were spoken by Muhammad just prior to the battle of Badr, when the pagan Meccans who had "expelled" the Muslims were fought and defeated by Muhammad's army. Literally -- yes, literally -- every educated Muslim knows this. Whether he wants to extend the meaning to include modern Israelis et al is up to him.  Plus that passage doesn't even mention making people change their religion. The Quran explicitly protects the rights of jews and Christians living in Muslim countries. Will look for that passage in a sec.      http://quran.com/8/12 [Remember] when your Lord inspired to the angels, "I am with you, so strengthen those who have believed. I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieved, so strike [them] upon the necks and strike from them every fingertip."      i had few muslim friends. they were nicest people i have ever met.   Until they become a majority and you will know about it then.     My neighbors are from Egypt and are Muslims, and they're really cool and nice.   In my experience, Muslims are basically like Christians.    i dont hang with them anymore cause i moved. but fuck they were nice, or then they acted nice before killing me   They ruined Lebanon. If you dont believe me look up Lebanon/Beirut pre 1950s...     http://quran.com/8/60 And prepare against them whatever you are able of power and of steeds of war by which you may terrify the enemy of Allah and your enemy and others besides them whom you do not know [but] whom Allah knows. And whatever you spend in the cause of Allah will be fully repaid to you, and you will not be wronged.       yes it is. jelly?     and one of my friends got beaten even tho he never wanted bad for anyone. it sucks ass that racists and nationalists beat and kill wrong guys     Completely normal in every way. Some of them held some strange beliefs (one was utterly convinced that there were skeletons of giants found in Israel) but aside from that they're just like any other person.   They expelled western-imposed capitalism and commercialism? Well I guess Gandhi ruined India.   Dutchfag here so plenty of muslims around. In my life I've only met 3 nice muslims, one guy from Kosovo, a girl from Turkey and a Turkish guy.   Agree  Catholicism was the majority, now it's like 12%-15% of the country.     I've met several really cool muslims. Outright decent people.  Having said that, I believe that all actually peace-loving muslims that hurry to disassociate themselves from the ISIS nuts have to understand that it is THEIR problem. It is them the ones who have to invest resources, risk danger and do what it takes to root the people that bring dishonour to their race and their god. Just shrugging and complaining that they shouldn't be grouped with those fanatics, leaving their eradication to their victims (the Western world) is almost paramount to complicity.    ITT: Dhimwits   Muslims in Europe are basically like Niggers in America. And Muslims in Muslim countries are like Niggers in Africa, a lot different. I as a European can say, that all Niggers I've met have invariably been nice people, inviting me and telling me it's really cool I'm from Europe (which you'll never hear from an American) bla bla bla. tl;dr I could tell you plenty of bad experiences with Muslims here, just like you could tell me about Niggers.    I've been to both Iraq and Afghanistan. Never had a problem with the religion before, still don't.  Although, Iraqi people are dicks, just in general. Self centered, amazingly entitled considering their position at the time. I really disliked most people I met in country because of their attitude.  Afghans were way cool though. I really enjoyed working with and around them. Couldn't trust putting your back to them but mostly they were cool as shit. They'd share smokes or food or whatever. I did the same.  Overall I don't think it's the religion that really makes anything, it's really about the culture that they were raised in.         Well said, and I agree. However between american bombs, general western political manipulation, and extremist groups giving them all a bad name, the peaceful middle easterners caught in violent areas must feel trapped in the middle of a massive clusterfuck. Must be hard for Palestinians as a society to say "we've isolated the source of our problems, and it's Islamic extremism"    this x1000 had this same experience with both the iraqis and afghans.    http://www.mnnonline.org/news/egypt<wbr>ian-police-torture-and-beat-believe<wbr>r-in-attempt-to-force-her-reconvers<wbr>ion  Moslems are nice people, kek  </wbr></wbr></wbr>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=I_T<wbr>o-cV94Bo</wbr>  [ ]  I live next to a muslim family growing up  their daughter was pretty hot and we were good friends but she straight up told me we could never be together as I am an italian-irish catholic and she's a muslim. Her parents were excessively cautious and private      i had a muslim roommate from Iran in college, we got along pretty well, one day we both went to a titty bar since he was curious, that drove him nuts, so he went out to find pussy and fucked this fat chick he met all night for like a week till he could hardly walk, after that he became filled with remorse and started praying five times a day, true story     in the part of germany where i live im surrounded by them. i have a few and had mudslime friends. most of them i view with utter disgust. they dont produce anything productive to the country now. they may helped us rebuild our nation after ww2 but who knows if we would't be where we are now if they didn't helped us... but there is one thing im sure about, these people kill. i also have to work with a lot of them. and sometimes when you go in a conversation i ask them how far they would go for their believes. they often wont answer immidiately but we all know the answer. they would do anything for their shitty religion. i ask them why the would die or kill for it. and they allways tell me that this is the way they where raised and i cant understand this...     Oh good. I'm so glad they're nice. Then it's cool that they're destroying society. Since they're nice.   http://michellemalkin.com/2009/02/1<wbr>4/the-barbaric-muslim-beheading-in-<wbr>buffalo/</wbr></wbr>    Britbong here Work in kitchen of Indian restaurant  2 chefs are Bangladesh and practicing Muslims 1 waiter is Indian and does same Always very nice to me, give me free food and drinks always asking if I'm ok Best thing is working during Ramadan because they tell me to stop working and come break their fast with them        I met this white guy in an interview who I found out was muslim because in the middle of the interview he asked if we could use our prayer/meditation room because he had to go pray.  Spoilers: he didn't get the job.       Muslims can be nice despite Islam.  I know many Muslims, and I'm friends with them. Doesn't mean I can't fundamentally disagree with their bullshit religion.       http://www.theguardian.com/world/20<wbr>10/oct/20/somali-islamists-schoolbo<wbr>y-amputation-ordeal</wbr></wbr>   They're okay but some of them are annoying with how hard they try to push their religious beliefs, it's like having a jehovah's witness as a friend!     Sure, they are nice.  But is their religion?       Those are shia concepts not islamic Shia is a sect Like westbori baptist church     Muslims are fucking cunts, i interact with those shithead sandniggers on a daily basis because of shitty my job and where i live.  Their religion contain the stupidest crap I've ever heard, and their prophet is a pedophile, his first wife was a fucking 9 year old girl.  Basically everyone here who says that they are nice haven't actually met a fully religious muslim.       Do you not realize the inanity of this comment?   If they push their beliefs, they're breaking Islamic law. Tell them and maybe they'll shut up.       ITT: can we discuss Niggers we've actually met IRL? Living in a white privileged society viewing the African American world through Fox News portrayal it'd be easy to view Niggers with disgust. But when I sit down and think about Niggers I've met, I realize they've invariably been nice people, always inviting me in for malt liquor and shit, telling me it's really cool that I'm white (which you'll never hear from a Nigger). I'm interested in hearing about other people's interactions with our homies. If you've never met a Nigger, pls stay out of conversation.       telling me it's really cool that I'm from America (which you'll never hear from a European).   So in other words you want someone who would butt kiss you. Anyone who comes from poor countries will think the western countries are the best. Thats why we don't give a fuck about muricans because we already come from the west. Also us Europeans have access to alot of information and your self glorifying propaganda gets really tiring. Anyone form the 3rd world country won't hear you say "Duhh we saved you asses in WWII, withut us you'd be speaking german!"  Now go sit on a corner and eat a burger muricunt.             B8.  Anyway, my family is muslim but my dad and I are atheists. Just like any other christian family we have a religious book somewhere in our bookshelf but nobody ever reads it.  I live in France and we dress just like other people. We hate the current generation of muslim wearing their clothes from another era, they make arabics in general look bad, even those who accepted occidental lifestyle and just want to live in peace.  People can't tell i'm arabic at first sight, as i'm white and i have green eyes. I'm a pretty cool guy, always nice to people, i have very close friends, arabics and white, i play video games and eat ham. Everybody in my family is a hard worker, many of us have important diplomas and jobs and have a succesful life thanks to the occidental lifestyle. I'm thankful to my ancestors for bringing us in France, i love this country.  Only bad thing is sometimes i meet people taking advantage of my origins to make fun of me or make me look like i'm some kind of extremist deep shit or that i have another culture and that it's bad or idk.  For example my ex girlfriend's friends told everyone in college i was a radical muslim because i once acted jealous because she wore something that showed her stomach when she went to run. Thing is she spent her time making me jealous, flirted with guys, told me stories about being flirted with etc, all the time. When it happened i was being jealous all the time, so i overreacted. Usually i wouldn't even care. They didn't consider me as just jealous, but as a muslim who has another culture.....  I hate burqa, religous signs, and arabics who claim they have the right to wear this or do that when we live in a country where we have to adpat and not the other way around.. Basically, i think i'm 100% occidental in my lifestyle as i was born and raised here.              People pick and chose which parts of the Qur'an they wish to practice, just as Christians do with the bible. The difference is that there are a lot more Muslims taking the Qur'an as the literal word of God than Christians    no, he said he's sorry, you repressed faggot     That's exactly the problem.    You can be against Islam, but not against Muslims.  You can be anti-Islam but not racist.      YFW murica is the same thing as Islam    Murica the greatest, Murican the freest Murica the best.   Islam the true religion of peace, Allah the great, Islam the best.   Different cultures, same brainwashed mentalities. You worship celebrities, they worship a god.          Nice bullshit, I see you practice taqiyya.    Well the difference is the Quran is actually supposed to be the literal words spoken by god. When it comes to Christians, it varies sect by sect whether they take the bible literally. Usually it's the fanatical southern US churches which are the worst offenders; Catholicism gave up taking the bible literally long ago. We can be thankful, then, that the Quran limits human-lead violence to defense of the religion. It forbids spreading Islam by force.    A lot of Muslim exchange students showed up at my college. They travel in large groups, shout Arabic to each other at long distances, blast Arab music in the library upstairs while they pray (can be heard outside), they put minimal effort into classes and treat the maintenance and staff poorly. Also I wore a "we want beer" shirt with American flags all over it and got stared down by like 5 of them.  I live in Manchester and there are more Muslims than white propel at my school, every one of them said if Allah told them in a dream to stab me then they would without a doubt, 25% of them hate white people and they gang up on white younger girls and shit, I hate them  Hey faggots explain how hating on islam is racist?   manchester anon here  Which school? I go to a school with muslim majority and they are all really nice and liberal, we play Muslims Vs Non muslims at football     irishfag here, i know a pakistani muslim, drinks, gambles and does drugs with us now. very nice guy.    the only muslim ive known (about 20 "people") have all been hyperviolent retards that cant converse for shit and loads of em drew knives on me the first week of me knowing em for shit knows what reason and tried to "assert dominance" like the animals they are...  TL:DR mudslime/sandniggers are violent subhumans       This right here  Once moslems become a majority they show their true nature.      Just because you're a gay who gives free blowjobs to muslims during lunch period doesn't mean they are nice, it means they tolerate you for your services.    Bullshit  Go post your disinfo elsewhere      This here is completely true:  Every muslim I knew in my age (actually hung out with some for a short time here in germany) had a serious anger management problem. When someone looked at them the wrong way or said something false they totally went batshit. One of them went to jail for attempted murder some years later. All just for their "honor". Actually nearly everything was about honor or coolness/"fucking bitches". They stole in shops (mostly alcoholics and cigs), didn't behave like "muslims" more like gangstas. But when ramadan came they all got scared of going to hell and didn't eat and drink all day. They were mostly unfriendly to people they didn't know. But they were friendly to their own kind and what they considered friends. Also they were really friendly to customers (one worked at a Dönershop, another one sold mobile phones).  All in all they were really ambivalent: Wannabe hard gangstas who drunk, smoked and whored around &lt;-&gt; want to be honored, fear of "allah", blind fate, attacking people for nothing  most women i knew fell in one of these categories: -Absolutely loved islam but afraid that they whore around -&gt; niqab, but still really vulgarly -Absolutely hated their strict culture and wanted to get away from other turks  All I kept from these times is that the young ones can be dangerous especially in groups and that they take their religion really seriously while not following it's orders. I don't really like them.                     Have one muslim friend that was born and raised in the UK. Pretty cool guy even cracked a few steryotype jokes.    playing game with muslim friend   was a shooter with planes   he starts shouting "crash into the building"    realizes mistake   says "oh my daise you can tell I'm muslim"         I've had multiple Muslim friends and haven't had any negative experiences. Albeit these were 1st generation American Muslims so they didn't adhere to the Islamic doctrine like you would see in the Middle East.   Lived in Van (Turkey) for a while, and confirm that. btw I am European not American    http://www.jihadwatch.org/2013/10/m<wbr>uslim-cleric-says-kenya-mall-jihad-<wbr>murder-attack-right-thing-to-do</wbr></wbr>   Interesting, thanks.   I know a few practicing and in name only muslims. I met them at college and I gotta say they are some of the nicest people I know. I mean I don't really know what else to say. Nice people with really good food and they like to chill and smoke hella huka and go to bars. I mean, I dunno what's not to like.  In fact, Islam is more than a religion. It is a rigid political and cultural system with a mandate to conquer and govern the lives of others via necessary force "until religion is only for Allah." Violence is sanctioned by the Quran, a book which not once tells Muslims to love those outside the faith.  The problem with most muslims are not the ones who come here looking for job, it's their kids who watch murican based TV and want to be black gangsters so they prey on whites using nigger slavery and their religion as an excuse to act violently and anti socially.  This isn't exclusive to mudslimes, asians from poor families do the same thing. Why minorities dress like gangster niggers ?    Islam breeds arrogance and self-absorption, which accounts for the collective petulance and perpetual grievance characterizing Muslim populations in general - along with the astonishing unwillingness to extend equal moral consideration to those outside the religion.     Forgot to mention that "normal" turks normally complain about the turks in germany, because only the "scum" is said to come here. Also first generation are mostly normal guys, but second and thrid generation are mostly complete assholes. It's funny that many turks say that themselves.  And one more thing: Every turk I knew hated jews and homosexuals and many of them said they would exterminate them without a thought if they could.          This disregard for others is rooted in the supremacist ideology of the Quran and Islamic law, which unashamedly draws the sharpest distinction between those within the group of believers and those without - towards whom arbitrary denigration is cast and hatred, harsh treatment and eternal punishment is prescribed   read that<br/>   Sister had a Muslim friend. She was generally really nice and cracked many jokes but secretly had a very strict muslim father that would hurt her and had a muslim extremist ex bf that said my sister was a bad influence to her because she wore shorts. he even tried to call her one time.     Keep it that way, we patriots from western Europe need a place to flee    I read that verse of lies, there is much disinfo going on in here.  read this   Explain why islam is scared of having separate governance?        These are the hairy tits of a really cute Arab girl I like to fuck.   Lel   As a consequence, not a day goes by without someone, somewhere in the world being horribly murdered by devout Muslims in the name of this religion - over ten thousand persons each year. More innocent lives were snuffed out in just two hours by devout Muslims on 9/11 than by the Ku Klux Klan in its entire 145-year history   No it's not a sect, you're all the same savages, sunni or shia. You're even worse then shia.   All muslims are taught to lie to non-mudslimes get what they want.  Fuck sand niggers.     Live in London. Most of them are great guys. Love to party and fuck. Only a couple fast for ramadan to satisfy their more conservative fathers.  Most eat pork and drink, and love weed.   They all consider Islamists and radicals as the 'bronies' and 'fedoras' of Muslims.        I once worked for a Jordanian man who came here with his family. He owns a Mobil station in town. He goes and prays 5 times a day in his office and all that jazz, and he's as nice of a fellow as you'd ever meet. He speaks better english than I do, and his loyalty to family and friends is worthy of admiration. He's a better man than almost every American I've ever met.   Where Islam dominates, there is systematic discrimination and oppression of those of other faiths. Where Muslims are a minority, there is peevish self-interest, disloyalty and eventual rebellion and terror when demands for special privilege and entitlements are not met - all part of the eternal jihad to bring about the rule of Islam as Muhammad instructed   Tasty disinfo   Can one name a single country in the West in which the significant influx of Muslims has not been accompanied by severe social strain? Can one name any country affected in the same way by Hindu immigration?   Islam isnt a fucking race. You can hate islam and muslims all you want, thats not racist because ANY race can be muslim. Religions arent races.  If I say fuck muslims, thats not racist. If I say fuck arabs/sand niggers/dune coons/pakis/nips/gooks/niggers/whit<wbr>es, thats racist.</wbr>        I hope this story is real soo bad; very nice to read.    We've niggers though.    Hate is hate. No need for technicalities.   York university (canada) had a string of rapes the last few years. 80% were by sand nigs and nigs.    Where in the south? is it near al suwayda    Then you call it hate speech, not racism.  If i saw women are inferior to men, is that racism? No thats sexism.  If i say all faggots carry aids, is that racism? No thats homophobia.  If I say Japs are superior to niggers, is that racism? Yes.  Get your shit straight. It is important because if you ever go to trail for this shit racism and hate speech carry different penalties.             Went to school with one. Guy called Tahir, from Kashmir. Met him at a club later on in life, saw him slamming shots. Asked him about and he said "yeah, I'm a terrible muslim."     Mudslimes   Just another day.     There were 2 sandniggers at my highschool who were annoying misandrist pieces of waste. They were in charge of the school newspaper and used every opportunity to rip on white men. I had several converstations with her in debate class, none of them pleasant.    Lol    Rabble.  Rabble.  Rabble.  Rabble.  Rabble.            Yeah, people who believe in a higher power a hard to fucking deal with     Sand niggers   I find this racist language offensive. Call them Dune Coons you racist asshole.     Those willing to open their minds will find that, regardless of the excuse-du-jour, the remarkably wide-spread level of narcissism, repression and violence is deeply ingrained in the teachings, double standards and early history of the Islamic religion. While there is not a single verse in the Quran that commands love for those outside Islam, there are nearly 500 that either promote violence or allude to Allah's hatred for unbelievers - in a book that is largely about how to think of and deal harshly with those outside the "true" faith.    I lold.     That sounds like a lot of self righteous people. Also sounds like about 80% of /pol/.     I am an uneducated piece of shit     you're trolling right    I was friends with a muslim who used to say "I'm not white, I'm not black, so I get to choose. I choose black."  essentially wiggers in a nutshell       Trevor Noah said mixed race is a one way street. You can choose black, you can't be white. We focus on the problem.     Clearly. Fuck this board is stupid.     I have a small pecker. :(((      pagan Meccans  read as  Pagin Mexicans       I've met plenty of Muslims, though only a few that weren't born in America.  I've never really had a problem with any of them, especially nothing based on their religion. Any issues were based on deep personality flaws that they would have held regardless of their faith (a belief I base on other shithead qualities that can be found in many other people).  I think the most positive experience was in college. I joined a program that paired native English speakers with non-native speakers who wanted to improve their language abilities in some way. Most people got Chinese or Korean students who had awful pronunciation or just poor grammar, my assignment was a 36 y/o Jordanian Muslim PhD student. Great guy, had a family with two little girls who were born in the states. He spoke fluent English because his father was an English teacher, maybe at the university level. He just wanted to hold English conversations because his field was engineering and he was teaching his daughters Arabic at home, so he was rarely speaking English and felt his accent was worsening.  Unfortunately, he received his PhD but couldn't find an employer in time that would support his visa and he had to return to Jordan briefly. Last I saw on LinkIn, he managed to find something in Texas. I was really happy for him. His family is probably loaded enough so that he had no debts from his extended education, but he was a really hard working guy who lived for his family and put in untold hours to better his life.           like westbori   cept they represent more than half all muslims   so really more like the catholic church        I hate Fascism.  Is that bad, too? after all 'hate is hate'.       Good friends with a muslim for a while, joke about it from time to time and call each other racist shit for bants. Ask him if he would kill me if his religion called for it.  "If my Imam said I had to kill you I would do it in a heartbeat"   Same shit from a muslim girl a few years later who by all accounts I had more in common with than other regular white folk. The level of indoctrination is fucking terrifying and unfortunately my liberal eyes have been opened to the truth.         So?  Of course there are nice Muslims. It's their religion which is the problem.  There were nice people who fought for and beleived in Germany during WW2. Does that mean Fascism wasnt bad? No.          lol &gt;^_^&lt; ya! every1 just be judging them 2 hard!   Vast majority of religious are people Id avoid regardless of how nice they seem, likewise atheists. I'll never say though lel   Oh what the hell moar?    The only Muslims ive met were african, so cool people. Never personally known a legit towelhead.    You really don't sound like it. You sound hateful :( which would lead me to believe you favor right-wing..     can we discuss Muslims we've actually met  I've met a few. I live in australia.  None of them wore a burqa it was just a hijab or headscarf. They never talked about Islam. I talked with them about movies and books and games and stuff and they were normal. I used to go to a kebab place and the lebanese guys became really friendly over the years and honestly I've not got any problem with them. There are a few mosques around the city but nothing like the hundreds of churches. I don't think ISIS is acceptable and I hope they get dealt with, but the moderate muslims are no threat and cop a whole world of shit by association. Imagine if all christians were thrown in with the westboro baptist crazies who protest at funerals with the god hates fags signs. Not all christians are that bad. Most muslims living in the first world are really happy and value the freedom, they have no problem with people of other religions.  Islamophobia is real, it's only really valid when discussing radical violent muslims, like ISIS.  This is the exact same discussion from a few months back about Jews and Zionists. Jews are fine and normal people, apart from the genital mutilation, but Zionists are fucking mental and violent colonists. It's about knowing which is which and not hating all of any group.             You're providing the same anecdotal evidence you're accusing me of.  The thread asked for experiences, and I gave mine. I've never had a problem with a Muslim because of their religion. And since it asked for experiences with Muslims, I gave one.   If you can get the words past the cock bruising the back of you throat, feel free to give your own experiences         Not that guy, but islam and facism share many characteristics. So how can you say he is wrong if he hates both?     Beirut in Lebanon is insanely modern and western. They even have clubs and women expressing that they should be able to enjoy sex. And even a fucking kfc I just saw that new episode of Anthony bourdain on CN...   I know lots of Muslims. Dated a couple. Almost proposed to one. One of my closest friends was Muslims. They're all over the schools and universities I've been to.   Most of them are just chill people who want to make their sandwiches and shit like anyone else      I've mainly met nice muslims too. But it doesn't mean shit. Being a nice person, I'm more likely to meet nice people too, probly like you OP, even though you're a faggot.     Rabble.    elaborate     Only... they don't shit like anyone else. Do they.     I played ultimate frisbee in college and we had a student club to try and engage the student body. The most friendly and supportive club to ours was the Muslim students association. They would come to our games, support our fundraisers, and were some of the coolest people I've ever met.    :) Rabble....Rabble.    rabble rabble      here are some muslims http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/art<wbr>icle-3140454/Tourists-run-lives-Tun<wbr>isian-beach-gunman-carries-attack-o<wbr>utside-hotel-packed-Britons.html /thread </wbr></wbr></wbr>   Moslems are great m8        Funny how non-muslims know more about the quran, hadith, and the islamic sciences than muslims.         Those are JEWS you retarded kike     was Muslims   My brain is fucked today        Rabbit rabbit    gr8 b8 m8    Fucking jews      Of course some Muslims are fine people, there's 1.6 billion in the world. The ones who socialize with westerners are generally going to be the ones who are not radical.  That doesn't change the fact that the 1% minority in the U.S. and 8% minority in Europe pose the greatest sustained terrorist threat, and the greatest threat at using democracy to undermine our secular, liberal values.     Met a Muslim grill who was born in the states but family originally from Iran but she lived in Iran for some part of her life. Had her affairs in order. Smart, friendly, nice, but really shy. Gotta say she was fucking gorgeous. Had a bit bushy eyebrows with dark dark brown eyes. Every part of her body was covered except her hands and her face. She was covered with regular clothing and a hijab or a scarf. We were in the same study group so we'd constantly meet. 5'3 ish and petite as fuck. Probably weighted around 95 pounds. Had a private study room with another grill. Muslim girl goes up to white board to write something and her long shirt lifts up showing her stomach, abso-fucking-lutely flat stomach. She was also wearing some slacks and wasn't wearing a coat this time and could see the shape of her ass. Unfortunately I spilled my spaghetti and fucked it all up. I would had married that Iranian grill and start believing in Mohammed and Allah for that grill.   Funny how they are correct    I have some friends who are Muslim.  half Korean   half Turkish   Muslim   Ramadan every year since they were 12 years old.  Sydney Australia. Of course there are lebo tough cunts etc, but to be honest even the bad ones aren't any worse than redneck yobbos. As long as they're 2nd-generation ie born and raised in Sydney.   I reckon Islam isn't so much the problem as much as the place that it comes from, ie war-torn, jewfucked middle east.           No, I'm pretty sure the death cult that gives the death penalty for leaving is the problem.   im from a muslim family and let me tell you secretly they are really reacist   But, most of our families are, secretly. ;) Just know that. We're not so different, you &amp; I.     I don't care what it leads you to believe.  Hate is a natural human reaction. It can be bad, it can be good.  Hate for nasty or violent acts ideologies is a good thing.  What kind of person would I be if I didn't hate things like murder, rape and torture and the ideologies that espouse them?          I prefer.... Extreme dislike.    B8   i'm a muslim myself and i live in a muslim country.  it is true that the most liberal muslims are still pretty conservative.  and of course islam isnt terrorism, but some people do have questionnable morals or views, and are pretty intolerant.  For example, homosexuality is taboo and can't even be discussed on television or on public. sexuality in general is rejected.  i can answer questions (sorry for bad english)            chill western protestantism Christianity is not the same as islam. people that actuallu are muslim have rules that control them trough every day. there is no such thing as moderate Muslims. they are all bad the same reason all orthodox catholic people jews. Mormons. is bad. they are too fused into their dogma. and don't use rationality and is often in alliance with their own religion than people from outside aka racist. i had friends from middle east. but all of them were atheist and was partying and drinking alcohol like normal people    My favorite band is Allah and the Snackbars    Same thing.      it means you are talking to a 13 year old idk why you want to     What country do you live in m8?    Difference is, one can lead to feelings of disgust &amp; the other can lead to violence.     (sorry for bad english)   hasn't made any grammatical errors       I am that guy, and thank you.      sandwiches? with ham, troll bait post     England    Rabble. :(   Yeah I had a Muslim friend in high school and she was one of the sweetest people there. Made friends with everyone and stood up for those getting bullied and what not.   top kek    I prefer The Taliband. you should have a listen some time.     No, that's a definition you just made up.  Hate and extreme dislike are for all intents and purposes the same thing.  What distinguishes whether you turn to violence or not another decision.  I hate Islam, but I'd never go out and commit violence because of that, other than in strict self defence, because the very reason I hate Islam is because I hate violence.           Algeria, in north africa.   well it's my third language so i'm not really fluent in english :p       The only Muslims I've met that weren't stupid or crazy weren't actually practicing Muslims.     The 9/11's are bretty good too     Hate + hate = good.     This.  And the only rational Muslims I've met are the ones who have chosen to ignore most of their holy book.        But when I sit down and think about Muslims I've met, I realize they've invariably been nice people, always inviting me in for tea and shit,   Selection bias. The ones who hate infidels and Americans, and there are many many many, don't invite you in for tea.   Duh. And those people are Muslim the way Barack Obama is a Christian. In name only. Serious Muslims (that is, the ones who take their religion seriously) hate you, because their religion says to.        They just copy Red Hot Chili Falafel     You can post meaningless sound-bites all you like, but if you don't hate violence, murder and torture, and ideologies that promote it, you're either not a very nice person or extremely misguided.      "they" who the fuck are you reffering to exactly you retarded fuck?    Most muslims are cool, but for some wierd reason the boys are total dicks from the age of 13-19. Violent and stupid. But after turning 19 they are very cool.   How is it selection bias when it's the only ones he's met &amp; at that, at random..    Yup, the less Muslim someone is, the less averse they are to western values and people. On balance.     death cult  Illogical, kneejerk beliefs with no facts to back up your stance.  Congrats little boy, you have become that which you hate and are as much of an extremist as them.       They're not meaningless, if you actually think about them.   Athiest who converted from Islam here. The worst thing about Islam is the shitty eastern culture that comes with most muslims. They believe that everyone who isn't muslim are all out to get them. They believe that arranged marriage is the only way to get married. They believe that women are worse than men and treat them like shit.   Have you read about Mohammed's life? Are you unaware that Muslim men are supposed to emulate that as much as possible?  And yes, if you join a group or are born into a group, and they threaten to kill you if you leave, that is a death cult.     Quran (8:55) - Surely the vilest of animals in Allah's sight are those who disbelieve   Quran (48:29) - Muhammad is the messenger of Allah. And those with him are hard (ruthless) against the disbelievers and merciful among themselves   Quran (9:30) - And the Jews say: Ezra is the son of Allah, and the Christians say: The Messiah is the son of Allah... Allah (Himself) fights against them. How perverse are they!   Quran (8:12) - I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them   Quran (9:123) - O you who believe! Fight those of the unbelievers who are near to you and let them find in you hardness   Quran (5:33) - The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His messenger and strive to make mischief in the land is only this, that they should be murdered or crucified or their hands and their feet should be cut off on opposite sides or they should be imprisoned; this shall be as a disgrace for them in this world, and in the hereafter they shall have a grievous chastisement              What about these facts?    Seems like a death cult to me.         austriafag here. i've met quite a few muslims in my life. were i life they're about as frequent as niggers in america (at least i think so). most of them are pretty chill, but some of them can be irrational violent assholes. but guess what: so are wannabe nazis. i've prolly met just about as much muslim assholes as nazi assholes.         I've met a fiew, and most of the boys, think they are so fucking cool. But the girls on the other side, i have no problem with. They are very nice people. They just care too much about food.    also muslim woman are very flirti, I have been working with some muslim woman and they love to flirt and being very direct.    That's why moslems are always dirty pedos     I realize they've invariably been nice people, always inviting me in for tea    This probably describes every muslim who has committed an act of terrorism. It's not logical, its doesn't make sense, they have been brain washed by a particular brand of Islam to do this shit. They're all nice people before they do it.       Seems like samefag..  Just as most Christians don't follow or believe strictly &amp; literally what's in the bible, I assume most Muslims don't either.        Would I want to live in a society dominated by Islam? Over my dead body.   That can be arranged.      The west, especially Europe, has become notoriously nominal in their Christianity. In fact Europe looks down on the U.S. for not being as nominal as they are.     Muslims   In Australia   Surely Australia is the last bastion of un-cucked western civilisation?        BBC   Bong detected     Every Muslim I've made friends with have been very nice people as well as their families.  Though one of my mates has extended family in Pakistan that her family that gives them endless trouble.     Pretty much, they're the only western country that desires not to have millions of illegal immigrants.    Well.. that is interesting. I would think it was the other way around.   had a college english comp class where i met a guy from syria. he was the biggest asshole to everyone and so disrespectful to the professor.      I am a teacher at one of the international schools in my country. (Pay is a lot better than in public schools, which is the only reason I stay there, for now.)  I have muslim children for several nations. And despite different languages and countries, their behaviour is very similar.   Boys have little to no impulse control. If they want something, they take (steal) it. If they are angry, or feel insulted, they immidiately resort to violence. And they keep to those with their own faith, and seek conflict with any others. Including teachers. Especially female ones.   Girls are quiet, timid and nonresponsive. They simply excist in class. As with the boys, they pay no attention in class. And instead of violence, they are simply quiet. They do not listen, they do no work, they even deliver tests blank. They are simply there because they have to. (by law).   In essence. They are already "trained" to live on welfare. That's their only view on the future. To leech on the society they live in, and bring violence onto those they "feel" are doing them wrong. (anyone).  Fuck Muslims. Fuck Islam.                your country is so shit not even niggers want to live there    being proud of that shit hole  pro tip Tomasz, Polish people are just white niggers.      nope. there is heaps of immigrants here. In fact australia is founded on immigration.   Got spat on by a muslim girl, at a young age doe      the ones around here are actually Sikhs. Heh.     I know there are immigrants, but they actually turn boats of illegals around, which makes them unique in the west.   No loli bread? Lets remedy that    Damn OP no ones posting.    why dont you take a cure right over there      SJW      i dont wanna self bump and get the thread erased   Are people going to upload pictures of lolis in this thread?   Moar      Fuck...I´m gonna miss Etotama.        Pretty decent CGI    good thing i havent watched it yet, that way i dont miss it        What's that from?      reminds me of schooldays somehow     enough etotama, at this rate you are gonna spoil all the series  5qwhbg6pdq7v Oh yeah fill it    what am i supposed to do with this?      eat up                        I know. It shouldn't have been any good but it somehow worked. A lot of fun to watch.    This is what happens when you nuke people only a little bit.    it is     Rugrats are American   boys are not circumcized   0/10        Sauce?     actually, they're french    got quads.... better post something then...      DESDES &lt;3   She's about to masturbate. get in now.  http://reallifecam.com/en/view/03_1<wbr></wbr>    shes just rubbing herself  i play with my dick like this when watching tv, never fap though      Love that dog. Rapes that pillow and doesnt afraid of anything.    Based dog fucking that pillow up     Kek   switched to camera 4 to watch dog fuck the pillow up   She's not very entertaining to watch masturbate   She lives in a house that people from the 60s/70s thought we'd be living in 10 years ago  anyone unlock camera 2?   shes going to do itttt   what is this even about? any backstory? do these people even know they are being broadcasted and still don't give a fuck to rub one out while live? just wondering about the whole thing  wait wtf is this? does she know shes being watched?   no some freaky russians broke into like 10 people's appartments and installed up to 10 cameras without them knowing.     Yea the people on this website agreed to be on cam 24/7 for money    Remember watching this shit like 2-3 years ago and there was a script to get all the cameras unlocked anyone still have it or another way around it?  there is already a video of her on Pornhub, "reallifecam" search   I miss isabela and marcelo   I'm sure that laptop we can't see shows details of show is watching, how many etc.   she'll never get naked or take it very far on a free camera. soon she'll get up and move to a pay-only camera    still fun to watch the lead up to it, just don't get your hopes up   Whet the fuck is she watching?  my guess is that the website this is hosted on put cams in here house and told her act slutty at home, they pay her depending on how many views she gets. More views more £   fuck, maya and stephan are STILL on this fucking site?      act slutty at home    girl is by herself watching tv touching her breast    slutty  Jesus fuck I'm losing faith in my generation.  She doesn't even have to do anything for your attention you desperate neckbeard.         Well, she's on camera to the world and getting paid for it.. so that kinda counts    those feet  MY DIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICK   Its gonna happen i feel it !

I have fixed the counting software so all of the dubs/trips/quads rules should apply as shown.   SOMEONE PLEASE DON'T LET THE NIGGERS WIN ANOTHER GOD DAMN CROWN.     Free men will never die  Freeeeee men  rolllllllllin'  You have 10 seconds to name a better video game than this.  protip: you literally can't.     I really can't    FF6 is better you imbecile.   tetris is more fun than that crap  LEAGUE OF LEGENDS HUEHEUHUEE     Sing us a song your the samefag man      Timesplitters:Future Perfect   Abes odesey hands down beats this garbage   Metal Gear Solid    COD4    the server is a bitch lately!   This game says otherwise    FF7 best FF   Following the herd I see      Such an overrated game you fucking plebian    Snake eater     FF6   "Hurdd durdd pixel art is reel cool guise"  mfw     Psh fucking easy gg m8   call of duty 2      Xenogears could've been better though.   Post yfw the remake will be and action rpg without a world map.   FF7. The game so lame the antagonist just wants to get his mom and hang in space.   The game is the most popular one, got movies and a remake and add ons, there is no herd just people that accept the fact     Final Fantasy IX, Kotor      literally ignoring:  the best cast of characters ever   the best villain ever conceived   the best soundtrack ever composed   the deepest and most emotional story ever written          FF12  /thread        hum best cast villain soundtrack deepest emotional story ever written you must mean 7 not 6 read what you post next time fagot   Minecraft   Kh series.  Thread over       a shitty pay-to-win fuckfest with by far the most toxic gaming community ever   best video game ever  kid plz      Literally any other game FF is a shit series          LEGEND OF ZELDA    where you fight the nigger instead of siding with it       The toxic part is true as fuck but how is it pay to win? I unlocked every champion without paying a cent.      TES III Morrowind FFVII is a close second though       the problem is you have the option to pay at all.    Lel, he murdered him with his cock         cards     maybe if you are a weaboo teen with low IQ    I actually enjoyed this game when I was younger.     ET for the atari.   People who talk shit about something they know nothing about are fucking retarded. LoL is a shit game but it's nowhere near being a fucking p2w game you retarded piece of trash     FF6 could have been great, but they were forced to cut a lot of content due to the size constraints of the cartridge format. As a result, character development was shallow and the script remained in its infancy. If they remade the game and devoted more time to dialogue and development, it could easily outclass VII, but until then, VII, with all its flaws and goofy aesthetic, remains superior, if simply for the fact that each character was given the time they deserved--with the exception of maybe Vincent, which was (unfortunately) made up for in Dirge of Cerberus.     Why the fuck you fuck would you play Emo Fantasy???? There are waaaaay better game like The Last Of Us    VtM:B    This 100        Best games here        If only it wasn't for the last disc of this game, I would agree.  Although, from my view, Star Ocean Second Story wins.       SUPER MARIO RPG      Well, yeah. Everything COULD be better. The second disc was shafted due to the huge investment Square made in FFVII.     It's not better, but goddamn is it a close second.   Final Fantasy 7 had a lot of factors going into WHY it was the best:  *Next gen gfx (at the time) *Flagship title for the PS1 *Impressive music &amp; art *Acceptable script (albeit, certain parts were... weird -- but that's what made it unique) *Huge, explorable world, in 3D *Tons of little sidequests *Memorable characters  Now, not saying there weren't overlapping factors w/ FF6, just saying that FF7 had all that FF6 offered and a little bit more.                Shit was cash wasn't it? I'm planning in picking up a rom for it so I can emulate     The heck are you talking about? SOSS's second act was even more abysmal. At least Xenogears had a fleshed out story to tell, no matter how rushed it was in telling it. SOSS was just "Here are some bad guys that are now the super villains. Also there's an alien goat guy. Oh, you beat the villains while I mentioned that. Hooray you win!"     Final Fantasy 4, Final Fantasy 11 Pokemon Emerald Touhou 10 Alice: Madness Returns Halo Reach Marvel Vs Capcom 3 Super Mario Bros 3 Megaman 2 Shemue Guitar Hero 3 Devil May Cry No More Heroes Catherine Yume Miru Kusuri Yume Nikki Bloodborne Dragon Age Origins Drakengard Asura´s Wrath Street Fighter 2 Turbo                          best villain ever conceived  Really? You need to read more.    Age of Empires.   No kidding, is the best franchise out there by far. Mario is the only one that comes close     Maybe you're too young to remember when it came out. FFVII is overrated now because of nostalgia, but in 1998 it was a phenomenal game.  Super Mario World is just another platformer now, but in 1992 it was fucking amazing. I played that game for hundreds of hours and discovered all of its secrets.  Legend of Zelda (original) sucks now, but in 1987 it was fucking amazing: it was the first NES game that let you save your games and progress through the story over time. It had an alternate world, unlockable only by secret code or by beating it the first time. It had secret passages and hidden items. Par for the course in the 21st century, but incredible in the 1980s.         All of them are trash, only ones worth playing is yume nikki, bloodborne and pokemon    all those shit games lol    Reach but no halo3?! The custom games.... How can you forget about those    Kekkerdekek Also no gay random Encounters   What did you say?   FF9    beat me    Like every other free to play game?    leisure suit larry   Which one is more overrated by 12 year olds? Splatoon or FF7?   Hence the 2015 Remake.   Ctrl+f chrono trigger  Really? nobody's posted the hands down greatest rpg of all time.      We all played Crash Bandicoot, but I'm sure we liked it because everyone liked it, and now we look through nostalgia glasses.  But I tried it recently. The gameplay is immensely shit.      mother 3 best rpg     flagship  This isn't even an argument for why the game is better, what?   3D  The original Doom was more 3D than FF7. The game environment was seriously just a bunch of layered images.       Ff7, oh wait, something better? impossible question.   Go to bed, grandpa.    If it takes graphics to be one of the best, it isn't one of the best.   Also, who the fuck cares if it's it on the ps1?       1997 +18   Not realizing Jenova and Sephiroth are the same being.   It's like a god and jesus thing       Just about every other Final Fantasy in the franchise   <br/>   and the fact that they didnt expect good sales.    The game where I am pretty much 'god.'    everything you said is true    Yea. How dare they make money. They should develop a game, support it, and make it completely free. Solid business plan. Think of it as a pay game that they give you the option to play for free, because that's what it is. you fucking nigger.     Literally anything else you fucking weeaboo.    Vaan is gay    bad rats     dota 2     u wot m8 ?    Oh you mean shitshaft? Quit playing that after my hs computer lab days were over. Even runes cape is better than that piece of crap     this    OP easy WOW and LOL you cant say other wise    What's it like blowing dudes on a long board with a vape in your ass    Those abs though    This and FF7 always held a tie for first for me in the FF series.    Most annoying voice in the entire series    Summer fag fuck off you werent even alive when this game was out nigga    Runescape? Nah. At least on Minecraft, I don't have to stand and watch my character chop a tree for hours on end, or make fires so I can do a quest.   Playing FF7 for the first time right now. Got pretty far but realize I fucked up Tifa being my bae so I just restarted.  Hey look a thread full of fat faggots argueing about beta games, you guys should get out more and get laid  Just gonna leave this right here for a sec.   Playing all of them I would say Wow is the top, panda and what ever the new expansion is is shit cata was shit too    Sex gets pretty boring after you've had it enough. It then boils down to  buy condoms and have sex with a possible STD-ridden whore who might accuse you of rape later  or  play vidya   I think I'll take my chances with vidya.         https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=H47<wbr>ow4_Cmk0</wbr>  [ ]   Battletoads you autistic fuck   This game was complete trash and the battle system was shit too    Top kek, U WAT M8?!!!!! I know you are only dissing me because you feel shitty about yourself and this is the only way to blow off steam with getting your head knocked off :D I'm not mad at you Anon because I know you will get knocked out M8. I hope your life gets better :)     dota 2     With the same woman maybe change it up, there is a new condom out that turns green if the woman has a std    pandaria was fucking great I've been playing since bc and while panda is my second least favorite expansion it was still epic in terms of play and story. Quit after, haven't played WOD     Metal Gear Solid 3 Legend of Zelda: A Link To The Past Done. Twice.      Sure is summer here    these are the same kind of delusions that fat ugly feminists tell themselves    I have friends that played panda and liked it, i still hit up vanilla and bc on privates though   Chrono Trigger   Think it was already mentioned you filthy cuck     FF VII brings back great memories of college...  pic is my fave though       Meh. I just replayed it last year and still enjoyed it.    I've had nothing *but* prostitutes...about 30 of them, between 2011 and now. I've learned that sex itself is over-hyped, and mostly a physical thing that can be avoided. Yes, I know of the whole, "it's psychological/intimacy" thing, but we have to know that "love" and such are just illusions; chemical reactions in the brain that doesn't have any intrinsic value outside of context.  tl'dr, I'll stick with vidya. Women and sex come dead last on my list of things to care about.      Nice trips faggot, vanilla is fun but BC improved vanilla x10 the funnest part on private is imo the world pvp but if you play a pay 2 win you should prob die also those servers that are x10 xp     FF7 for the PC    literally ANYTHING i would rather play a dora the explorer game than that fucking piece of shit. heres a list of MASSIVELY better games Left 4 dead/2 Mass Effect/2/3 Halo/2/3 any yugioh game after GX Donkey Konga any zelda game smash bros Hyperdimension neptunia Gravity Rush Call of Duty: Black Ops any fucking real-life card game id rather go to a justin bieber concert FUCK FINAL FANTASY, ITS OVER RATED AS SHIT AND ISNT EVEN FUN  half the people i know "enjoy" final fantasy games, but they never tell me why, they never explain any decent mechanics, or what element from the story they like. i tried multiple games in the series, and i enjoyed ONE  FFX-II SO FUCK YOUR SHIT-TIER TASTE IN GAMES, YOU GOD FORSAKEN FAGGOT                       You sound like a emo faggot, how many dicks you suck in college?   Destiny. How is this even a thread?   from the FF series, FF6,   and then hundreds of other games       /threading your own post  How is summer treating you newfriend?     Yet even with that it's still a better game    Calm down keyboard warrior    check'd BC and wrath were my favorite     try harder   Rome: Total War   I loved FF6 my self it seemed very magical and full of secrets     LoL   Pay 2 win  You've never played LoL     FALLOUT 4 FAGGOTS   Wrath was great M8 just that last patch b4 cata ugg, tons of new mounts in wrath good dungeons and raids the jousting was sick too and yes DK were fun! When they first came out they were OP as fuck lol had to fix that..    this was the first version I bought of it haha. My piece of shit computer could barely run it, couldn't get past wall market because of frame rates. got it on my ps2 a few months later and was blown away     yes, I'm emo because I like well developed plot lines.  Connect the dots...when I was playing FF it was completely acceptable and encouraged to bully faggots like yourself...emo only exists because this next generation of males are ashamed of their dicks       FF IX. Damn that was so easy   Hello everyone, we finally managed to find the source of a glorious ass on /gif/ at  Unfortunately this webm is the only video that we can find on the internet... But! Turns out she is an escort from mexico http://www.zonadivas.com/jessica_la<wbr>mborghini.html So here's the plan: 1. We find someone from mexico 2. After legitimate proof he actually is who he says, he calls her and post the registration here 3. we then proceed to fund him the amount of money that she asks for fucking and being recorded 4. he uploads the video. How does this sound?      </wbr>    bump for that ass  you need to find a mexican dumb enough to post his personal info on 4chan  Count me in with 20$ once there is proof.  bump for justice   He just needs to proof he lives in mexico in some way or another, then post the registration of the call   Don't let this die guys we just found someone who's going on a trip to mexico  We need someone that speaks spanish to call the number and ask how much she wants   I have $171 in my PayPal account I am willing to give for the cause, come on guys we can do this!   Looks like someone found out she wants 3000$/hr   Oh well fuck that, no escort pussy is worth that much.    Its sounds retarded    No proof, he's just bullshitting. And there is no way a escort in Mexico costs that much. Even the highest tier prostitutes (the ones for celebrities or royalty) cost around $500/day. That's a lot of money in Mexico. All we need is pay her for one hour and to record it, which will cost around $200-$400.    Have you looked at that ass? More than woth if you ask me... Anyone we still don't have any proof of the price      faggot detected    Bimp  Mexican reporting in  bump      Read this:<br/>       Call the number on the site, ask how much she wants to get fucked and taped, record the call and post it here, quickly!    Wait it says she's in Playa del Carmen. I'm literally in the opposite end of Mexico    Well will you do her and record it?    Then someone else will fuck her, right now all we need is to know how much she wants.    I had plans to go this summer break with my family to Cancún, which is like 30-40 minutes away from Playa del Carmen, but plans changed. I can try to find out how much she wants, like this guy says     It will be extremelt appreciated    Okay ask her how much for sex and record the phone call if you can so people will believe you.   This is going to be one of our biggest accomplishments    I sent her a text. I'm at work so I can't really make such phone call lol     Go the bath and use your cellphone   Maybe the anon got the currency wrong and he actually meant 3000 pesos. They should correspond to about 200$    Post screenshot    Yeah, Mexico uses the same dollar sign for Mexican Pesos.     Seems like we have a price then, although she might ask for more since we want to record her... Let's see how this goes   Great work anon    Go the bathroom and call her with your cellphone    Keep us updated     I just did, she won't answer  She's probably busy or something       Swedish anon from /gif/ said she answered, that's strange...    I'll try again in a few minutes   hi /b/, what's bothering you?   you  you're not in my arms right now      you are   you   ▲ ▲ ▲        why's that?
