I've only ever welded pipe before with stick and tig. What am I up for? Never even fucked with the machine either..<br><br>Pic unrelated</br></br>  Make sure you leave your mana untapped.  <br>cant be that hard if immigrants can do it.</br>  Mail me your magic cards and ill tell you  <br> 3G Flux core <br>About the same as welding with Sticks, but you have one extra safety, the gas, if you handle sticks, then you probably will do fine with flux core.</br></br>  Gas at 25-35 cfh bro  keep a 90 degree angle and don't have to much or too little stick out, check your nozzle between passes for spatter build up and run between 35-45 psi on your Argo shield and you'll be fine  <br>I need them cards.</br>  Can't really remember the parameters for heat settings. I think around 18.5 volts and 200 inches per minute on the wire feed should be fine. It's just carbon steel ya?  <br>I run 26.5 volts and 300 wire speed on .45 wire</br>  <br>Please I need your cards.</br>  Pretty much mig. Just make sure you watch the Flux separate from the metal and don't leave shit in yo welds.<br>Handles like mig. Take the precautions you take with stick. Watch for the Slag to not get caught on the weld. It's also runny. But that's just the slag. <br>That was not clear at all... <br>It's automatic stick. Just handle it like you do stick without pushing the gun. Also walk the cup on your bevel, <br>I also play magic what do you think of ftv products?<br>Immigrant welder here. Where are you trying to get a job op? <br>so that I can go and take it from you</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Please give them to me.</br></br></br>  <br>He's gonna keyhole and grape at that heat with no backing plate. Never heard of a test like that. All my plate tests have had a backing strip for CWB anyways</br>  <br><br>If you can weld tig and stick you'll be fine with flux core. Grab some scrap plate/flat bar to test the settings on the welder before you hit the pipe, don't be shy, perfectly reasonable to do so, especially with a welder you haven't used before.<br><br>If it's vertical test just keep the heat low since no backing plate can cause you to fuck the pipe with too much heat.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah I'd say like 23.5 V and 370 wire speed maybe</br></br>  <br>I need them please.<br><br>Also, , you carry your cards in a plastic box?</br></br></br>  <br>It's not pipe. He said 3G. That's just a vertical plate test</br>  <br>This reminds me use all your fucking tabs. This is essential to get good penetration, not necessary in no test areas but it makes your shit look more professional.</br>  Fuck off, Trip  Op here sorry forgot i made this shit was fapping. Yea well im only a little iffy about the machine settings. What do you guys mean not let slag in my weld? During the process or make sure i clean after each pass? Plate is 3/4th inch thick  <br>They call it monkey mig for a reason. Go downhill for the root pass(if they let you) and you'll be fine. If you can weld pipe an open root 3g test should be a breeze.</br>  <br>isn't there always a backing plate in all g weld tests?</br>  <br>I was trying to get into magic ever since i got laid off the pipeline earlier this spring<br><br>Thanks for the tip was wondering that. <br><br>Its just where i keep them</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>clean after every pass and you'll be fine. flux core is easy to run</br>  <br>Both. You got to look carefully until you get a feel for it. Else all you see is one puddle instead of distinct metal and flux. This may leave pinholes and inclusions if you are not careful.<br>But for real yo i'll do your job for pennies were u at faggot</br></br>  <br>oops sorry, forgot he said no backing</br>  <br>Uphill progression because is a vessel welding shop i have no idea why not just test me on a fucking pipe and im guessing thats why no backing because it needs no less than 1/16th reinforcement however idk why flux and not mig for a root. I dont know what the fuck</br>  <br>I've never heard of flux roots either. at work we use STT mig for roots</br>  <br>You'll be doing monkey work and you'll quit in a month. We're you at man I don't even know my right under the law and I'll take cash. Hook me up bro. I'll let you play with my cube. Cmon.</br>  <br>Whats the purpose of the backing? Sorry never ran structural before</br>  <br>Monkey work you mean they'll be cracking the whip? Im in houston</br>  <br>They use it in some places it gets ground out either way, it's a crutch.</br>  <br>If it's a shipyard, they want you to use fcaw cause you can use it outside without wind fucking your shielding gas.<br><br>lol no</br></br></br>  <br>Bro what I'm in Houston too.
