A ton of them were claiming moral faggotry shit like ohhh he shouldn't cheat on his wife, she has a right to know, he's a teacher he manipulated her, blah blah blah. Brad was simply fucking a hot young chick behind his wife's back which is epic and some /b/ moral fags couldn't take it. It's funny cause dudes on /b/ try to normally act edgy but in this case the moral fags took over and player hated on poor Brad. Now he's being investigated. Never seen such hate on a dude just fucking a chick.  <br><br>Brad is going to prison</br></br>  <br>Basically</br>  shaveballs was an idiot who documented his affairs and left them in a public photobucket account. who cares about the morality of what he did, he was a fucking idiot and /b/ jumped on a golden opportunity to fuck with someone. Nothing more, nothing less.  <br>Says the actual virgin</br>  <br>You r an edgelord fag</br>  <br>Which part of "you didn't read txt between them" did you not understand?<br>Seriously, do you by any chance go to the same school seeing as you are so uneducated?</br></br>  <br>See</br>  I am a fat 29 year old virgin loser who would give up both of my shaved balls for a girl like Lani so I am loving the destruction of Brad he can go fuck himself  <br>The school brad will continue to teach at is rated the best in the state</br>  <br>i bet the super nintendo of that school is pissed!1</br>  <br>Moar?</br>  <br>100% agree</br>  <br>Wait, so brad a /b/ro? Even worse, does that mean that all promise not to share breads are monitored by sjw police? Holy shit.</br>  <br><br>Rich coming from a faggot whos only time of getting pussy was when his mom mistook him for the afterbirth that run down her legs!</br></br>  <br>Wow, the best in Alabama. That's like being rated the warmest spot in Antarctica.</br>  The joker was right...<br><br>Brad introduced a little anarchy and everyone here lost their minds.</br></br>  <br>Yes dude. So many edgelords on /b/ who just wait to ruin lives. Post pics at your own risk</br>  <br>no, the "posted pics in a promised not to share" story is bs. that's not how it started.</br>  <br>Fuck off. The little girl was only 18.he was a fucking pedo and deserves to be put in jail. She wasn't 21 yet asshat.</br>  <br>Fucking doubt it now the superintendent is involved</br>  <br>You are fucking retarded</br>  <br>Nice. Your insults are getting a little better wizard.</br>  <br>18 is an adult fuck boy. Dont be such a moral fag on here .</br>  <br>shut up retard</br>  <br>In all likelihood, the girl was younger than 18 when this actually started. Not to mention there are other students commenting that he may have tried and/or succeeded in doing this before. The details are sketchy.</br>  <br>This. The feminists own /b/ and have for a long time</br>  <br><br>She was 17 when he preyed on her</br></br>  With AOC being 16 in Alabama, doubt he's going to see jail time. His career and relationships are toast, though.  christ, most of you are some edgy bastards  Guys, can someone teach me the fine art of ball shaving? I don't want to be left out  <br>too bad nobody cares</br>  You know /b/ mostly celebrated when that lady teacher got jailed for 22 years for having sex with 3 17 year old students right?  <br> Fuck off. The little girl was only 18. <br>what the fuck are you even saying? aldults cant fuck adults? MAKES NO SENSE. <br><br> the little girl <br> little <br> girl <br>she is a young woman you piece of shit, are you now saying that 18 yo ADULT women cant make their own choices?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Brad faces 2 to 20 under Alabama law and an incredible 10 TO LIFE if the Feds get involved.<br><br>Anyone know if Brad has lawyered up?</br></br>  <br>Bait, is that you?</br>  <br>Obviously you do seeing as you are in the tread and the shits hit the fan big time!<br>Now run along Brad, shave ur ass, ur need it looking perky for jail time!</br></br>  <br> Brad faces 2 to 20 under Alabama law and an incredible 10 TO LIFE if the Feds get involved. <br>you americans are fucking crazy, in europe he would only lose his job.</br></br>  <br>mfw 15 is legal in my country.

In my country a kid's rapist find a new job in another school and rape some more kids (and I mean kids like 4/5yo).</br>  What does /b/ think of the "murder" of Samuel DuBose? He was being pulled over, didn't have a driver's license with him, and then tried to start the car and drive off while the cop was still talking to him. <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Z0c<wbr>dejrSjyc</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Why do black people act like assholes, then get pissed that they're shot? All of these "police brutality" videos show the black guy committing a crime. If they just followed the god-damned law to begin with, they wouldn't even have these encounters with the police.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Dont get me wrong, I hate niggers, but he could have been tazed</br>  It's always something.<br><br>Trying to flee the scene after being pulled over without a license, selling loose cigarettes, robbing a store, whatever. Then the media defends the poor black man that got hurt by the bad popo.</br></br>    "It’s true that around 13 per cent of Americans are black, according to the latest estimates from the US Census Bureau.<br><br>And yes, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, black offenders committed 52 per cent of homicides recorded in the data between 1980 and 2008. Only 45 per cent of the offenders were white. Homicide is a broader category than “murder” but let’s not split hairs.<br><br>27 bjs use FactCheck: do black Americans commit more crime?<br><br>Blacks were disproportionately likely to commit homicide and to be the victims. In 2008 the offending rate for blacks was seven times higher than for whites and the victimisation rate was six times higher."</br></br></br></br></br></br>  The argument goes like this:<br><br>Black people are disproportionately affected by police violence because greater numbers of them are not skilled in ways to minimize negative interaction with the cops. Combine this with a greater likelihood of an axe to grind against said police, and you have a recipe for disaster.<br>According to this way of thinking, the police are aware of this and use it to their advantage, since they can be incredibly brutal while still following the law.</br></br></br>  <br>You're saying he wasn't "skilled" enough to know that he shouldn't speed away while he's being stopped by the police?</br>  <br>Pick another word, if you want.<br>But you know you or I would never make that decision, just based on the possible consequences.</br></br>  <br>I wonder if you could use boiler plate for the story and just fill in the nigger's name</br>  Black people do not listen to what the cops say, plain and simple. Take Sandra Bland for example. She did literally nothing that the officer asked her to do and that is why she got arrested. You resist arrest, you get arrested. I just do not get how the black community as a whole does not understand that. Cops, most of the time, are not out for blacks. Blacks just don't listen or help themselves  <br><br>  Step 1 <br>Nigger commits crime<br><br>  Step 2 <br>Nigger is confronted by police<br><br>  Step 3 <br>Nigger resists arrest<br><br>  Step 4 <br>Nigger is shot/tazed/pushed to the ground<br><br>  Step 5 <br>Nigger dies<br><br>  Step 6  <br>Nigger witnesses lie (See Michael Brown - Several witnesses who originally testified against Darren Wilson, while being interviewed by the prosecution, admitted to lying under oath as to the truthfulness of their testimony.)<br><br>  Step 7 <br>Ohhhh lawdy! He wus a good boy, he dint do nuffin! Popo is discriminatin against us!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I like how "unarmed" gets tossed around these days. Example A:  Why didn't he chase him with his police car? Wouldn't that be so much more fun?  <br>Why do you think /b/ (or 4chans) opinion matter? Cop screwed up at the wrong time against the wrong color with the wrong technology. <br><br>He'll get 10 to 15 years no matter how many posts stormfront makes.</br></br></br>  Remember Bill Cosby's famous "pound cake" speech?<br><br>But these people, the ones up here in the balcony fought so hard. Looking at the incarcerated, these are not political criminals. These are people going around stealing Coca-Cola. People getting shot in the back of the head over a piece of pound cake! And then we all run out and are outraged, 'The cops shouldn't have shot him.' What the hell was he doing with the pound cake in his hand? I wanted a piece of pound cake just as bad as anybody else, and I looked at it and I had no money. And something called parenting said, 'If you get caught with it you’re going to embarrass your mother.' Not 'You're going to get your butt kicked.' No. 'You're going to embarrass your family.'<br><br><br>... not that it's a great source anymore, since he raped everyone and ended up being just another nigger.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>"That unarmed man didn't deserve to be killed!"<br><br>"I guess I wouldn't have been throwing rocks at the police to begin with"</br></br></br>  Someone vandalized the mailbox down the street from me with "black lives matter".<br><br>Way to prove that you're not a criminal asshole, nigger.</br></br>  <br>black mail matters too</br>  Sure it's cops v blacks but why do white americans go into cinemas and start killing folk? Why do white americans go to schools and start killing kids? Why do white americans go to kindergartens and start killing babies? Y'all r the sick ones yo. No wonder ur crackers  <br>blacks do things just as bad or worse but are not publicized</br>  <br> No wonder ur crackers <br>huh?<br><br>Yes there are while people that commit crimes, but:<br><br> “It’s important to note that black men commit nearly half of all murders in this country, which is astounding when you take into consideration the fact that they only make up 12-13 per cent of the population.” </br></br></br></br></br></br>  New thread Boxxy/Catie<br><br>Forever Queen</br></br>    <br>Hey</br>    7th image in your reaction folder, is your reaction to being crowned "Mr 4chan man 2015"      Well...              <br>I don't even...</br>                <br>that's so fitting!</br>            <br>I don't even know why I saved it in the first place.

If you reply to these faggots with yes they think you are okay with doing whatever the hell it is they want. If you say no then it is the same thing.

It adds NOTHING to a conversation and makes you look ignorant when you say it. <br><br>Also when people say decimated when they mean obliterated.

We get the watered down shit that's horrible to watch. Then again, listening to Japanese subs gets annoying sometimes. Even if I'm reading the damn words on the screen, it doesn't mean the language still doesn't sound like gibberish to me.</br>  <br>It's tricky, because they either do that or they never shut the fuck up about every little thing that bothers them. There's no in-between.</br>  <br><br>better thing to say is "I can't tell you what to do. but if it was me I'd......"<br><br>this is how I deal with these, because it's not my place to tell anyone how to live their life</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not meant to be taken literally you autist.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;631263862 <br>Considering how often police are acquitted and how many autist Wal Mart-Americans support them unequivocally I think cops are more deserving of the title dindu nuffins.</br>  <br> "epic" <br> "I could care less" ...so you care at least a bit? <br> "Don't throw away your vote" <br> "Patriarchy" <br> "When you have kids of your own..."

It's a strawman at best. What is "making the tribe stronger and higher quality"?

Educating children, developing new technology. Army grunts just run around being told to intimidate and kill things. Perpetually "defending" our country from an unseen threat doesn't remotely contribute to the actual country's development. Plus it's a huge fucking resource eater. We could resolve all of our economic issues if we cut the military budget in half. <br><br>But instead, you have a fear-mongering group of people who always remind out about these unseen threats and how your children are going to be kidnapped and you'll be decapitated. <br><br>It's more a statement about the lack of real contribution the military makes to society.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>you mean platitudes? <br><br>yeah my least favorite<br><br> It'll be okay <br><br>i hate that. its not.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you need to chill brah</br>  <br>Are you me?</br>  <br>Yea I never understood this.

Thank you based anon</br>                                        <br>What game</br>                              Game of Thrones discussion thread anons.<br><br>I'll start with two ideas.<br><br>1) Stannis Baratheon isn't dead yet. I'm not going to try to work out some theory as to why Brienne wouldn't kill him after what he did to Renly, but the fact that he's the only person that could appropriately represent the Baratheons at the moment makes me think that it's too early for one of the four houses fighting for the throne to just fizzle out. <br><br>2) Arya's sight will come back with something related to Syrio. I've heard that in the books, she gets her sight back eventually but I chose not to read into it further and see (no pun intended) how that actually happens. If you go back to season one and watch the last time Arya and Syrio practice, Syrio says that Arya was not seeing, and that true seeing is within the heart of swordplay. <br><br>Thoughts?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Jon Snow dies  <br>ARYA is blind. Think about it..</br>  <br>Explain?</br>  <br>stannis the mannis can't die and he rapes Brienne with Oathkeeper</br>  <br>Arya needs to become no one. Arya is blind. When the girl is no one the girl won't be blind.</br>  <br>It's odd how over half of stannises groups abandoned him when in the books his army is at full force, soon to go to winterfell, someone had theorized that stannis staged the few mutannies so the army would strike winterfell later, seems half baked of an idea but still done properly would be interesting.</br>  <br>1) Pod stops Brienne from killing Stannis. Stannis willing goes to join the NW. Stannis goes to wall and becomes Lord Commander. John Snow is brought back to life. Stannis sees John Snow reborn as Azor and pledges fealty, so then Starks and Baratheons are united again. Or something like that.</br>  ain't dead yet faggots  <br>Stannis new lord commander of the nights watch after Jon "dies". Calling it now.</br>  Joffrey is ressurected and is renamed the King of Westeros  <br>Aryia gets her sight back after learning to live with out it and continues becoming a faceless man.<br><br>Red lady will bring john snow back to life, since he has died he is released from his nights watch vows and can now go do stuffs<br><br>Have other ideas but these things are known</br></br></br></br></br>  Since there is no heir to the stormlands, Jamie convinces Cersi to give it to Bronn  Robb Stark comes back to life and is proclaimed King in The North  <br>Slowpok'd it. <br><br><br><br>This nigga got the right idea</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I have the ideas about Red Lady bringing back Jon however, I can see the NW trying to torch him so he doesnt become a walker, and he wont burn due to his targ links, then Red Lady jizzs and resses him, or the flame brings him back</br>  <br>They can't let both the cliffhangers have happy endings</br>  <br>Ah, got it. Is that from the books or is that just a thought?</br>  <br>Who says anything about those endings being happy? Those are just plot movers, yo.</br>  <br>Not all targs don't burn</br>  <br>Targaryens aren't immune to fire, George R.R. even said that in an interview, what happened with Danaerys and the funeral pyre was a miracle. She got burned when she rode Drogon.</br>  <br>^ what this guy said. Clear evidence from Dany's brother dying via a premium golden shower.</br>  <br>Just a thought.</br>  <br>It's from the books. Once Arya can live as a blind person she gets her eye sight back. It's all to teach her to become no one and so she can fully commit to roles as a faceless assassin.</br>  <br>It depends whether we go from the book or series though, they have their differences now, either way he'll be reborn as Azor Ahai most likely</br>  <br>Fuck the show after last season, the book is the way to go now.</br>  <br> Season 5 <br> No victarian greyjoy yet <br>Fuck this gay earth, also fuck them for not showing ramsay brutality beating the shit out of his wife like in the book.</br></br></br>  <br>Stannis is too ambitious to join the nights watch, he would rather rule Westeros</br>  <br>Or the fact that it isn't Sansa in the book.</br>  <br>Davos will be Azor Ahai. No proof but It would make him believe in the Red God.</br>  <br>who da fuq is dat<br><br>Also, I read that Lady Stoneheart is supposed to be a thing. Think it'll come up at all in the show?</br></br></br>  <br>Yea, but i actually like that part, she wasnt doing anything in the book.</br>  <br>Nah, it's totally Jon, but I don't think Jon is the son of Lyanna and Rhaegar.</br>  <br>But she also bathed in boiling water and picked up a red hot dragon egg that burned a servant girl.</br>  <br>But Jons a loser</br>  <br>Any kind of evidence to try to support that claim? Davos being Azor Ahai just for the sake of him believing in the Red God would kind of be a let-down.</br>  <br>No shit Stannis isn't dead. He killed the shit out of Brienne. You thought he'd just keel over? Lol.</br>  <br>She was getting set up to marry Robert the Heir or whatever the fuck that kids name was from the Vale, SweetRobin was going to have an "accident" and she would have been set up to rule the Vale and the North once Baelish revealed who she really was.</br>  <br>Targaryens have a natural resistance to heat and such, higher thresh hold than others, but a full on immunity? Nah. Plus in the books she is dealing with burns from Drogon. She isn't immune, just resistant.</br>  <br>A bad ass who wears fucking plate armor when fighting on a boat, his brother also comes back to be the new king of the iron islands and brings a horn from old valrayia that binds dragons to your will.</br>  <br>If you're trolling, 5/10<br><br>If you're not, Brienne can be fairly emotional but she's not going to be killed by someone half-dead barely supporting themselves against a tree.</br></br></br>  <br>At the battle of the black water he was reborn amongst the wildfire and the salty seawater when he was blown into the water</br>  <br>His sacrificed love will be Shireen when George kills her in book 6. Not love in the traditional sense, but he fucking loves her like a grandfather.</br>  <br>yes, or when his son died at the blackwater</br>  <br>You mean the true king of Westeros, got surrounded and severely out numbered fought his way into the forest for safety, as he was "half-dead barely supporting" himself he took down three people at once. Yeah, he's not just going down, even by some freakish amazon. Stannis got himself some Valyrian Steel. You can mark my words.</br>  <br>Not really a sacrifice so much as a casualty of war. Shireen is literally being sacrificed.</br>  <br>maybe stannis takes oathkeeper and fights white walkers resurrected jon</br>    Am I the only one who hates seeing Gwendoline Christie at game of thones events  <br>I don't know about Jon Snow. I know that he's the only reason the wildlings are as peaceful as they are at Castle Black. I know that if he's dead they could very well turn on the Knights Watch and end them. I don't know why they would really try and kill Jon Snow.<br>Honestly the entire thing seems like the little kids day dream, exacting his revenge on him for his childish anger with him.<br>I also know it's bullshit that they would label him a traitor and they would know they wouldn't get away with it. He was offered to leave the Knights Watch for Winterfell the throne of his family and he didn't take it. He's no traitor.</br></br></br>  <br>Is that the chick who plays Shireen?</br>  <br>yeh, that's her, apparently took the pic at a bbq this week,and posted to twitter</br>  <br>After the time he spent with the wildlings and everything they fought for they see him letting the wildlings through the wall to settle the gift as a betrayal of every brother who died defending castle black. They do it to save the values of the NW as they know it, which they see him as destroying. By allying with the wildlings, it goes against hundreds of years of hostility between the NW and the wildlings, which in their minds is pretty much NW treason. Also, Olly doesn't exist in the book, so fuck that little nigger.</br>  <br>yeah, olly a cunt</br>  <br>I don't get why people still thinks Syrio is alive. I mean, yeah, we didn't get to see his dead, but he absolutely couldn't have survived that. The fact that haven't appeared anymore in both books and series is a proof. Unless he is a faceless man, but not all bravosi are.</br>  <br>Arya becomes blind in order to further her training as an Assasin for the Faceless.<br><br>She has to use all her senses. Read the damn books if you like the series.</br></br></br>  <br>I hope olly gets fucking raped by thenns. Then eaten.</br>  <br>WHAT IS HYPE MAY NEVER DIE<br>(I kinda secretly wish for him to be Daario in disguise tough)</br></br>  <br>No. Faggot who lost in the vote for Lord Commander is using that as an excuse to attempt to steal the position. He gets fucked.</br>  <br>the book have always been the way to go<br><br>littlefinger wont do that, if he kills robert arryn he loses his position as lord protector of the vale, not a bold move</br></br></br>  <br>Clegane Bowl?</br>  <br>TV faggot plz die<br>Books master race</br></br>  <br>Faggot who lost Lord Commander vote was sent off to either the Shadow Tower or Eastwatch by the sea, he isn't even there to instigate it.<br><br>He won't kill off Robert until Sansa is married to the other guy so he can control the vale via her.</br></br></br>  <br>get hype</br>  <br>he wont marry sansa away, hes tricking her. sansa is the heir to the north, why lose her to some random guy of the vale?</br>  I personally believe that Robert Arryn is the son of Petyr Baelish as he is very unlike John Arryn. Probably not a significant part of the story but still  <br>Saw a video about that theory, made sense to me. Not sure if I believe, but would be pretty cool.</br>  <br>She would still be the heir to the North, and then she would also have a stake in the Vale, maybe an accident befalls her new husband as well, leaving no heirs, only a widow in charge.</br>  <br>I get it, makes sense, but what about the tv series? What did he get marrying Sansa to Ramsay? Seems pretty dumb if he's going to take the north by army anyway,</br>  <br>Holy shit! How did I not see that? John was a big brawny guy and Robert "Arryn" is a rail thin scrawny shit, so much like Petyr...</br>  <br>if he marries sansa himself he will control three kingdoms at once, i dont think he will marry her away<br><br>maybe he is, they both were in kings landing for years</br></br></br>  <br>the horn is named dragon binder or whatever but so far it hasnt done shit to a dragon. it has however made eurons enemies all of a suddon support him at the kingsmoot once blown</br>  <br>the tv series stopped having sense long ago, i can see some small plotlines being cut. from now on only main plotline will remain the same, i think</br>  <br>God I hope so. Bronn is such a great show character. Yeah he's basically comic relief at this point but who gives a shit<br><br>I wanna see that guy pretending to act like a lord and then realizes he likes being a dirt covered sell sword</br></br></br>  <br>I wanna feel Arya's pussy wrapped around my cock. Snug fit.</br>  <br><br>I can see this happening. I mean, Lysa kind of forced her way with him once or twice. I love this short video about his story: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=W18<wbr>nggyOHfc</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Too bad stannis is dead idiots.</br>  <br>Jon Snow made peace with the Wildlings for the first time in history.</br>  <br>Then once the guy who blew the horn died, they all hated him again.<br><br>He marries her off to a supposed heir of the vale to give her legitimacy over the vale after said heir dies, then he marries her. Now he has legitimate control.</br></br></br>  <br>Rule number #1 of TV:<br>If they don't show the death in detail, it's not dead. Unless you are Jon.</br></br>  Stop pissing on the show you autistic book faggots  <br>That is the problem.</br>  <br>It's been confirmed, Stan the man is dead.</br>  <br>"Confirmed"</br>  <br>i just hope the child killing is a result of the crazy mother and not mellisadre and stannis. it seems out of character for him to do it like that</br>  <br>Its already been confirmed. Producers say showing his death would have been gratuitous. And they're right. You see stannis 'die' (his wife hanging herself, him burning his daughter, his army leaving him). It wasn't necessary to show</br>  <br>I know,I know... But I read that somewhere.</br>  <br>Exactly... (I'm the one who confirmed it) kek</br>  <br>If they did kill Jon Snow, they all but killed themselves, so fuck them anyway. Samwell isn't there any more anyway, so they can all go to hell.</br>  <br><br><br><br>If I'm not wrong they said Bran and Rickon were also dead when Theon burned the two random kids. Honestly tough, the show always show the death of important characters. Ned, Robb, Cat, Jon, to list a few. So, yeah, I kinda believe he's alive. But it won't make much of a difference anyways, unless he allies himself with Brienne, or the Brotherhood Without Banners if they appear next season, he's rekt.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What about Pip and Grenn? They weren't there stabbing Jon... His only friend who betrayed him was Bowen Marsh, and he did it with a tear in his eye.</br>  <br>What do you expect them to say? ''oh yeah stannis is certainly not dead''. This confirmation doesn't mean shit</br>  <br><br>Well if a miracle can happen for Dany then why not for Azor Ahai? Yes they're not immune and fire can kill them, but they can have a resistance to it and crazy stuff can happen because Targs are magic.</br></br>  <br>But I always knew that they wasn't them who got burned. That episode ended showing bran with osha in a dark little hole.</br>  I really want to know why the Lord of Light abandoned Stannis after he made such a tremendous sacrifice. He loved his daughter very much and sacrificed her to the Lord of Light.  <br>didnt pip and gren die</br>  <br>Jon is dead. Kit Harrington the actor is still employed by hbo, because he will be back at some point. As who....? Not sure.</br>  <br><br>Nah. Stannis is dead inside you can tell. If he shows back up it will only be to his suicide/death. Frankly they should leave it there. And everyone knew rickon and bran werent dead. Youd have to be a dummy to fall for that as a viewer (based on what you see in the show, not by 'assuming' the show is just trying to trick you)</br></br>  <br>That was so gut-wrenching....</br>  <br>If miracles just happen for everyone then how is it a fucking miracle? Targs aren't "magic" it's just a natural resistance based on their ancestral homeland of Valyria.<br><br>Only in the show.</br></br></br>  What's with Ramsay anyways? Damn plot armor. I mean<br><br> be him <br> is kinky having sex with kennel master's daughter <br> wild annoying greyjoy sister of reek appears <br> beat the shit out of her while shirtless, and the help of four good men and dogs <br><br>And now, twenty good men, he sabotages Stannis's camp easily as fuck. The hell, I know "the villains wins" is different but it's getting kinda ridiculous. If you don't want to kill him, cripple him or something!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>fuck off</br>  <br>One thing i hate is the show makes jon snow seem like a pussy and incompetent. Him choking that one guy a lifting him off his feet by his neck wasnt there and in the book they posioned him then he still broke one guys wrist. And wtf was up with brienne beating jaime easily? In the book he nearly kills her, even being unarmored and in chains and starving.</br>  <br>hype acquired</br>  <br>Heck, Shireen's sacrifice have to get a effect. Wasn't it to save him? Maybe Brienne did kill him, but thanks to the sacrifice he gets revived, Thoros of Myr style, only with wi-fi.</br>  <br>Gotta tear down that patriarchy, am i rite?</br>  <br><br>/b/ needs a fun mod again, a mod knight who can rid us of cancer and shit posting, and ban just for the kek's.<br><br> (USER WAS BANNED FOR THIS POST) <br><br>Who wants to see this red banner again?

Also, silly crows, they forgot to burn Jon's body, hehe.</br>  <br>Yea, iam sad they took out all the internal politics with the northmen slowly turning against the boltons or mentioning the most badass part about how aryas direwolf is fucking wrecking people, with a giant wolf pack of over 100 wolfs, and that people think its Robb starks and his mens spirts come back to take revenge.</br>  <br>Fucking confirmed, get hyped</br>  Holy shit this exactly like /r/asoiaf  Things I expect from Season Six 01/03  <br>but reddit is for losers</br>  <br>02/03</br>  <br>03/03</br>  <br>What's exploding behind littlefinger?</br>  <br>Yes, meaning this thread is also filled with circlejerking book faggots</br>  <br>The wall.</br>  <br>wildfire you cuntslag</br>  <br>I guess it looks like he blew up the wall/Castle Black with wildfire.</br>  <br>the wall of ice, seems like in the picture littlefinger has brought the army of the vale to fight for the north, buying alot of wild fire, not something i would see littlefinger doing.</br>  <br>I'm not retarted faggot, I meant what he was blowing up with the wildfyre</br>  Were the Winterfell horses the ones that left Stannis after he burned his daughter?<br>I don't get why Stannis would even try if he knew Bolton had this huge mass of horses that was like 3x that of his whole army.. and they came out of nowhere. can't he like scout first?</br>  You want the good girl, but you need the bad pussy.  <br>How did Darth Maul become king of the undead?<br>Also where was Ghost while John was being stabbed?</br></br>  How does Littlefinger profit from blowing up the wall?  <br>I guess they don't show Ghost at Jon's side because it would be expensive? I don't get why his wolf isn't at his side all the time. But they have a bond, if Jon's dead, Ghost felt it.</br>  <br>that's even more fucking retarded</br>  <br>Do you guys think she poisoned bronn with the bite on the ear?</br>   tfw Doran doesn't do shit this season   <br>And this is what puzzles us all in a nutshell, in the books he seemed 100 times more calculative, also, you don't get to be called a ''brilliant stragedist'' if you pull shit like this off.</br>  <br> Update] [Auto] 9 new posts <br>he'd lost everything. probably wanted to go out with a clean death, just a shame all his men had to go with him</br></br>  <br/>  <br>"He would see this country burn if he could be king of the ashes." - Varys</br>  <br>He has a pretty nice wooden wheelchair tough. Didn't even tough it was possible.</br>  <br><br> doesn't talk much <br> clever as fuck <br> wheelchair <br>So he is basically Stephen Hawking of Westeros?</br></br></br></br></br>  Don't ask how I know because fuck you that's why.<br><br>The first episode of season 6 is a flashback episode of Roberts Rebellion showing the R+L=J, Then Jon's resurrection (Because yes, He's not dead) and Then it goes into season 6 Which will focus ALOT more on White Walkers. Oh and if you thought the battle of Hardhome was big and CGI'd, Wait till about episode 7 or possibly 8.</br></br>  <br>Pretty sure Ghost is locked up because of security reasons, the Stannis supporters still at the wall don't feel safe around him and Ghost has gotten more aggressive as people start to turn on Jon so for the safety of everyone else he had Ghost kenneled.</br>  <br> Jon's Resurrection <br> Not dead <br>Pick one. If he's getting resurrected then he is dead.</br></br></br>  <br>The problem is, the only flashback we've had were in form of dreams (in Bran and Jojen's case) or thoughts (Cersei's) so who will be having this flashback? Howland Reed? A vision by Bran? A vision by a dying Jon? Melisandre?</br>  <br>he's not dead because he got resurrected. how stupid are you faget?</br>  <br>He isn't resurrected yet in either book or show so he is fucking dead until it happens.</br>  <br>This flash back is to show Robert Rebellion and the real parentage of Jon, It explains a fair few things for the now in GoT.</br>  I hope Jon stays dead, I think he's the most boring person in Game of Thrones, even worse in asoiaf  <br>He's not dead in the book you fucking cunt<br><br>It's left on a cliff hanger that's he's been stabbed just like it did in the show.<br><br>Why people seem to think he's dead is beyond me he's just laid there dieing, Not dead.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wouldn't mind him coming back, but I really do not want him to be the son of Lyanna and Rhaegar. It'll probably be that way, but here's hoping it doesn't.</br>  <br>Olly is the new Azor Ahai and Lord Commander, The Urbunt, King Beyond The Wall and Warden Of The North.</br>  <br><br>I didn't even think of that. That's fucking genius. Davos is a fucking awesome character.</br></br>  <br>If he isn't fucking dead then the NW will finish the job in a much more permanent manner, either beheading or burning, in which case I don't see much chance of him being resurrected.<br> Azor Ahai is a headless man <br> Azor Ahai is a pile of ashes </br></br></br>  <br>He could be Ashara Dayne's son too. R + L = J still is more probably since there's a lot of clues, still, I don't doubt if GRRM is just fucking he is just the son of a random whore named Wylla.</br>  <br><br>Quoted the wrong post, oh my.</br></br>  <br>He's the product of incest between ned and his sister, this explains why is mouth always looks like he is pouting</br>  <br><br>the last season was pure garbage dude.

I like that outcome so much better.</br></br>  <br>I'm not arguing that Jon is permanently dead, only a complete fucking faggot would believe that. All I'm saying is that for any of what anyone wants to happen with Jon, be it Azor Ahai or any of the other fucking fan hype shit on him he needs to be dead at some point so his vows to the watch or no longer relevant. He doesn't die, he's still a member of the NW. He dies, he's free of his vows to go fuck up WW's as Azor Ahai or free to go marry Dany or whatever the fucking faggots want him to do.</br>  <br>This looks so much like Harlock, another famous pirate</br>  <br><br>That makes absolutely no sense dude. The only people in that cage were Jaqen, Rorge and Biter.</br></br>  <br>He's saying that Syrio was a Faceless man and that he changed into Jaquen and got put in that cage on purpose.</br>  When samwel hears the news of jons death, he will come back to the wall with the wildlingsand rek.  So, remember when Viserys said that he would let Dany be fucked by all the Dothraki and their horses? Well... That seems very likely now.  I would watch a DanyXdothrakiXhorses porn  <br><br>Regardless, I think Syrio's fate is going to remain a mystery.</br></br>  Johnno does his Ghost thing, he's dead as dead gets and his watch is over, Mally transplants him back into his body cuz she weak and can't resurrect shit, he shoves Longclaw up that little shit's shitter and beats motherfuckers to death with him then joins the obviously not dead Mannis who just kicked the Boltons' shit in at the night lamp, the Mannister gibs Johnno Winterfell after naming him a Stark then Bloodraven tells him to dig up the horn of winter from the crypts and bring it to Bran.<br><br>Later after some other shit happens that i'm too high right now to get into Johnno, with that fat fuck Sam's help, realizes that the CotF are remnants of telepathic ayylien scum trying to aushwitz the others before men figure out why they're important, something that the 13th LC figured out ages ago but the Starks sperged out and ruined it, he also figures out that Planetos isn't a medieval shithole but a post-apocalyptic ruin and that the long night was a nuclear winter caused by men trying to #rek the little midget faggot CotF's shit in with nukes but it went to shit and ended their civilization save for a small outpost on a shitty little peninsula that managed to preserve some of its technology and tried to rebuild the world but some weak minded high ranking valfag got worged by a CoTF and detonated their remaining nukes in the underground silos which #rekkened what little was left of pre-war civilization and now the whole world is going through an interregnum.<br><br>Also, Quaithe is Ashara Dayne and is Johnno and Danny's mom and probably knows a fuckton of pre-war shit cuz the Daynes are all up in that shit what with their composite nanotube metal-ceramic family sword and fuck knows what other tech they're hiding, the Hightowers know a bunch of this shit too, but yeah Ash-Ash Dayne is working with badboy Bloodraven to teach and prepare Johnno and Danny to be strong as fuck when they finally re-unite and kick the CoTFs' shit in once and for all with their song of ice and fire.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, meryn trant just let syrio run away. No, syrio is dead.</br>  What the fuck ever happened to Blackfish?  <br>Fuck off, the whole interregnum is Preston's worst theory. Ruins the entire fantasy aspect of the book by turning into sci-fi.</br>  <br>most likely escaped the red wedding. his body wasn't found</br>  who wants this to happen to him?  <br>This. I promise you, they are the same man. No man.</br>  <br><br>He's probably going to end up being a PoV character to reveal some things about House Reed. I see no other way of bringing Crannogmen in the current plotline.</br></br>  What's his name again?  <br>I know that feel</br>  Mark ZuckerJew, he can suck the filling out of a creme egg without disturbing the foil (or paying for it).  <br><br><br>That is American pop/country recording artist Taylor Smith.<br><br> btw, she's a gril <br><br> btw, she only likes pussy now <br><br> btw, her gf Karlie is *hawt* </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Describe your sex life using only quotes from spongebob  Take it away penny!
