[ I figured at this hour most people on /b/ would not be American, so it was a good time to ask the question.<br><br>What do you guys think of the US? The cliche here is that everyone from every other country hates us, but presumably that's not actually true. What's your personal opinion?</br></br>  <br>Fuck yeah, 'merica!</br>  <br>We're like that annoying jock in high school. You always hated him and everyone thought he was annoying. But when he asked you to hang out or actually talked to you in a class, you were BFFs.</br>  HATE YOU MOTHERFUCKING 'MERICAN FAGS....................../´¯/) <br>....................,/¯../ <br>.................../..../ <br>............./´¯/'...'/´¯¯`·¸ <br>........../'/.../..../......./¨¯\ <br>........('(...´...´.... ¯~/'...') <br>.........\.................'...../ <br>..........''...\.......... _.·´ <br>............\..............( <br>..............\.............\...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  A lot of you are cunts, but atleast you're entertaining.  <br>I work for the merchant navy, at the minute on cruise ships and i've been at the US and worked there for about 9 months in total, so you could say i've got a fair grasp on what the average american is like. And i'm sorry to say I think the overwhelmingly vast majority of you and some of the most disgusting, obnoxious, arrogant people i've ever met in all the world that i've seen so far! I can absolutely, 100% understand why you are almost universally hated. I used to think it was a cliche too, and I thought when I travelled over there i'd give you chance. Fuck that!</br>  <br>I want to live in Texas.<br> Polefag here </br></br>  <br>It's idiots like this cunt that give you a bad name<br><br><br>And to an extent, this cunt too. The problem with America is that you think you're the greatest country in the world, it's funny because 70% of you don't even have passports and have never even seen beyond your own boarders to make that judgement. It's this overwhelming sense of arrogance and unwarranted self importance which makes you the most despised people on the planet</br></br></br></br>  America to a lot of Europeans is like the village idiot winning the lottery. You can't really be mad at him for what he is since it's not his fault...but his attitude is still pretty obnoxious  my point of view, from Europe:<br>I've found most americans I've met to be really nice and welcoming (been a couple of weeks in NY and about two months around South Carolina ). At the sae time, I have the perception that most americans are pretty oblivious to what happens around the world, and are easily deceived (probly because during the decades of th cold war they were pretty much brainwashed into extreme capitalist values) wich makes for some weird shit: yay for freedom .. but lets all be slaves to big corporations. yay for free speech .. but lets censor and propaganda the shit out of everything. yay for equality .. but lets have a caste like education system etc..</br>  www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=q49NOyJ8fNA<wbr></wbr>  [ ]  have a cousin from germany who came here to study abroad one winter. he saved up some money to come back in the summer and felt more at home here than in germany. we can't be all that bad.  <br>I can see that. To be fair, the sentiment is much stronger in places like China and Korea, but it is definitely present in the U.S. In my experience it's not as overwhelming as you might think; people I talk to tend to like some countries more than the U.S. and some less, often based on naive and basically irrelevant stereotypes or political minutiae.</br>  I like the fact it's a cultural melting pot. Hate everything else about it. When people say this is the greatest country in the world, I have no idea what the fuck they're talking about.  <br>I feel like the high school jock comparison isn't a bad one. You're stereotypical jock thinks he's the hottest shit and is on top of the world, but once he leaves high school (leaves the country) he finds that the world doesn't give a fuck that he won the championship and fingerbanged Cindy after he roofied her.</br>  <br>It's called patriotism. Quit being a little bitch and love your country like it's the best in the world.</br>  <br>Well, tbf. If there was a country that warranted it, it would be the USA.</br>  <br>I agree with all these things except the censorship. There isn't really any censorship enforced in the U.S., especially when compared to Europe. There is propaganda of course, but it is all paid for; the government doesn't generally hijack the media like it does in some places.</br>  <br>Eurofag here, been to the US twice. Once on the east coast and once on the west. Your politics are fucked up but i love the people and the fact that you can find anything from around the world there. Also, your food (when eating out) is generally way better than here.</br>  <br>too fat , too much niggers</br>  AMERICA NEVER SLEEPS  Coming from an American, the majority of Americans and fucking retards. They make a bad name for the 1%, or, well, about 20 - 25%  <br>Bullshit and you know it. We don't necessarily have full on censorship, but propaganda is essentially halfway there. That anon is pretty spot on though.</br>  Ameri fag here, when I moved to the UK I gained 50 pounds... 6 months on ameri soil I lost it all and then sum. Them doner kebabs be ruining y'all  <br>Can I ask where in Europe? I haven't been to Europe since I was 8 years old (in France), so I have essentially zero basis for comparison. I find I like the food around me a lot, but at least half of it is either authentic or Americanized foreign food.</br>  <br>I'll answer you honestly, for a change.<br><br>The US people, (most of them) Iknow personally are normally educated, competitive people, pretty similar to the educated, competitive people of any other country.<br><br>The country itself is without doubt the most powerful one, for now. The arrogance you see here is just a sign of immaturity, but...<br><br>That being said, US is a major bully on other countries that could have some resource that may be needed and I'm concerned about the ignorance of the teen segment of the population.<br><br>Also US is a VERY shitty place to live if you don't have money, that could be obvious for some, but in your country if you don't have money, you don't have access to the minimal services your state should provide, like health care.<br><br>So, as everything, it's a mix, some good, some bad.<br><br>Truth is, since 9/11 Inever set a foot in US again, I prefer to go to France to do tourism.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Met a couple of really awesome americans, but also a bunch of loud annoying idiots.<br>I was at a hostel in Japan at that time and that guy kept rambling on how the discovery of the higgs boson will give us beaming technology. Fucking idiot</br></br>  Commie loving libtard radar went off.  <br>I guess we have censorship in terms of age ratings for film, radio, and TV. Those are technically voluntary, but have become industry standards. Again, it's really enforced by private companies, not by the government.</br>  <br>I have been all over the world, many first world counties included in that list of places. America is almost exactly the same. People are almost exactly the same. Good, bad, ultra shit, stupid, it's all the same people. Anyone that thinks one country is better than another or worse is a full on retard that has never been outside their tiny monkey sphere in their life and probably never will be.</br>  <br>I'd rather stick with my classic British cynicism thank you very much.<br>I don't want any of that annoying relentless optimism that Americans seem to love.</br></br>  As an american, I love this country and it's idea of freedom, but everyone in it is unbelievably ignorant. 50% of the people I talk to make me wanna slam my face into the fucking wall. That and our politics and government become more corrupt by the day. I have to say I love hate my country  I love your people, love/hate your society, and hate your government.<br><br>Probably this is 99.9% of everyone.</br></br>  Australian here. I don't like the trends it's setting in general laziness, self-entitlement and self-victimisation e.g. obesity, tumblr feminism, opposition to controversial humour. I don't like how overly patriotic a lot of the country is, nor the gun culture. I do love however its technological progress, scenery, charm and diversity. Sadly, its progress is being overshadowed by countries less plagued by extremist Christianity, like those in Asia. It's doomed if it doesn't see a fundamental cultural shift that would encourage a stronger, more productive constituency.  <br>The situation with healthcare has changed somewhat. Although some employers are still able to deny group rates to their employees, everyone is eligible to apply for means-tested health care. I.e. if the fed deems you unable to afford your own health insurance (I think the rate is either 150% or 200% of the federal poverty line), you get Medicare discounted or for free.<br><br>In other ways you are right, though. Welfare makes up the largest part of our immense budget, but still doesn't seem to go very far for people who really need it.</br></br></br>  <br>To be fair, I hold my own country in the exact same regard.<br><br>This is unlike most people, however, who refuse to hate their own government on principle even when it's as bad or worse.<br><br>No, I'm not European.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Today I will remind them.<br>Every country in the world belongs to America.<br>The moon is American too.<br>Mars soon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes. What this guy said</br>  <br>Australia seems to have imported some of these sins direct from America. Luckily not the guns, though. There are so many guns here, further restrictions seem almost pointless. What's the difference between 500,000,000 guns and 500,000,001?</br>  <br>Sadly, this is true, especially when it comes to health care. It's rediculously expensive here. Currently, I'm working a minimum wage job simply because it has supreme, very cheap medical benefits so that I don't have to pay out the ass for Obamacare. It accounts for half the paycheck of most other jobs. The Affordable Care Act is anything but affordable, and if you don't have medical care of some sort, most of it being rather expensive and rising, you pay a hefty yearly fee to the government for not having coverage.</br>  We killed Hitler you faggots. Your welcome.  <br>Like faux news?</br>  I got papers going back to the very early 1700's, I'm related to a prominent general of the Union. Fuck the south. <br><br>My family has been in this fucking country for 12 generations. <br><br>God I wish I was Canadian or Finnish/Swedish/Norwegian. <br><br>As an American oldfag, fuck this country. <br><br>WHY HAS MY LAST 7 CAPTCHAS BEEN STEAK<br><br>FFFFUUUUUUUU I WANT STEAK</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You like our diversity? Our diversity is a huge issue. It's turns out taking a ton of people from various fucking cultures and throwing them together doesn't fucking work that well.</br>  <br>Having visited china on my travels I definitely agree that the sentiment about being proud of your country is just as strong if not strong than that in the US. But the Chinese aren't nearly as arrogant about it, for them is like "Yeah, we're proud of who we are and love where we come from" and the US is like "'MURICA! FUCK YEAH!!!" <br><br><br>That's a good analogy and I feel for the 30% of them who've travelled out and saw the world that's how these people are. And that's great, those kind of American's I like! They're nice to talk too and a very friendly, curious bunch. It's like the experience of travel as humbled them into realising that america really isn't as great as they once thought and that the majority still think.<br><br><br>No it's not. It's called arrogance and there is a huge fucking world of difference. I wouldn't expect the average American to understand that though.<br><br><br>Well no. Every great accomplishment made by America was done off the backs of other nations, the entire space program was setup/run/executed by nazi scientists following ww2. And even if that wasn't the case, the average American seems to think that they had something personal to do with anything great their country has accomplished. And's just looking at the historical events, things in this day and age, freedom of the press, human development index, quality of schools, quality fo government, quality of health care etc i.e. all the things that make a country worth living in, America absolutely fails on nearly every indicator.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Perhaps I see things from another point of view because I'm not from US.<br>But I think it's the -duty- of the state to provide healthcare, not "a discount".<br><br>Yes, I think the situation is better now, Ido agree with you, it's far from be good or fair, however.</br></br></br></br></br>  This.  This might possibly be the most civil, well reasoned debate i've ever seen on 4chan. Much fucking less /b/!! Wonder how long it'll take till it descends into shitposting and smack talk?  <br>I agree with you, and public health insurance is a popular idea for a significant minority of Americans. But it isn't yet the majority, and likely won't be for years. It's considered a free market issue here, though I find it weird that everyone fucking hates insurance companies until they fear a law might harm their bottom line. Then you get your far-right wingnuts who think Obama will create death panels or whatever; you'll never win them over.<br><br><br>If only he had kept us safe for the full 8 years . . .</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why provide healthcare from the state? What is the state doing that private companies cannot? People complain about the US private healthcare sector in terms of cost when comparing to other countries, but the level of quality is not even funny when comparing to places in Europe. If you can afford it, you can get the absolute best care in the world, and if you can't afford it, you get pretty much the quality from overseas. People fail to understand that NOT EVERY HOSPITAL IS THE SAME. You CAN shop around like with any other service, and the prices do vary by a lot. If you are paying out of the ass for bad healthcare, 90% of the time it would be your fault. The 'Affordable' Healthcare Act is only going to make shit worse by attempting to slightly mimic European countries.</br>  <br>I agree, I was just going to post the same.</br>  <br>Sweden, but i have been to Greece, Turkey, Norway, Finland, Holland and Denmark. The only thing i can find somewhat similar to the US is Holland, but that's because tourism.</br>    All americans I've met irl, has been very friendly and nice people. Personally I do not hate regular americans, it's just politics I don't agree with. You guys have enormous inequality in incomes and that's not a surprise when you have only two parties, both very right wing minded, even when compared to my home country right wing parties (Finland).  <br>300 year purge overdue. genocide more natives, expand south.</br>  murican people are cool but i really dislike how jew the fuck out of everything and your brands are literally taking control of every place which is why its not fun to go to holidays anymore coz its just another mcdonalds jack and jones gamestop etcetc major brand shitfest. even your artist cunts are getting all over here ffs    <br>reference: alex jones end game</br>  <br>I like the idea of America being Australia's bigger brother (im from aus), but the more I read into your country and more I've come to learn that it's a corrupt piece of shit country, run by a bunch of reprobates. I personally have nothing against the US, but I know behind the veil, it's a shit show.</br>  Met a few americans on my travels, some good, some bad, what shocked me is how many holidays you guys get a year, seems like most of you have a job you can never stop working, 11+ hours a day, 6 days a week etc. And you get fuck all holidays, like 10 days a year or something ?    <br>It's really a question of health insurance more than healthcare in this particular debate. In most developed countries, healthcare is cheap enough relative to the GDP per capita for free public health insurance to be viable. The USA is in that category, though barely, because as you say our healthcare is substantially more expensive than comparable nations (e.g. Canada). It's not just a question of quality; you can't get good cheap healthcare here at all, even at or below the levels you can get it for free in other places.<br><br>Obamacare is not public insurance; it is a guarantee that you get a group rate for private insurance. Public insurance is like Medicare, which is extremely successful in spite of the fact that it serves the highest risk group of Americans. It has many advantages over private insurance, including driving down healthcare costs and guaranteeing standards based on need rather than margin. It is however also extremely expensive.</br></br></br>  Check em    <br>Every country has a good side &amp; a bad side.<br>unless we talk about africa, full of niggers &amp; aids.</br></br>  <br>The huge problem there though is that you're lumping all of Europe together. There is a world of difference between the quality of healthcare in places like the UK, France, Germany, all of Scandinavia where we do have some of the best hospitals in the world which is state funded (through taxes of course, nothing is truly free) and places like eastern Europe which are a little better than the 3rd world. Mimicking Europe doesn't necessarily have to be a bad thing, if you do it right.</br>  <br>Yeah, just ten federal holidays. Some states also have one or two state holidays, but not my home state of Ohio. Most jobs will give a couple of extra days, e.g. the day after Christmas, but that is by no means guaranteed.<br><br>However, hourly employees do get 1.5x overtime for every hour worked above 40 in a given week (or above 10 in a given day). Since the minimum wage is so low, some people have to work extremely long hours anyway. This is one part of the reason productivity is so high in the U.S. and people are so unhealthy.</br></br></br>  <br>only after millions of Russians and 75% of Europe was dead. <br><br>Truly if it wasn't for russia we would of lost. They thinned their supplies hard and forced alot of them to surrender.</br></br></br>  christian right wingers are straight up crazy. ive heard christians arent as passionate in europe but over here its on a next level of cringe. just scrolling through social media and seeing the shit some people post and how much they get into it its like a fucking cult. I dont know how anyone can even be that seriously christian shits exactly the same as greek mythology. religion needs to be classified as fucking myths cuz they people cray  Healthcare should not be something you can buy. Do you really think, that equal, free healthcare is socialism?    <br><br>You always get some idiots fagging everything up. Fucking idiot children.</br></br>  <br> country <br> africa </br></br>  <br>Vasemmistoliitto havaittu</br>  <br>Haha fuck had me dying</br>  <br><br>I don't hate you, I think your country has its flaws but every country does.</br></br>  <br>Except the fact that it isn't actually free, as said in the known tax debates. The AHA also messes with lower income brackets of people and the market by forcing those who are slightly too old to be on their parents' healthcare, but too young and undeveloped in the workforce to command a high salary to buy healthcare that many in fact do not need in order to help subsidize the costs of the at risk groups. This not only reduces the possible spending and saving by those younger or not commanding a higher salary, which hurts them gain wealth and possible down times, but also messes with the markets supply/demand chain by creating an artificial need of the services being offered.</br>  As an American I can confirm there's a lot of tards here. It depends on where you are in the country too. If you're in the south you'll see nothing but shit. I live in Montana and the people here are nice and welcoming. Every foreign exchange kid who came to my high school said America was a lot better than they thought it'd be. Then again they might have been afraid we'd get angry if they said otherwise  <br>Also, we are the only developed country not to guarantee (or in most cases, offer at all) paid leave to new parents (even mothers who just gave birth). We do not guarantee sick days or pensions, though every state has a system for unemployment (albeit not a very good one). We are not even really guaranteed medical coverage, since companies can opt out by paying a penalty. And no promises for breaks (e.g. lunch) or raises or basically anything you could think of. And the minimum wage for a full-time job (40 hrs/wk) covers less than twice the average rent for many cities.<br><br>Shit sucks.</br></br></br>  <br>did i mention your patriotism is exhausting?</br>  We're a bunch of dumb fucks who obsess over freedom despite most other countries having it, have an unnecessary amount of military bases in other countries, and half the politicians here are Conservative idiots.<br>We suck. Canada is a better fucking country than we are.</br>  <br>I love the states. went on holidays there in january and had a blast. Some of the cities there are unbelievable and i thought the people were really nice.</br>  <br>You seem like a faggot.</br>  <br>you seem like a faggot</br>  <br>I'm American and I fucking hate this country</br>  <br>Lazy fuck. Get back to work.</br>  I think the problem of the US is the same problem with Russia and China. They are all superpowers and their playground is the rest of the world.<br>They should all be cut down to small countries.</br>  ITT: yuropoor inferiority complex<br><br>The EU has almost double the population of USA and still a smaller GDP<br>We have the largest military budget/power of any country, by a huge margin<br><br>We're beating all you fags in both economy AND military<br>Are you guys even trying?<br><br>Stay mad<br>-America<br><br>(in before pussy apologists)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>      <br>Maybe cause most americans are asleep?</br>  <br>Healthy people who are in their late 20s and early 30s are indeed required to by health insurance to reduce the group rate. That's how group rates work. The alternative is to have people with high bills unable to pay them and people with low bills unwilling to pay them and rely on free emergency care in case of a major accident. There isn't any obviously good alternative.<br><br>To be clear, if the majority of people paying into an insurance plan did not pay more in premiums than they collected in claims, insurance could not be profitable. When you reach a point where insurance gets so expensive that healthy people start to opt out in large numbers, you end up with the untenably high rates we were seeing and a lot of people avoiding routine visits, which ends up raising costs even more in the long run.</br></br></br>  <br>I think us being so far away from pretty much any other country means we tend to not pay any attention to or know anything about other countries.<br>I'd say 75% of America isn't retarded, and of that 75% only 25% of it pull their heads out of the sand and bother to know things that they don't need for their jobs and day-to-day routine.</br></br>  <br>They talk a lot louder than the others.</br>  <br>Because I'm using reason when debating my point, trying to explain how I feel and not just throwing shit about?<br><br>Yeah. You seem like an American.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think anybody will try to argue that the USA is not the global hegemon.</br>  <br>No, you seem like a faggot. Also, you're not good at punctuation or capitalizing letters.</br>  <br>I'm mute.<br>what a shitty world kek</br></br>  I don't remember a captain Europe.  <br><br>I have noticed this. I had an American sitting behind two seats behind me on the bus and she was talking so loudly and so slowly to her friends I watched her and she was just talking normally for Americans...</br></br>  <br>Yup, still a few idiots in this thread though. They must be the teenager still up on a school night with nothing better to do than talk shit, on what up to now has been a fairly decent thread.</br>  <br>This is true. In all my travels the way I found fellow Americans was to follow the laughter. No one else in the world laughs.</br>  the fucking defensive white people in america. Ive met English people who worked in developing cities in Jamaica for years because of what England did there for fucking years. But the white people in america are so fucking defensive and pissy its like they have to defend some type of status or something like they think theyre being personally attacked because some people legitimately want change. The hypocrisy in white peoples arguments in these situations make me wanna cut my damn eyes it these people are just fucking BLIND. American men and women can never lighten up either, watch any prank video and compare america and europe. Americans get so nervous and pissy they just cannot relax. try to just shoot the shit and have a simple conversation and they have a godamn mental breakdown its pathetic. American men are just so worked up over masculinity they get defensive over nothing its amazing to watch. european dudes are just like meh whatever. <br>Im an american btw living in america atm this is my legit observation</br>  <br>butthurt german detected</br>    <br>Dude you need to lighten up bro. You seem tense.</br>  <br>Spoken like a teenager<br>Just because you don't understand how the world works doesn't mean only 25% of 75% of the entire population does<br><br><br>This<br>We deserve to have opinions and involvement with the rest of the world because we're so involved in it. Naturally everybody else gets salty and butthurt over it.<br>Personally I'd love to go back to isolationism and just focus on ourselves but we're heavily dependent on foreign trade and suddenly withdrawing from foreign politics would disrupt a lot of shit and make a whole lot of chaos.<br>People are upset with us for being so involved, people would be upset with us for being so uninvolved. We can't win. Making an effort seems like the "right" thing to do, though there will always be haters.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's a trait of the South. In the North, I haven't really noticed it, at least compared to Canada (about the same, including Montreal), the islands (BVI), or Belize. English in general as a language is spoken more slowly than Spanish or Italian (in terms of syllables per second), but conveys about the same amount of information per second. Similarly, the same sentence will take up much less room on the page than it will in French. It's just a linguistic/dialectical difference, not really a difference in attitude.</br>  <br>No just a nigger.</br>  i live in texas. as shitty as the average american may be, they're no where near as PC or weak as the average swede/brit/norwegian nowadays. you guys really lost your fucking balls since diana died eh?  <br>No, you just strike me as kind of a self-satisfied dick. I bet the people in your own country don't like you either.</br>  I'm an ausfag and we don't have much of an opinion, pretty much all of our media and trends come from the US so we don't make a big deal out of the difference between us and you, your military spending is fucking retarded though  <br>No. USSR killed and won wii.</br>  <br>This. You can watch the outrage in the world when we act. An the outrage when we don't. It gets tiresome.</br>  <br>I like america, but not your people. You are egoistic, stupid and waistfull. The only point at which you have better solutions is in creating and using technology. But to be realistic: the most innovative people do have european family-lines or are even from other countries. <br>You call yourself awesome and you live freedom, but your freedom fucks up the world by pollution, rubbish and murder. Your are twice worse than IS or North Korea</br></br>  I'm dating an US girl.<br>She went abroad young enough and I met her soon enough to broaden her view of the world but god damn her family is pure american trash.</br>  <br>I think they've got some fantastic art, literature, and music going down over there. I also think they have the best comedians in the world.<br><br>Now, shit I don't like:<br> delusions around being land of the free <br>Not anti-US, just saying it's obvious you guys aren't even in the top 5 truly free countries in the world.<br><br> hypocrisy in condemning other nations <br>Genocide of the natives; slavery; Japanese concentration camps (the only thing setting you apart from the Holocaust was the war never fucked up your infrastructure and resulted in Japanese deaths), Yet you seem to go around calling other people sick motherfuckers and style yourselves as "liberators".<br><br> mindless propaganda and patriotism <br>Conditioned from a young age to believe US is bestestest and nothing will ever change that. It's good to be proud of your country, but it's taken to such an extreme in the US that it's hard to have an intelligent, critical conversation without a large base of idiots going "SHUT UP AMERICA IS THE BEST!"<br><br> living on glory of WW2 still <br>before WW2 america wasnt that much of a superpower. that war made you guys rich, and put you on top (against russia which eventually fell). don't get me wrong, without US my country (UK) would've been up shit alley against ze germans. but you weren't the knights in shining armour you make yourselves out to be; you weren't the only people fighting the nazis. you played a big part, yes, but it wasn't like the movies.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What I don't like about the US is that your culture is built on a perception of wealth and happiness. Everything is extremely commercial in the US. Nothing is done out of goodwill and there is always some ulterior motive behind it.<br>I've been to the US three times this year alone and it never stops surprising me how oblivious some Americans are to the world around them. After visiting the US for the first time I understood how the economic crisis of 2009 could start. Everywhere you go you hear 'No credit, no problem!', 'Take these antidepressants now and feel better!', 'Have totally normal side effects from drug XYZ? We sue them!'. It kind of makes me sick. You abuse the freedom you are so proud of and have people believe they are doing the right thing.<br>I was in a supermarket in Houston and I slipped because of a broken can of coke on the floor. I didn't hurt myself but before I knew it there were 3 managers around me asking if I was ok and to please not press charges because it would ruin their family business. Of course I didn't, but it seemed terrible to me having to live in such fear all day. Just realize that everyone in the world sees Americans as a bunch of uneducated moneyblowing hambeasts. I wish I was kidding.</br></br>  <br>Must be nice to be so intelligent, getting all that from a single post and knowing absolutely fuck all about me. Yeah, I can definitely tell you're American.</br>  <br>Our military spending keeps worldwide military spending down.</br>  <br>Not sure if retarded or just bad at articulating.</br>  <br>oh<br><br>they don't exist anymore pizdet'</br></br></br>  Much Commie butthurt up in here.  <br> I wouldnt expect the average american oh god yummy cocks gobble gobble gobble <br>Maybe america thinks it's the greatest because everyone else is one big fucking goth faggot, rolling their eyes at anything optimistic and being cynical pricks for no reason and brooding in their rooms while listening to evanescence.</br></br>  <br>C'mon, you know that's not true. World War II was a massive collective effort for the allies.</br>  <br> 3 managers rushed to make sure you felt ok after falling in their store <br> fuck america <br><br>if you fell in an austrian supermarket the manager would tell you to fall right the fuck out the door the next time</br></br></br></br>  <br>preach</br>  <br>people just need to talk about this shit because honestly the white people here are straight up delusional. im seriously about to go out and murder one of these fucks because i cannot get over this shit</br>  <br>Сам пиздец тупой америкос</br>  I don't see how being a patriotic citizen could in any way be a bad thing. If anything a lot of the things everyone is pointing out about America on this thread could be said about many other countries, Germany stands out the most to me. I work along side many Germans on a daily basis and their overwhelming love for their country is just...well...overwhelming.. but as an American I respect their patriotic ways. <br><br>We are fucked up though, our younger generation is the very definition of sheep. I don't know if you guys have seen this whole race war spawning across the country but you should read the comments left by our citizens, its a bit disturbing how easily people will jump on the bandwagon.<br><br>I also think everyone in the world should have the right to own the means to defend themselves (firearms) which may come off as a typical American idiot way of thinking to a lot of Europeans and Australians but I don't see the benefits of having your gun rights stripped from you overshadowing the increased rate of crime from firearms. They are a great survival tool in both natural disasters or a man made problem (war, government control etc.)<br><br>Whatever, I think the general consensus is that we are like everyone else... we are just fun to make fun of from an outside point of view.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  A lot of people here talking about patriotism. There is obviously a lot of that here, but you also have to keep in mind that you will never hear from people who are not so nationalistic saying "I like America and other people too." It's just not as loud. No matter how the discussion goes, the people shouting "USA" will always get your attention.<br><br>It's not like everybody acts that way in person, from the right or the left. In fact, you'll hear lots of people saying "we should be more like X country" or "I'm moving to Y" (usually Canada).</br></br>  <br>Russia won the literal race to Berlin but there's no denying that America had a substantial impact on the war. The German war machine was steamrolling over Russian forces and assuming USA didn't get involved, the only way Russia could have won was by attrition. Germany and the axis was destined to run out of resources eventually and Russia would have just continued throwing bodies at them until Germany ran out of bullets.<br><br><br>Yeah, pretty much. We're assholes for getting involved yet we go unthanked for keeping the world in check, through force and peace.</br></br></br></br>  I've never been to the USA, however everyone who went there said that the people were nice and welcoming - but dumb.<br>Even average students in my class who went to the USA were the best of the whole school there. <br>All of them said that these multiple choice tests (you really have those?!) were stupidly easy and everything below A would suck hard.<br>One of my teachers who used to work in the USA confirmed that.</br></br></br>  <br>Checked<br><br>Smoke up irie.</br></br></br>  <br>Говорит здесь вашпедик !</br>  <br> cite american propaganda movie, disregards sensible arguments with facts and logical discourse <br><br>this is essentially the problem we have with America</br></br></br>  <br> shitty student goes abroad, comes back claiming to be the top of an american school <br> you believe him without any doubt <br> confirmation bias <br><br> same thing with a professor who is no longer teaching in the US <br> what is a grudge <br> xd </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>;-;</br>  <br> It's turns out taking a ton of people from various fucking cultures and throwing them together doesn't fucking work that well. <br><br>Do you even realise that's how the US was built?<br><br>Fucking hell, man.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>quads don't lie<br><br>But you know it's not just "white people," right? It's everybody. Nobody can relax when issues of race and privilege are brought up. But since white people are the most privileged race, they have everything to lose and nothing to gain.</br></br></br>  <br>Get rekt.</br>  <br>Typical American propaganda</br>  <br>Instead of throwing your toys out of the pram, why don't you trying arguing your point and joining in with his debate? I think there's two reasons why, and neither are particularly flattering; first is you're an idiot, incapable of arguing anything beyond "everyone else is one big fucking goth faggot" and other is that you KNOW, deep down he's right and you can't fucking stand that, can you?</br>  <br>Russia won the race on American steel.</br>   World War 2 <br> World War <br> World <br><br>AMERICA WON THE WAR<br><br>no.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Too politically correct, more so than England, at least we have popular parties who are willing to address problems caused by people of different skin colour<br>America has black on black and black on white violence in the thousands per month, yet every time a white cop or even just a cop kills a black person, there's riots about how racist the country is.<br>Obama got into office because he was black, Hillary's voting crowd seem to only be voting her in because she's a woman, and that's where the problem comes from IMO. America votes for novelty, not policy, at least they have been recently.<br>However, I do like the undying patriotism held by the sensible few, and how freedom of speech is actually upheld, whereas here in Bongistan, you can be arrested and thrown in the taxpayer funded rape system called prison, but it won't be so bad. At least you get looked after better than soldiers and the elderly.<br>I feel like I've started to ramble, so my bottom line is going to be that America has more cons than pros, but it does have some really attractive, yet few pros.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you seriously believe owning guns will help protect you against war or government intrusion? I cannot envision a scenario in which one of these two things happens and being one of the people who owns a gun does not make you MORE likely to be targeted and killed.<br><br>Also, the idea of a mainland invasion of the US anytime soon is totally ridiculous.</br></br></br>  you idiots realize 90% of the americans who act all self important/ignorant and shout MURICA FUCK YEAH are not being serious, they are intentionally being obnoxious to piss you off and are essentially mocking their own country and other countries views of them.  Remember that time Russia was good at sports?  Typical american propoganda: <br>1. We won Wii2<br>2. We created the atomic bomb<br>3. We created PC<br>4. We won the space racr</br></br></br></br>  <br> Also, the idea of a mainland invasion of the US anytime soon is totally ridiculous. <br><br>pretty much the idea of mainland invasion of any 1st world country ended with the 20th century, tbh</br></br></br>  This is an interesting country. I'm going to pose a serious question (on /b/, I know, right??):<br><br>The entire world despises just about every military action we take - and I'm not saying that I don't as well. However, we got to this point because we developed an economic structure which can't survive without a giant military-industrial complex. It is the reason we don't have the vast majority of the benefits that citizens throughout the rest of the Western world have - we spend so much on our military. However, this being the case it is also the case that it is largely due to the umbrella of protection that this military provided that other nations were able to spend less on their militaries, and more on their citizens.<br><br>So now, if we actually got rid of that military, what would balance out the military powers of nations like Russia and China? Would they not - in the case that the US decreased it's military to a size similar to, say, Canada or Germany's - flew their muscles, first regionally and then on a larger scale...?<br><br>Wouldn't this force other Western nations to increase the size of their militaries, either to prevent something like Russia annexing Ukraine or China annexing Taiwan? Because once Russia annexes Ukraine, it will turn its sights to the Baltic nations - sure, eventually they may decide to stop, but they certainly will not maintain their current borders.<br><br>So isn't it the case that we in America suffer - with no healthcare or secondary schooling that doesn't come with crushing personal debt, with a broken primary school system, with no social safety net....all things that are almost taken for granted in Europe - so that those countries which DO have those things, can?<br><br>If this is the case, then our ginormous military is an act of altruism. And since it's there, we can't NOT use it. If we fail to move it around, exercise it, then it will not be taken as a credible deterrent, and all the sacrifices made to have it will have been for nothing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>America World Police was satire.</br>  <br>It's fine. Pretty normal people, some cool sights (love the woods/mountains/lakes), hot chicks, decent melting pot of food, etc. Don't care for most of "their" alcohol, but that's about it.</br>  <br>I've heard the same thing about foreign schools. French schools are easy. Russian schools are easy. I mean, maybe it's true, but how would you really know? There are some very challenging schools here and some very easy ones. There are some districts with a large number of easy schools, and some with a large number of hard ones. There are some states with a large number of "easy districts" and a large number of "hard districts." And so on. And the people who travel overseas and take classes are hardly representative of the population, even if you think these specific kids were not that smart.</br>  <br> wii2 </br>    <br>what?! i thought it was a documentary!</br>  <br>Soviet Union<br>8,800,000-10,700,000 military deaths<br>24,000,000 military + civilian<br><br>United States<br>416,800<br>418,500<br><br>Germany<br>5,533,000<br>6,600,000-8,800,000<br><br>Stay salty<br><br><br>Yeah, no<br>America turned its entire attention towards the war effort and produced an absurd amount of technology and war machines, helping us dig ourselves out of the great depression<br>Russia's economy was already mediocre at best and remained pretty much the same until the formation of the USSR, and that was a bubble at best</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;6265843 <br>kek it was wwii</br>  We just cant hold all these world cups!

Everyone who I've talked to went to the 'highest' type, the Gymnasium (still nothing special tho).</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes.

Not all our schools are the same quality.</br>    <br> Too politically correct, more so than England, at least we have popular parties who are willing to address problems caused by people of different skin colour <br>Clearly you haven't heard of Donald Trump.<br><br> America has black on black and black on white violence in the thousands per month, yet every time a white cop or even just a cop kills a black person, there's riots about how racist the country is. <br>It's not about how racist the country is, it's about how racist the police are, which is not really a debatable point. Cops here are really fucking racist. Maybe it's hard to see that from across the ocean.<br><br> Obama got into office because he was black <br>His politics would have won the black vote virtually unanimously regardless of his race. Black voters already vote Democrat in a large majority, and when you add that his campaign focused on issues like poverty and education while his opponent focused on issues like tax breaks and oil, I mean what do you expect to happen? Republicans never make any attempt to win black votes. Saying he "won because he was black" is utter nonsense. You also seem to ignore all the votes he surely lost because he was black.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>George Carlin's outlook is perfect on your country.<br>You've built a reputation of laziness, stupidity and arrogance because your founders laid a beautiful future and you made a balls of it.<br><br>Your people complain of their leadership, forgetting that they put them in charge in the first place. You gave birth to the fat stereotype, and the patriotic stereotypes. You built an ego off of having a large military budget and being the bully of the world, picking on smaller countries for your own image.<br><br>Your country's controlled by the businessmen and bank owners, you elect a government, but they're not really in control; they're puppets for what the rich men really want, and you're so blind you don't even see it. You're a false democracy, and yes many other countries if not all are too, but one thing other countries do less than the US is invest less in their military and wage war against others. When will you people wake up? Wake up and realise your country is a shamble? Realise that you're being played with by the men with the money and you live, work, shit and sleep because they allow you to do it. You have no rights, USA, you have privileges.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh, I see what you mean now.<br>Yeah, even before we officially entered the war we were already providing yuropoors with a ton of resources for the war, so much so that Germany had to start attacking our merchant vessels with u-boats</br></br>  <br>I've only met one Aussie who set me off. But he was a military officer. So it may have just been that.</br>  <br>Wew<br><br>The Soviets got a large colonial empire/warsaw hile the Americans got NATO and a massive economy while losing many less people and never being bombed on the mainland. We were really just lucky</br></br></br>  <br>This is obviously true - everyone I know went to public schools mostly in a rather conservative area. <br>I've heard that the quality of the education in the USA highly depends on how much money the parents have. That might explain a part of that huge difference.</br></br>  <br> That being said every American I've ever met has been really friendly. <br><br>Britbong here. I always thought the same thing, until I realised every American I met was the kind who made the effort to travel to Europe. Those kinda people tend to be quite affable, happy go lucky, and open minded wherever they are from.</br></br></br>    <br> You also seem to ignore all the votes he surely lost because he was black. <br><br>this is a great point which is not made often enough</br></br></br>  <br>This x1000</br>  Mind numbingly stupid when it comes to gun laws<br><br> hurr i needs dis here ayssault riiifle fer huntin dem skwirrrlz <br> durr muh freedoms <br><br>No.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>women's doesn't fucking count</br>  <br>Yeah. It's much better to pretend we don't have a class system while keeping firearms out of the hands of everyone but the landed gentry.</br>  <br>I like all the entertainment you give us, but fuck i hate the country in general</br>  <br>It was an arms race you dingus. The biggest legitimate threat from Russia was that they were going to nuke us (with technology stolen from the US in the first place) but both sides knew that it would mean a nuclear war which nobody wanted.<br><br>Russia essentially tried to do what the US did during WWII, which was focusing their economy on war technology, but unfortunately for them their bubble burst and when the USSR disbanded they pawned off their defunct arsenal to the highest bidder for pennies on the dollar.<br>For a time their militaristic threat was legitimate but in the end it proved to be more of an illusion than anything.</br></br></br></br>  <br>the Enigma was German made</br>  <br>I'm definitely not saying the problem shouldn't be fixed - I'm asking if you think it's possible to radically reduce the size and scope of the US military without consequentially enlarging the militaries (and therefore the money spent on them) in the rest of the Western / NATO countries.<br><br>...and, if that happens, how will those countries maintain the standard of living and social benefits that their citizens enjoy?<br><br>How do we fix it for the US without fucking the world?</br></br></br></br></br>    Due to the crowding in your largest city, you've learned to have a pretentious (not in the posh way) and loud nature, which is obnoxious.<br><br>Due to your puritan roots, your media cannot tolerate words like fuck and shit, whilst promoting violence which mostly hurts innocents is ok.<br><br>Due to your multi-culturalism, your political correctness has run amock. Kids cannot cycle to school because the schools are afraid to get sued if they get run over - thus no exercise.<br><br>Whilst your top universities are excellent, your general knowledge is rock bottom and there is no general respect for the purposes of academia.<br><br>Due to your entrepenurial roots, you think life is about money.<br><br>Your politics make no sense: "Guns don't kill people; people do" True, but compare pulling a trigger to stabbing someone to death, and you'll realize why your murder rates are through the roof.<br><br>You're a peculiar mix of bigoted, religious, violent, loud-mouthed, saviour-complexed, money grabbing, ignorant fanatics who have way too much power</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Its just like a company<br><br>Hurr durr were the best of all be glad to work for us cunt!</br></br></br>  <br>Public (state-funded) schools in the U.S. are of a lower quality than private schools essentially by definition (why else would you pay for private school?). That doesn't mean they are all bad. In most states, schools are funded by property taxes, which means wealthy districts have well-funded schools and poor districts have badly-funded schools. You get what you pay for.</br>  <br>Automatic weapons are banned, have been banned, and will never be not banned.<br>You're thinking of "assault weapons" which is a term made up by politicians to ban guns that "look scary". I'm not making that up either, "assault weapons" are defined not by their rate of fire or bullet caliber or anything legitimate like that, instead they are defined by augmentations like weapon grips or butt stocks.</br></br>  <br>Enigma was the German code. The "Enigma machine" was the British code-cracking machine that exploited a flaw in Enigma. Calling it a "computer" is a bit of a stretch though.</br>  <br>That's a topic that's been battled over for a long time, but the NRA has a LOT of money behind it.</br>  <br>To be fair though, A LOT of black people went around with plaques and t-shirts that said "we want a black president".<br>Might have been because of his politics but its doubtful.</br></br>  <br>I think it's not really a conservative/liberal thing, more a rich/poor thing. And just random individual variation.<br><br>Though if you go to some places deep in the Bible belt, you will find schools where they won't really teach evolution. So there's that.</br></br></br>  <br>Bro. We spend more on social programs than the military. We spend more on education than the military. It's not about money spent. We won't improve the system by downsizing the military. We already pump more money into those other systems than we would get from rolling in defense spending. It's about efficiency of service and ROI. <br><br><br>But if you want to make your point scale it down. The whole world is too large a scale for most to fathom. Europe is fairly civilized now so pulling out of NATO may not make that big a difference. But, what would happen if we stopped being the protectorate of both Japan and S Korea?</br></br></br></br>  <br>The US has some of the strictest labor laws in the world. The federal minimum wage is about $8.00/hour and my state's will be $10 by next year. People like to make the claim that the big-bad-1% run this country but labor unions contribute so much more than any 1 entity.</br>  Mfw americans clap when;<br> you order a double big mac <br> your plane lands safely <br> a movie finishes at the cinema <br> twinkies on sale <br><br>Why do americans clap so much?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the second amendment isn't about hunting <br><br> you fucking retard </br></br></br>  <br>Our murder rates are through the roof as you say, because niggers are killing niggers. White America has a similar gun crime rate as Belgium.</br>  <br>The need for an enormous military declines as economic cooperation increases. It's already happening. There are many countries we could completely destroy without firing a bullet. Technology plays a role too, as we can leverage a small military with such force multipliers, we can conquer entire nations with US casualties in the double digits. Even Iraq, with one of the largest armies on Earth, was essentially powerless in the face of air superiority. I think it's already the case that our military does not need to be nearly as large as it is, though the interests keeping it so massive are not going anywhere soon.</br>  <br>No, you're not the jock, you're the delusional nerd at school who hangs out alone and thinks everyone wants to be like him.<br>In the end only your mom (UK) likes you.</br></br>  <br>Automatic weapons are not banned have never not been banned and never will be banned. And there has been exactly one crime committed with a legally owned automatic weapon since 1932. And that crime was committed by a cop who was banging on the door of a crack house while off duty with his legally owned mac10.</br>  Britbong here. I can't wait to move to America and enjoy myself. Should be there by start of 2016  <br>Also, you have no proper democracy. Due to your freemarket worship you let the market run legislation through lobbyism. You don't realise that the people can collectively put certain annoyances out of the question for all, in order that quality of foods and clothes etc. does not drop infinitely.<br><br>If you decide to put taxes on sugars and fats in food, then you would lower obesity, and your health care system could receive extra funding.<br>But you're so blinded by the idea that people can freely decide for themselves - they can, but we are social animals. And our autonomy depends on collective decision, America does not realise that. You think free choice is about being an individual doing what he "feels" like at every single moment. Rather than a society going together planning what their future will look like.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I dare you to find a source to back up the assertion that we spend more on social programs than the military.<br><br>I admit it's *possible* to make that claim if you add up ALL social programs AND don't consider the 3-letter agencies as "part of the military" as well as also leaving out the off-budget spending that goes to the military.<br><br>...and again: I'm just asking what people think would happen if our military and social program expenditures were of a similar ratio to those in say, Germany, France, Norway, Latvia, etc.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>me again<br><br>Q: are Americans really that weird about foreskins?<br><br>Q: is my accent gonna get me laid?<br><br> inb4 i am a fat neckbeard </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I like how tax dollars go towards paying government employees who then give our money to their union who then support the candidate (democrat) most likely to increase the budget of their donors department</br>  <br>When you get a name for your country I might like you.</br>  <br> Be 25 year old American <br> go to Germany, first time in Europe <br> plane lands, I applaud. <br> In German airport, take off shoes, pants, leave 3 oz sample of blood and semen in quart sized ziploc <br> "Sir, you don't need to do that.

NFA weapons (including "machine guns," which actually just means automatic weapons in this context) are regulated but not banned. To buy one, you do have to submit to a background check and register the gun. The seller is also subject to a $200 tax. But you can definitely still buy, own, and fire them legally.</br>  <br>I've noticed, as an American that has been in Europe, that a lot of the opinions I've been reading here are from people who have swallowed all of the media propaganda that we feed each other here.  is a fantastic example of that. All of you seem to see us as the people we like to pretend we are all of the time, which is just plain silly. If there is one thing that I've noticed that is really apparent in America that you don't see a lot of other places, it is that the educated people of America are twice as complacent and also twice as self-deprecating as the educated people I've met elsewhere. Like,  doesn't know anything about American gun laws, or American gun culture. Almost all of our gun violence is done by people that either aren't legally allowed to own a firearm of any kind, and almost all of our guns are owned by our ignorant, conservative hicks, and they keep them in giant gun vaults that they rarely, if ever, open. It would be more appropriate to say that America has a very large and expensive gun collecting habit. So yes, most of you are just as ignorant, if not more so, of actual American culture as we are of you and your culture. The only difference is that our media is constantly being shoved down your throats, and we are too busy consuming our own media to have any of yours.</br>  <br>Foreskins are weird, makes dicks look like fucking nematoads or some shit.</br>  <br>I'd like to see numbers on that claim.

I don't know of a place in the world where this isn't true though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  AAAMMMMEEEERRRIIICCAAAA<br>AAAMMMMEEEERRRIIICCAAAA<br>AMERICA, FUCK YEAH!<br>COME TO SAVE<br>THE MOTHERFUCKIN DAY YEAH<br>MERICA, FUCK YEAH! <br>FREEDOM IS THE ONLY WAY YEAH!<br>TERRORISTS YOUR GAME IS THROUGH, CUZ NOW YOU HAVE TO ANSWER TOOOOO<br>AMERICA!<br>FUCK YEAH!<br>SO LICK MY BUTT AND SUCK ON MY BALLS<br>AMERICA!<br>FUCK YEAH!<br>WHATCHA GONNA DO WHEN WE COME FOR YOU YEAH!?!<br><br>That being said, since Britain recently voted conservative I might be moving that direction. Depends on the outcome of the next election. No idea who the republican party candidate is gonna be, but I imagine it'll be some useless corporate puppet with a faux religion and a liars smile who will shout about fixing the economy before shipping every single job in the country off to some third world shithole while feverishly sucking the cocks of Halliburton and the Koch brothers.<br><br>The democrat nomination is obviously going to be either Bernie Sanders or Hilary, I don't know much about Bernie Sanders, but I know he's not Hilary. So that's excellent, because if Hilary isn't elected I might not actually need to emigrate.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you flash your firearm around, yes it will get you targeted. Same with wearing a bulletproof vest or camo. There is also the difference between living in a rural area and a highly populated city. In my case, I can simply hike up into the mountains with a bug out bag and my rifle. I would rather be armed in either situation, especially during the event of an economic crash leaving this country full of desperate people who can't fend for themselves and are willing to kill others to survive. You can't always expect everything to stay on track and I'd love to see you hunt with your spear, its not as easy as you'd think. <br><br>You call us delusional for wanting to be prepared for such situations, I call you blind to current events.<br><br>there is huge racial tension, our government just fast tracked the TPP which, once in place, will cause mass mayhem... and our economy is so fragile right now that one good natural disaster could literally put us into a 3rd world state. A firearm is something I could survive without, but would rather have it than not have it when needed. <br><br>Plus, at least in America... our criminals will still find guns. We still find heroine, meth, cocain, DMT and so on. Plus you can make your own weaponary if you have the ability to follow a youtube video or even just common sense. <br><br>If America went to shit, who would open their lands to us? No one. So as someone who thinks logically I'd say being stuck on a continent filled with a bunch of over-privileged-never-having-had-to<wbr>-go-through-a-hardship-greater-than<wbr>-driving-to-Walmart citizens...yeah...I want my gun.</wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Smegma is fuckin nasty.</br>  I don't _hate_ the USA, but I hate its ego. They're always going on about freedom they don't have, their culture is nonexistent and its political system is shit.<br><br>I've been there a few times, nice for a vacation, but I'd never live there.</br></br>  Also for everyone who isn't an American ( FUCK YOUR U.S. CITIZEN BULLSHIT I'M AMERICAN MOTHERFUCKER GET USED TO IT BITCH )<br><br>Link related<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Ihn<wbr>UgAaea4M</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>The moral of the story is that when people say MERICA, FUCK YEAH! They're being ironic.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fair enough, I was misinformed.<br>However they are still highly regulated, extremely expensive, and require a lot of hoops to jump through, including an extensive background check by the FBI and approval from local law enforcement agencies.<br><br>It's mostly to allow the legalities of manufacturing them for military/police and not so much for average joes to carry them down the street.</br></br></br></br>  <br> thinks $8/hr is a "strict" minimum wage <br> thinks comparing a single corporation to 23 unaffiliated national trade and labor union conglomerates is in any way meaningful <br> thinks these numbers mean anything after Citizens United <br> thinks he can get away with pretending "the US has some of the strictest labor laws in the world" when he knows it is provably false </br></br></br></br>  <br>because that works well for you right?</br>  <br>i don't know where americans get this from<br><br>i've never had a problem with smegma in my foreskin cause, you know, i wash more than once a week...<br><br>longest i've gone without showering since puberty is maybe 3 days, and even then - nothing</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>as an american living in bongland I can tell you with confidence that:<br><br>1 - American girls will scream and run when they see your cock<br><br>and<br><br>2. your accent will not only get you laid, it will make most americans think you are much smarter than them and will do or buy anything you say to them<br><br> yes, americans really ARE that dumb </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think American culture and its values faded out completely at some point in the 90s. Now it's just a parody of what it used to be. Then again, that goes for most of western society. <br><br>America between 1945 and 1985 is incredibly fascinating.</br></br></br>  I hate America for what they did to Japan, Vietnam and the German Soldiers after WWII. <br>Every war crime is justified as long as they do it. You will never hear an American apologize for any nuke testing, village massacre, etc.</br>  <br> 1 - American girls will scream and run when they see your cock <br><br>why?</br></br></br>  <br>this is why we hate you</br>  <br>P.S.: Also nuke the Middle East.</br>  <br>The federal budget is open source. It's posted on Wikipedia FFS. Defense spending makes up a quarter. Over a half goes to social programs. And NIP spending is &gt;$50b.</br>  <br>Your lack of humor is why we hate you.</br>  <br>Shit I Nuke Test errrday</br>  also, what is wrong with socialism? look at norway, they were led by a democratic socialist party from early 2000´s to 2012, and they are doing fucking great. They went through the 2008 crisis with almost no trouble at all due to running a different economical program for the industry than almost all other countries (and keep in mind almost all these other countries had more capitalistic governments). only downside of socialism is libtards that want "muh equal rights, muh diversity"  <br> What do you guys think of the US? <br><br>The best way I can explain it is, how do you feel when you watch COPS? <br><br> Omg, these people are real? <br> How can there be drugs EVERYWHERE?  <br> Minorities sure love to steal.  <br> Look at that chubby cop run. <br> Man I'm sure lucky I don't really have to deal with any of that shit.  <br><br>It's entertaining, but it's also kind of sad. <br><br>This is what reading American news feels like for Europeans. We love laughing at a mostly white, English-speaking people who manage to have shitty literacy, too much religion, has to get in debt if they break a leg and go to war against people who kill less Americans than American cops do. <br>Then we remember all that military spending, the spying and how we all kind of have to suck your dick anyway, and we cry a little inside.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is pretty accurate to my experience.</br>  <br>because anteaters are scary</br>  <br>That's an odd thing to say. I'm not American, but the German prisoners weren't treated that badly. The Soviets were animals, though, and killed hundreds of thousands of German POWs.<br>Nuking Japan actually saved lives in the long run, while the actions in Vietnam have been greatly exaggerated as a result of movies. While there were massacres and rape in Vietnam, they were mostly isolated incidents, and not common occurences.<br>People also seem to forget that North Vietnam committed genocide on their enemies, killing millions of civilians.</br></br></br>  <br>I try my best to imagine that America doesn't actually exist and that the world is just Europe, when that fails I realise how much I hate America.</br>  <br> I dare you to find a source to back up the assertion that we spend more on social programs than the military. <br>https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/de<wbr>fault/files/omb/budget/fy2014/asset<wbr>s/budget.pdf<br><br>Go to page 193. As you can see, we spend more on Social Security alone than on defense; however, that comes from a separate trust so it isn't really comparable. But means-tested welfare (Medicare and Medicaid in particular) still easily outweigh defense.<br><br>IDK about the education figure. He's probably talking about state/district/individual spending at that point, because I'm sure the federal government does not spend more on education than on defense.</br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>Because some guy named Kellog ( of questionable relation to the cereal guy ) hated masturbation so he pushed the Jews practice of circumcising babies and now like 80% of the american population is circumscribed, so bitches here have never seen uncircumcised cocks.</br>  <br>We used to spend A LOT more on military spending, but it only makes up ~16% of the federal budget of 2015, which is considerably less than the total 60% we are spending on medicare, unemployment, medicaid, etc etc. https://www.nationalpriorities.org/<wbr>budget-basics/federal-budget-101/sp<wbr>ending/<br>The spending on education or energy is pitiful, and medicare/aid is not exactly as useful as it is bloated, unwieldy, and expensive, but we've got room to improve regardless, so fuck it.</br></wbr></wbr></br>  Come to straya, and eat some fukn vegemite m8  <br>You completely missed what he said. You cannot legally buy an automatic gun in the US. You can buy a single-fire AK-47 or whatever, but you cannot buy an automatic one. I grew up around gun-toting conservatives, I should know.</br>  <br>Personally I'm an europoor, and I strongly believe we should all be hacked into pieces, boiled and turned into a massive pulp of organic matter, which is then processed and transported into America to be used as fertilizer. To grow potatoes or whatever the fuck they want.</br>  <br>One day, we will be lucky enough to invade and destroy all of those shitty yuropeen countries.<br><br>It will be fun.<br><br>But seriously, are many Europeans ignorant enough to mass generalize like that?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>kek<br><br> mfw americans are owned by jews so much that even their dicks are jewish </br></br></br>    <br><br>Straya ftw m80</br></br>  <br>Fuck off. Norway isn't socialist. Like most countries in the western world, we're somewhere between socialism and capitalism.<br>Furthermore, Norway is successful because it's a small white country full of white people (though that's changing). You can't really compare a homogeneous society of 5 million white people, to a massive country like the US, with 300 million people, where a third are minorities.</br></br>  <br> You cannot legally buy an automatic gun in the US. <br>That is simply wrong. Look it up. You can legally buy fully automatic weapons (which the NFA calls machine guns) if you submit to a background check and register them.</br></br>  I picture yrop as a bunch of whiny nerds claiming to not care about america but then gets obsessed with everything we do.  <br>Thats what smericans do slways</br>  <br>There's a reason we export our labor to China.<br>As far as comparing to other first-world countries, we're about on par.<br>The point is that American workers have it pretty well off. It doesn't take a genius to restock shelves at walmart but they still receive pretty good compensation for accomplishing such menial tasks. Starbucks employees earn $10/hour and medical benefits to fucking brew coffee (though these are not required, the Starbucks corporation provides that out of the goodness of their hearts).<br>If someone isn't happy with the way their company treats them they are more than welcome to find another place to work because there are 3 people waiting to take the spot. And labor laws hardly ever get less strict, they typically get more strict, which means it's only getting better.<br><br><br>Fundamentally I'm against socialism because I live in a nation of moochers and takers. If everyone made an effort to pull their own weight in society it wouldn't be so bad, but I know first hand that people take advantage of the system just to accomplish the bare minimum (or less) on the backs of the people who do their part. Therefore socialism would better benefit the people who don't deserve to be taken care of at the cost of the people earning their own keep.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I've worked with exchange students going to all parts of the US, and every year we get complaints that the school does not allow the students to cycle to school because they are afraid of a lawsuit. Actually a lot of average European behaviour is inhibited for the exchange due to the fact that they're afraid of lawsuits in the US.<br><br>Your educational culture is based on tests, and foster very little ingenuity. In my country, Denmark, 11% percent of the people who take normal teacher's education are sent abroad as consultants to Asian and American companies teaching them how to think for themselves, because they haven't learned from school. <br>So although it's getting better in the US (and Japan), and although you defnitely have a lot of entrepeneurs, your education still fosters conformity and yet you make little collective decision with regard to inhibiting the "free market".<br><br>Denmark where I'm from, is currently declining toward xenophobia and conformism due to a shift in government, so I won't defend it too much. But life here is definitely not about money, too any large extendt. You're paid for studying, health care is free (there also politicians fighting for free psychological therapy to those in need now) and everyone has a right to a home. Which means that we can concentrate on many other things, and thus DK has been declared the best country in the world for entrepeneurs by several of the big think tanks (even the American ones). So not thinking about money and democracy, is healthy for the politics and the economy</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Then you are the only worthy yuropoor I have ever encountered.</br>  I see the US as the epitome of a nation of excess. You guys can't fucking live simple lives, everyone wants fame, your people are uneducated as fuck, its about short term happiness. Selfishness, greed, fuck I could go on. Not saying every other country doesnt have this shit, just saying, USA is the best example of a people whose heads are so far up their own asses, they aren't even living in a real world.  [Austria]<br>In my opinion most of the Americans you meet are pretty nice, but i only meet them on vacation so idk if they are nice all the time.<br>But the economic system of the USA is just a big pile of shit! "The American Dream" won't work; the gap between poor and rich only gets bigger and you should really look at north Europes economy system, like Sweden. <br><br>But that was only my opinion.<br><br>If you ask anyone from Europe (Westeurope; Balkan is fucking retarded) you can clearly see that if there would be a war between Russia and America, nearly all countries would help America even if we are just your slaves. In the news there is always said how dumb Russia is and that Murica is the protector of Freedom USA USA USA<br><br>Btw I knew you were/are spying on us before Snowden, because it is soooo obvious...<br>And there is no thing that america doesn't want to know</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>In Texas you're allowed to hunt with them.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>this is why we hate you</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The Feds don't spend a lot on education. I was talking about state and local funding. And when we add in private funding for education the amount spent doubles that of defense.</br>  <br> One day, we will be lucky enough to invade and destroy all of those shitty yuropeen countries. <br> It will be fun. <br>You guys can't go to war against brown people who HATE you without losing more soldiers to suicide than combat, what do you think will happen if you try to invade people who speak decent English and have watched all the same movies as you?<br><br> But seriously, are many Europeans ignorant enough to mass generalize like that? <br><br>I guarantee you that the average European knows a lot more about the US than you know about Europe. <br><br> Captcha select all hamburgers </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>All he's proving is that he's as ignorant as the Americans he's making fun of. People are like that, European or American: ignorant.<br><br>I'm European, and there are many things that I don't like about American society. However, unlike the majority of my European peers, I don't blindly trust left-wing representation of America that we through the news and through Hollywood. If you ask almost any European who's critical of the US about his opinions, he'll simply parrot the same shit as every other person. There's no place for research or independent opinions, and they more or less copy the mindset of a left-wing democrat.<br>It's sad, especially when they end up being the very stereotypes they think they're criticizing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Jews didn't do this. Puritanical Christians did. Jews just came up with the practice that Puritans used to (try) curtailing masturbation. <br><br>I don't blame the jews for this. I blame Christ-insanity.</br></br></br>  <br>Of course, it's not like technology will remove the need for the military altogether. But it increases the power of a force. A thousand people operating drones are going to have an advantage over a thousand people with AK47s staring at the sky. Ultimately, an equally-matched force with superior technology ought to be cheaper than one with inferior technology. Otherwise it's useless.</br>  <br>Why, I wouldn't mind being spared. But at your mercy, obviously.</br>  <br>Finally someone fucking notices the scenery.</br>  <br> 70% of you don't even have passports and have never even seen beyond your own boarders <br><br>I'm 28 and haven't even left my state. Being a poorfag sucks.<br><br>That said, nationalism also sucks. I imagine most people in other countries are just like me: poor slobs just trying to make a living and not get caught up in other people's problems. I see no reason to hate them just because my government wants me to.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> What's your personal opinion? <br> pro <br>movies<br>Technology<br>im not from murica<br><br> cons <br>the rest</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm not on the bandwagon, that's so mainstream. I'm on the anti-bandwagon. </br>  <br>You are unbelievably paranoid and out of touch.</br>  <br>Nigger that ain't Nationalism that's tribalism, and fucking everyone does that shit in one way or another.</br>  <br>You sound like my father, who was an undereducated, overworking, politically backward man who spent thousands of dollars, even after government assistance from federal and state, for me to go to a university for reasons he can't really explain. Tried to sell me Ayn Rand. Do you like Ayn Rand too, anon?</br>    <br>German here. For me the USA is like a pretty decent reality TV show. Entertaining to say the least.</br>  I don't even need to care who's country is richer. I as an individual am wealthier than the average murican.<br>So my quality of life is better than yours. Eat that, savage American.</br>  <br>God why don't you go live in a cave you fucking tin foil head. Bad shit happens year after year it doesn't mean there's going to be an apocalypse.</br>  <br>What's wrong with our gun laws? Seriously. Idk how the fuck you guys feel comfortable when your government can have weapons but you can't.</br>  <br>Oh. Well, I went a public school in Texas so you'll have to forgive my ignorance.<br><br>I'm just trying to say that I'm not a flag waving douchebag who thinks America is #1 supah powah yeah yeah yeah. I just happened to be born here and in such a shitty situation that I never got to travel and see the world.<br><br>Euros are lucky. You guys can hop on a train and see several countries without too much hassle.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And you're a fucking asshole for wasting your dad's money.</br>  <br>Yeah, fuck critical thinking.<br>Good job acting exactly like the stereotype of Americans that you love to hate though.</br></br>  <br>When I was a teenager I hated the US, mostly because I perceived them as arrogant (which is ironic considering I'm a frenchfag).<br><br>Nowadays, I like the country, I think people got less narcissistic and more humble, and the only amerifats I hate are the deluded retards denying actual data and statistics pointing out that in comparison with Europe, their country gets absolutely shitty ranks in quality of life, education, healthcare, wealth distribution, poverty rate and a lot more.<br><br>Beside that, I'm quite okay with the US, and happily host a fair share of Americans at home.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Sorry meant for</br></br>  <br>Yeah. It only takes 13 hours to cross your shitty state.</br>  <br>A self-hating American isn't any better than a rabid nationalist. You can love your country without being a flag-waving caircature.</br>    Anyone remember Shezow?

Looking at a female, saying 'hi' to a female, farting louder than a female, a male spreading his legs on public community busses, not to agree with a woman, wearing a shirt you got from your gf, and all that other shit the feminazis come up with is also not, I repeat is also N-O-T, rape. No fucking way! Those things may be issues in discussions, but in no way is it rape. If feminazis could just talk about those things as issues in stead of crying rape, it would be much easier to listen to them.<br><br>But the thing is:<br><br>They can't do that because of the mental melt-down in their brains.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You didn't place a trigger warning on that.

Feminists have w-a-y too many theories. One of which their feelings are more important than the written law.</br>  Sort of related, but what's really starting to annoy me lately is white women who blame white men specifically for all the world's problems. Like white women weren't sharing in the efforts of slavery, segregation, and general suppression and oppression of other races by whites. As a white dude I can accept the historically fucked up shit the white dudes before me were responsible for, but how do these layyyyyyyydes think they can squirm out of the blame? It's bullshit.  <br>I believe the government owes me 500Mil. in Tax refunds.<br><br>I mean I can't be wrong here, right? Guys?</br></br></br>  <br>2000%MAD <br>2000%MAD<br>2000%MAD</br></br></br>    <br><br>implying in countries where capitol punishment is practiced you wouldnt get killed for raping an 11 year old</br></br>  <br>I am triggered now.</br>      <br>Whenever feminists do retarded shit they're not "real" feminists.</br>      <br>Fucking wow good job legal system</br>  <br> &gt;&gt;/triggercounseling </br>    <br><br>Except they consume slots that other's can fill by existing and failing you fucking moron.<br>Not to mention their attempts are all on the Marine Corps fucking dime, flights to Quantico and all.</br></br></br>  <br>And yet they are held in high esteem by feminists.<br>These women will almost always stick up for eachother regardless if they're ignorant or right or wrong. They believe every battle is a battle against women that needs to be women, as opposed to a battle against an individual women who is, quite frankly, blank as a piece of paper. And then they write together in their forums, or join local gatherings and keep bouncing their stories and opinions off of eachother making them more pent up and isolated from differing points of view. It's kinda like church or institutionalized religion, really. Or any political party gathering. <br><br>And that's not the worst. Forget that there's actual a hidden agenda behind the modern wave of feminism, just like there was a hidden agenda behind the first wave- Or you think Rockefeller threw all that money in support of the first wave because he wants the betterment of women or because he was compelled to. Please. <br>And today it is a cold war between the sexes, between misandrists and misogynists, who are but a small fraction of the populace, while the rest of us are stuck in the middle and some of us are distracted by either side. Divide and conquer. You can't suck the people dry when they are united under the same agenda.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I would suck all the dildos in the world to get the chance to beat her to death with that award. <br> absolute madman </br></br>    <br> triggercounseling </br>      <br>That is the top proof for me that you only require a loud voice and a little bit of persistent nagging to achieve anything, even if just superficialy.</br>      <br>'wildebeest' caught me off guard, got a hearty laugh out of that one</br>  <br>Strangely the thing that angers me most about this one is the comment "A true humanist is a feminist. Period."<br><br>Bitch, you already put the period in there, that's how you ended the sentence.<br><br>I think I'm just growing numb to all the feminist bullshit, but general stupidity still gets me riled.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>if they find out that they have a averagely higher number of recruits they will increase respective budget<br>and in the end it's the military that wants people to try hard to become marines or whatever<br>they are grateful for people trying to do it</br></br></br>      <br>I've heard about that before. It's amazing how some people say that it has no impact on sexual function and should be allowed. You're cutting off the foreskin of somebody a few hours old whose pain receptors get overloaded incredibly easily. That's why the kids stop crying during the process, they actually get so overwhelmed that they are unable to effectively process the pain anymore. They're only a few hours old, so it doesn't matter, though. According to feminazis that is. And chopping off the tip of a sex organ supposedly doesn't have any negative effect, according to a feminist "friend".<br>Shit like this pisses me off.</br></br>  <br>I love instant crush</br>  <br> only require a loud voice <br>She, or more accurately, her boyfriend have some con-artist skills.</br></br>  <br>No you fucking moron they won't. I'm directly going into this field and many people's dreams have been destroyed because of the budget. We are currently downsizing the military and it is harder than ever to attend OCS.<br>Stop bullshiting out your own fucking ass for once and swallow the fact that you don't know what the fuck you're talking about.</br></br>  Is there an actual clip of this?<br>Looked on yt but it seems to be removed from the full clip</br>    <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=v6m<wbr>MpE8AaA0</wbr>  [ ]<br>whole thing</br></br>      <br>i never know what the fuck i talk about, that's the reason i go to 4chan<br>BUT<br>if murrica downsizes their budget, BUT has a higher number of applications for higher qualified jobs, they might just consider to remove some more lower slots in order to get more quality for the same money they spend right now</br></br></br>  <br><br> Looked on yt but it seems to be removed from the full clip </br></br>  <br>Exactly that is what the whole show is.<br>This is all con, everybody seems to try to get to the top in no time and at all costs.<br><br>It looks as though the more stupid you act the more successful you will be. You just need to draw attention, the rest is done by others.<br><br>Also no regards for the ultimate price that will be paid by everyone involved and by most uninvolved.<br><br>Good thing I can only laugh about shit like this. Internaly I am dead already so what the hell.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think the woman in that picture is committing psychological rape on me.</br>  <br>I really, really, really hope that the next man lets the door go, so she walks straight into it and gets a big black eye, I promise here and now, that I will do exactly that if I ever get a chance.</br>  <br>Dude, that's not even your fault. <br>I'm black and I have no sense of vengeance towards any whites. Our past is fucked up, but we can't blame white men for something their ancestors did. All we can do is learn from our mistakes and grow from it. It's bullshit that any of you should feel guilty for what your great great grandparents might have done. You can't blame a child for their family's past. That's just petty and low.</br></br>    <br>Suppose that the female firefighter that didn't pass the course is responsible for several deaths because she can't so the job. I just wonder how much money the city of new York is going to have to pay out to the family when it's revealed she couldn't pass the minimum standards</br>  <br>my hero</br>    <br>She never mentions said 'healthism' in the video. I think the image maker added that in.</br>  <br>Shit she's kinda hot in a freeky way like yolandi</br>  <br>She does, actually. I watched the video. https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=v6m<wbr>MpE8AaA0</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Oh my bad. I must've missed it. I was mult tasking while watching that on the side</br>  Feminism is the biggest logical fallacy of all time. From circular logic, to genetic and everything in between. Ever see the RAINN statistics? Cherry picking at its finest. Anyone with a brain would check all major data sources and form their opinion from that. Logic would work against feminism if not for constant hamstering.<br><br>What they should be aiming for is TOLERANCE. As in, "I will TOLERATE you, simply because you're a human being with feelings, thoughts and dreams, too." Not ACCEPTANCE which is a step above it. Such as, "OMG that's awesome, so great for you! You go on being awesome!"<br><br>I bet if you were to walk through a mental asylum and then a feminist rally in the same day, you'd never be able to tell the difference between the mental patients and the feminists.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Also no regards for the ultimate price that will be paid by everyone involved and by most uninvolved. <br><br>Pic very related.</br></br></br>  I dunno why I read these threads before I go to sleep, makes me seethe  Unlike a lot of you here who only hear stories of it, I was actually falsely accused of rape and spent a month in jail during the process. I still ended up having to take a plea for a simple assault and probation for a year.<br><br>After all of that I still can't agree with what you guys are saying. Rape culture does exist maybe not how its presented by the media. Something like groping or touching her ass might seem innocent but the implications are what can that lead to. More women are afraid of being raped or abused than men are of being accused of such. That fear is real and to downplay that fear is kinda fucked up. Feminism is NOT a problem, all it means is equal rights for women. There are bad feminist just like there are good feminist.</br></br>    <br> they might just consider to remove some more lower slots in order to get more quality for the same money they spend right now <br>You clearly don't understand the Marine Corps.<br>The fact that they get fewer slots makes them want a more proficient and squared away Corps. <br>Just shut the fuck up, honestly you have no idea how this shit works and the knowledge is literally a few clicks of the keyboard away.<br>I'm not going to keep telling you that you're fucking wrong, but you're fucking wrong you dumb nigger.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shit, I've got some mad "heart pumping blood for me" privilege.</br>  <br>pls be real</br>  <br>*nods respectfully towards you*</br>  <br>It's only bad if it happens to a girl.<br><br>I've actually seen people say this.<br><br>I want to throw my PC out the window.</br></br></br></br></br>      <br> I bet if you were to walk through a mental asylum and then a feminist rally in the same day, you'd never be able to tell the difference between the mental patients and the feminists. <br><br>That made my day. I bet he is right all the way.</br></br></br>  <br>Their hats look so silly</br>  <br> go to bake sale as a man <br> say you identify as a woman <br> ???? <br> PROFIT </br></br></br></br>  <br>I believe that if male circumcision is going to be legal, so should female circumcision, which is actually just the removal of the clitoral hood.</br>  <br>Paid shill.</br>  <br>Not even that much. Too much for your brain anon?</br>  <br>The worst is when you encounter them in the wild. I just laugh at them and walk away. Or I let them have their spiel (and act interested) and after say.. <br><br>'Umm yes that makes total sense.... if you don't bother to think about it in the least.'<br><br>They are probably the worst group of people in civilized existence.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Finally, a heart warming story with a happy ending<br>One less psycho cunt in the world.</br></br>      <br><br>  ▲<br>▲ ▲<br><br><br>i kekd</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think he literally keeps needing to post or he'll die of retardation.</br>  <br>topkek</br>  <br>wow, this one's pretty disgusting though</br>  <br><br>They are trying<br>and failing<br><br>Besides, you can "let" fish climb trees all you fucking want that doesn't mean it's ever going to reach the top.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>... This is truer than you may think. Some of my peers would believe anything a professor says. And when the three or four old fucks call them out the class looks at us like we are aliens. <br><br>Young adults can be deceptively stupid.</br></br></br>  <br>well, i'm way past my third beer, so yes</br>  <br>So he has tay sachs?</br>  <br>ALL.

Call me sexist or prejudgemental, etc. But when you grow up, get some experience, live around females, then come back, you'll agree. They seem very composed but thy're nervewrecks when you get to the bottom of it (With some outliers, ofcourse) which is evident in these examples of feminist extremists statements and ideas. <br><br>Where I'm going with this is that, she may have gotten modded to seem less attractive. But she undeniably is still attractive to some guys out there. Which just begs the question; <br> Was it really worth it you vapid woman. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>WOOOAHH THIRD BEEEERR WATCH OUT FOR THIS BAD BOY.<br>Are you twelve?<br>Make sure to give someone your keys man!<br>THREE BEERS!</br></br></br></br>  <br>Vastly underrated post.</br>  <br>Nobody with 2+ digits of IQ disagrees with the reality of male-on-female rape, the problem is the idea of hiding or belittling the reality of false accusations. False accusers are often let off for free just to avoid seeming like doing otherwise would "deter women from reporting it when it truly happens."</br>  <br>I believe neither should be topless in public.</br>  <br>Whatevs, I proudly advocate the socioeconomic advancement of women. There are feminist theories I believe in some I don't. I have my own view I carved out. reverse-sexism does not exist and I can argue against it. Unlike you, I enjoy a pretty healthy social life and love life.</br>  <br>again - heavily simplifying the problem - women DO have arms and legs, the only thing they could possibly lack would be body- and musclemass<br>that just means they have to train even harder, but they can make it</br></br>  <br>Murrica and their fucking laws</br>    <br>Kim Jong Un is leading feminism to destroy America, confirmed.</br>  <br>yea, guess i'm hardcore<br><br>feels pretty damn gangsta to focus on getting an engineers degree instead of drinking all year</br></br></br>  <br>I hope he has a designated driver</br>  <br>murica?<br>so true if you study physics.wait no,its not.idiot.</br></br>  <br>autism</br>  <br>Women that claim false rape should face the same punishment that men do after commiting legitimate rape. <br><br> I get that you are a fucking dolt, but feelings should not supercede objective law.  <br><br>I.e. you commit a crime, you are punished for it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A lot of Europe is affected by it too, like Sweden, France and the UK.</br>  <br> hurr durr, beautifull </br>  <br>This is a story that has been told for ages with different people being the general.

They're out of their parents and can do what they want. They experiment. Try lots of different guys, dicks, situations, drugs, etc....

Ever since I was ten years old, far too young to understand "the evils he stood for." <br><br>When the schools began preaching against him, I became wildly defensive. All my school reports and speeches were aimed at clearing his name. <br><br>I learned much about him, the liberation of his people, and his amazing accomplishments in science, infrastructure, economics and industry. <br><br>My reports were often graded harshly, even with citations. I myself come from mixed German ancestry (grand parents came to America post WW1, from Austria. Grandmother's cousin was in Hitler youth) so I felt it was close to home. Part of understanding where I came from. They moved to US because the treaty of Versailles forbid their country from uniting with Germany. As as the German economy flourished, and Poland began exterminating the German speakers, they moved to America for the sake of their children. <br><br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/626573264#p626573264">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>americans covering up their own war crimes says little about wherever or not the gernan ones are legit or not. the allies won the war of course they cover their own shit up. they also bombed civilians even obviously civilian targets like farms etc. intentionally.</br>  <br><br>OP another video from that old german woman where she speaks english, she is without a doubt a very intresting woman.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=J1C<wbr>VP97g-Uc</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  the more evidence someone comes forward with, the bigger your conspiracy will just get.<br>Testimony-&gt; oh he's a jew DON'T BLIEVE IT<br>Footage-&gt; it was staged by the JEWS<br>No point bringing evidence to someone who has denied all evidence in the first place<br>Let them live their Aryan wet dream in their little corner.</br></br></br></br>  Would you still fuck her if she looked like this?  <br>Just started watching the first episode<br> What. <br> Da. <br> Fuck. <br>It's just a cartoon about fatsos and food.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Aaaaand suddenly erect.</br>  <br>Continued watching.<br><br>Does the Mexican kid have autism?</br></br></br></blockquote>]
