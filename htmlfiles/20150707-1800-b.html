No more pizza 4 me pls</br>  <br>Pussy?</br>  Sword Art Online changed my life. If you want to talk shit about the show go ahead. This show has helped me in more ways than one. Fuck all the people who hate this anime. I love Sword Art Online to death and will always love it until the day i die. I will show this anime to my children and grandchildren because that is how much i love the show.  neat  <br>just watch .hack//SIGN instead.</br>  <br>Regardless of the bait I genuinely enjoyed the first season and plan on finishing the second</br>  babies first melodrama. its ok mine was clannad.  I liked it a lot until all the fairyshit happened. Then it was meh  <br> my children and grandchildren <br> implying <br>kek</br></br></br>  <br>Log Horizon is a better show in every single way. I used to like SAO until it turned into generic romance harem shit.</br>  I stopped watching after that cancer girl died. That whole part about her was fucking boring. Does it even get better after that or is that just it? Whole show ends with this random girl with cancer dead.<br> watched show <br> got into cancer girl  <br> boredasfuck.jpg <br> stop watching bc it got fucking gay stupid about random throw in character </br></br></br></br>    <br> cancer <br>What? Are you talking about the bitch with actual AIDS?</br></br>  SoA is like Hello Kitty compared to Naruto.  <br>Naruto is the best anime ever amirite<br><br><br>UP TOP</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Clannad <br> melodrama <br><br>ISHYGDDT</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't give a fuck what she had. She killed the show for me with her boring ass sob story. All they did was cry and it was a waste of time</br>  <br>That was the end of the season if I'm correct. I agree it was overdone. It's become a drama instead of action like I hoped it would be.</br>  <br>Yeah it was way over done. Try Fairy Tail, that what I'm watching and its great. 10/10 recommend. &amp; you don't have to wait for episodes for a long time bc they already have so many out</br>  <br>Everything but GGO and part of SAO was utter shit, Asuna is a huge pussy, even Sinon was turned into fap material, the story took a back seat to fanservice</br>  A public service announcement:<br><br>Of the two current seasons out. Each has 2 parts. Of the 2 seasons there are 4 parts. 1st and third are good. SAO and GGO are awesome, elfhiem and RL bs are blah. Check out 1 and 3 eff 2 and 4.</br></br>  <br>I've watched up to episode 120ish of Fairy Tail. At some point around episode 100 I just lost fucking interest. It's so god damn repetitive. I'm currently getting my fill of edgy comedy by watching Soul Eater.</br>  <br>Fairy Tale is fine until you realize it's like 400 episodes of the same fucking plotline over and over until you want to hit Natsu's friendship with fucking sledgehammer</br>  <br>I got into an argument with a friend who was convinced ALO was season two. He did not want to understand that the first season is 24 episodes, and the second season is 24 as well. he was convinced it was 4 12 episode seasons. Fucking retards.</br>  <br>Aha I know what you mean, im mainly watching for the boobs now anyway ;) I'll check out that one too tho</br>  <br>the main fucking villan for half the show is a fucking butterfly. Just watch venture Bros for that shit.</br>  <br>You want boobs watch Sekirei</br>  <br>oh god the second season is a total fucking mess. but i blame the source matrial for that</br>  <br>I'll note that one down too ;)</br>  <br>Correct on you but at the same time they kinda are different seasons. I wish they did split them.</br>  <br>Muh nigga.<br>still waiting for that final fucking season.</br></br>  <br><br><br>I was watching Fairy Tail, dubbed. So far it's at the end of the first series with the 2014 series staring in the fall I think.<br>The Grand Magic Games are hype as fuck.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I've completely run out of good ecchi to watch. Theres very few animus that I can watch unless theres constant tits. Unless theres a good story, that's all anime is good for in my book.</br>  <br>yeah. i agree with this guy. TO be completely honest, SAO gets WAY more credit than it should by fanboys with an unwavering unquestioning support</br>  <br>Anon what the fuck are you talking about?</br>  <br>Like the others said, plots repetitive, just gotta hang on for the boobs</br>  log horizon? .hack? anyone?  <br>fuck off u fukkin weeb piece of shit</br>  <br>good stories, good tits. I agree.</br>  <br>I watched 17 episodes of SAO. I have never seen a show jump the shark so hard, so fast. Guy spends 2 years or something unconcious then just gets up and walks away to go play the same video game he just played for 2 years, but this time it has fairy's and magic bullshit. I think the First 14 episodes were top notch. Everything else was not.</br>  <br>Friendship and adventure are my bread and butter.<br>I switch between One Piece and Fairy Tail when I'm waiting for the other to have new episodes.<br><br>Season 2 of pic related when?</br></br></br></br>  SAO was good ALO was shit GGO is above average can we all on this?  <br>nah, past the first 5 or 6 they just started dodging the main point.</br>  <br>SAO did do action well though. and the music for the action scenes felt perfect for a MMORPG too. but the rest of the show is a mess</br>  <br>log horizon was cool as well, love it. .hack... yeah didnt really care for it.</br>  thank me later  <br>I actually enjoyed Devil is a part timer, though I wish they would do a prequel season showing the fighting in the other world.<br><br>I legitimately tried to get into one piece a few days ago, and I just couldn't. Something about that luffy kid pisses me off.</br></br></br>  <br>Log horizon season 2 WHEN<br><br>WHEN</br></br></br>  <br>lol sry forgot the pic</br>  <br>Yup</br>  <br>Awe sick boobs</br>  <br>Serious?<br><br>It's already over.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>just because you like something, doesnt make it good.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That whole comic/doujin/whatever the fuck it's called is breddy gud.<br><br><br>The whole thing is on Fakku</br></br></br></br>  <br>I watch One Piece dubbed. I can't into Luffy's Japanese voice.<br>Devil is a Part Timer is the one time I actually wanted more SoL instead of action.</br></br>  <br>We are waiting for 3 now... enjoy your next weekend</br>  <br>dont mind the fags anon, they're here forever.</br>  <br>I think half of the people you quoted were complaining about the show.</br>  <br>Anything past aincrad is shit mate. Especially what they do to Asuna.</br>  <br>Thanks /b/ro, for dem titties</br>  <br>What was the point of your post?<br><br><br>I thought season 1 was 24 episodes my bad. Still, I want more of the damn show.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You know what, fine. SAO is not a great show, but I like it anyway. Kill me.</br>  <br>Just because you don't like something doesn't make it bad.</br>  <br>hate me later<br>http://pururin.com/view/2856/00/vic<wbr>timgirls14-sleeping-beauties_1.html<wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>we all have our anime sin. mine is clannad love the shit out of it</br>  Did anyone watch the first episode of Dragon Ball Super?<br>No spoilers please I just want to know how it was.</br>  <br>LH was boring.</br>  <br>Jesus how many anime's am I gong to have to note down to watch? Fuck if I get anymore I might start thinking tumblr is an actually good site</br>  <br>i didnt say it wasnt great. im just not saying its fucking life changing.</br>  <br>Awe shit thanks man.</br>  <br>You're entitled to your opinion anon. It's kinda hard to get into because theres not a lot of action and it's mostly dialogue. I personally really enjoyed it.</br>  <br>I was afraid that I was the only one that liked the Gun portion of the show. the animation when he was using the lightsaber was pretty slick. I think the first arc and GGO were interesting because lives hung in the balance. in the boring parts we are just watching people play an MMO.</br>  <br>My guilty pleasure is Ouran High School Host Club.</br>    <br> its sin <br>Nigga do you even Clannad?</br></br>  <br>Just go to justdubs and watch everything in the ecchi category. Make sure you have your adblocker on</br>  <br>if Boko no Pico isnt in there....</br>  <br>pretty much. Loved those two parts. ALO and the BS back to "the cripple wins strongest by time" bs... yeah still not liking that. oh spoiler warning.</br>  <br>Fucking loved that. I usually only watch anime with nice titties but this OHSHC was something else that I enjoyed</br>  <br>.tv<br>their original site was taken down....i dont like the hew owners of the site.</br></br>  <br>WHATTHEFUCK</br>  <br>i enjoyed it to. not sure why. but i did.</br>  <br>Tokyo Ghoul.</br>  <br>i work two weeks on two weeks off at a lumber camp this is the only place i can talk about anime so im embarressed about all of it<br><br>i also like the valkyria chronocles anime...</br></br></br>  It was good up until the game stopped killing people. Then it was meh. The GGO season had potential, but the ending was disappointing. Haven't watched the Excalibur season yet, don't plan to anytime soon.  <br>There it is... Soak it anon<br>there's 16 of those</br></br>  <br><br>Thanks lads. <br> tipfadora.jpg </br></br></br>  <br>I don't even use the main site anymore<br>I use dubbed anime dot net. Found a link to it at the bottom of just dubs. Although I have to look at a big picture of kirito at all times, I find the site better.</br></br>  <br>It's life changing because my purpose in life became to make Asuna my personal cum bucket after watching it</br>  <br>It was too cute and funny for me, I fell for it in the second episode</br>  <br>My Guilty pleasures are slice of live Girls shows like Azumanga Dioh. Mainly a guilty pleasure because I am a burly construction dude who loves to weld in his spare time.</br>  <br>It does a great job of being a shit anime on its own.</br>  <br>Ah, now i understand<br>Yeah, Animes not too popular with most Adults. Probably never will be.<br><br>Correction, 19</br></br></br></br>  This anime changed my life by making me realize how mundane real life is. I just want to become a cute little girl :(  <br><br>Well I'm glad there's at least two more almost-fags out there.<br><br>Can we agree that its a travesty that the Negima anime fucked up not once but twice?</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;626318501 <br>Tits guy reporting in.<br> yes I can agree </br></br>  <br>my nigga<br>First half of both seasons were best.<br>That and Mother's Rosario.</br></br></br>  <br>I know that feel nigga</br>  <br>Apparently a lot of people disagree with you since the LN and Blurays sold really well in both japan and the west. /b/ has a habit of hating shit just because it's popular.</br>  <br>gospel right here folks</br>  <br>yeah, ive been there to and it is<br>.<br>yeah, that. thats probably why for me. And its not the most repeated main plot.</br></br></br>  <br>I wish I could like something this much OP, damn. I'm happy for you.</br>  <br>Haha, no you don't. Trust me on that one, I'm so damn short, my friends all call me loli, no one wants to date a girl who looks like pedophile bait.</br>  <br>Hey man its a strange new world, if you want to be a little Japanese girl i am sure the supreme court will eventually back you.</br>  <br>Another show to note down</br>  This how I feel about mlp  <br>man this shits pretty fucked up</br>  <br>how you doin?</br>  Who else hype for the One Punch Man anime?  <br>...your in the wrong place to be saying that, you probable fat dude</br>  <br>Who else hype for new Digimon?</br>  <br>I can get down to that.<br><br>Amen.<br><br>and i agree with you there, its just amazing how it fucked up so hard on everything else.</br></br></br></br></br>  After episode 14 I le dropped SAO<br>In the beginning it had a cool idea but over time I was rather disappointed abit until 14</br>    <br>I liked the ggo arc. but yeah afterwards is ok. ok as in fairy dance arc ok</br>  <br>Holy shit digimon is still goin? I haven't watched that shit since the first season.</br>  <br> and i agree with you there, its just amazing how it fucked up so hard on everything else. <br><br>RIGHT</br></br></br>  <br><br>Why am I on 4chan again</br></br>  <br>Why do you think i posted "hate me"<br>that shit depressed me when i first saw it. Now though.....Lets just say im not opposed to it</br></br>  Fire  <br>because your probably fat dude in his early to mid twenties. isnt that what i just said</br>  <br>Because you can never leave. No matter how loud you scream</br>  <br>I've said it before and I'll say it again. As it is SAO is a great smaple platter for newcomers looking to get into anime. All the cliches are there.<br><br>That said It would have been a much better show if it played to its strengths and just stayed in SAO.</br></br></br>  <br>fuck that. I am a male equivalent of a loli and practically bathe in the affection of females. Perhaps not in completely sexual sense, but affectionate nonetheless. Still rather be a cute loli since cute girls &gt; cute boys</br>  <br> started watching friends so i get the reference </br>   626308029 <br>Weeaboo</br>  <br>I can never get into anime that are over 100 episodes long. they all fell like they are full of filler. nothing ever happens or develops. fights last for multiple episodes. Basicly dragonball Z syndrome.</br>  <br>Fuck off, I don't have to prove myself to you<br><br>I see.</br></br></br>  <br> That said It would have been a much better show if it played to its strengths and just stayed in SAO. <br>i blame the source matrial for that</br></br>  my friend really likes sword art online<br>im not a fan of it myself but its ok</br>  <br>Dragonball Z is the only anime I can stomach more than 100 episodes of besides fairy tail.<br><br>I couldn't stand the first episode of one piece. And I would rather drink Bleach than watch the show.</br></br></br>  <br>didnt say you had to bro.</br>  <br>OH, how do people feel about the<br> New Hunter X Hunter? I fucking love that show.</br></br>  <br>I am 28 and find myself using quotes from Seinfeld and friends all the time. that shit was popular when I was young.</br>  <br>Congratulations, you finished the second season you fucking retard. There wasn't anything else after she died, genius.</br>  <br>just saying that until you do, everyone here will think you a guy.</br>  <br>I'm turning 20 and everyone thinks I'm old because I quote Friends and Fraiser.</br>  <br>Then you're in luck because they're making a half dozen new movies that are sequels to the first season.<br><br>That would make you a shota<br><br>DBZ isn't even that bad anymore. DBZ uncut has 297 episodes<br>Naruto has a combined over 500 episode now<br>One Piece just crossed 700.<br>Bleach has over 300.<br>I'm sure Fairy tail is getting up there now.<br><br><br>I watched the dubbed run of the original series, and am about 30 episode into the 2011 series.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>NO SOUP FOR YOU!</br>  This was the first anime I ever watched since I didn't want to be a weeb.<br>It's actually good.... For ep. 1-14<br>After that, it became weeb trash while having my friends insist, "THE INCEST IN SAO IS OK SINCE THEY ARE UNRELATED OR COUSINS IDUNNO"</br></br>  <br>People use me as a place to put their elbows, pick me up without permission, I have to look up at people when I talk to them, my neck fucking hurts from that shit, the jokes are endless bro, people are always trying to either protect me or hurt me because I'm so tiny and defenseless</br>  <br>Newfag found</br>  <br>IT GETS GOOOOOD <br>like i found the show to be non-stop gooood.</br></br>  <br>Underrated post</br>  <br>Well maybe if you stopped being a drink stand and started sucking dick people would treat you better.</br>  <br>The main character literally did paper work for months worth of episodes<br><br>I don't think that other guy's statement was an opinion<br><br>Like that show is objectively a piece of shit</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Dude I honestly tried with DBZ, Fairy Tail, bleach and did not like any of them. I do have a box set of hunter X hunter and watched a lot before i got burnt out. Hell, i watched all of ranma 1/2 and all of the original Inuyasha back in the day though.</br></br>    <br>Why hello newfriend</br>  <br>Done it once before, never again. Gag relfex was too much and the guy I was with was a complete asshole about it</br>    1st arc is God tier. 2nd was high class. 3rd was a lot of filler, but ok. 4th was just shit tier. You expect some big revelation, but no, she just fucking dies. <br> MFW <br> Also, MFW waiting for next season knowing </br></br>  <br>you just found a prick. there are decent guys out there. You're just attracted only to douchebags.</br>  <br>you are making me want to protect you. fucking little people. Also whats the worst that could happen? you throw up? that's kinda hot in its own way.</br>  Akame ga kill? anyone?  <br>Thing about that guy was that he was such a good actor, seemed like completely decent and then had this asshole side out of nowhere, dumped him for that and some other stuff</br>  <br>I've been told it gets good. But I was watching it with my brother and he dropped out and it feels weird to watch it with our him now.<br><br><br>I really enjoyed Ranma back in the day. Hopefully the figuarts come out some time this decade. I've been meaning to rewatch Inuyasha as well. <br><br>I've been watching the viz dub of Sailor Moon too.<br><br>dumping digimon cuz that shits cool</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It started strong and then halfway through the first season it dove face first into the dirt and dragged it all the way through season 2.<br><br>It felt like the writing was taken over by an autistic 16 year old with no experience with real human interaction after the first 8 episodes or so.</br></br></br>  <br> le nice guis never win <br>fat betamax detected</br></br>  <br>Practice makes perfect.<br><br><br>Fair enough. I only got into DBZ because it's DBZ and as a kid, that was the tightest shit.<br><br><br>That's your opinion man. I disagree with it, but if you didn't like it, I won't try to force you to. The claim that he did paperwork nonstop for episodes was not entirely true. They gave him something to do while expanding on other characters backstories, and at the end of the season you see why him doing paperwork was so important. he was leveling a skill that had TREMENDOUS results.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Love AGK, hoping the manga ends differently than the anime tho.</br>  <br>Now that I'm thinking about it, he might've liked that, me coughing and spluttering and shit. Would explain a lot</br>  <br><br>men are pricks. You just got to be persistent and find a decent one thats nice and hang on. Unfortunately not many of those exist.<br>okay man, but youre missing out on some good stuff.</br></br></br>        <br>i did not quote that correctly ignore the first 2 lines 282<br>ignore the last line 276</br></br>  Ｉ＇ｖｅ ｂｅｅｎ ａｎ ａｖｉｄ ｇａｍｅｒ ａｌｌ ｍｙ ｌｉｆｅ． Ｓｔａｒｔｅｄ ｏｆｆ ｏｎ ｔｈｅ ｃｏｎｓｏｌｅｓ， ｍｏｓｔｌｙ Ｃａｌｌ ｏｆ Ｄｕｔｙ ｂｕｔ ａ ｌｏｔ ｏｆ ＲＰＧｓ ａｎｄ ａ ｆｅｗ ＰＣ ｓｔｒａｔｅｇｙ ｇａｍｅｓ.

Unless you were saying that I'm missing out on the boys.</br></br>  <br>Fucking lag am i right?</br>  <br>Fucking protection instinct intensifies, sonofabitch.</br>  you all need to try watching actual good anime instead of all this shonen shit... try steins gate or full metal alchemist brotherhood. trust me you'll rethink your shonen ways  <br>no, you were suppose to expose the last line.</br>    <br>I didn't like steins gate. Haven't gotten around to Brotherhood, but it's on the list.</br>    <br>Yes. This is literally my desktop wallpaper.</br>  <br>Dude I feel exactly the same way. I'm a grown man and I went through a box of tissues watching this because it touched me so emotionally.</br>  <br>this guy gets it. SO much trash tier shit out there. <br><br>your fucking crazy if you think im reading that when the only thing i see in the entire thing is "kill them"</br></br></br>      <br>Watch log horizon OP! If you love SAO season 1 you'll like Log.</br>  <br>the first few episodes of steins gate were shit and I gave up on it. Did I miss something? I think i just did not relate to any characters. I liked FMA in its original form, have it all on DVD. That was a thing before all this streaming goodness.</br>  <br>That ends this little digi-dump.</br>  <br>I love anime, but I never felt like a fag for it until I watched SAO</br>  <br><br>stop it. i may be wise but that doesnt mean i dont have a penis.</br></br>  <br>Steins gate is good man. Gets crazy, and the main character becomes more likable and less delusional.</br>  <br> SAO touched you <br>Watch clannad then rethink everything you think you know.</br></br>  tbh i only liked kirito in the last 6 episodes of season 2. as soon as he got out of the main role and all he wanted to do was sit around his virtual cabin a sleep. all kirioto needed to do to be likable was not give a shit and get out of the limelight  <br>still has parts from the VN though. like it almost feels like a harem<br> "bet shes a guy." </br></br>  It's nice to have some genuine discussion about anime. This shit doesn't happen on /a/.  Weeb  <br>the whole point of steins gate is that it builds up slow to gain anticipation then hits you with mind bending shit around episode 13 and so on... before that its just supposed to make you go "huh?" but still keep you interested</br>  <br>one of my favorite non shonen shows that I never see mentioned is "Planets" released by Bandai I believe. About a team of regular office drone type people that collect debris in space.</br>  <br>yeah, im opposed to Digital. I like to actually OWN it physically.</br>  <br>Well fuck<br>I got him to cum in the end though, huehuehue</br></br>  <br>I liked it, but I wouldn't say it's life changing.</br>   tfw when try to convince my brother to watch Soul Eater because it's enjoyable <br> tfw this fucker shows up </br>  <br>Yeah, dislike the fact that Tatsumi and everyone for that fact basically ***s<br><br>im guessing you dont know how to &gt;<br>or at the very least you dont know what it means</br></br></br></br>  <br>I fucking hate that guy<br><br><br>Post pic without face of how small you are</br></br></br></br>  <br>Will definitely check it. Sounds interesting.</br>  <br>I started buying bootleg dvds on Ebay around 2005? All the good stuff, Bebop, Evangelion, Then i was going to bestbuy when they had a good anime section. i have probably spent a lot of money on anime DVDs. Now i have Netflix, hulu plus, crunchyroll, and funimation.</br>  <br>thats what i said.<br><br>well now i....i dont think ill forget this anytime soon. How big was he?</br></br></br>  <br>I googled it and the art style gives me cancer. Might czech it out though.</br>  <br>That makes me so happy.</br>  <br>yeah, i do use crunchyroll for shit thats currently streaming.</br>  I know some OVA's of Kenichi got made but did they ever get to this glorious moment?  <br>it is old. Like 2006 i think. it came out within months of TMOHS.</br>  <br>The second episode scares so many people off just because of that "somehow more annoying than Naruto wanna be ninja." The first half of the anime he is intolerable, but luckily he improves throughout.</br>  <br>hey fucker. i havent watched the ova, im still hoping they make another season.</br>  <br>What's so special about it that will flip my world?</br>  <br>Forget that guy, the little emo bastard with the pistols triggered me. STOPSHOOTINGWITHYOURFUCKINGPINKIESL<wbr>IKEITSCOOL.JPG</wbr></br>  <br>About 6 or 7 inches, can't remember, I eneded up just sucking on the tip and a bit of the shaft down to the middle, let him cum in my mouth because I had to know what it tasted like</br>  <br>Yeah. We know that. Its convincing other people that's the problem!</br>  <br>Death the kid is kind of a faggot starting out. I'm only on episode 11 but I still find him more tolerable than black star.</br>    <br>Well? Did you swallow or not?</br>  <br>I agree man, like i said, triggered.</br>  <br> same <br>Oh now I have to know. And feel free not to answer.<br>What did you think about the whole experience. you know except for your boyfriend complaining like a little priveleged bitch</br></br></br>    <br> not as gay as i though <br> even gayer </br></br>  When does Kirito fuck his sister, I mean cousin.    <br>forgot the "t" and it still fits.</br>    <br>sorry i have to be the one top tell you... they dont</br>  <br>at the risk of sounding stupid, what show is this?</br>    <br>close to end of the season in the 2nd game.</br>  <br>Macross Frontier</br>  <br>What fucking episode was that? I don't remember that scene</br>  <br>you should watch a show called Koi Kaze, right up your alley.</br>  <br>The Movie, Lagann-hen</br>  <br>Swallowed, dude was completely shocked and treated me like a slut ever since<br><br>Hmm. I'll say it was nice, made me feel empowered, (don't like that word but can't think of a better one) to give someone else pleasure was the best thing about it, and I liked the feel of it too, the saltiness of precum is a detail I remember well. I suppose it's an experience worth having</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks Anon, i loved the original Macross. MA KU ROSS, MA KU ROSS. But Minmei was a bimbo.</br>  <br>I shouls say that Lagann-hen is the second movie<br>Gurren-hen is the first.</br></br>  <br>i liked the end and at the same time i didn't... no clue about the ovas though</br>  <br>I'll be honest with you and say that I've never seen Macross. Only Robotech.</br>  i love sao i think its the best animd out there i got alot of props and collectibles of it :)  <br> not treating you like a god damn war hero.  <br>Like i said, a prick</br></br>  Someone tell me an anime with nice boobs and ass. Greatly appreciated  Hunter x Hunter is #1 anime ever. Faggots  <br>I felt the end of the manga was too abrupt but at the same time where do they go from there? Can't really get the stakes any higher. Could have used a quick cool down arc like Negima had though.</br>  <br><br>I want to say that Macross was dubbed and marketed as Robotech in the US?<br><br> is macross, or looks exactly like it.</br></br></br></br>    <br><br>Well have a great life anon. and remeber. If you're giving some guy head and he gives you shit or treats you nice and then becomes a complete tool later. Drop that fuck. There are plently of people who would fucking Love a blowjob. and there are those who would kill(literally) for some one who like to give head and swallow. Trust me. I would stab that fucker in his guts. (always need to go one step too far)</br></br>  <br>agreed.<br><br>maybe he wanted to do more but someone higher said it was enough ?<br><br>idk... just so many bad endings nowadays</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>As the guy who had been posting all the webms in this thread yes Robotech is the Power Rangers to Macross' Super Sentai. The American cobbled together version that causes a great divided in the fandom.</br>  <br>Most of the first season is fine, the second season and onward is absolute garbage though.</br>  <br>Pull a Dragon ball and have aliens invade maybe?</br>  <br>Sekirei<br><br>basically so high five nigguh</br></br></br>  <br>meh this coulda gotten better but it fell flat towards the end like the actual anime</br>  <br>Thanks anon</br>    <br>kek.<br><br>just as you said.. the end was just too abrupt.. and the drawings at lhe end showing that he became a writer ? fuking seriously ?</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks Anon, I am missing a disk from my macross collection and had to torrent the episodes. ended up with robotech and was dissapoint. the version I have has Vic Mangina or whatever as the voice of Hikaru. Way better dub than robotech.</br>  <br>Nice!</br>    Never watched much anime but it pulled my heart strings.  <br>Becoming a writer is what he always wanted to do.</br>  <br>did that old guys head fall off for no fucking reason? last time i checked, Nukes dont decapitate.</br>  how the fuck did it change your life  <br>All in all it just made me feel fucking alone.</br>  How about ghost in the shell sac?  <br>are we replaying the women's world cup footage again? We should be more humble USA.</br>  <br>I love GITS SAC. is it weird that I like the stand alone episodes better than the main arc in both seasons? Tachikomas rule.</br>  Too Bad you don't watch good anime. Must be a real challenge to be tht gay.  <br>GoaGaiGar Is pretty dang good. Glad I found that dvd of what they managed to get dubbed. The subs are still on it but the dubs feel like a lost treasure.</br>  <br> not realizing there's 50 episodes of thw Log Horizon anime </br>  <br>what movie was this again?</br>  <br>Grave of the fireflies?</br>  <br>Probably why I enjoyed Hollow Fragment, since it diverges from the "Canon" timeline and the death game continues after Kayaba is defeated.<br><br>That and you can romance girls other than that cum sucking whore Asuna. Including Argo. God do I fucking love Argo.</br></br></br>  <br>oh right thanks</br>  <br>yep<br>although i havent seen it<br>dont know how to watch the show.<br><br>Cowboy Bebop is great. its phenomenal</br></br></br></br></br>  isnt that one of them chinese cartoons  <br>Legit. when i was young my sister asked me this same question. and instead of correcting them i just said yes.</br>  <br>I am pretty sure that was wrong. grave of the fireflies was about firebombed city and starving kids eating mud pies. But I have seen that anime.</br>  Anymore anime like SAO or Evangelion? Just stated watching anime, and those two are my favorites so far    <br>Fuck You, you made me sad about that again. I hope Akamatsu goes back to it sometime like he said he would.<br><br>Gecko endings are literally the worst. Ruined Negima, Soul Eater, FMA.</br></br></br>  <br>I found it, probably Barefoot Gen, not Grave of the fireflies, apologies.</br>  <br>It's just... It deserves a full run anime. The school festival and the magic world tournament deserve to be animated.</br>  Watanabro reporting in    <br>Underrated</br>        Why can't any Amerifats drive stick ?  the better to speed down the streets drinking alcoholic beverages, enhaling hamburgers and shooting our firearms naturally.  i drive everyday a 1999 BMW 318 with manual gear.

This one boils my blood every time  God and the Devil have a game of chess, or, if you're one of those rigid types who can't stand anything vague or metaphorical (like... life, the universe and everything) the personification of truth and the personification of deception have a game of chess. God knows the truth, God knows the outcome of the game, God knows the truth will win. So God has no qualms letting the Devil know his every move. The Devil, being one for deception and tricks, being one who only cares about winning, believes God is deceiving him in order to trick him into making a bad move so that God will win. Thus, God wins without trying and, ultimately, the Devil defeats himself in a game of chess.  What a pussy<br>With all the shit, he may as well raped her anyway or worse. She took all my shit?

Keep in mind, it was politically correct at one point, to think women were second class citizens.</br>  <br>No black ass! Bigots!</br>  509 - Spokane here.    <br>un-free? lol we have weed, guns, and had gay marriage before the supreme court decision</br>  <br>hey kelso, longview over ehre. what you got?</br>  <br>that is your measure of free? Try speaking a politically incorrect subject and see what happens</br>  <br>p.s your guns are next</br>  <br>Guns that are literally to the point of being phased out or so challenging to obtain what is the point. Weed fuck yourself you 15 year old edge.<br> Gay Marriage. </br></br>  <br>no Mademoiselle?</br>  <br> Mademoiselle <br>Is that a town?</br></br>  <br>In Wa it is probably an adult.</br>  <br>She knows who she is</br>  <br> phased out <br><br>they're not doing shit. every time i ask a conservative to give me an example of gun-grabbing they talk about fucking extended magazines.</br></br></br>  Seattle here  <br> In Wa it is probably an adult. <br>Say again?</br></br>  <br>Malia Buffaloe nudes?</br>  <br>haha try flying a rainbow flag or having some dumbass slutwalk in eastern washington. cultural discrimination goes both ways</br>  <br>Extended mags? who uses those, they just break the barrel and smooth the rifling. No just after you dykes won your gay marriage there was a change to the 14th amendment that forced no further changes to prior existing amendments. And no im not a "gun grabber" I just want to own a fucking Romanian PSL without the police confiscating it.</br>  <br>And yes you're trying to, look at the unenforceable I-594. waste of money passing useless legislation?</br>  <br>because they look cool? who's the fucking 15 year old again?</br>  <br>Why do people collect body pillows? so they can stand up on their own? no so they can be the pure essence of weeaboo.</br>  <br>you're full of shit if you say there should be a background check but not a registry.<br><br> oh no big brother gonna take muh guns after they put me on the list </br></br></br>  <br>No it states that people who are shooting your guns also need a background check, which is unenforceable because there isn't a police or a licensed dealer at every range.</br>  <br>are you saying that extended mags smooth the rifling and break the barrel because you can shoot more bullets? because that sounds like what a teenager might say.</br>    <br>it doesn't. hunting and range shooting are exceptions</br>  <br>No, you seem not to know anything about weapons coming from a nice salty liberal. The more round you hoot in a shorter periods it applies heat to the barrel which can mend the rifling. intern ruing the gun and causing heat stress on the actual barrel. Why dont you think the military uses "extended mags" for standard practice?</br>  <br>i hate when interns ruing my gun</br>  <br> Gifts between immediate family members<br> Antiques and relics<br> Temporary transfers for self-defense<br>Nope, no where it states that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Woops im a bit salty ill slow down, top kek</br>    <br>No one cares about your filthy Wenatchee women.

She is from Richland WA    <br>did she get into a fight with an octopus?</br>  Tri-shities <br><br>never live here</br></br>  <br>I did not know that</br>  <br>I could believe that fucked up vagina was from this state....</br>  <br>I lived in Kennewick and Benton City. I liked the infrastructure but hated the entertainment scene. Decent place to live tho 7/10 IMO. The mexicans fuck the place up. <br><br>Speaking of Richland...<br>Sharon Tate was a Bomber</br></br></br></br>    Just leavin' this here  <br>509 Richland</br>  <br>where you at?</br>  <br>whos this?</br>  <br>You're the anon from puyallup right?</br>  <br>Its the radiation.</br>  253<br>Live in sumner<br>Anybody got amiibos I can buy?</br></br>  <br>so it works good, I fly my flag, you fly yours. We both take shit but only you are whining about it.</br>  <br>Never seen here around here.</br>  <br>Extended mags are a problem? Only if you are stupid enough to think ANY gun can be reloaded in a slit second.</br>  <br><br>Richlandfag here, thinking of getting out of here whenever I get the chance, maybe even out of the state.</br></br>  <br>I could believe that. Subs at bangor are prolly dumping in the ocean again.</br>  <br>World class athlete/</br>  the red star will burn when the pole is circled again. <br>the blue and red, they will do our work for us when the pole is circled again.</br>  <br>I moved from the small town WA to Kennewick and that was the big city in my view. Lived there a few years ultimately ended up hating it because I couldn't afford a boat and that fucking river taunted me. We moved to Oregon and now back to WA and I miss the DriShities.</br>    <br>I Grew up in Benton City, and now live in Pasco. Fuck all the mexicans here, i cant go anywhere without getting angry at the spics. <br><br>as said overall Dry-Shitties blows for most entertainment and activies. Gotta basically drive atleast 1.5 hours away to do anything</br></br></br>  <br>My god have you ever been to the Kennewick Ross? Its like a mexican throw up party every day in there.</br>  <br>Family lives in kennewick, but up in the southridge and canyon lakes big houses, so not so many beaners there. <br><br>Never been to Ross, but Costco is now ruined for me, tried to go there the other day and was raging hard.</br></br></br>  <br>Yea they discovered Ross in 2011 from what I saw. We bought our first year membership in 2010 and rarely saw mexicans. By renewal time in 2011 I considered not renewing because you had to fight the beans and smell their stank. <br>I swear that parking lot gave me PTSD</br></br>  Gf and I are long distance atm so i make her go out and take pics in public  <br>It's a nice, peacful place(or at least Richland is), but the tri-cities blows in anything to do for fun. Also, Richland HighSchool fucking sucked, was boring as fuck.<br><br><br><br><br>Actually, the fuck is up with all the Mexicans in Tricities here anyway? This is the last place I expected to see any of them when I moved here back a couple years ago.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shit man, looks fugly. Please tell me she at least has a great personality.</br>  <br>I think they come in from the surrounding Ag seasonal camps for supplies and to wire money south.</br>  <br>We have a huge agriculture industry here, Farms, Orchards, Wineries. Illegal mexicans are cheap labor, Hence all the Mexicans.<br><br>It is suprising though when you think about them being that far north. I just saw a statistic the other day for the Pasco Schools that most are between 60-80% mexican now and couldnt beleive it.</br></br></br>  <br>who do you think i'm siding with? slutwalks are a fucking embarrassment. but everyone has the right to assemble and fly whatever flag they want</br>  At least the beans bring in decent burrito trucks    Edmonds then north(gate) seattle... come get your dickings...  <br>100 bucks says she is a butterface</br>  <br>Nope. Not in the Dry Shities. That place has 1 decent mexican place and its spotty at best. They bring nothing to the area but disease.</br>  Milf tits  <br>no... no they don't.<br><br>i'm from arizona. what you call "mexican food" tastes like someone used interpretive dance to describe mexican food to a canadian helen keller.</br></br></br>  <br>Post more</br>  <br>I have Found 2.
