When I was a kid, neither parent was around because they were working so they didn't notice and when I told them something wasn't right they didn't care.<br>I met a lady when I was 18 on the inter webs since that's where I spend most of my time and we got together in person when I was 22. Now I am 26 and we are married. I said all of that because my wife paid attention and cared enough to get me help and has agreed to stay with me even though it's known that I'm just going to end up that old fuck who hates you and everyone in your general vicinity.

Maybe the bi polar thing may stop you but just try.</br>  <br><br>oh god it didn't die. and there's a cringe thread i have to purge too. fuck. <br><br>nice trips tho.</br></br></br></br>    <br>I don't know why, but this got me</br>  <br><br>God dammit. Gets me every fucking time I see it. Fuck you.</br></br>        <br>Fuck that was pretty good. I don't know how they're going to top Greatest Generation that is such an amazing album.</br>    <br><br>Unfortunately, this is true. I had a dog that did that to her food dish. I don't think she was trying to save it.</br></br>    <br><br>true<br><br><br>I'm realizing this<br>I'm an apathetic fuck lately when it comes to finding a job or getting at girls<br>I'm easily capable of both and have done it before plenty of times<br><br>I dont know if I'm in a rut or what the fuck but I need something to change</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>        <br>Happy birthday anon</br>            <br>lmao wtf happened here</br>    <br>underage b&amp;</br>  <br> Tríes to post gore to troll, post shit tier gore </br>    <br> troll </br>  <br><br>this<br>its pathetic tier considering how long he's goin now</br></br></br>    <br>I'm 19 so not underage. I just don't feel shit looking at these dead people, don't know em don't care</br>   calling someone pathetic <br> feels thread <br><br>:l</br></br></br>  <br>weird feeling ain't it?</br>  <br>It's called branching out and not giving up. The only support I had in elementary school was my dad, and I had severe autism back then, so I was a dickhead of a kid and I was treated as such. Didn't know I was being one, but I was. You don't let shit like that hold onto you. You get the fuck back up, and you just keep going. You don't stop until you're content. The issue with you guys is you don't wanna deal with anything. That's fine, living the way you do is okey dokey as you are guaranteed not to get hurt, so good on ya. But it won't ever help you meet a girl you may someday marry and have kids with, it aint gonna get you that best friend who will help you out no questions asked other than "what do I need to do", and it most certainly ain't gonna help you to feel better about yourself. Nothing is impossible until you decide it is so.</br>    <br>I hate animal empathy</br>  <br>nah, more so just a "oh look dead person" kinda thing</br>  <br>happy birthday, anon</br>  <br>you should write a self-help book.<br><br>you'd make millions.</br></br></br>  <br>all you guys with these bday wishes is seriously awesome. thank you so much<br><br>hope 25 is better than 24</br></br></br>  <br>you'll understand what i meant by that when you're older.</br>  <br>goofgender. check your pillage</br>      <br>His stuff is boring as a fuck, a low size images</br>  <br><br>This shit, too. My cat had cancer. I worked extra to put him on chemo. For almost three fucking years. Impossible for a cat, right? Not this guy, he was a fucking fighter and so long as he was willing to fight so was I. We fought through a sudden strengthening of his cancer after about a year. We fought through a severe cold. We fought through a lot. Together. Every time he came home from the vet after chemo he got a special treat on the way home. We sat in my car outside Taco Bell eating chicken soft tacos. We even fought together when the vet was absolutely certain it was time to say good bye. But he showed them. The next time he came in for chemo he shocked them all and was extra loud and obnoxious. He was always at my side: morning, day, and night. Then one night for the first time while he was sleeping I heard him moaning. For the first time in almost three years of fighting he was uncomfortable. I knew as soon as I heard that the next day I would lose him. I hugged him close and he started purring. That morning he could barely walk, his back legs kept giving out on him. It was time, it was only going to get worse. I took him outside and let him wander around the yard he looked over from his favorite window perch for these six years. He stumbled over to a spot I could tell was his target from the time he went out the door, and rolled around in the dirt, seemingly happy as a pig in shit. Finally he got up and we got in the car. He sat in my lap the entire time to the vet, his ability to move degrading as we drove. The vet took us into a special counseling room with a comfortable couch and we sat there. I laid back on the couch and he laid on my belly and chest like we did so often watching TV and napping when I got home from work. The vet came in after a while to see how we were doing. He was in a near sleep, purring still. I clenched my eyes and gave her the okay and she came over.</br></br>  <br>now you know how i feel.</br>  <br>gr8 b8 m8 can't w8 to see his h8<br> implying I don't know what you're talking about. </br></br>    *rustles hair*<br><br>atta boy.</br></br>      remember when you saw this and felt nothing then some anon was talking about how his kid died?  <br>Happy birthday, anon</br>  <br>I've been on anti-depressants for a few weeks now, and while I can now last 5 minutes with my own thoughts without feeling a strong urge to kill myself, now I'm just angry at my ex all the time.<br><br>Months of fucking misery to the point that I need meds, and it turns out the whole break up was because she was being a fucking idiot.</br></br></br>  can't talk to women though.<br><br>big deal<br><br>much hurt</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He barely reacted to her, barely moved, never skipped a purr. Odd, because he hated being there, and was never trusting of them. But this time he just knew things were different. She took the catheter in his arm and started the injection. I couldn't watch. I just held him. He never flinched. Never moved. He just kept purring. Gradually his purr grew softer, softer, softer, until finally it stopped. He stopped. He laid there. Gone, but not longer in pain. I finally let out my breath, and I heard a sound, a most awful sound escape my body and I broke down uncontrollably. I couldn't stop. Our fight was over, our long tiring fight, but we had cheated, we got almost three more years together when they said we wouldn't get six months. We won. Damn it all. WE won.</br></br>  <br><br>It's only going to get worse from here.</br></br>    <br>omg thats hot &gt;_&gt;</br>  <br>fucking epic. screen cap'd. your story will live, anon.</br>      <br>I don't have that right now. I'm pretty fucking happy where I'm at tbh: not concerned about a woman, therefore I don't have many issues. I understand that certain people are acquaintances and others are friends and only a handful are true friends, therefore I don't fret over who cares for me. I have a job with the Army that is guaranteed for four years, therefore money, shelter, food, and companionship will never be an issue.<br><br>I'm an incredibly happy guy, and I shouldn't be bragging about it, but in a way I'm not. I didn't used to be this well off: I used to care for every single person I met, I used to love people who I knew would never love me back, and I used to constantly think about whether I was of importance to people or not. <br><br> The first thing you guys need to do is be happy with yourselves. Only then can you ever find more happiness </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you know what, tomorrow i'm going to remember what you said. <br><br>thanks for that.</br></br></br>  <br>This is the story of my life, right here.</br>    <br>sorry anon. :( <br>mommy's here.</br></br>    you're too dead to realize that you're screaming. <br><br>oh wait, you're afraid of appearing "edgy."<br><br>they're not.</br></br></br></br>  <br> mfw I have no face </br>  <br>XD</br>  <br>Happy Birthday Anon.</br>  <br>Dunno if you're a troll, but if you aren't, then no problem fam.

Bigots!</br>  509 - Spokane here.    <br>un-free? lol we have weed, guns, and had gay marriage before the supreme court decision</br>  <br>hey kelso, longview over ehre. what you got?</br>  <br>that is your measure of free? Try speaking a politically incorrect subject and see what happens</br>  <br>p.s your guns are next</br>  <br>Guns that are literally to the point of being phased out or so challenging to obtain what is the point. Weed fuck yourself you 15 year old edge.<br> Gay Marriage. </br></br>  <br>no Mademoiselle?</br>  <br> Mademoiselle <br>Is that a town?</br></br>  <br>In Wa it is probably an adult.</br>  <br>She knows who she is</br>  <br> phased out <br><br>they're not doing shit. every time i ask a conservative to give me an example of gun-grabbing they talk about fucking extended magazines.</br></br></br>  Seattle here  <br> In Wa it is probably an adult. <br>Say again?</br></br>  <br>Malia Buffaloe nudes?</br>  <br>haha try flying a rainbow flag or having some dumbass slutwalk in eastern washington. cultural discrimination goes both ways</br>  <br>Extended mags? who uses those, they just break the barrel and smooth the rifling. No just after you dykes won your gay marriage there was a change to the 14th amendment that forced no further changes to prior existing amendments. And no im not a "gun grabber" I just want to own a fucking Romanian PSL without the police confiscating it.</br>  <br>And yes you're trying to, look at the unenforceable I-594. waste of money passing useless legislation?</br>  <br>because they look cool? who's the fucking 15 year old again?</br>  <br>Why do people collect body pillows? so they can stand up on their own? no so they can be the pure essence of weeaboo.</br>  <br>you're full of shit if you say there should be a background check but not a registry.<br><br> oh no big brother gonna take muh guns after they put me on the list </br></br></br>  <br>No it states that people who are shooting your guns also need a background check, which is unenforceable because there isn't a police or a licensed dealer at every range.</br>  <br>are you saying that extended mags smooth the rifling and break the barrel because you can shoot more bullets? because that sounds like what a teenager might say.</br>    <br>it doesn't. hunting and range shooting are exceptions</br>  <br>No, you seem not to know anything about weapons coming from a nice salty liberal. The more round you hoot in a shorter periods it applies heat to the barrel which can mend the rifling. intern ruing the gun and causing heat stress on the actual barrel. Why dont you think the military uses "extended mags" for standard practice?</br>  <br>i hate when interns ruing my gun</br>  <br> Gifts between immediate family members<br> Antiques and relics<br> Temporary transfers for self-defense<br>Nope, no where it states that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Woops im a bit salty ill slow down, top kek</br>    <br>No one cares about your filthy Wenatchee women. They all have herps any way.</br>  NE Vantucky  Seattle checking in, who wants to smoke?  <br>hurr durr maybe read the fucking thing, not bullet points on a VOTENOI594.ORG</br>  Im just sitting here doing Washington stuff at 8:53 PM. Omak WA here. Home of the Suicide Race.  <br>I do /b/ro</br>  jessyie gaspar will steal your car and wheels<br><br>shelbi curry will give you herpes</br></br>  Dumping...  509 here. why is nobody posting Hope Solo (soccer goalie) pics. She is from Richland WA    <br>did she get into a fight with an octopus?</br>  Tri-shities <br><br>never live here</br></br>  <br>I did not know that</br>  <br>I could believe that fucked up vagina was from this state....</br>  <br>I lived in Kennewick and Benton City. I liked the infrastructure but hated the entertainment scene. Decent place to live tho 7/10 IMO. The mexicans fuck the place up. <br><br>Speaking of Richland...<br>Sharon Tate was a Bomber</br></br></br></br>    Just leavin' this here  <br>509 Richland</br>  <br>where you at?</br>  <br>whos this?</br>  <br>You're the anon from puyallup right?</br>  <br>Its the radiation.</br>  253<br>Live in sumner<br>Anybody got amiibos I can buy?</br></br>  <br>so it works good, I fly my flag, you fly yours. We both take shit but only you are whining about it.</br>  <br>Never seen here around here.</br>  <br>Extended mags are a problem? Only if you are stupid enough to think ANY gun can be reloaded in a slit second.</br>  <br><br>Richlandfag here, thinking of getting out of here whenever I get the chance, maybe even out of the state.</br></br>  <br>I could believe that. Subs at bangor are prolly dumping in the ocean again.</br>  <br>World class athlete/</br>  the red star will burn when the pole is circled again. <br>the blue and red, they will do our work for us when the pole is circled again.</br>  <br>I moved from the small town WA to Kennewick and that was the big city in my view. Lived there a few years ultimately ended up hating it because I couldn't afford a boat and that fucking river taunted me. We moved to Oregon and now back to WA and I miss the DriShities.</br>    <br>I Grew up in Benton City, and now live in Pasco. Fuck all the mexicans here, i cant go anywhere without getting angry at the spics. <br><br>as said overall Dry-Shitties blows for most entertainment and activies. Gotta basically drive atleast 1.5 hours away to do anything</br></br></br>  <br>My god have you ever been to the Kennewick Ross? Its like a mexican throw up party every day in there.</br>  <br>Family lives in kennewick, but up in the southridge and canyon lakes big houses, so not so many beaners there. <br><br>Never been to Ross, but Costco is now ruined for me, tried to go there the other day and was raging hard.</br></br></br>  <br>Yea they discovered Ross in 2011 from what I saw. We bought our first year membership in 2010 and rarely saw mexicans. By renewal time in 2011 I considered not renewing because you had to fight the beans and smell their stank. <br>I swear that parking lot gave me PTSD</br></br>  Gf and I are long distance atm so i make her go out and take pics in public  <br>It's a nice, peacful place(or at least Richland is), but the tri-cities blows in anything to do for fun. Also, Richland HighSchool fucking sucked, was boring as fuck.<br><br><br><br><br>Actually, the fuck is up with all the Mexicans in Tricities here anyway? This is the last place I expected to see any of them when I moved here back a couple years ago.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shit man, looks fugly. Please tell me she at least has a great personality.</br>  <br>I think they come in from the surrounding Ag seasonal camps for supplies and to wire money south.</br>  <br>We have a huge agriculture industry here, Farms, Orchards, Wineries. Illegal mexicans are cheap labor, Hence all the Mexicans.<br><br>It is suprising though when you think about them being that far north. I just saw a statistic the other day for the Pasco Schools that most are between 60-80% mexican now and couldnt beleive it.</br></br></br>  <br>who do you think i'm siding with? slutwalks are a fucking embarrassment. but everyone has the right to assemble and fly whatever flag they want</br>  At least the beans bring in decent burrito trucks    Edmonds then north(gate) seattle... come get your dickings...  <br>100 bucks says she is a butterface</br>  <br>Nope. Not in the Dry Shities. That place has 1 decent mexican place and its spotty at best. They bring nothing to the area but disease.</br>  Milf tits  <br>no... no they don't.<br><br>i'm from arizona. what you call "mexican food" tastes like someone used interpretive dance to describe mexican food to a canadian helen keller.</br></br></br>  <br>Post more</br>  <br>I have Found 2.
