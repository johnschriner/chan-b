My bad for not being all that clear.<br><br>Still... imagine watching it as a slice of life. Shit'd be fucked.</br></br></br>  <br>Toradora is pure slice of life, was trying to avoid that.<br><br><br>I'm glad it got released on Steam. I'm not usually for paying for my VN's, but fuck if this series isn't worth it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> summer </br>  <br>Not hating on anime or so. But what makes you like anime and where to begin with a serie? How long does it take to finish a whole serie</br>  <br> i watch filthy frank <br> Kill yourself <br> ayy lmao you newfag summerfaggot kid fghdctryf hgcdeyjtvghj,frthjce </br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I'm pleased they are as well - but I'm more pleased that they redid the sprites. Damn the old ones were awful.</br>  <br> assuming this is a serious question and not b8 <br><br>When I first started watching, anime was just another form of media to me. Just like a TV series, I looked for some sort of strong plot or something I genuinely liked in it. Over time, I got more into it and eventually anime started to become my main source of media entertainment over normal television/movies. While at first I was embarrassed over it, I eventually just realised I didn't give a fuck. So what if I like anime? So yeah, I don't know why I like anime so much as I guess I just do.<br><br>Beginning with a series is pretty much the same shit every time, go through at least 4 eps and if I like it, continue. If not, stop. A 26-ep series will take me 3-5 days to finish on average, depending on work/other commitments.<br><br><br>Reminds me of the first time I read Umineko. Didn't realise there were updated sprites until the 3rd Episode. Had to redo it all from the beginning.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Spongebob Squarepants.</br>  Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo  <br>ey bo$$</br>  <br>Normally I'm skeptical about Slice of Life, but this was... something else. The fanservice itself ended up giving me heart boners instead of real ones.</br>  I also recommend Higurashi. It's no slice of life but is really good.<br>Chapter 2 on Steam when?</br>  <br><br>Surprised no one mentioned Mushi-Shi<br><br>It's a slower paced anime (not action orientated) but the per episode stories and feels are amazing, beautiful soundtrack with great animation makes it incredible.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Dubs never lies.<br><br>If we're gonna' recommend just plain good stuff, genre notwithstanding, I'll definitely say Daily Lives of Highschool Boys. You can pick it up and go whenever you want and it never gets old.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Spice and Wolf is great as well.</br></br>  Top tier games for crappy computers?

They're not "push X in a timely fashion to win". Either you're a really obvious troll or you grew up on Xbox. Eithe way, I pitty you.</br></br>  <br>Freelancer, if you're into space dogfights</br>  So I had a theory about the playable character possibilities in borderlands 3. I was thinking as the sirenesque character you would be that seraph from the end of the presequel or just from the ones you see throughout the game. Or you would be the sage/master of all the other sirens. Because remember that Maya did come from that monastery place. Anyway what else does /b/ have to spark my thoughts?  <br>Not sure what u mean by spatial dimensions. Dimensions are dimensions. We can influence the ones we live in and move through the one above us.</br>  I'm pretty sure the only real way to be happy is to procreate.  <br>The day you don't give a fuck whether she cares or not is the day you know you are over her.

How would you describe your country with one world?  tea  Hi /b/, I'm planning on buying a new phone. I'm not a richfag, just a student that makes the ends meet, but I was saving for a while and I'm pretty fucking tired of my current phone. I did some research and taking all the pros and cons, Galaxy S5 seems to be quite a good choice. Do you guys think there's a better alternative?<br> inb4 touchwiz <br>nova launcher/cyanogen mod<br> inb5 android lags, buy iPhone <br>I'm 100% sure I want an android smartphone<br> inb6 OnePlus One <br>I'm a Polishfag, hard for me to buy this phone.<br><br>So the question is, are there any other phones in similiar price range I should consider?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah, I don't have a problem with iPhones, not saying they are shitty phones. They are just to costly for me. That's all</br>  Note 3 master race reporting in<br>Touchwiz &gt; stock</br>  One plus one/two</blockquote>]
