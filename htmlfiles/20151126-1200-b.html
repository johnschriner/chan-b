HAHAHAHA</br>  <br>reroll :D</br>  Why do people react that harsh on murder? How it is not to be able to kill? I never felt murder and CP immoral.  <br><br>Well when you're as low as you are, I'm sure it seems like everybody is pretty high up.</br></br>  <br>You strike me as a 16 year old edge lord faggot.</br>  Who needs moral when you got dank memes  Babysitter femanon is here again, if someone is interested.<br>Sorry if it is earlier that what I planned, but I've got to work later in the evening.</br>  <br>Great read / great fap, thanks !</br>  <br>Essentially by the time i was masturbating (12-13 years old). I was able to stay home alone as a kid. I wish I had a qt babysitter at that age that would have helped me out. Seriously if hes masturbating he would have no problem with you helping him out.</br>  rip  Hey hey USA. <br>How many kids will you kill today?</br>  <br>I haven't seen this much dedication since since the "why can't atheists define atheism" threads</br>  Banning black people from reading? Damn, that's cold America.  <br>Same. I wonder how many individuals have posted eacheck, by now. I would like a full tally, for each, culminating in a Steel Cage Match at New Years Revolution.</br>  islam appreciation thread.<br><br>allahu akbar !</br></br>  <br>Have you ever really rode a jet ski? I mean really rode it.</br>  <br>oh shit</br>  People not getting the memo that christianity won.  MURICA TEST!<br>Are you a dumb Usasian? <br>If so you will disagree with the following statement...<br><br>SWITCHING DOUBLES YOUR CHACE OF WINNING</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Its not 50/50 either way, its 2/3 if you switch... You can look it up if you want, its some statistical trickery. You can even run a simulation and it will show you the probability is higher.</br></br>  <br>No it isn't you retard.<br>If you have 3 choices, and only 1 is a winner, do you have a 50% chance of choosing the winner?</br></br>  <br>Statistically it goes up since you go from chosing 1/3 to 1/2. Still 50/50</br>  First trips get it. <br>Roll fags</br>  Pure fucking autist in here  <br>its fucking true you fucking retard this thread is up with the same fucking picture more then three times a fucking day</br>  check em  anon,<br>how can I be happy?</br>  <br>Sure more dick.</br>  <br>get the right meds</br>  Crack, or heroin  <br>be happy</br>  <br>get alpha</br>  How screwed am I if use this on my PS3?  Inb4 "nigger"  <br>Depends what you mean by use, but as long as you don't flip it over while spraying there shouldn't be any issues.</br>  <br>Alright, thanks.</br>  Try to shock me.<br>Winner gets 10 $</br>        Why the fuck is the Starbucks cup thing even an issue? Help me make sense of this /b/.  Dubs decide what I do to my cats toes  <br><br>leave your cat alone</br></br>  Post em, rate others, describe your opinions on others  <br> gravity <br>Fucking hell.</br></br>  <br>Doing the same rn</br>  <br> crybaby <br>brutal</br></br>  People become atheists because they got picked on in high school. Rummage through an atheist's emotional baggage and you will find a pile of leftover teenage angst, a few cases of repressed rage at mommy and daddy, and an overpowering urge to feel superior wrapped around a stupendous amount of self-loathing. Ultimately the "atheist movement" is just another Internet fad, mostly made up of attention whores, stupid arrogant twats, bigots homosexuals inmoral fuckdicks.<br>Atheists think they can blame religion as the cause of conflict and most wars and murders that have ever occurred. <br>But we can look at history and see that atheistic societies tend to break down without religious morality controlling the actions of people.<br>Mao-Tse-Tung, Atheist: 40 million plus dead<br>Joseph Stalin, Atheist: 20 million plus dead<br>Adolf Hitler, Atheist: 15 million dead<br>Vladimir Lenin, Atheist: 5.5 million dead<br>Kim-Il-Sung, Atheist: 5 million dead<br>Pol Pot, Atheist: 2 million dead<br>Fidel Castro, Atheist: 1 million dead</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    NICE!!!!!!!
