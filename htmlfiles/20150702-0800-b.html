That would be what keeps me from cheating</br>  Yeah with my sister in law to boot, I drunk texted her and we started chatting over a couple of months.

Uh, why do ya ask?  <br>Interesting perspective/justification.</br>  Thought about it.  <br>This is the P.I she hired to get proof for the divorce.</br>  I did up until my current wife....and I have not cheated on her its been almost ten years....but I made that change for me  <br><br>What this guy said... right on bro.

Just had 10th anniversary last month. I cheated twice, both times with the same chick. I love my wife and shes a dime, but she is a 3/10 at sex.  <br>Why are you married then?</br>  <br>dUDE</br>  <br>I have and I regret it deeply. Before you cheat, jerk off and see if you still want to.</br>  <br>is homosex cheating?</br>  <br>part of his equation for happiness..</br>  <br> marrying someone that is 3/10 in your own opinion <br><br>U wot m8? I don't understand people like you. Was this your first girl? You cannot be this blindly in love to commit if the sex isn't good.</br></br></br>  <br>I only cheat with guys.<br>It's so fucking hot to come home to your wife and bend her over the bed, like you were an hour before, with a load of cum still in your ass.</br></br>  <br>5 yrs. never have.<br><br>though I ask you, is cheating, fucking? getting sentimentally involved? or?</br></br></br>  <br>Almost exactly the same story for me except two diff chicks. Having sex with my wife is like having sex with a corpse</br>  <br>It depends on if you're the top or bottom.</br>  <br>fuckin scumbag</br>  <br>I don't want to do anything after jerking off</br>  <br>lol why? would I be less a scumbag if I fucked some chick instead?</br>  <br>No</br>  <br><br>her face looks much nicer than her vag</br></br>  I haven't yet.    <br>try emptying the load of manspit out of your ass maybe? do you cry at night?</br>  Nope. Fantasize about it sometimes, but I jerk off and avoid tempting situations.  I do, I need sex and my wife and i have sex 3 times a year, we're both over worked, tired and don't make time for each other, we've been married for 2 years now, things changed for us when we had our baby, I don't even kiss her goodnight anymore.... it's sad, never used to be this way  Its only cheating if you get caught  <br>Costello: When I get married, I'm going to marry an ugly girl<br><br>Abbott: Why?<br><br>Costello: If I marry a pretty girl, she might leave me<br><br>Abbott: But an ugly girl might leave you too<br><br>Costello: Yeah, but who cares?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Any more pics like this?</br>  <br>No? Why would I? My life is awesome.<br><br><br>Hilarious. Too skinny for my tastes though. But the right amount of hair.</br></br></br></br>  <br>getting fucked isn't cheating, but fucking someone is</br>  <br>delightful photograph.</br>  <br><br>Never had homosex but im considering to cheat on my gf to fuck a guy in the ass for the first time</br></br>  <br>oh boy, you're doomed. you gone lose haffa whatchugot<br> LOL2YEARSALREADYSUCKS <br> CHOICES THAT COST YOU 1/2 OF EVERYTHINGLOL </br></br></br>  Have a Latin sexy 21 yo live in nanny im considering fucking, such a classic situation holy shit, do I do this? Never cheated before.  <br>Meh. Guy ass is nothing special. You want anal, fuck your wife in the ass.<br><br>You go to a guy for the one thing you can't have being married to a woman. Cock.</br></br></br>  I definitely fuck some strange on occasion, but that's the joys of an open relationship. No emotional investment in the chicks I bang, no cheating. Feels good man  <br>How are you too tired and don't make time for your wife but have the energy and time to get another woman and manage that whole situation?</br>  <br>top, and I unload at glory holes.</br>  <br>Would with her</br>  <br>Basically - when he has time and capable - she doesn't have the time nor wants it. Duh.</br>    of course. Any attractive guy who doesn't get enough sex and is married, is going to cheat. If you don't then ur whipped. <br><br>I cheat probably 3-4 times a year. So not that often. Getting the occasional strange on the side helps let me be a happy good husband with my wife... <br><br>So really it's a kind of marriage counseling. <br><br>I'm doing it for our marriage.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What if your wife would have emotional investment in YOU?</br>  <br>boys give the best head</br>  I'm married. For 12 years. <br>I have cheated on my wife, but only with one woman. <br>I fuck that one woman every now and again, over the course of several years. She is in a long term relationship as well. <br>When she and I are together, we don't have any of our "real world" pressures. We can just lay around naked in our hotel room and fuck/suck/sleep/cuddle for a day/night. <br>Then we are back to our regular lives. <br>Sometimes I wish I could run away with her, but then reality would set in. It is pretty cool to just have someone you can fuck/suck/sleep/cuddle with for a day with no screaming kids/grass needs cut/laundry needs done/work is e-mailing me/whatever.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>that's because people are not naturally monogamous.</br>  <br>it's easy, she gets home from work late, I'm home, she showers, gets into to bed, complains she's tired or some shit, I get it, she works a lot , but we aren't intimate anymore because of it, we live busy lives and my side chicken is always available, I'm not the only guy in this situation, it happens a lot, and it goes both ways</br>  <br>She does, much like I have emotional investment in her. That's why we're married.</br>  <br>She doesn't like anal. And I'm curious to fuck a guy</br>  <br>Sounds like an excellent arrangement. Do you get any guilt at all?</br>  Yes because she's frigid. I have a serious prostitute habit.  Yes. I have cheated with several different women.  <br>wonder who she is letting into her magical cave while she tells you she's "working late."</br>    <br>none. She was my high school sweetheart, and I probably should have married her instead.</br>  <br>Try sticking your finger in her ass. That usually gets them jump started</br>  I've never cheated on my wife. Never really had the desire to either. I jerk off to porn, but doesn't everyone?  <br>So, is the over working worth it?<br><br>No.<br><br>Live simpler and quit buying so much junk you never have time to use anyway.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fucking excellent post, 10/10.</br>  I did with my ex wife. She was a hitch so I fucked anything I could. I was with over 100 women in 12 different states before I finally got rid of her  <br>Of course<br>Don't ask stupid questions</br></br>    <br>This is a really stupid post. Don't use semantics to justify your cheating. Just admit it.</br>  <br>...and give her the HIV you just received.</br>  <br>then you shouldn't have wifed her, dumbass. My wife sucks dick, eats jizz, gets tied up spanked and fucked in the ass. <br><br>And no I don't cheat on her, why would I?</br></br></br>  Wedding cake is the biggest anaphrodisiac in the world apparently.  before we got married, and we were on a break, does that count as cheating?<br><br>also, chick I fucked was a lesbian</br></br>  Yes, every week, tinder isla a great friend  <br>if she was, or wasn't I wouldn't mind it, I get energized and happy and become a new man after a sesh with my fuck buddy, makes me a happier man at home</br>  <br>I hear you - 13 years this fall for me.<br><br>I -<br>1 - fuck young women 19-27 yo every once in a while<br>2 - had a longer term affair,but shit got too serious on her end, but she liked to get ass fucked really hard so I went with it for a while. saw her husband last weekend and talked to him for a bit. Feels pretty powerful to fuck a guys wife and have him want to be your friend.<br><br>3 - let a guy suck my dick a couple times<br><br>4 - had a fat woman pay me $150 to fuck her.<br><br>But as for your disappearing act...I am trying to set more of those opportunities up with my wife. having her parents take the kids and go away for 3 days. Wife is still hot and likes to fuck when she isnt exhausted and is fucking good at it...but that kids to sport and work and yard and ....<br><br>It sucks. gots to make the time.<br><br>Wife knows I fuck the young ones sometimes, but not how often and does not know about the $150 or the long term.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> occasional strange on the side <br><br>?</br></br></br>  Lul i cheat on mine with my exgf who married someone else. We have more sex together then with our own spouses  <br>That's pretty handy. I'm in a similar situation. Was seeing a girl from work for a few months and it was as you say, escapism. That ended and now I have a Skype sex buddy who I met through Tinder. Not actually MET her In person but we cam sex lots. Not sure I want to get to the next step though as I think she is more into me than me in to her. But she is dirty and likes to play. She only lives a short distance away so maybe...</br>  Not married but I'm seriously debating whether I should invite my ex over to give me a little head  I never cheated because my dick and balls was severed in an accident.  <br>consider it all the time, we talk about how to fix our relationship all the time</br>  <br><br>that cant possibly go wrong.. ow wait , it can. It will.</br></br>  <br>Get the fuck out of here, O.W Grant.</br>  So should I fuck the nanny or not damn it?  theres not enough posts in a thread for me to tell my story but let me summarize:<br><br> i spent years trying to better our lives through hard work and career advancement <br> i make good money now, but she is changed <br> she works 50 miles away 3 days a week and stays at her gay male friends house 3 nights a week <br> i tried to explain the only reason i married her was to have someone here when i get home from work to talk to  <br> she wants me to quit my very successful and fun career and go back to doing what I did in my 20s: teaching english in foreign countries <br> i tried to explain to her how hard life is when you have very little money <br> she doesnt care she just wants to travel <br> she wants us to "live our lives before we are tied down with kids" <br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/625192035#p625196642">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I've done it three times. <br><br>First time I was so disappointed in myself and the entire flight home I was so nervous that I almost vomited. <br><br>Second time I did it was much easier and with a fucking pig that I'm disgusted even happened. <br><br>Third time was with my ex-girlfriend and her friend and that was just 'cause I wanted to relive a bit of the old crazy. <br><br>Each time got easier, but I wouldn't do it again - I just felt terrible about myself and I don't want to ruin the trust we have.
