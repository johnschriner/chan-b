[ I need your help /b/ros, what is this shit?  <br>Looks like the warts, mate.</br>  <br>You got warts nigga, good luck with that</br>  Human papillomavirus (HPV)  <br>its aids bruh</br>  warts bruh  Kek  you been sleepin around m8?<br>dont fuck da nasty hoes</br>    <br>Human papilomavirus. Only way to get rid of it is with cryosurgery.</br>  <br>stick sharpie in peehole</br>  Not want to scare you but yuck  <br>Human papiloma virus, dude. <br>Go to docs, get antibiotics asap</br></br>  <br>Lice eggs</br>  That there is faggot warts, and it can only come from faggot's ass. Enjoy a short life.  <br>pretty sure they're skin tags. It's what fat people get in their rolls.<br><br>Basically, because you have a fat ass FUPA because you're a fat shit with a pooch that rolls over your dick, the skin rubs and forms them. <br><br>You should probably get off /b/ and go here:<br><br>www.4chan.org/fit/</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  virus <br>  get antibiotics <br><br>wat</br></br></br></br>  <br>you do realize antibiotics only battle bacteria?<br> pls no bait </br></br>  <br>No mate this is warts. Hopefully op is trolling.</br>  <br>It looks like a hand on a dick</br>  <br> /b/ <br> asking for advice </br></br>  <br>No. OP don't listen to this fuckwit.<br><br>This looks like a case of PPP (Pearly Penile Papules) but on the base of the penis. basically these are just sweat glands, and chances are that you've had them for a very long time. <br><br>The optimal surgical option is currently is with laser removal. It's very likely that if you do have this surgery then you will lose sensation in the surgical region. Most patents don't complain though.<br><br>tl;dr don't even read this, just go to a dermatologist and get a confirmation</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>hi OP.<br><br>they look to me like mollescum. its not dangerous or bad but very annoying, can take months to kill. but its just a harmless virus.<br><br>though it may be HPV, the strain that causes genital warts. this is also not a big deal, even less so. i have HPV (doctor initially thought herpes than mollescum). you can get this liquid to put on it and it kills it over the course of two weeks.<br><br>the down side to HPV is that you will have it for two years, maybe more. you might not get another outbreak of warts, but every single person that even rubs against your bare genitals is at risk of catching it. its not a big deal, it goes away and isnt bad, but a lot of people avoid you just cuz of the warts. considering how harmless it is i dont recommend telling partners during a hook up, but do tell your long term partners so they are aware, but explain that its not a big deal.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  It's called, GO TO A DOCTOR DUMB SHIT.  <br>Those are only.on the penis (note pearly PENILE papules). Stop giving bad advice please. Op I'm sorry but you have warts go to the clinic.</br>  <br> considering how harmless it is i dont recommend telling partners during a hook up <br>HPV can cause cancer in women.</br></br>  <br><br>doc is gonna prescribe you sth for HPV, like aldara, which will make your dick bleed for weeks.<br><br>try regular wart spray with liquid nitrogen. <br><br>thank me later</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Condyloma.<br><br>basically genital warts. u fucked some bad pussy. <br><br>go to a clinic and they will burn it off.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>underrated post, kek</br>  <br>i think its your scrotum, buttmunch</br>  <br><br>Nerve gas receptors</br></br>  <br>Boat nectar</br>  <br>no i'm a Doctor</br>  <br><br>sure, if you're a fucking dumbfuck.<br><br>HPV that causes gential warts does NOT overlap with HPV that cuases cancer in men or women. OP of course could catch these other strains that cause cancer (and show no symptoms) but genital warts does not mean that at all.<br><br>also, any woman who is smart already has her HPV vaccinations.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>HIV virus and AIDS syndrome.</br>  http://www.myfoxal.com/story/296616<wbr>83/tcss-investigating-allegations-o<wbr>f-inappropriate-employee-student-re<wbr>lationship</wbr></wbr></wbr>  Okay, and you're pasting your RSS feed here why?  <br>Bruhh.. rly?</br>  This should explain everything to everyone who just joined  <br>It just keeps growing.....

I'm 31. My wife hasn't slept with me in a long time, actually I can't remember when the last time was. I work and... that's it. I have no idea what to do with my life. I'm serious. And please don't tell me to get another pussy. I lost interest in sex.<br><br>I feel weird. I feel like I'm on the edge of loosing the will to live.<br><br>Any ideas?</br></br></br></br>  <br>travel the world</br>  <br>Give me your money and go innawoods</br>  <br>Video games.</br>  <br>Not enough cash. Most of my money goes into the rent and food.</br>  you need to go somewhere and not tell someone and do something bad.  <br>Congrats on not being an edgy faggot. Good for you</br>  Go to a therapist or counselor.<br>Talk to your wife.<br>Find out what YOUR dreams are/what you want to do.<br>Stop being so fucking complacent - you are in the prime of your life.<br>You sound depressed as fuck, it will take ongoing change and commitment to becoming a better person to battle it. You may need anti-depressant meds to help (wellbutrin FTW).</br></br></br></br>  Do this<br><br>1-Make hunter on WoW<br>2-Name him WalterPalmer<br>3-Aquire pet lion<br>4-????<br>5-Profit</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sounds like you need a hobby other than 4chan first of all.<br>Gardening, shooting, innawoodsing, taking care of a pet. Or you need to live somewhere different like out in the country with your own space to be happy and just don't know it yet.</br></br>  <br>You need to find a reason to live. These are not:<br>A job<br>Another person (your wife or anyone else)<br>Playing Video games<br>Watching Movies<br>Listening to music.<br><br>Something that would get you going in the right place would be:<br><br>CREATE music, art, film, games, etc.<br>BUILD your body by eating better and exercising at least 5 days a week. <br>START slow with anything new you want to do. <br>DO NOT GIVE UP EVEN WHEN SHIT DOESNT WORK OUT.<br><br>I thought I wanted to learn piano, tried it for 9 months and didn't care for it, went to guitar and loved it, been playng it for years ever since.<br><br>I wanted to run. Ran for a year and made it to 6k runs easily but it wasn't making me happy and I hit a plateu. Started swimming and have been for 6 months and am enjoying it immensly.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nature helps me a lot relax. Go in like a spiritual journey for you, even though it is something small. Do random acts of kindness to random people, trust me you will feel good. You first have to figure out whats wrong with you then fight that shit asap! You can do it!</br>  Go to therapy by yourself.<br>Get some anti-depressants to go with the talk therapy.<br>Ask wife to go to couples therapy, tell her you feel like you're losing her.<br>Find friends outside the house, make sure they have hobbies you can latch onto.<br>Join a hobby club for sports or board games or somthing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The only reason you have lost interest in sex is because you aren't having it. Your testosterone levels have probably dropped because you have been denied sex by that ungrateful bitch and depending on your job, you have probbaly been sitting for 80% of the last few years. <br><br> get up <br> get some kind of hobby (preferably something active and something that will really push you to your limits) <br> go out and hit on some girls. Nothing too serious.

Later I tired to talk again and she was just annoyed, so I stopped. I read that if you start lifting that she will naturally start getting interest. But nothing happened so far.<br><br>Thanks everyone for the kind answers.

Fuck your job.<br>Do some stuff.</br></br>  <br>This doesn't work in the long game OP.<br>Just because you get some muscles doesn't mean your marriage will magically begin to work again.<br>If she doesn't want to talk, you need to take action which may mean separation. Even if it is just for awhile, you can't force yourself to stay in a shitty relationship.<br>You should not feel obligated to get muscles just so she sexually likes you again.<br><br>Can you post a pic? If not can you describe yourself physically?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You need to go slow with this stuff or you can fuck up your legs pretty good.<br>http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2<wbr>/2_3/181.shtml</wbr></br></br>  <br> I try think about what to do with my life, what would really be something that I always wanted to do, but I can't seem to find anything interesting... <br>Same boat. The solution is to "find yourself" like a teenager taking a gap year before college. Meaning you have to fill your calendar with random shit you're not interested in. Activities that put you in touch with new people at least 4 times a week. Make sure each activity repeats once or twice in a month, but otherwise keep them diverse.<br><br>After 6 months, you should have found at least 2 activities you wanna do as a hobby. If not, start a whole new set of rotating activities.</br></br></br></br>  <br> become teacher <br> fuck hot student <br> post pics to photobucket <br> ???? <br> profit </br></br></br></br></br>  Underrated solution: sunlight.<br><br>Get at least 3 housrs of pre-noon direct sunlight. You've heard of "seasonal affective disorder" aka SAD affecting people in winter. If you normally stay indoors, it can affect you year round, but the right wavelengths of light hitting your eyes and skin(chest or arms) can fix it.</br></br>  <br>Downsize your life. Save money. Generate energy and bring yourself back to life by working out</br>  <br><br><br>This man gets it. This is how it's done.</br></br></br>  <br>shit i didn't even know 3mi was 5k. I certainly want to do it again but I'm going to wait 2days. Obviously i wasn't sprinting the whole time, I would have fucking died. I'd say it was about 60%/40% jogging/walking. I'd kinda just run until i exhausted myself, then walked until I could start jogging again. stayed off pavement most of the time.</br>  <br>what movie is that? I recognise it</br>  <br>whats her first name?</br>  <br>Tell your cunt of a wife to fuck herself and run off. Take the money. And find something fun to do.<br><br>Go skydiving. I dunno.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't get new pussy then. Just be by yourself. You can try learning relaxation techniques or travel. Retry your old hobbies.</br>  <br>You can still get shin splints doing that if you're not careful, and that can put you out of commission for weeks. I wouldn't go any harder than you already did for awhile.</br>  <br>Thats the problem around 30... Then we re thinking about life and if we are on right track.</br>  <br>Event Horizon</br>  Could be worse. I'm 24 and directionless in life.  <br>I was there.<br>Its really a tough run to get over.<br>The reason things suck is that you crave for less responsability.<br>This craving must stop. You need to become the alpha male you were born to be. Not only in body but much more importantly in mind.<br>Life is as it is. Teach yourself to love it or your going to hate it. It will take afew month AT LEAST.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Showing people a shittier situation doesn't make them actually feel better about theirs.</br>  <br>suicide on stream</br>  <br>Yeah I kinda feel lucky in that sense. I was a major drug addict and alcoholic from 16 to 29. Sobered up at 29 and went back into college to become an addiction therapist (cliche, I know). I'm 31 now and 2 years left until I have my masters. Feel like life is just beginning. It's awesome.</br>  Jizz all over your stomach and let it absorb into your skin  <br>I did that once about 10-12 years ago.<br>It hurt for afew days.....<br>I think it was part of an anxiety attack. But at the time it helped. I did it on bike off-road in a forest.</br></br></br>  Either kill yourself or video games.  <br>It's called depression, you moron.<br>Go see a doctor.</br></br>  <br>  travel the world <br>  no need money <br>kek, please explain how</br></br></br>    <br>Thats the way to do it... Every day is a new day to start something. It s just up to you if you grap that opportunity or not.</br>  <br>That's normal, especially for millenials wher job prospects aren't that great, debt is high, and nobody gets married because they are afraid of picking the wrong person like so many divorced parents did.</br>  <br><br>These.</br></br>  <br> You can still get shin splints doing that if you're not careful <br><br>yeah i think i felt one coming on right as i got back to my house, but it feels fine now. I was actually surprised how well I held up. I didn't know how far it was until i got home and checked the alternate route that I took. I guess all the shit on my mind recently made it easy to ignore the distance. It's damn near therapeutic, especially at 11pm when there isnt really a lot of noise in the suburbs. that being said I think i might only go 2mi next time. Havent decided yet. I feel like all of the "dont force yourself" and "take it at your own pace" rhetoric in the article linked is exaggerated and counter productive. I'm 19, I'm not going to break a hip. If I cramp up or hurt, I'll take a break. It's not rocket science.</br></br></br>  <br>Your wife is a selfish cunt. Either you tell her to start giving you some, or you're leaving.<br><br>Listen /b/ro, when you aren't fucking with your wife somethings definitely wrong. Either your relationship is shit, or she's fucking cheating on you. Either way, she's a bitch and you should fucking leave her. Go find someone else you can be happy with, get that old adventurous vibe going again.</br></br></br>  <br>Like a hobo. Beg people for rides and couches to sleep on. Pay by doing favors (either fix computers, clean houses, or suck dick). It can be done if you abandon all sense of comfort in exchange for adventure.</br>  <br>I didn't even get to go to high school or college. I've had a fucked up life. Not making excuses. I just don't know what to do.</br>  <br> invent something that's useful <br> learn something useful <br> shoot some niggers <br> travel the world <br> fuck some chinks <br> get into politics <br> hoard some money <br> make some friends <br> play some games <br> cure cancer  <br> evolve cancer <br> build weapons <br> destroy weapons <br> feed the world  <br> starve the world <br>the possibilities are endless</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well the reason that running and lifting didn't work out for me at first was partially because I did force myself. I would overdo it the first time out and end up so sore I couldn't do any type of exercise for days. Those days of doing nothing to "recover" became longer and longer and I fell out of the habit. When I got back into it the last time I paced myself more and now it's all part of my routine.</br>  <br>i know shit people that actually make them better sadly</br>  <br>Yeah I've been thinking about a lot of shit and had the spontaneous compulsion to get away from the spot i was in. My brother had my car at the time so fuckit, I'll run. it probably wasn't the smartest thing. If I tripped over something in the dark and hit my head I wouldn't have been found for hours. I think Ill start earlier next time.</br>  <br>I repeat, that's normal for millenials. At least you know what you should do: get a GED so you can eventually get a job thats full time (even if it is still flipping burgers). Most 24 year olds have a diploma and maybe even a bachelors, they still don't know what to do next.</br>  <br>It's a lot of fun. I've been a bit depressed for the past few months. I'm going to go back to being homeless within the week. Back to riding around everywhere, dumpster diving for food, going to bed and getting up early with a regular sleeping pattern. Haven't felt this bad for a while, so hopefully this will pull me out of it. Get my motivation back and get moving again. Got things I want to do.</br>  <br> At least you know what you should do: get a GED so you can eventually get a job thats full time (even if it is still flipping burgers) <br><br>And where do I go from there? Work minimum wage till I'm 60? I'm never going to have a good career.</br></br></br>  <br>Where do you sleep? Where do you shit? Aren't you afraid of getting attacked by other hobos?</br>  <br>Find a hobby looser</br>  <br> I feel weird. I feel like I'm on the edge of loosing the will to live. <br>depression<br><br>change things around, get out the rut, do something new. And soon, and regularly, before you sink so far down you can't get out.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Try to become a hero or watch yourself turn into a villain. <br><br>In short - try a new career, if not, become a politician.</br></br></br>  <br>What is your job anon?</br>  <br>Good advice. Maybe his hobby can be learning how to spell "loser" correctly, you retarded faggot.</br>  <br>Web developer. Mostly PHP.</br>  <br>If you work min wage you qualify for food stamps. That will give you some wriggle room.</br>  <br>this is some of the worst advice i have heard on this board. You must be in your teens.</br>  <br> you qualify for food stamps. <br><br>So yeah. I'll be working min wage till I'm fucking 60. I'll never know a good life. I'll be a retail slave living on shit money for the rest of my life.</br></br></br>  <br>well wtf man how high is your rent? Why are you spending it all on rent and food? Do you drink?</br>    <br>From there you'll at least be in the same boat as everyone else who is under-employed. Minimum wage at a full time job is better than at a part time job.<br><br>But to get out of minimum wage, the best bet is to get a job at some place that likes you so much they will pay for your college degree so you can do even better work for them. I know someone who volunteered as a substitute teacher in an elementary school until the school paid for them to get bachelors in teaching and be a full time math teacher. The same can work for hih tech startups and other companies.</br></br></br>  <br>Industrial areas are good because they have no one around at night. Rooftops are great if you can access them. Anywhere there is no one really. But I already have a few stashes here and there. Shopping centres are good for that. Truck stops and universities for showers. Never really meet or associate with other homeless. They're mostly losers. Only been found asleep three times in as many years. Luckily none of them decided to beat the shit out of me or something. Most people are nice like that.</br>  well... you can shoot yourself in the face with a shotgun<br><br>or just drag out your meaningless existence<br><br>the choice is yours<br><br>i highly suggest death by heroine overdose, i think it's beautiful</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>you need jesus in your life<br><br>and kids</br></br></br></br>  <br>Im saying get on food stamps and save a little. The extra cash will help you feel more secure and maybe you find a better job. Or just blow it on alcohol/drugs. Anything is better than just being miserable.</br>  <br> Any ideas? <br>Midlife crisis anon. <br>But it could be worse, I'm 32, single, and still not getting laid.</br></br></br>  <br> well wtf man how high is your rent? <br>Depends on where he lives. If you're near NYC or DC or LA or SF... rent can easily be $1300 a one bedroom with no toilets</br></br>  what the fuck is up with all these positive comments and /adv/?<br><br>i am disappoint /b/<br><br> for shame!</br></br></br></br>  <br>I have around 1700 Euro after tax every month. rent is around 700 Euro. I pay 180 for train to work. Food, internet, and phone are around 500 to 600 per month. You should get an idea.</br>  <br>Learn to fly an airplane, OP.</br>  <br> you need jesus in your life <br><br>Yeah. An imaginary friend who says feel guilty for being human (muh sins) and worship me. Also don't love this life and world. And just be an all around bigot.</br></br></br>  I feel you OP, I also have no clear reason to live. But I do enjoy life and live for myself. Being a slave to the whole "living in the moment" thing creates such void in which reasons are not needed, only desired. <br>One thing I wish for though, is creating something totally authentic, that seems like it could be joyful.</br>  <br>kids is the last thing he needs. Just start living more for yourself op. Just everyday start doing more things you enjoy for you not for anybody else and little by little you will find your way.</br>  <br> I'll be a retail slave <br>Or you can be prompted and become a slave overseer. A manager position is pretty good on your resume for when you change careers in 5 years (to whatever you qualify for)</br></br>  <br>Because most are grown ups and know what OP is going through.<br><br><br>True. NYC apartments are fucking ridiculously expensive. Even for crappy ones.<br><br>You have to be making at least $300k a year if you wanna live a good life in NYC. LA might be more suitable.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  you can always kik this slut<br><br> his hole <br><br>she doesnt do pics, but she sexts n shit<br><br>changed my life</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>dude, you pay 180€ a month for the train? I pay like 300€ a year</br>  <br>Dude then move. Its not like he is destitute. You have enough money to move to a new cheaper place.</br>  <br>er no space<br><br> hishole <br><br><br>mfblazed.tiff</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do some drugs...<br>Shrooms or acid is a good start in your case.<br>or maybe some molly if you want to feel extremely happy for a couple of hours.</br></br></br>  If /b/ can count to 10 with ten different consecutive posts I will release her nudes.
