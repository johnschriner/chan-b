Their mom posted on facebook somewhere.</br>  China<br>Retarded babies in China are only killed if they're born female. China's "one male, non-retarded child only" policy was adopted in 1976 during an era of rampant industrialization and infant retardation. The boom in babies born in pools of toxic sludge rose dramatically for nearly a decade, which is proven to correlate to infant retardation. In 1972, 1 in every 55 children was born a female retard and had to be destroyed. China saw little economic effects from retarded female babies, as all female babies were burned in many factory coal burners.
