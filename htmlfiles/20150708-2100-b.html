Eh kills aliens and doesn't afraid of anything.  <br>Shut up!!!!! That is EXACTLY what he wanted you to post! GO AWAY REDDIT/SUMMER/NEWFAGS YOU ARE NOT WELCOME HERE<br>∆<br>∆∆</br></br></br>  <br>I'm excited to cast my vote for Bernie Sanders!!</br>  <br><br>i know sanders would look better than hillary.<br>and not because muh misogyny and anti-feminazi rhetoric but because the clinton family is corrupt in my opinion<br><br>all sides are corrupt.<br>just don't vote. that's our only option <br>#apathy16</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Very enthusiastic about supporting and voting for sanders  tl;dr but it is definitely worth it  <br>Not voting is the same as giving your vote to a 80 year old war vet who votes for Donald Trump. <br><br>For the love of Pete please vote... Everyone here vote and give a shit.</br></br></br>  <br>His campaign contributions are all from labor unions and are public you moron</br>  <br>please don't vote<br>nobody should vote</br></br>  <br>Lol?</br>  <br>He's been saying the same things since the 90s when lib were hated 10x more than today</br>  he's just another old white dude coming to butt-fuck the american middle-class  <br>you don't have to be an ascended master or a shaman.. but the first part<br><br>"ignoramus level"<br> there is absolutely NOTHING conspiratorial about anything <br><br>what level are you at?<br><br><br>he sounds too good to be true. and people can still be paid up in stone cold cash.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I love Bernie. Anyone who has studied politics for years knows what this man has done. He has turned Vermont into one of the most beautiful states in America, never ran a negative add, predicted everything he said such as how the Iraq War would make us look to the world and put us into even more debt, and is running without taking donations from business which he plans to break up. <br><br>I actually like these elections coming up I am really hopeful with more young people are voting than ever. You can see America shift to big boy pants. Tough issues such as climate change are not debatable. <br><br>Ran Paul also looks good to me. Honestly if Bernie does not win, I sure hope he does. America does not have a right and left. America has a far right and a moderate group. If Ron is elected and brings common sense and makes the right the best again while making the left more left and less moderate, we might actually have the ideal system again for now until I pray a third party comes in.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't agree with most of his political views, but I respect the hell out of him for not trying to pretend he is someone he's not.</br>  <br>What in the fuck is that even supposed to mean?</br>  <br>So you are basically a republican<br><br><br>This<br><br><br>Riding Hillary's dick THIS hard.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Can't wait for him to be president  <br>america has the illusion of the right and left, as well as the spectrum in between<br>america has the illusion of pepsi or coke<br>america has the illusion of choice<br><br>the choices have been made for us<br>a vote for president is a vote for tyranny</br></br></br></br></br></br>  all i offer is the truth..<br><br>nothing more..</br></br>  <br><br>This could not be more wrong actually. People that say this make me mad as well and completely take out system for granted.</br></br>  Let's not forget that the Clintons killed Vince Foster, regardless of Shillary's other countless corporate pandering bullshit.<br><br>Bernie is not the Messiah, much like Obama wasn't, and I disagree with him on a number of things, but I appreciate his genuineness. Whether or not the system can be broken, I can see this guy at least fucking shit up for a few people.<br><br>But it'll be Clinton vs. Bush, again.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.</br>  <br>fuck you jace</br>  <br>Marylin Manson</br>  <br> this </br>    Bretty gud guy  <br>because i am exercising my right to NOT vote i am taking the system for granted?<br><br>no...<br>i do not willingly submit myself to tyrants. i didn't ask to be born here... and if i could leave i probably would, but to be honest it sucks other places too so the options really are limited.<br><br>have you ever been outside the US?<br>people who have traveled outside the US don't always fall into the same ilk as the die hard nationalists who have never left their hometown</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>America does have a choice. People are just losing faith in the system. Everyone has a voice and yet we have the lowest voter turnout of any nation. I have visited nations over and over that their people do not have a voice unless they riot. To live in a system that does not let you say anything unless is propaganda is sickening. The fact people like you can say stupid shit and people defend that no matter how dumb it is nothing short of a modern day utopia compared to how things were in the past.<br><br>If people would speak out and have a voice things could change and for the better. For now put that edgey sword down.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It isn't your money, faggot. Why do you care?</br>  <br>Fiscally conservative, socially liberal. Anti-union, anti-corporate welfare, and I think cops and firefighters are way overpaid. I think all immigration should be legal. Sign them up at the border and make them citizens - then start taxing them. I also think we should abolish income taxes and convert to a consumption tax (national sales tax). <br><br>I don't fit any political party's mold.</br></br></br>  <br><br>  but to be honest it sucks other places too so the options really are limited. <br><br>Then shut the fuck up you over privileged faggot.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> I don't fit any political party's mold. <br><br>Gosh, you're just so unique like a snowflake.</br></br></br></br>  <br>seems like a genuine person. Thats what we need. I will enjoy voting for him.</br>  <br><br>I think his politic is too smart and rational for the average hurr durr dumbfuck retard muricans</br></br>  I'd like to thank the academy...  <br><br>Yeah, fuck the middle class. Billionaires should pay far less tax as a percentage of income than the middle class.</br></br>  <br>America has been the #1 highest GDP nation for some time now. Now the media has america convinced that it is the poorest country in the world and they have to fix it by destroying the most capitalistic country in the world by voting for socialism.<br><br>America has not been through the "oh shit socialism does not work" phase like other countries, so maybe this is the fall for the worlds economical power house.</br></br></br>  The only hope the United States will ever have in becoming a viable country to live in for anyone and everyone.  <br><br>You're right, because the "smaller" contribution of one billionaire pays for literally tens of thousands of leechers like yourself.<br><br>Or maybe we should tax the shit out of them so they decide to make their money elsewhere....oh wait, that's already happening.<br><br> But muh welfare... </br></br></br></br></br></br>  Makes Hilary look republican hes got my vote  <br><br>Nigger do you even capitalism? Or do you think the internet you're using to communicate your bullshit was built on good will? If you have a problem that others make more than you then there are a litany of countries you can move to.</br></br>  So I see a lot of people in this thread saying how bad socialism is. So let me clarify what it is and why people think we need it.<br><br>Socialism is the idea of taxing the wealthy a larger amount than usual to give income to those who do not have it in an attempt for them to move up the social latter, and then be the rich ones paying for others in a non stop rope grabbing. <br><br>Most economics agree that wealth inequality will keep going up in America. It is already worse than it has ever been. Socialism is a call to help people who are stuck in minimum wage jobs and can not move up due to income where as before America had so many jobs they went to Europe to get more people to work here. <br><br>If inequality goes up more and more there will not be people to buy most good and America will cease to be a land of moving up the latter and better lives.<br><br>Socialism would fix this for the most part as seen in countries like Denmark. The down side is that people lose more money at the top to help those who for better or worse could not or did not want to get it themselves. Most people leave socialist countries for lands like America that let you keep money so we might lose our brain drain to us if we do this move. <br><br>Basic incomes and a robot revolution will make it worse, and as of now socialism is the only fix till we get more smart people to come up with other ways to make a fair system for everyone. Hope this helps.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I agree with most of his ideas but I'm not sure he will make a good president.  <br><br><br>Not him but billionaires should pay the same percentage as middle income Americans. I'm not for extremely progressive tax policies but abolishing the capital gains tax, for example, is perfectly reasonable.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Better than Shillary, that's for sure.</br></br>  <br>Everyone that the only rich people in this world are billionaires who have 365 paid vacation days.<br>So everyone get's jealous and demands money from the lottery-winning rich.<br>When really the rich are people who either work their asses off or thought of an original idea. Unfortunately the envious bastards take all of your money becuase their to lazy utilize the biggest economy on the earth.</br></br></br>  BERNIE<br>S<br>A<br>N<br>D<br>E<br>R<br>S</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I was born in Vermont and so I have known of Bernie for quite a while now. My father has met him before too. I'll tell that story.<br>My dad was eating at a restaurant and went to the bathroom. As he got to the door, Bernie comes out. My dad greets him and Bernie responds, shakes his hand, and goes on his way quickly, you know the usual politician thing. My dad goes to the bathroom and smells one of the rankest shits he has ever smelled. He described it as spicy and somewhat palpable. Since Bernie had exited the bathroom prior, no doubt it was him, and that was probably why he was in a rush. <br>Thought I'd share that story.</br></br>  He's a dumbfuck who only appeals to teenagers. <br><br>Everyone thinks Socialism sounds good the first time they hear about it. As people get more informed, more experienced, and just see the bs which comes from the left in general, they get over it.<br><br>Sanders is a rare example of someone drinking the lefty coolaid for decades yet has actually achieved something with his life. For that I have a begrudging respect. But I'd never want him in the white house.<br><br>I mean, he thinks Greece is doing the right thing, ffs.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Most wealth in inherited.</br></br>  <br><br>His initials is BS</br></br>  <br>Firefighters tho? do you mean in pensions? close fam is fdny, they're not making too much bank as a lieutenant. plus they actually risk their lives and have bonds with the community</br>  <br> 2015 <br> Voting Republican or Democrat <br> Shilling this hard <br><br>Jesus H can't you fucks think for yourselves? Maybe think outside the box?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well then he lost my vote. I want a president who will linger until the next guy enters the bathroom just so he call take a big, deep whiff and go "Smell that? I did that." before putting on sunglasses and sauntering off with a big grin on his face.</br>  <br>nice b8 m8</br>  <br>lol and obama's middle name is Hussein. DEEP CONSPIRACY SHIZ SATANISTS SPIRITUAL AWAKENING</br>  <br>Radical</br>  <br>socialist thief</br>  <br>http://verdantlabs.com/politics_of_<wbr>professions/<br>The republicans are busy making money and the democrats are busy not making money.<br><br>Democrats cant find out why they're not rich</br></br></br></wbr></br>  <br><br>  Condescendingly decides no one knows what Socialism is in a thread where we're all talking about Socialism <br><br>  Describes a progressive income tax and wealth redistribution, not socialism. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Edgy summer fag detected</br>  <br>He was originally independent in Vermont, but running democrat ensure a clear path if he wins/loses to Hillary. genius political move.</br>  <br>Not bait</br>  <br><br> taxing the wealthy a larger amount than usual to give income to those who do not have it in an attempt for them to move up the social latter, and then be the rich ones paying for others in a non stop rope grabbing.  <br><br>First of all, no.<br><br>Second, capitalism is built on a reward system. I was born rich in Lake Forest, IL. In the 80s it was the highest per capita income city in the country. You know that house with the Ferrari in Ferris Buelers day off? That was a basically my neighbor. Mr T lived down the street, I would pass his house daily on the way to school. His address was 395 Green Bay Rd.<br><br>Commodities took a shit and my dad went from hero to zero (as far as money, he's a great man). I've had to make decisions in my life like gas or cigarettes or food. Help was not available from parents.<br><br>I went to a state school and used financial LOANS (not aid). <br><br>I got my education while working a full time job. I graduated with a bachelors in business and started my own business. Now I'm looking for a house in Southern California (500k+) and can basically afford everything I need and most of what I want.<br><br>People like you who say I should be taxed more literally make me ill. Capitalism is based on a reward system. Those who generate more wealth are seen as more desirable and they are rewarded for it. They generate wealth that pays for bullshit that leeches like you promote. Socialism is an absolute joke and requires that everyone be on board mentally. It's a utopian dream. You can't get two people to agree on anything, much less an entire nation. Fortunately, logic usually prevails but it is still sickening to see anyone in this country promoting socialism. You're basically saying I didn't work, but give me give me give me. Get off your lazy fucking ass and get to it. If you're unable because you're not smart enough, clever enough, talented enough, etc, then you deserve to be EXACTLY where you are in life and no one owes you a dime.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gr8 b8 m8</br>  <br><br>Better than Hillary.</br></br>  <br>mama mia</br>  <br><br>You're a dumb Muriderp. Between me and my wife we earn around $180,000 USD per year. My brother earns $300,000 USD per year. I am from a wealthy family.<br><br>My brother pays ~40% effective income tax on his $300,000 yet the average person earning 100million a year pays around 10% income tax. Some even pay no income tax.<br><br>Your logic: Wanting the rich to pay the same amount of income tax as the middle class = Socialism.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>First time I've ever donated money to a campaign. Attended the rally in Wisconsin with 10,000 other people. This man is the real Mccoy, and he has my vote.</br>  <br>And?<br>If it's inherited and not worked for, then there is no income, nothing to tax.</br></br>  <br><br>Two party politics is a part of the system. If you want to change the country in any way, join one of the big two parties, and work within it to enact change.<br><br>e.g., A libertarian leaning republican fighting to shift the GOP towards libertarianism is creating more real change than a member of the Libertarian Party.<br><br>Just the way it is, dude.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>If what you wrote about yourself is true, I am baffled you are able to generate that much income while simultaneously being this stupid.</br></br>  <br>Logic in /b/? Good post anon. Totally agree</br>  <br>capitalism is based on a system of hiding truths, mixed with some systematic disenfranchisement, and some wealth inequality. what your company produces taxes the planet, period. that is why it is wrong.<br><br> wealth of the planet should not belong to the company that extracts it. the land belonds to everyone, and everyone belongs to the land.<br><br>go on, lizard man.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuckign right. I'm in an industry where most of my peers make ~140k a year but they are all super republican. They are all for these tax breaks even though they don't realize that it will hurt them the most. Fucking retards. Bernie 2016.</br>  <br>Da fuck</br>  <br>High taxes kill small business which runs the U.S. We have the highest fucking corporate tax in the world with no improvement on our debt to show. <br><br>Also,<br> voting for a democrat or republican </br></br></br></br>  <br>He's an independent. Neither Republican nor Democrat.</br>  http://verdantlabs.com/politics_of_<wbr>professions/<br>The republicans are busy making money and the democrats are busy not making money.<br><br>Democrats cant find out why they're not rich</br></br></br></wbr>  Love him, but as of right now this insufferable ass looks like he has the best chance of winning. I know people claim this a lot, but I legitimately have an exit plan from the US in place if he gets it. I hate my country so much.  <br> coolaid <br>Lost all credibility there</br></br>  <br> wealth of the planet should not belong to the company that extracts it. the land belonds to everyone, and everyone belongs to the land. <br><br>No, the company should reap the reward. Otherwise, why would they work so hard? Give them one fucking good reason. Interesting utopian dream you have there, too bad it totally contradicts human nature which is why socialism has always failed throughout history.</br></br></br>  <br>This is clearly bait but... <br><br><br>Bernie's a pretty cool, down to earth guy that will be in the populist vote. Hilary will still likely be the actual presidential candidate for the democratic party but Bernie will be among the few voted for by the general population. (That's actually a big deal).<br><br>To be honest I am thinking the other side populist vote will be Rand Paul because the Repub Party in more of a shitter than Dem.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Maybe they're capable of realising that if you're making 140k/year you're not a poor person, and without a victim complex they don't need to vote Dem</br></br>  <br>How's mom's basement?</br>    <br> Otherwise, why would they work so hard? <br>because they are dumb. they should work smarter, not harder. notice SMART technology, it is named that for a reason. It knows what is true, and right. Socialism has failed because it existed alongside slavery. Evil is easy to commit when the masses are brainwashed into not seeing it.</br></br>  <br>No chance.</br>  <br>have you ever just cringed so hard</br>  <br>Fuck that, the U.S. needs a good businessman to pull us out of this shit.</br>  <br><br>Wish I could upvote this. But you'll need quite a bit more than 500K to get into my SoCal neighborhood. As I've said many times in the past, I bought my house at the right time (1998) and if I had to, I couldn't afford to buy it now.<br><br>Smart people generally succeed. Stupid people do not. Society allows the stupid to procreate providing a necessary underclass for the society to flourish while providing voters for the Democrats.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Companies don't generate capital for nothing, there is always some commodity, product, service, etc that people use. This is called being useful, and generally people and corporations reap the benefits of a capitalist system based on how useful they are. Take that away and you also remove the driving force to do, well, anything....you know, like furthering technological advancements. Then again you probably believe the sewers under your house, the electrical grid keeping your computer on and the internet that relays your bullshit was just all there to begin with.</br></br>  <br><br>He's a pretty cool guy and doesn't afraid of anything</br></br>  <br>Mom's basement? Just because i state the truth on b doesnt make me one of you guys lol. interesting site but all you people are clearly flawed.</br>  <br>You best be trolling nigger, Trump's entire foreign policy are two middle fingers as if the rest of the world is just going to listen to him. Best case he makes the entire world actually hate us instead of just random bitching on the internet. Worst case he starts world war 3.</br>  <br>Again, its not smart, its ignorant. When there are artificial traumas instituted by the government in power, how could people possibly see the truth, when they are slaves.</br>  <br>Nigga I was born wealthy and still am, yet I still support socialism because I'm not a selfish dumbass. Capitalism doesn't work, it just fucking doesn't. Okay cool you went to school, wah. Socialism is the thing we as a civilization need to strive for to get some stability. That's how it needs to be and eventually it will be because it's getting to, if not at a tipping point</br>  <br>This</br>  <br><br> Socialism has failed because it existed alongside slavery. <br><br>Do you literally bath in liberalism? I would cut it out, it's rotting your brain and any sense of logic or fact based reasoning.<br><br>There are plenty of open fields you can live in though, you should give that a shot. It would probably do you well. There's a movie about that in fact...gosh, too bad that kid didn't have a hospital and modern medicine. I wonder who built that hospital and discovered those medical breakthroughs....was it good will or the love of money? You see, while the root of capitalism is essentially greed, we all benefit from it. <br><br>I mean, these are the basics. Do you really belong here arguing?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Nigga I was born wealthy and still am, yet I still support socialism because I'm not a selfish dumbass <br><br>Then you clearly don't have a perspective to make that judgement<br><br>  Capitalism doesn't work, it just fucking doesn't.  <br><br>Do you have a source for this? It seems to work pretty fucking awesome, and continues to.<br><br> Socialism is the thing we as a civilization need to strive for to get some stability. That's how it needs to be and eventually it will be because it's getting to, if not at a tipping point <br><br>It's a fad at best, now turn off the computer, it's past your bedtime.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you have little compasion and understanding of the state of the planet. yes we do benefit, which is great. if there were no negative effects, what exactly is the point of saving energy? you are being IGNORant.</br>  <br>Are you me? Except for the anti-union thing. I just think unions shouldnt be supported by the gov. In any way. Otherwise unions are totally natural within the free market</br>  <br>Bernie is giving away free bumper stickers: https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s<wbr>/free-bernie-sticker</wbr></br>  <br><br>I love that firing ambition you had to work your way up that is good. I am very happy for you to work your way up again. My mother was very sick when I was just 6 growing up in the early 90s and we lost everything. I went from playing my consoles all day to sitting outside because it was cooler than an unconditioned house. I did not take out loans as I was so bored all day all I did was read and had no friends so I easily got scholarships and managed to start working in my city. I manged to help my mother by letter her move in with me (also because it took away from my lonely house) and am living fairly well. <br><br>I can understand the hate of someone taking your money, but what if someone is not as lucky are you are me. What if someone like a person I know from playing halo 3, that took out loans and got a degree to work as a Walmart manager making next to nothing struggling bill to bill. Poured himself into debt and gets nothing out of it. Where is the reward for all the hours he put in school wise? Some of his employees have more disposable income than him due to paying back loans.<br><br>Capitalism reached its peak in America in the 80's. At this point it is only helping a select few. Rewards are very rare for most nowadays. I love capitalism, but it needs at least very strong restrictions and some form of tax redistribution to help those we want a future and put time into it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're misunderstanding everything, stop. I can 100% guarantee that if you're in the US and posting on /b/ in this time frame you're not in the super billionaire club. Bernie's saying to tax the super rich as much as everyone else, people who don't need a few more million in the bank.<br><br>I don't get how Americans can bitch about wealth disparagement one moment and cry about higher taxes on people who should be paying them the next. <br><br>At best it says you're just ignorant of basic economics, at worst it says you're plain ignorant and haven't come to a point where you realize you're too stupid to deserve an opinion without researching first.</br></br></br></br></br>  I'm sure he will lose graciously.<br><br>I hope President Clinton is magnanimous</br></br>  Bernie is the shit. BERNIE SANDERS 2016!  <br>mah nigga</br>  <br><br>Totally besides the point, but I've looked at six houses so far in my area all between 450k and 550k that are pretty nice. The price will increase with demand, as it should. <br><br>For you socialists out there, this is called scarcity, and you have yet to address how that would be dealt with....unless you feel human nature is to bypass material possessions and personal advancement (see ... every event in human history for evidence)</br></br></br></br>  <br>This is bait</br>  <br>You rather this?</br>  <br> leechers like yourself <br><br>I will just sit here in my newly built double brick, sound proof building I had built separate to my house so that my neighbours would stop complaining about my audio.<br><br>My monitor died so I am using an old one, Phillips 40" 4k monitor coming, couldn't buy it locally.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You're literally whining.<br><br> But they have 10000x more than me <br><br>Yes, that is called the reward. Someone has to have it. We all strive to have it, and that keeps everyone trying their fucking hardest which is why we continue to advance. <br><br>You have to understand capitalism before you can knock it, and you clearly don't.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Then what the fuck are you complaining about? Looks like capitalism worked out great for you.</br></br>  <br>Everyone vote, god damn it</br>  <br>Where you gunna go?</br>  <br>Not the guy you replied to but...<br><br> Hurr durr your means of production belongs to the state basic economics <br><br>Really? Basic economics? Basic economics states that the less a corporation or business is burdened with government taxation, the easier it'll be to make more money, expand and hire more people.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dismissing my points without providing any real rebuttal. Intelligent. I appreciate the discussion we had</br>  <br><br>I pay 40% income tax, the super rich pay a lot less than that. That is my issue.</br></br>  <br><br> Admits government is corrupt. <br> Still thinks government is the solution to everything. <br><br>I don't fathom how anyone can still have enough faith in the US government to think that any social initiatives it puts forth wouldn't simply turn into another scheme for politicians to funnel tax payer dollars to their lobbyist friends.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>mah nigga</br>  <br><br> Phillips 40" 4k monitor coming, couldn't buy it locally. <br><br> Phillips <br><br> - nope, not with socialism. That is a corporation built on profits.<br><br> 40" tv  <br><br>- nope, not with socialism, that is a consumer good built for profits<br><br> Couldn't buy it locally  <br><br>- Then where, Amazon? that is a corporation built on profits, as is the shipping company.<br><br>None of these things are public necessities, and all would be standardized and inferior in a socialist economy. Russia tried it, and 90% of funding went to the military. You might like bread lines, but I'm more of a Costco kind of guy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Actually living very comfortable here in Florida if you want to throw around "MUH SUCCESSES." No one's saying there shouldn't be some difference between the classes, but what you're asking for has been proven over and over to not work. It's not working now. We're pretty much the only first world country without secondary education, and try as you might to argue otherwise even with loans that's something not everyone can afford. <br><br>It's not a fair system, you're willfully ignorant if you claim it is. <br><br>And the final point, if you're actually on the same financial level as me, is that neither of us is in the bracket that would see more taxes. Because you want something more to strive for is no reason to keep others in the dirt.</br></br></br></br></br>  People are no longer buying into the failed economic policies of the right wing.  <br>Nailed it.</br>  <br><br>Your tepid grasp of the word rebuttal is about as strong as your grasp on both socialism and capitalism. I suggest you find a different thread.</br></br>  <br>It doesn't matter if we vote why don't people get that. The popular vote means nothing in the presidential election because the electoral college overrides everyone. Bush vs.Gore, Gore would have won by popular vote but popular vote doesnt count since the elctoral college voted for bush.</br>  <br>Delusion cunt with no idea how reality works.</br>  god please yes. I can't even imagine the horror of clinton vs bush.  <br>Wrong you cock, taxing a business and taxing a CEO are two different things. So far he's not talking about taxing businesses more.<br>Taxing a CEO means a business still has just as much money to reinvest.</br></br>  <br>are you stupid? bought out by who? his 42 dollar individual donors?</br>  <br><br>Stupid fucking social democratic reformist</br></br>  <br>I just dont why those 2 dont get together and be like lets take this election by fucking storm<br><br>Hillary/Bernie 2016<br><br>then after 8 years Hillrnie it will be the Castro twins and they will take turns being president, so thats a minimum of 24 years before any republican has any hope of winning the white house again<br><br>and shit by then they will be so dead and gone, "conservative" will be a commonly used term to describe stubborn old bigots who were to dumb/proud/tradition to adapt to the modern world.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Topkike</br>  <br>Technically taxing a CEO means you're taxing a business. They own shares in the company they're head of along with the other multiple people that own a portion of the company. The company is not its own entity but rather comprising of ownership by one or multiple people.</br>  <br>Bernie doesn't have private donors. All of his political donors are ordinary people who went through his website.</br>  <br><br>It is a fair system - if you are more useful to society you are rewarded. Those investment bankers that make untold amounts of money? Their "evil capital investments" are applied to projects which employ millions of people (housing developments, corporations, technology centers, etc). They deserve the reward as that benefits everyone. <br><br>You're proving the point that socialism is for those that want a reward for nothing.<br><br>Even if we are on the same economic level, it has nothing to do with me wanting a goal. Socialism removes the driving force of the economy and literally replaces it with nothing. Again, your tepid grasp of human nature and how that aligns with capitalism is paramount in your failure to understand both capitalism and socialism.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  it's like if dick cheney and karl marx had a lovechild  <br>Best choice. Not enough rational voting US citizens to put him in office. We need some nut cases to demonize the other canditates for him to have a shot.</br>  <br><br> What if <br><br>Tough shit, that's life. That's what I was told and I dealt with it, as do millions of people daily. Don't take it from those that earned it. That's called being a leech and it's detrimental to our society.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> durr, its all the right wing. <br><br>Are you really this naive?<br><br>When the Republicans try to lower taxes then you freak out because its tax cuts for the rich.<br><br>But when the Democrats tax everyone and then funnel those taxes into the hands of their lobbyist friends then you think they're making "Green Jobs" or "Saving the Auto Industry"/<br><br>Seriously when Bush gave the banks hundreds of billions of dollars you threw a shit fit; but when Obama did it you idiots said he was saving us from another great depression and clapped like a bunch of trained seals.<br><br>Pull your head out of your ass.<br><br>The rich people who own the Republican party own the Democratic party too. They play both sides and they sit back and laugh as you bicker with the other side over your illusion of choice.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>by not voting you're letting another vote from some idiot voting for a corporatist count. you're literally submitting yourself to tyrants by not voting at all idiot</br>  <br>I've only voted twice in my life and it was for Ralph Nader. I'd vote for this guy.</br>  <br>Regardless of whatever point you think I'm proving by realizing there are people who didn't have the same start I did, the multitude of countries that are much more socialist than Bernie's policies throw your arguments out the window. Germany is a true socialist nation, behind us and Japan they're still one of the top manufacturers in the world with a much smaller land mass. All the Nordic countries have been doing this for ages and no one talks about them because they're happily existing and thriving. <br><br>Your entire argument is proven invalid by their existence.</br></br></br>  <br>By not voting, you're not voting. It's an option, asshole. Luckily we don't live in your votalitarian state.</br>  I like him.<br><br>He's a democratic socialist in the sense that he believes that our taxes should go towards subsidizing post-secondary education instead of pumping out tanks until there is literally no space left on Earth to store them. He doesn't buy into the whole "billionaires make all the jobs" bullshit and understands that the greatest source of human capital is and always will be education.<br><br>He's also one of the few to directly call out the Koch brothers. That means if he gets elected they'll probably have him killed if they can't bait him into a scandal. And from there we finally have our angry revolution. <br><br>I'm all for it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You have no idea what you're talking about.<br><br>The Corporation as an entity pays corporate taxes.<br><br>People who own shares in the company pay Capital Gains Tax when they make a profit on their shares and the CEO of the company pays Income tax, just like everyone else over the poverty line.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Wow.... my mind is full of fuck just reading this.<br><br>Have you left Murica? I have been all through Asia and to many "Socialist" countries. Socialism doesn't mean there will be no companies.<br><br> None of these things are public necessities <br><br>EXACTLY YOU IDIOT.<br><br>Socialism = public necessities are provided for free by the government. Meaning water, basic housing, a telephone connection.... everything else is provided by private organisations and it doesn't stop you saying, stick your government paid things up your arse I am buying these better private ones.<br><br>  socialist economy. Russia tried it <br>That was communism you idiot.<br><br>There is such a thing as bad capitalism and good capitalism in the same way there is good socialism and bad socialism.<br><br>All you faggots are claiming Bernie Sanders is a socialist and flaming socialism. I am merely agreeing with his policies.<br><br>I am from fucking Australia and I know far more about American politicians than you Muricunts.<br><br>I spent a month in Japan a few weeks ago, late at night the train stations is filled with old people because they don't have enough "socialism". So if you are forever alone, and get old and haven't got a HEAP of money saved to cover you until you die. Bad luck, go sleep in the train station. My wife was crying seeing them all. They weren't on drugs or beggars, they just couldn't earn enough money to afford housing as they were mostly in their 70s+.<br><br>Disagree with old people sleeping in train stations then you are a communist. Murica logic.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you're an idiot lol</br>  <br>reward from what? exploits.</br>  <br><br> He's also one of the few to directly call out the Koch brothers. <br><br>Are you shitting me? I can't turn on NPR without hearing about them.<br><br>If he wants to impress me then he'll start calling out the billionaires who buy off the left wing as well as the ones who buy off the right wing.<br><br>I bet you don't even know who George Soros is do you?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Germany is a true socialist nation <br><br>They have billionaires that aren't taxed up the ass also. If you want to talk countries in the north, Switzerland has one of the strongest capitalistic economies in the world. <br><br>You clearly don't understand my argument and the points you tried to use against me were really completely false, as is the idea that socialism would really work. In every modern society there are socialist factors, i.e. medicare, social security, etc, but these were voted on in a democratic process and ride on the back of capitalism.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This 100 times.</br>  Socialist kike.  <br><br>Labeling something with an "evil" buzzword doesn't take away it's effectiveness. I believe there is a drum circle you should be attending.</br></br>  <br><br>Wow some one who knows what socialism really is.</br></br>  <br><br> samefagging this hard </br></br>  <br><br>i think he's legit. I don't think he's owned by the corporations like the rest of the government</br></br>  <br><br> Privatized organizations <br><br> Income redistribution <br><br>Pick one.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>His campaign stop in wisconsin(?) recently had 100000000000 times more people than dipshit scott walker or any other republifag could dream of. I loved all of his stances on every issue so I love him.</br>  He's a fuckin' moron playing to a base of fuckin' morons.  <br> socialist factors voted on in a democratic process <br><br>THAT IS WHAT I'VE BEEN TRYING TO SAY YOU FUCK. That is 100% what Bernie Sanders is trying to accomplish. <br><br> German billionaires aren't taxed up the ass also <br><br>Wrong, but as billionaires they can afford it and still run their companies in a capitalistic best idea gets the best reward manner. CRAZY.<br><br> points you tried to use against me were really completely false <br><br>Burden of proof is yours as the accuser. Enjoy your googling to learn how fucktarded you are. Might I suggest starting with social benefits all German citizens enjoy because they weren't as afraid to implement logical policies.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck did you just fucking say about Bernie Sanders, you little conservative? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class at community college, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret fundraisers for Bernie Sanders, and I have over 3 confirmed dollars raised. I took a class in political science and I’m the top Bernie Sanders debater in the entire US Bernie Sanders club. You are nothing to me but just another republican. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this website, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying Bernie Sander shit to me over Reddit? Think again, conservative. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of Bernie Sander soldiers across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, phaggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your opinion. You’re fucking going down, Bernie Sanders hater. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can argue with you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare lips. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed liberal debate, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Democratic Party and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass of shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “fuck Bernie sanders” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking fingers. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the gold, you goddamn tea partiest. I will shit democracy all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.</br>  <br><br><br>Japan and their elderly was a brutal realisation. During the day they box up all their stuff and go off to try and earn money. At night they come back to the train stations to sleep. They wear business suits and they are far too ashamed to take money.<br><br>I saw one of them get up in the morning and use a broom he had made our of a bundle of sticks to sweep a park. They still have a strong sense of community they are just too old to work any more. Some were really old and basically needed to be in palliative care they wouldn't have been far from death.<br><br>Thinking people like this deserve to live this way is so brutal.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Fox News is already calling him a socialist as their counter attack.<br><br>As far as I'm concerned that shit won't work. Most of America is living on dept they can't recover from. The banks are literally fucking everyone. The socialist bullshit is just that -bullshit.</br></br>    <br><br>Your logic<br>Income redistribution = no privatized organizations.<br><br>That's fucked logic bro.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Koch brothers are by far the most active though and have the most to gain/lose. And yes I know of George Soros, Peter Thiel, Sheldon Adelson, etc. They're all bad for using large amounts of money to finance campaigns and for general billionaire fuckery, but if you're going to argue that Soros is just as bad or worse for America than the Koch brothers on the whole then you're certainly wrong. <br><br>Come to think of it, I wonder what's going to happen if Bernie wins the primaries against Hilary. I think he will definitely stick to his guns, but I know that he knows what it takes to win. <br><br>I think if he makes it to the general election he has a much better shot of winning it all. I'm looking forward to Sanders vs. Paul.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> he has been bought out <br><br>His top 20 donors are labor unions and professional trade associations.<br><br>Hillary's and Jeb's are literally banks.<br><br>Look it up. He is the only one being back by people instead of corporations and banks.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  He needs to win.  <br>Bought by who? The people? Us?<br><br>He is NOT talking corporate donations, and has refused. <br>Only way to send money is his website, through small donation.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Supporting him with my donations and my time volunteering. Making a career in politicial organization I plan to work alongside his campaign.<br><br><br>I'm excited to be part of the revolution that wakes America up to what it really could, and needs, to be.</br></br></br></br>  <br>the lesser of two evils perhaps.</br>  <br> abolish income taxes and convert to a consumption tax <br><br>You realize that is a regressive tax idea that would place a larger burden on the poor than the rich</br></br></br>  the only "honest" politician left in the us  <br><br> Koch brothers are by far the most active though and have the most to gain/lose. And yes I know of George Soros, Peter Thiel, Sheldon Adelson, et <br><br>I'd say the various Super Pacs created by various industries are far more dangerous than the individual Rich guys.<br><br>For example, the pharmaceutical and healthcare industry spent nearly a billion dollars on advertisements supporting Obamacare and God knows how much more buying off politicians. That's why we didn't get a healthcare bill that held the drug companies or hospitals accountable.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>"evil"? <br>dictionary definition of exploit<br>make full use of and derive benefit from (a resource).<br><br>stop being ignorant.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>i think he may be president.<br>hes the best candidate.<br>the problem is just winning over people that are going to vote for clinton because theyre stubborn</br></br></br>  <br>yeah, thats kind of his entire platform: take the most popular positions because they are POPULAR, positions that all the other candidates are too stupid/fucked over to take</br>  <br>Quads confirm</br>  He's a typical fucking jew saying what you faggots want to hear right now before he gets in office and takes your money  <br><br>No, she'll be lucky to be his vice president candidate. Anything is possible, only stubbornness goes to Hillary. She's fake, working for the banks just like Obama. We're tired of that. In fact most of America is tired of it, more than you know.</br></br>  <br>Thanks for reminding me of another reason to support Bernie. <br><br>He is against the TPP which would make big pharma even more powerful and snuff out any competition with stringent intellectual property regulated by corporations, for corporations. <br><br>Also he believes in a single payer system which would be a great step away from people's health and lives being a business, something that I have had a problem with in this country since day one. <br><br>His diplomacy with big pharma will be pretty obvious when he makes his statement on childhood obesity though, as that is something very connected to big pharma. Hopefully he won't make the same mistake as Michelle and accept "help" from Coca Cola and the crew.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Are all socialist supporters this autistic? I'd start with your assertion that there are no German billionaires but I might get a most factual response during a conversation with a wall.</br></br>  <br>It's amazing that people don't still don't realize that the ACA was purely to benefit insurance companies.</br>  <br> he sounds too good to be true. and people can still be paid up in stone cold cash. <br>its funny because that just reveals how mcuh we;ve been getting fucked by the 2 party system.<br>when someone comes along that says 'fuck the system' everyone thinks its too good to be true</br></br></br>  <br><br>So when you get your paycheck, do you rip it up?<br><br>And you think I'm ignorant....socialist supporters hardly have the intelligence to sort out the point at hand which is another reason the idea is almost scary that people with that little foresight want to change the economy.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This socialist hypocritical moron doesn't have a shot in hell.</br>    <br>Apparently you're not aware of a personal's entire financial history being checked before being voted to Presidency. If his campaign takes cash, it will be know.<br><br>You people are trying hard to make up lies, aren't you?</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br> It's amazing that people don't still don't realize that the ACA was purely to benefit insurance companies. <br><br>It didn't benefit Insurance companies, they got to be the scapegoat.<br><br>It benefited the Pharmaceutical and Healthcare industry because it forces everyone to buy insurance thus mandating people spend more on drugs and healthcare. <br><br>It also benefited the healthcare industry by forcing people to buy insurance which kept the hospitals from eating the costs when poor people came in who needed care they couldn't afford. Ironically Obama sold that as one of the reasons why healthcare costs would come down; but he just left it at that and then expected the healthcare industry to lower their prices out of the goodness of their hearts and I think its pretty obvious how that turned out.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wasn't the original ACA a single payer system, but they had to water it down in order to get Republicans to cooperate?</br>  <br><br><br> Home is washed away in super-storm which is just one of many caused by capitalist exploitation of the planet <br><br> TOUGH SHIT THAT'S LIFE CORPORATIONS CAN FUCK THE PLANET AND PLEBS DEAL WITH IT <br><br>Nice. I, for one, believe in an organized government and society with clear goals...like wiping out poverty, increasing the creative potential of each citizen, and using our collective wealth (the greatest ever seen on the face of the planet) to make sure NOBODY drops below a humane standard of living.<br><br>But I guess you'd rather some rich fuckboi stash another cool billion in the Cayman Islands so he doesn't need to pay taxes like all of us right? Just deal with it right?<br><br>Nigger.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> I disagree, must be bait. <br><br>Fucking idiot.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>No the Republicans never cooperated.<br><br>The ACA was passed when the Dems had control of the house and the senate.<br><br>Then Ted Kennedy died and Massachusetts elected a Republican to his seat because he promised to vote against ACA so the Dems had to stick with the prototype version of the bill that they'd voted on since they couldn't get a refined version past and we ended up with the trainwreck of a bill that is Obamacare.<br><br>A single payer system couldn't even get passed by the Dems when the Repubs were powerless to stop them, the party considered it too radical and they were afraid it would anger their buddies in the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br> doesn't need to pay taxes like all of us <br> blaming rich people for the inability of the poor <br><br>You truly don't know what you're talking about.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>see <br><br/></br></br></br>  <br><br> Capitalism causes hurricanes. <br><br>For fucks sake.</br></br></br></br>  <br> people actually think like this </br>  <br><br> clear goals <br> increasing the creative potential of each citizen <br><br>Sounds like you're more into vague bullshit than clear policies to me.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> <br><br>do you not think systemic oppression exists? sure, YOU got yourself out. But you are an exception. wouldnt we maximize profit by empowering the masses as much as possible? or should we reward the 1% for being the best? are those mutually exclusive</br></br></br>  <br><br>His voting record has been consistent with his message. He speaks out against things like money in politics and has stayed true to his word by not operating super pacs in his campaign. He's the only principled candidate in the race currently. I agree the system is abhorrently corrupt, but some honest politicians do slip through the cracks occasionally.</br></br>  <br>  <br>Rand Paul 2016</br></br>  <br>It's called climate change you mongoloid. But I'm willing to bet you think that is a jew-spiracy. <br><br><br><br>Increasing affordability of education, decreasing the cost of housing, providing basic amenities so every day isn't a struggle for survival, allowing an internet connection so that people are able to self-educate and aren't isolated to their little ho-dunk towns.<br><br>This is all part of elevating the creative potential of humans. What capitalists don't understand is that human potential is only tapped into by capitalism. not GENERATED by it. Creating living situations conducive to allowing this potential to manifest means that we need to provide a motivation as a society AS WELL AS prevent the outright struggle of wage-slave living. There is a sweet spot in a mixed economy where you can have both.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>fucking scum</br>  <br>i think of it this way, if the popular vote is SO different from the electoral vote then it would cause revolt. we have a voice, it shall be heard. we won net neutrality somehow</br>  <br><br> Equating socialism with communism <br><br>No one is saying the government should make tvs m8.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Supported Federal Recognition of Gay Marriage <br> Voted AGAINST the 2006 Legislation to create a border fence between the U.S. and Mexico <br>Is that supposed to make me want to vote for him?</br></br></br>  <br>Yes it is, and if it doesn't I'm not sure what to tell you.</br>  <br><br>If you're a republican I guess so. Go vote for Donald Trump then. I'm sure he'll run the country the way you want it. (Straight into the ground)</br></br>  <br><br>By effectively penalizing the winners?</br></br>  <br><br>Well that was me, so explain - how do I think?</br></br>  <br><br>Oh? So where do you see the line between public wealth and private enterprise being drawn? You want both scenarios to work out, and they can't co-exist, so we chose capitalism. There are plenty of instances of socialized public works already, whatever kind of notion you have about our current system is highly skewed.</br></br>  <br><br>First of all the whole homosexuality into culture &amp; society thing isn't about human rights, it's about degradation and sexual deviancy, as per the protocols of the elders of zion. I feel sorry for the people who're living that way, they're victims, victims of hormone affecting substances in our food, drink, and even plastics we handle, victims of the propaganda war to promote homosexuality &amp; deviancy in all media since around the 60s. I know I sound like a bit of a nut, and I wish I was wrong. But I believe objectively all this shit is going down.<br><br>As for the Mexican border, come on. A fence is a pretty liberal solution to unparalleled levels of illegal immigration, cartels, bringing crime, murder, and rape.<br><br><br>As for Bernie, I'm sure he's in with the folks pic related (the zionists). Make of that what you will.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> when Bush gave the banks hundreds of billions of dollars you threw a shit fit; <br>That was mostly the Republicans, actually. It was maybe the best thing Bush ever did and actually earned money in the long run.

How do you resolve problems easily ?</br>  <br>if she was 9/10 i would have not lost her for the 7/10 lol</br>  <br>It starts with a few ground rules<br>got some real simple ones:<br> physical aggression is not tolerated at all <br>we never throw shit, slap, pinch, kick or otherwise harm one another, and never destroy each other's things.<br><br> no namecalling <br>insults help nothing at all<br><br> no running away from the fight or going to family members <br>it's not fair to add someone else into the fight, because of course they will be biased. besides, it's between the two of you alone.<br><br> Don't try to "win" <br>it's not about who's right or wrong, it's about communicating your thoughts and desires. the goal is to each understand the other's motivations completely and meet a compromise<br><br>if you can do those simple things, you can keep from fighting excessively. but you actually have to LISTEN to one another and not try to attack the other or bully them into admitting wrongdoing. everyone always has some motivation, you should understand theirs if you love them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>eh she was getting annoying. plus i was getting tired of fucking one girl every day. besides, i was 16 who gives a shit. shes like pre med and vanderbilt uni or some shit now. wish i had stayed w her kind of to roll in the dough but whatevs</br>  <br>your a god</br>  <br>I'm just a man, no different from any of you.<br><br>this is the recent pic of her I mentioned btw</br></br></br>  <br>and our cat</br>  <br>given me feels man, hope you two are doing well</br>  <br>yeah, pretty much.

I had finally had it with everything after some slut had tore me up pretty bad. I decided it would make a decent final joke to hang myself on haloween near some semi busy road. I chose one that wasn't well travelled at night and figured I would be mistaken for a decoration until much later. laughs all around and such.<br><br><br>I remember how I misjudged the length of the drop, and the pain of the rope tightening. I could feel a lot of pressure in my eyeballs, almost like they were going to pop like little balloons. My first thought was just the pain, I was thinking something like "jesus tittyfucking christ I would have fucked this up, can't even make a decent knot. after what seemed like an hour, the pain began to fade, as well as the panic of not being able to breath. I started thinking about what pushed me to this, and I kind of wondered if it was really worth all this. I remember everything blurring and darkening, and then I just felt like gravity was slowly flowing around me like a sphere, pulling me in every direction. I felt like bits of me were just expanding and being drawn away, into emptiness. I don't recall any actual sensory perception of it, nor any kind of panic. I was just ok with it, but at the same time, bored with it. I don't really know how to explain it, but it did feel like this was not the result I was looking for. (cont)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>(cont)<br>I remember what could best be described as a "snap" and then I felt like I imagine a collapsing star feels, as if everything were being pulled into a "center" and this light began peeking in, blinding.<br>When I came to, I was on one of those ER slabs with the paper on them. My chest hurt a lot, and my breathy was ragged, raspy and painful. I could not swallow and my left eye was blurred. I had no ID, they didn't know who I was, and I managed to slip out without anyone knowing. I walked for miles before someone gave me a lift, asked them to let me out 2 miles from home and I never told anyone about it until 6 years later. wore turtlenecks for a while to school. I'm not afraid of death anymore, but I'm just not in a hurry to do it again.</br></br></br>  <br>Lmao</br>  <br><br>damn dude, this shit makes me realize how good of a life I've really had.</br></br>  <br>Keep on keeping on anon</br>  <br>Your friend sounds so much better then you</br>   In high school <br> Last day before summer hols  <br> I spend most of the day bored and daydreaming <br> could have got away with it but Ms. M spots me looking miles away <br> killer look from her, then she says "stay behind class anon" <br> After class I stand up and look at Ms. M, <br> notice how sexy she really is <br> awkwardly smile at her <br> look into her beautiful eyes <br> She smiles back at me  <br> pulls me close against her and <br> holds me tight to her sexy body <br> I can't believe this is happening <br> now my cock grows hard <br> could cut diamonds with it <br> takes her hand and grabs my cock, slowly stroking it <br> every minute of this feels like a dream <br> right before I cum she looks in my eyes and says "Has anyone really been far as decided to use even go want to do look more like" </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you got me</br>  <br>That was awful and you should feel awful with your boring ass life fukboi</br>   be 2 minutes ago <br> reading green texts  <br> drinking Gatorade  <br> put bottle on my head like a retard <br> cap not on all the way <br> soak my head with gatorade </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>underrated fucking post kek</br>  <br>I don't get it?<br> inb4 summer </br></br>   be me <br> be in the 7th grade <br> lunch time at school <br> two 8th graders come up to me <br> they fuckin shank me with a fuckin pink dildo <br> wtf_just_happened.jpg <br> mfw I get shanked with a dildo </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> summer <br>It's an old joke I think it was from some old Goodnight Moon mini movie</br></br>  <br>we all take different paths in life anon. just keep your head up and look forward.

I don't know her. Nor do I care to. The thing is, you can't miss what you never had. I don't have any anger, but she made her choices and has to live with them.

I had previously taken acid before I ever smoked weed, and it felt like I was having a flashback. <br>  flashback combined with being high as fuck <br>  feelsgoodman.jpg <br>  My friends were talking, but my brain told me it didn't matter what they were saying.  <br>  Began to feel like everyone was messing with me. <br>  decide to try a kickflip, which I could do pretty good at the time. <br>  could barely get on skateboard. <br>  OK, well I'm fucking baked. <br>  hear someone shout "shit, security's coming our way. <br>  We decide to go that direction, because the school is that way.  <br>  tokerface.jpg <br>  "hi guys" says security person <br>  "hello" I say, trying to be cool. <br>  they just pass right by us. <br>  decide to go in through front entrance <br>  everyoneslookingatme.jpg <br>  Go in cafeteria <br>  listen to psychedelic classic rock for hours, with my eyes closed, having amazing closed eye visuals <br>  Fuck to the yes. <br>  Ended up ditching the next 3 classes, because I was too fucked up. <br> walked into 7th hour, still a little high. <br>  no one suspected a thing. <br>  I look back on this, "god damn, I was such a dumbass." <br>  mfw my mom asked why I ditched those classes <br>  made up some excuse about being stressed <br>  she buys it <br>  lets me sleep in the next day, cause I had 1st off <br>  Never suspected a thing. <br>  As it turns out, I still had some weed the people gave me, to be honest, I forgot they gave it to me, I was so baked.  <br>  smoked every day for the next week. <br>  shit was so fucking great. <br>  never ditched class again </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Basterd fuk wen i see u to date on schilldren buying u basterd hornady but lost cuz basterds in the sue bantma fukktack basterd henderson away from it</br>  <br>Anon that was my favorite story</br>  <br>U a chok helux from a basterd thought over molly chit cumber basterds over u can beat a loob basterd under tunks basterd bite a shite brite</br>  don't 404 on me you bastard  bampu<br><br>it is not your time</br></br>    :(   <br> first ride hitchhiking <br> guy picks us up drives 150 miles <br> buying us beer every 10 <br> gettingdrunk <br> lets stops to let us out juat over state line <br> oh you boys wanna do some work for me? <br> ill pay cash and buy more beer feed you roo <br> seemed legit <br> drives us all the way back to by where he picked us up <br> lives in trailer <br>  okay boys ill make some pizzas  <br> great we were hunhry <br>After we eat he says<br>Okay boys time to shower<br> ...okay can we do that work first? <br>  nah go ahead and get cleaned up <br> ...

It's been fun sharing my stories of trauma, suicide, and triumph with you anons again, even if I was copypasta-ing. A lot of good reads in here too, thanks for sharing, everyone. It's getting to the point where a 404 seems inevitable.  <br>So is the grill so big that it covers 80% of the backyard?<br>Or are there multiple grills covering 80% of the backyard in total?<br>OR is it a normal sized grill that covers 80% of a tiny backyard?<br>Also, is it a pool table or a swimming pool?<br>If it's a pool table, what size is it if the backyard is 80% grill?<br>If it's a swimming pool, how do you have PoolFun.mov beside potentially a gargantuan grill, or a plethora of grill, or if the swimming pool is too small to fit people?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I have typed this out again and again, trying to find the correct way to word what I truly mean to say. I'm just gonna' wing it this time:<br>From the age of six to eleven I was molested, and orally raped.<br>Years down the line, isolated indecent from the sentence above, I was assaulted on the street. I was seventeen, just minding my own damn business, when a man decided he didn't like me for whatever reason. Be hit me in the back of the head, I fell down, and he proceeded to beat the shit out of me for a few minutes.<br><br>Now, I have wanted to beat the shit out of people before.<br>I have beat people.<br>Now, I have had a sexual attraction to a person before.<br>I have fucked people.<br><br>But I would claim that the people I wanted to beat &amp; fuck would be agreeable under societies views.<br>However, the man who beat me, he clearly had an issue. The man who molested me, also had some problems. <br>But not for a second have I thought they needed to be burned alive or whatever the fuck.<br>These people need understanding, and some fucking compassion. We need to study this shit to help people. I know for a fact that the man who molested me didn't like who he saw himself becoming. I could hear him crying, beating his head and hands against the wall, until the desire came back again.<br>I personally believe this man was weak, and could not control his desires. <br>That is more human than anything I can identify. <br>We are all animals, so stop fucking pretending we are more.<br>Stop fucking pretending these people are less than you.<br>Stop pretending you don't have skeletons in your closet.<br>Stop fucking pretending your attraction is any different than theirs.<br><br>God damn it, people. I should have the most fucking hate in my heart, out of the majority. The difference is I use my fucking brain. I know that nothing can be gained from murdering people who never had a choice, never had a chance to choose what they were and were not aroused by.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Too long; Didn't read<br><br>I'm sure it was a great story though</br></br></br>  Cont.<br><br>I understand that no one helped them have a fighting chance. I get that humans are meant to hunt and gather in groups, and when separated, we fall apart.<br>Ousting these people only damns them to their own heads which either makes matters worse and solidifies acceptance of their views or makes them fall into the deepest pit of self loathing, self hatred, anger, loneliness and depression.<br>This is beneficial to no one, either way.<br>Maybe if we helped these people and accepted them as a normality, helping them climb barriers and sustain a positive self image &amp; confidence..<br><br>Maybe I wouldn't have been hurt in the ways that I have been.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Lmao, can't blame you I guess.</br>  Idk bro.

Not a storytelling board!  <br>Newfag detected.</br>  OP raped his son, and beat up some random stranger out of frustration and self-loathing.<br><br>Now he beats his meat imagining his son understanding and forgiving his actions.<br><br>OP, I would slit your throat, and watch your eyes closely, waiting for when they dilate just as you give up.</br></br></br></br>  <br>epic</br>  <br>Kek, nah man sorry, I don't have kids yet.<br>Dont fucking want them, either.</br></br>  <br>OP. Ican understand your point of view. Even though you've been molested, you still show compassion for molesters, because you think they can't control their urges because it is natural for them.<br><br>This is a topics with much taboo associated to it. Imagine somebody admits that they have pedo urges (without ever acting on it), they'd be shunned from society forever.<br><br>And investing money into pedo science isn't very popular decision.<br><br>Maybe if get a society where everyone has a very high level of education, maybe people can look more understanding.<br><br>But like you said we are still animals.<br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/626570890#p626576034">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  saw pic, got excited, no padlet, disappointment.

Have no friends for anything illegal.</br>  <br>nevermind, yea DPH makes me feel like I can't move more then anything else, not my cup of tea. My friend from NY said he kept stepping on his dead turtle while on DPH though, idk how he experienced stuff like that but I never did.</br>  <br>It changes people, but I guess you know...<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=yUR<wbr>RmWtbTbo</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br> confirmed summer </br>  <br>no i just don't use it as much as I do DXM so i forgot the abbreviation.</br>  <br>no problem, i figured, i get them mixed up sometimes too. i did it a lot back in high school. saw so many things, did so many weird things. that shit is crazy.</br>  <br>I hit my 50 trip limit, and sadly, at the same time, I can't drink the robo anymore or else I throw up. Even the tiniest amount. It's really depressing actually.</br>  <br>don't fucking take the liquid shit, its the worst trips ever. Pill form is best form.</br>  <br>I actually prefer the syrup form</br>  <br>I usually do around 550mg of dxm through robo, then I took 350mg through the pills and I felt absolutely nothing. I'm going to try extraction though, not sure if it be worth it.</br>  <br>Looked into extraction. Not sure if i have the patience</br>  <br>what is 50 trip limit?</br>  <br>just do all pills, mixing is the worst specially liquid and then pills. Tried doing that too.</br>  <br>honestly i don't believe in that myth, i've done DXM more then 50 times and i still get high off the pill form. Liquid though just no.</br>  <br>Ive done robo well over 50 times</br>  high school tier drug holy shit you fucking losers  <br>I'm out there.<br>This isn't even the peak.<br>What the fuck man.</br></br></br>  OP, and everyone else in this thread who does DXM:<br><br><br>Combine. With. Whippets.<br><br>It's the craziest, most dissociative whippet you'll ever do in your life. The aural and visual flanging is utterly overwhelming.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>My peak is coming</br>  <br>What are you wearing on your head?</br>  How bad is dxm to your brain and body?<br>Also I've noticed that I tend to really fuck up a day or two after taking dxm. By fuck up I mean driving into a curb because I wasn't paying attention and then popping my tire and cutting my hand open because again I wasn't paying attention or something. And this was a day after tripping.</br>  <br>I love DXM. But I hate that transition from sober to tripping. It just feels so bad and so weird.</br>  <br>South Vietnamese helmet.</br>  <br>lol no. Or if you really get third plateau with that 350 you must weight something like 30kg.<br>350 is high 1 or low 2 max.<br>DXM is best after 1200+ mg.</br></br></br>  <br>150lbs</br>  <br>It's toxic to your liver with repeated (i.e. daily) heavy use, but otherwise it's safe. As for your personal situation, I'd say just don't drive or do focus-intensive tasks the next day. Plan around the trip. You don't want to harm yourself by being an innocent psychonaut.</br>  <br>The 50 trip limit is partially about how your body develops resistances to substances. If you need to take more and more, you can develop dependencies and lose money. It's also about how using a tripping substance over 50 times is just promoting stagnation. Try new things, get new experiences, take a break, and try it again after the 50 trips. I don't want to believe it, but it is important to take advice from people who knows this as it is their life.</br>  <br>Coincidentally, while tripping one night I found a full can of whip in my fridge, I -know- the effects but I've never tried nitrous. It was absolutely astounding when I tried it. I wouldn't do it again since it only lasts for 20 or so seconds. It really doesn't seem worth it.</br>  <br>I feel that it's a completely arbitrary number. You've correct in that the 50 trip rule is about the body becoming resistant to the drug, but everyone's physiology is different, and so we all develop resistance differently. Also, the 50 trip rule doesn't take into account the time between trips.</br>  <br>Not if you buy oodles of whipped cream bottles for just an hour of fun. Buy whipped cream chargers, a cracker and a balloon. You get a ridiculous bang for your buck.</br>  Is there anything fun you guys do at/past the peak? I prefer video games, but they are mechanically difficult with all the dissociation. If anyone else likes the vidya, Heavy Bullets on steam was MADE to be played while tripping. I'd recommend that. Also, Audiosurf 2. With some setup beforehand, it's a compelling experience.  <br>It is an arbitrary number, there is absolutely no reason why the number is 50, but again. It's just advice from experience people, and only advice.</br>  <br>I personally prefer to not create action, but to observe it. I remember watching Rick and Morty this one time, and I was transcending levels of existence within and outside of the show. Watching anything while dissociated is a great idea.</br>  The only thing I hate bout DXM is the roboitch, no matter how many times you do it that roboitch never goes away.  <br>anyone else feel like you might scratch open your scalp from itching too hard when you get roboitch?</br>  <br>I tend to have severe memory lapses if I don't focus on something. I was in a skype call for what would seem like hours with a childhood friend and I kept feeling like basic everyday memories with the dude was repressed and complex psychological anomalies. In and out of tears, and reading on Erowid, it seems that memory lapses trend with each type of person, and I might be that person. Movies or shows might now be my thing</br>  <br><br>From what I've read, the itch is a psychological thing. It's in your head. Don't think about it before the trip, or during, keep yourself in a cold/cool enviroment, and staying hydrated keeps the itch away. Even if it is placebo, it worked for my girlfriend.</br></br>  <br>I just go and lay down when I peak because whenever i'm doing something on my computer when I do, holy fuck do I get annoying and people know I'm high cause i'll type something like this<br>"FKLJDSLKJFLKDJSKF JDSFNKLKL JSDFJKLF fjkkkk uck kfjdslajfsafjdsklj"<br><br>or because my keyboard has macro built in the last time i tripped with over 1200 mg I accidently macroed sentences to be typed over and over again and thought someone was hacking my computer because of it. So yea I tend to stay away from anything while im reaching my peak lol.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I just picked some shrooms....can't OD on shrooms.</br>  <br>Pop some DPH HCl along with the DXM. not only is it an antihistamine, but it's a strong DXM potentiator.<br><br><br><br>Interesting. To each his own! I haven't done crazy amounts personally- most I've ever done was 506mg- but I do tend to be forgetful at about 350 and above. I'm a totally sedentary person, so tuning out and watching something is perfect for me.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yea no matter what i always get them even though i've heard that before lol. Also I am always hydrated while tripping.</br>  <br>i don't like mixing because i've had bad experiences with mixing before.</br>  <br>What was that experience?</br>  <br>You'd have to do a LOT to OD on dxm. It'd be like chugging down 8-10 bottles or chewing down an unimaginable amount of pills. I'm sure someone on meth or really drunk might be able to do something like that, but I don't think a human body could withstand that much shit without puking it up.</br>  <br> dxm <br> underage b&amp; detected </br></br>  <br>I've never even reached the 4th plat nor do I think I want to. I've read experience with higher beings, and I had a crippling fear of aliens as a child. Bad trips happen lol</br>  <br>Shrooms also dont leave you with a shitty hangover like DXM</br>  <br>mixed alcohol with dxm and wound puking everywhere and sent to the hospital. Another time I mixed weed with DXM and wound up super paranoid which isn't the usual feeling i get while on DXM.</br>  <br>never get shit hangovers with DXM, in fact i love DXM hangovers I feel energized as fuck while relaxed. Its a nice feeling.</br>  <br>I'd say I may have approached or entered third plateau when I did 500, but most of my experiences fall on the second plateau, which is absolutely fine with me.</br>  <br>Stereotypes aside, the higher plateaus are even for some of the more advanced psyconauts, dxm on higher levels is so far out of a childs range of comprehension.</br>  <br>DPH and DXM are a really good combination, those other ones you mentioned are just 'tarded...</br>  <br>This. DXM is underrated because it's so easy for retards and kids to get.</br>  <br>Its great dissociative. And dont say something shit about ketamine or mxe, dxm feels quite different.</br>  <br>I have felt 0 hangover from dxm alone. I mixed with a little dph (not intentionally) and was lethargic the next day, but nothing in the realm of shitty hangovers. Fucking alchohol</br>  <br>you don't always experience higher beings, the last time i went into the 4th plat was around the time I was pretty addicted to WoW and I basically found Earth of Warcraft as I like to call it. I was doing a dungeon with other people who were on on DXM and we wiped. Sure it coulda been just a very vivid hallucination, but I like to think otherwise lol.</br>  <br>I agree with  to a fault. Never mix alcohol with anything as a rule, except a conservative amount of weed. DXM and weed is a good combination as weed prevents nausea and vomiting. Do you get paranoid when you smoke weed normally? Perhaps your paranoia was circumstantial.</br>  <br>Meh, I prefer traditional psychedelics....also shrooms are free :P</br>  <br>its a shit dissociative, and if you aren't extracting the dxm from robitussin it's absolutely terrible for you.</br>  <br>how are shrooms free? unless you live near a farm then i can understand but otherwise they aren't free.</br>  <br>[citation needed]</br>  <br>Um....wut. DXM is more psychedelic than dissociative, also you can buy pure DXM HCL on amazon.com, 900mgs for $20...are you sure you're not thinking of DPH?</br>    <br>One of the first times I got high on dxm, I had pneumonia, and had chugged down way too much nyquil (young and dumb), I was playing skyrim and for a solid hour (15 minutes reality) and whole heartidly believed I was a horse, majestically exploring the wilds.</br>  anyone else have trouble cumming on dxm?  <br>http://www.shroomery.org/9608/A-Gui<wbr>de-to-Hunting-and-Identifying-Panae<wbr>olus-cinctulus<br><br><br>They grow all over my college campus, I pick them 2x per week before class. Also commonly found on lawns worldwide.</br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br>  Considering using my wife's credit card to go buy 2 Benzedrex and eat them, then play Diablo 3 and have the time of my life, then face a shitty hangover tomorrow.  <br>when you experience Earth of Warcraft you'll wish it was real lol. I still do to this day and would probably play the fuck out of it if it comes out for when Hololens is out for more then a year. I'm sure blizzard will make loads of money from that.</br>  <br>I do on psychedelics, especially LSA. One time I was horny as fuck and fapping hard trying to cum as soon as possible but couldnt....</br>  <br>not my lawn lol.</br>  <br>I have only read, never encountered, but read that if your stomach does not contain the correct enzymes from types of food (sourdough bread as an example) that dxm can actually pass through your body with only minimal effects. Hallucinations on the other hand, are only based on your real world experiences. An individual with a pretty normal life might not get something out of dxm others might get.</br>  <br>Check other lawns, dicknips. Took me a few months of staring at grass like a tweaker but once I found a patch I've been bringing home about 4-6g per week.</br>  <br>Masturbating on acid for me is a bonkers experience. I can't get it up at all, and I've never cum before, but I just kinda squeeze and pinch at a half-chub and it feels like perpetual orgasmic ecstasy. Fucking weird.</br>  new drug user only done hash and green in my life<br><br>googling dxm is nice and all but i want your knowledge guys<br>how do i get this dxm, what does it do to you and for how long?</br></br></br>  <br>There are not many down-sides to dxm, but sexual dysfunction is always on the list. It's been proven left and right that many drugs prevent climaxing or even erections.</br>  <br> Hallucinations on the other hand, are only based on your real world experiences. An individual with a pretty normal life might not get something out of dxm others might get. <br><br>Same with LSD, shrooms, mescaline, DMT etc...<br><br>you also tend to see fractals and form constants like on traditional psychedelics.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I just read you should only do 1 on an empty stomach, but this thread isn't about speed you dumb fuck.</br>  <br>Fuck that noise nigga. You want to get crazy with this shit you gotta sip on some of that DXM polistrex. Delsym my go to. DXM molecule wrapped in a digestible plastic coating. Extended release. You drink a good bottle and a half of delsym and you will TRIP FUCKIN BALLS. For like 10 hours. And no acetaminophen and no guafiesin or however it's spelled. Safe as can be, lower nausea than any other method I've found, higher and longer and cleaner seeming trip.</br>  <br>http://dxm.darkridge.com/text/begin<wbr>ners.html<br>this is an AMAZING source, I can give a TL;DR if you want. But this is the #1 place to go. Erowid experiences vault is also a place if you want to know what you're getting into.</br></wbr></br>  <br>Yeah LSA is pretty much the same but I could get hard after a while. Never tried fapping on acid though, I'm usually with people when I drop.</br>  <br>i don't go for walks around my neighborhood so i'm good.</br>  <br>If I wanted to puke while tripping I'd chug San Pedro tea....much more worthwhile imo.</br>  <br>Chemtrails</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=UkE<wbr>h5Un_Kk0</wbr>  [ ]  <br>Well then you can just pay for them like a pleb or chug cough syrup like a 12-year-old...</br>  <br>I love dxm, but I still think delsym is for kids.</br>  <br>That polysterix stuff produces a lower quality high, but a longer duration. You'd have to chug more for even less. Also, for syrups, get Cough suppressant robo. It's basically pure DXm with no acetometophin and guistefisin er whatever.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;62656483 <br>That bloody next morning scalp. My life</br>  <br>gutfishin?</br>  <br>thank you very much<br>im 20 years old and 60kgs, how much should i take the first time? the 1st and 2nd plats sound nice, and youre right if you say its written exactly how mls you must take but it depends on your weight as said in the article</br></br>  <br>Ik ik. I just like the length of the trip. I drink alot more and make a day of it.</br>  ive tripped twice on lsd (200ug and 150ug) but havent tripped on anything else. for me lsd lasts a bit too long and I have bad trips often on it.<br><br>how long does dxm last and is it as trippy as lsd?</br></br>  <br>I am the same demographic, go to the wal-mart or the drug store, and buy one bottle of Robotussin 8-hour cough suppressant. Consume 1 hour before you want the effects, and it will last about 5 hours before you get near baseline again. This will get you at the lower end of the 2nd plateau.</br>  <br>read<br><br><br>Also<br>A nice system I use, is 1 bottle for "okay" effects. 1.5 bottles to get the speech slurred and the feelings good. Then 2 bottles for the closed eye hallucinations. following this method, I believe the 3rd bottle brings the open-eye hallucinations. (the mg per bottle makes me believe so)</br></br></br></br></br>  Ro-ro-robitussin!<br><br>I fkn LOVE DXM, it's amazing. I have had incredible, shamanic, spiritual experiences on it.<br><br>I once drank a bottle while meditating on top of ancient rock carvings in the middle of nowehere, and had the most mind-blowing day of my life. It actually made me a better person. I also used DXM to quit smoking cigs and codeine (it relieves opiatye withdrawal too!).<br><br>Amazing, serious drug. So glad it's still available. Use it responsibly and we'll all be able to go tripping legally for a while yet.<br><br><br><br>It can last 4 -6 hours, I reckon it's trippier than LSD, def. wierder, much harder to walk and talk, but equally fun and euphoric (for me, anyway).<br><br>Like, drink a full bottle (Dextromethorphan only, no Guafenesin) anjd you will trip balls. I live in Aus, so pic related.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>alright but im not sure i have these kind of cough depressants in my country<br>im a combat medic and all ive heard about is solvex/movex/rekod/codical and not sure if any of them contain dextromethorphan, ill check the public pharmacy once i get home and follow the instructions on the article you linked me, but still kinda feeling down that it might not have dxm</br></br>  DXM is the most beta and lame as fuck drug I have ever done. That is some 15 year old HighSchool bullshit. DXM is disgusting<br>Go ask your mom for $10 and ask that gangster kid in P.E. that is 17 for weed</br>  <br>https://drugs-forum.com/forum/showt<wbr>hread.php?t=107444<br><br>I wish you a lot of luck.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>sounds good, anon - I'm assuming you're in USA?<br><br>I reckon 380mg is a good amount to start with, 600mg for a great day but still able to walk, and for me 800mg+ I am no longer walking anywhere, and probably lost in the internet tubes shpongled out, seeking enlightenment</br></br></br>  <br>This kid obviously was too pussy to take a full dose. Weed is nowhere near the level of DXM...its more on-par with LSD or shrooms...</br>  <br><br>which country, anon?</br></br>  <br><br>I'm really jealous because the american robo is about 1/4th of the potency of the AUS version. Happy tripping man</br></br>  <br><br>You have no idea what you're talking about. I reckon you're scared.</br></br>  DXM was the first drug I ever did way back in 2001. The come-up and peak feel DISGUSTING.<br><br>Why anyone of legal drinking age would go buy dxm when you can drink some liquor is behind me.<br><br>To me, DXM screams SummerFag</br></br></br></br>  <br>israel<br>pls no hate</br></br>  1000% i used to do that...  <br>I think you've been taking it much longer than I, for your resistances are much higher lol<br><br>I am in the US, and I cap out around 600mg before I am sprawled out on the floor</br></br></br>  Isn't DXM that shit that kids in school call Triple C but without guafanisen or some shit? <br><br>yuck</br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, I'm pretty happy about it. Have introduced a couple of mates and they all had their fkn minds blown wide open.<br><br>However, I don't think we can get the pills or the polistyrex, which I would be interested in trying because dat syrup tastes fucked up, and I shiver every time I think about it</br></br></br></br>  <br>lol how is alcohol related in any way to DXM? I mean I'd recommend doing LSD, shrooms or DMT instead but DXM is way easier to get.</br>  <br>Wtf are you talking about. Nothing psychedelic about dxm.</br>  <br>DXM is a dirty,nasty,sluggish trip.<br><br>Just thinking of swallowing 30 red pills makes me want to gag. I threw up blood on 1500mg</br></br></br>  <br>CCC is apparently really shitty compared to other sources of DXM according to Erowid.</br>  <br><br>I lived on kibbutz for 6 months, all good bro<br><br>Awesome desert parties there... yeah I think it's very hard for you to get any decent drugs OTC, I could only buy 12 packs of codeine once a month...</br></br></br></br>  <br>I drink alcohol, but I hate what it does to your body, it's unhealthy physically and mentally. With dxm, you can get the effects of alcohol and weed, plus some really fun dissosiative effects you would NEVER get from either of the two. My favorite part is just -walking- when you are new to it. You feel your footsteps first, then a seconds later you perceive the distance you took with that footstep. This feeling makes you feel like you are floating through the world, making time slow down and speed up as well.</br>  <br>lol, are you sure you've even done DXM? It can be on the same level as LSD dude....</br>  <br>This nigga ate DXM with acetaminophen<br><br> being this pleb </br></br></br>  <br> imo <br>The polisterix isn't any better after awhile, and it's a lower quality high. all I care about is the amount of liquid I'm drinking because I have puking problems with robo.<br><br>ALSO a trick guys. Hold your nose while drinking and then drink a glass of milk, swishing it around your mouth at the end. Best way of dealing with the taste. I taste absolutely nothing afterwards.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>What are YOU talking about? It is a powerful hallucinogenic dissociative. Lower dose trips get me fully euphoric and exploring sacred geometry.<br><br>Also, DXM trip music for all of you trippers!<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=CVF<wbr>scjOsPRA</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Do you niggers realize the damage you're doing to your livers?

Hot as fuck, but I respect her too much to make a move she would regret.</br>  Sometimes I jerk off to petting my cat  I got anal raped once.  <br>I saw my brother masturbating.<br><br>I went into my room and laughed, he's so tiny compared to dad.</br></br></br>  <br>That's a man, baby</br>  K /b/ here we go:<br><br> Living together with three other people, 2 girls and 1 guy <br> Shared bathroom kitchen, that kind of stuff <br> Bathroom had openings for ventilation <br> Much high, but with chair you could easily see through <br> Crossed my mind, but never considered it, didn't want to get caught <br> One day, fuck it, let's try it <br> Holy naked boobs <br> Mfw, this is great <br> Over the years I got pretty good at timing it, was never caught <br> Have seen at least 6+ women (I know) naked while they were showering <br> Bitches do crazy stuff when in the bathroom <br> Best fapping material ever </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sexy.

You can only try to force something to work for so long, you know?</br>  <br>Fuck you.</br>  <br>very very common.</br>  <br>I did pull the knife on him</br>  <br>I've fucked my sister before.

I know, I was there for it</br>  <br>/b/ is my secret</br>  <br> saw my brother masturbating. <br> I went into my room and laughed, he's so tiny compared to dad. <br>how old is your brother?</br></br></br>  <br>i'm not a foot guy. but you're right, them feets are way hotter than them face.</br>  <br>Always a chance of success, no matter how slim.</br>  <br>Well, neither of us are 12, so I think we missed that opportunity.</br>  Femanon here.

I often think about how awesome death would be and wouldn't it be great if I don't have to kill myself and I die in some accident or something. That way my parents won't be sad about the fact that their son killed himself. <br>And no, I'm not depressed. I function fine.

I kinda liked the idea of dudes (but still women 99% of the time) over ten years ago, but I'm not that into it now. So I don't think it's a gay thing. I kind of like the idea of "returning to the body" too, even though physically that makes no sense.</br></br></br>  <br>High five anon.
