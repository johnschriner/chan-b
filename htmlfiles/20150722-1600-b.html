Almost broke my dick. Never trying anal again.  <br>Got shot in shitistan back in '05</br>  Sprained ankle  <br>I was shot in Afghanistan</br>  <br>one time i broke my pinky</br>  a broken heart  slammed my dick in a sliding glass door  I was pitting an avacado like a week ago and accidentally cut all the way through the pit and avacado into my left index finger. I severed the nerve and artery and now i wont be able to feel anything with that finger on one side for a few months. also there was a fuckload of blood.  <br>torn ACL, MCL, meniscus, and slight LCL tear.. playing indoor futbol... an illegal immigrant "hacked" my left leg...</br>  in high school track, i was long jumping. landed overhanging the board. Broke my femur and it came thru my skin. whitest white youve ever seen  <br>A broken fart.</br>  <br>like you were white or the bone was white?</br>  I tried to suck my own sternum and broke my cock  <br>I'd lick those toes.</br>  <br>dick tear(s)</br>  <br>Got shot when I was 15. Took a few months to go through rehab and recover.</br>  I have seriously sprained my ankles 3 times, twice on the left and once on my right foot. The latter being so bad that It woke me up at night and I couldnt even move from the pain, the pain was so bad I would have cut my foot off had i had a knife. Took 3 months to be able to walk normally again.  <br>you probably deserved it</br>  <br>why/how?</br>  Snapped banjo-string  <br>both</br>  Had my balls blown off in Iraq from an IED.  Broken jaw  <br>i was like 4 or 5, running in and out of the house through the sliding door wearing only my underwear, my little penor got a random boner and got slammed in the door</br>  Ripped my pinkie on the table saw. I went to catch a piece i passed through the table saw and i suppose i either dropped the piece onto the blade or i misjudged the distance between the blade and the end of the table. It didnt really hurt. Felt like sticking your finger in a plastic pedistal fan but startled the shit out of me. Lack of seep and a hangover had me sort of out of it that day  <br>This happened to me. The worst part was having my mouth wired shut for 3 months.</br>  Snapped my arm in half twice.<br>Shit was brutal man.</br>  broke my ankle  <br>Here's a picture i took at the hospita just l before being stitched up</br>  <br>Pics obviously related</br>  When I heard her say, I love you, but I lost the baby, please help me, god baby please don't leave me alone. On my voicemail. <br><br>I was on a 3 day trip to Virginia for work, my phone broke on night one. I came home to her in my bathtub, arms cut from wrist to elbow. If I'd have kept my phone on me and not dropped it she might still be. It's heavy.</br></br>  <br>Taylor</br>  <br>How heavy is it?</br>  <br>13 stitches later</br>  <br>Only reason I don't kill myself is to keep working, my grandfather and mother have cancer and are being crushed by the debt. I'm going without to keep them afloat.</br>  hyper-extended my knee playing college basketball  Shitty, weird neighbor shot me in the leg and left asscheek with rocksalt when I tried cutting through his property.<br>Learned my fucking lesson.</br>  <br>Life is for the living no need to feel bad. They don't have Obama care?</br>  <br>That's noble of you, anon.<br><br>I hope you find peace one day</br></br></br>  <br>Broken pinky, I'm a lucky SOB</br>  A papercut on my eye. Worst fucking pain in my life.  <br>You can't blame yourself for what someone else does to themselves, especially when they plan it such that you are not able to physically stop them.<br>If she did not succeed then, it would have been later at an even rougher patch like you becoming more busy in your cancer patient's lives. <br>Mourn the loss but move on. It's not your fault and never was. Remember the good times, and let the bad times be forgotten and forgiven.</br></br></br>  <br>My dick cought in a fan when I was following instruction to build a Ikea furniture.</br>  Torn meniscur<br><br>She got me</br></br>  <br> pain <br> eye <br> in an organ that has almost no surface nerves </br></br></br>  <br><br>knife Cut on upper arm, 10 Stitches.</br></br>  <br>Here's a pic after some healing</br>  a broken heart  <br>do you not have eyes or something you fucking idiot</br>  <br>Broken bone.</br>  <br>Well my grandfather got fucked, my grandmother still works but company messed up and he got dropped from her insurance for 2 months till reinstatement time. 2 months is an impossibly long time. Mother I don't really ask. Whatever little stuff she needs I help with, I don't like her, she didn't raise me. <br><br>Thanks anon. I have peace, happiness is not necessary to live.<br><br>It's easy to say and I'm sure you're right, in fact I agree, she was crazy, but I still miss her, I still won't ever open my heart like that again.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Your eyeballs cannot hurt, they lack the nerves to feel pain.</br>  <br>I have eyes, but I know your story is bullshit. <br>Had a friend who got a papercut on his eye too. No pain, just a bandage for a few weeks until it healed.</br></br>  <br>Step up your injury game cunt.</br>  Had a pocket knife in my coat, it came unsheathed somehow. Me, getting out of car, go to close car door by bumping into it with my hip. Knife is pointed right at me and goes almost 2 inches into led and nicks an artery. Don't think its that bad and really have to drive my friends to work or they are going to get fired. (friends work half an hour away) drive there and back home (1 hour later) blood has soaked through my jeans, thick coat, and through the car seat to the floor underneath. Still calm at the moment. Go inside the house pull off my pants to see how bad it is and a huge chunk of coagulated blood the size of a softball falls to the floor like jello. Freak out have panic attack call 911, they call life flight and like 2 ambulances and a couple cops. Also freaking out because I live in a house were the entire upstairs 2nd floor is used as a magic mushroom growing business and cops all in the house putting me on the stretcher. Luckily they did not go upstairs. At hospital they refuse to release me because I have self inflicted cuts everywhere...  Fell down some fucking 15 steps and the last two were concrete. Hit my head on both of them. I was around 5 I think. Head was fucked up, big gash and such. I walked right back up the steps and walked into the kitchen with blood getting in my eyes. The pain arrived shorty after. The worse pain though was when they had to strsp my ass down at the hospital to patch it up.  <br>I've broken then knuckles on my right hand 3 times (I'm 28) All the times where from fighting.. kept hitting till i broke it.. It's stupid i know, but I'm Danish, we don't use weapons we fight with our fists.</br>  <br>It's not easy to say. I had my best friend, practically a little brother, commit suicide in front of his ex wife after an argument with her. <br>We were supposed to get together that night and go shooting. <br>I blamed myself for over a year, kicking myself for not have knowing how badly his divorce affected him, what I could have done more to have stopped it, etc.<br>I finally had to realize it wasn't my fault, he made a bad choice in a split instant, and it was us loved ones of his that had to pay the cost.<br>Stay strong brother - things happen for a reason, even if we don't know why right away. Just how life is.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I have had sun poisoning 2 times and it is one of the worst feelings i have ever experienced</br>  <br>c1 c2 fracture broken hip ac separation broken collar bone. all at once.<br><br>run the fuck over by a Nissan.</br></br></br>  <br>Got stabbed twice by a darkness in front of jax landing<br>  Be at irish pub,walking out to parking garage <br>  Be with a group of 4 dudes <br>  Crackhead comes out of fucking no where <br> With like,an oyster knife or some shit <br>  Like he bought it at the dollar store <br>  "GIVE ME ALL UR SHIT OR ITS OVA MANG" <br> Tell him to fuck off <br>  He stabs me 4 times before my friends run over <br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/629568614#p629579664">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sorry for your loss man. I'll be fine, I've still got a fine job and a few drinks every now and then. I'll be okay.</br>  I spilt burning grease on my leg and arms. Have minor scarring on my right arm and hand to show for it if anyone cares.  Wives and GFs you shouldn't be posting...  <br> Dat goatee </br>  <br>The second time I caught myself just before I licked my phone. Thats just today, mind ye</br>  <br>keep going /b/ro!</br>  Okay 4chan I have to make the hard decision between build a bong or David Goldstein. What should I get the 16" David Goldstein or double freezer coil hoss  Or this Goldstein  <br>1st one<br>Coiled thingy</br></br>  <br>go with the goldstein , the pull apart ones are always a bitch to keep .</br>  Freezer coil hoss?  A double freezer coil g<br>Hoss would just feel like vaping</br>  I like the hoss more  Both fucking suck what're you 15?  <br>plus the goldstein looks better blown then the hoss</br>  Get a nice Sovereignty or just a regular straight/beaker with a nice gridded/circ down stem and a good 3-4 hole bowl or a Ben Wilson  <br>Follow your heart</br>  get a magic flight launch box they are awesome  I'd go for the goldstein personally,the whole pull apart aspect of the hoss is cool at first, but the novelty wears off quickly. Plus the goldstein seems much easier to clean. The only negative thing about the goldstein is a lack of an ice catcher, which isn't REALLY that big of a deal.  All these anons suggesting Goldstein<br><br> Goldstein </br></br>  But you could never take a cold toke in a goldstein  velcome to zhe 4th Uber games.<br>Rules are simple:<br>1. First 36.<br>2.
