Just need to find something you want to do with your life.</br>  <br>sounds like the opposite of growth<br><br>or maybe he's just discovered something truly profound that solves all the big questions the greatest thinkers of humanity have been trying to make sense of for longer than written history.<br><br>lets hear it anon. what amazing wisdom did you discern from this universe?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>do u have a job? or stay at home the entire day and let others pay your bills? Do u have friends? If no, get out of home more often</br></br>  My life was pretty pointless. No job, no gf, on disability benefits because paranoid schizophrenia.<br><br>But, I started going to the gym, meeting people at a local pub and I might have a full time job soon.<br><br>Life's not feeling too bad at the moment, although I'm more or less just waiting for my schizophrenia to relapse again and ruin my life.</br></br></br></br>  <br>you mean kneelism (thanks terrance mckenna)<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=vv2<wbr>g3vyvxO4&amp;spfreload=1</wbr>  [ ]<br>stayinyourplaceism (tips hat, immortal technique_</br></br></br>  <br>I was born in American Currently living in the UK <br><br>And I'm 20.</br></br></br>  <br>I grew out of thinking about pointless shit, stopped being a pity party, and moved onto trying to better myself and my life by getting an education, pursuing women, learning about important things instead of reading existential literature/philosophy while listening to metal and getting high, etc</br>  <br>I'm 31. This isn't a hormonal thing, it's a logical conclusion. Meaning is not an inherent feature of the universe, it's just some shit we made up. To willfully pretend otherwise is naive.</br>  learn to play the drums man everybody needs a drummer these days and youll get a hobby, meet fuckloads of people and maybe even make a bit of wedge  Don't like your life, then leave. Go anywhere, do anything, and don't give us any stupid fucking excuses like "muh computer", or "muh family". If you were gonna kill yourself then everyone around you means fuck all anyways  life IS pointless / meaningless.<br><br>but not "useless"<br><br>just because there isnt a pre-determined "meaning" or "point" doesnt make this ride completely useless.<br><br>use it for anything you want.<br><br>GO OP GO.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>move back and do Teach For America. people I know who have done it say it's extremely rewarding. You get like 50k per year and you teach kids who don't value education in poor areas where you can make a huge impact on a lot of lives. You don't need a teaching degree or anything.</br>  <br>You're right, it's not a hormonal thing. It's a maturity thing. You'll understand once you leave the basement and take the Nietzsche posters down.</br>  <br>lol<br><br>it's like if my cat could write, this is what it would write.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, I have a decently paying job, I have friends, etc etc. <br><br>It just all seems so vain to me, like there is no answer to anything. Just survival. Sustainment.</br></br></br>  <br> moved onto trying to better myself <br><br>Why?<br><br>If you cannot answer that question, then you haven't grown out of anything, you've just stopped thinking.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I tried to fill the void in my worthless life with the acquisition of material things. <br><br>lol Cool anon. Let us know how that turns out for ya in another couple decades.</br></br></br>  <br>The poster thing is a pretty funny accusation, actually; I have no posters on my walls at all. Way more nihilistic.</br>  <br>happiness, laughter, self betterment, pure clean ideals &amp; objectives<br><br><br> try to not screw things up for other people. <br>if it doesn't come back on you though who cares, morality becomes a moot point, redundant. no fear of no repercussions, the environment is infinitely maluable and subjective, riddled and ridiculed with error and imperfection. objectivity is no longer achievable because of the interconnected fate of the human species. a critically sad error of time to be born. a bad era<br><br>dystopic psych associators should just kill themselves right now, you are the bad breed, its not about genes or blood, its individual judgement of consciousness, redundant fucking untelligence. murder god</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I have experienced that same feeling.<br><br>Answer is: its true. Life has no meaning. Because of that, the only thing you can do is try and enjoy it while it lasts.</br></br></br></br>  Sports<br>Now go set a goal and work towards it. Lose some weight and gain some muscles. Boosts self-esteem and makes you happy</br>  <br>Because my desire to explore and experience all the cool shit this world has to offer is greater than my desire to waste my life searching for answers that simply don't exist and waste my life.</br>  <br>It's the sad truth I feel; nihilism. I don't have any advice for you other than don't get hurt by people.</br>  <br>In other words, happiness is a biological impulse, so the best way to achieve it is with biological stimuli; food, sex, exercise, narcotics, social interaction, etc.</br>  <br>I've been down that road. And yes its satisfying to have a nice looking body. You feel better in your own skin, more comfortable with yourself. <br><br>However, at the end of the day, its just another superficial trait.</br></br></br>  <br>have kids</br>  <br>So you argue with my initial post...<br><br> This is the unpleasant truth to which all rational thinking eventually leads. There is no correct answer, you simply pick the one you like the best, or you end it. <br><br>...even though that's exactly what you've done.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The purpose of live is to feel good and have fun. You don't need anything else. Hang out with friends. Drink, do drugs, have sex. Find a way to finance your pleasures. Create something.</br>  <br>anon wouldn't by chance happen to be a USfag now would he?<br><br>an entire country, devoid of philosophy, producing generations of this shit.</br></br></br>  <br>being healthy is not a superficial trait you retard fuck.<br><br>injury pain is real</br></br></br>  <br>yeah, having kids solves all kinds of problems.<br><br>...and totally doesn't dump all your problems onto them.<br><br>lol</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Both of which are obviated by death, which is inevitable.</br>  <br>Being healthy is normal as far as I'm concerned. <br><br>Looking good while doing it is superficial.</br></br></br>  <br>nice dubs and nice post</br>  <br><br>well dude, then welcome to real life, just deal with it</br></br>    <br>Like...a mass shooting?</br>  <br>A lot of people never really have that epiphany and find it melodramatic sounding personally I think they just haven't learned enough to see it. It never changes once you realize it, although sometimes you might not actively think about it all the time but it doesn't really go away.<br>I've found having a strict job gave me a sense of purpose. Usually the average person can't really use a lot of their freedom and rights to do much so giving a few of them up is worth what you get out of it.</br></br>  <br>I meant I'm beyond thinking along the lines of "oh no existence is so pointless that I should just kill myself". Once you get older you realize you've just been thinking about stuff like that because your life is literally pointless for the first 20 or so years.<br><br>It's very unfortunate and twisted that our society has gone this way, some of our best years are completely wasted. Things didn't used to be like that.</br></br></br>  <br>if you're bored and have no purpose in life then have kids. They will give you a purpose unless you have mental problems.<br><br>Have a problem with my post? well eat my buldgy mushroom cock you fucking faggot</br></br></br>  <br>But thats just the thing. Wouldn't living be pointless once you come to this realization? <br><br>I think I'd rather be dead than other sheep in the herd of mindless people living their purposeless lives.</br></br></br>  its all a state of mind. sometimes our feelings manifest as groups of words that later on we'll realize we didn't really mean, or we might not understand. everyone knows positive attitudes exist, but not everyone can ward off being negative all the time. you have to discipline and push yourself and if you work hard enough, really simple/easily taken for granted things will start to seem like miracles.  <br> I meant I'm beyond thinking along the lines of "oh no existence is so pointless that I should just kill myself". <br>You're not actually reading what I'm saying, you're just projecting your teenage angst onto me.<br><br>I'll repeat it:<br>  There is no correct answer, you simply pick the one you like the best <br>Is exactly what you've done. You chosen an answer. Indeedn, you've chosen a really stereotypical answer: hedonism. Doing things that feel good. Like animals do.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> muh 1800s thinking <br> subjecting kids to my bullshit makes me feel better <br>lol<br>guess again faggot, and having kids won't solve your fucked up marriage either.<br><br>Have kids because you can afford to give that kid a wonderful fucking life, not because your selfish ass thinks they'll be a band-aid for your problems.<br><br>It just creates kids with fucked up upbringings that need therapy and shit up the world further as adults.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not true at all really it has to do with mood.<br><br>see <br><br><br><br><br><br>you may feel like that today but you know it's not the only thing you feel. it's mood/perspective.. the mind is tricky. i'd say you're normal but from personal experience working my balls off tends to make me more optimistic when I'm done.. just sitting drinking some tea is wonderful</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> not depressed, just have empty life and thinks there's no point in living <br>this is the DSM definition of depression retard</br></br>  <br>but the DSM is bullshit anon, its really hard to argue/explain and i'm probably not the best person for the job, but it's bullshit.</br>  <br>Well, Other than that trait, I don't feel depressed at all. <br><br>I laugh, love, function socially, blah blah blah. I just see no meaning to life.</br></br></br>  I'm going exactly through that, OP  <br><br>The DSM is more of a political tool that offers descriptive guidelines. The entire field of psychology is likely to be rendered obsolete by neurology in the next few decades.</br></br>  <br>Blowjobs are the only thing in life.<br>I can't enjoy sex, but blowjobs are always there for me.<br>Even if my gf is bad at them :(</br></br></br>  <br>You've got me interested, explain more about this neurology? If you know, what a gift that would be to have a likely smart person share some rare knowledge on /b/.</br>  <br> I think I'd rather be dead <br><br>You know this to be not true, or you would be in the ground instead of posting on /b/<br><br><br><br>Not sure how you could say I'm the one projecting teenage angst when you are acting like the classic annoying pseudo intellectual that just discovered Dostoevsky and despite not comprehending any of it acting like you've attained enlightenment.<br><br> hedonism <br><br>Yeah pursuing a woman is totally full blown hedonism, you've earned a fedora tip for that one.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>all anyone needs to know. also work hard</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm kind of thinking the same thing, we're making strides in neuroscience, but I know for certain it will be far more than a few years. Our knowledge of brain function is still shockingly rudimentary. We're at the level where we understand that some molecule binds to some receptor and then X,Y, and Z happens in the brain. We still don't know the how a lot of this happens nor why, just that it does happen.</br>  <br>I can't go into very much detail, since I'm not a neurologist. But basically if the mind is analogous to a computer, psychology is learning how it works by sitting down with a keyboard, mouse and screen and trying to use it and neurology is learning how it works by opening up the case and see what all the little components do.<br><br>Essentially, we're still just animals. Our brains aren't fundamentally different than other animals, they obey all the same physical laws, they're just a little bit more complex. When we understand the brain, we'll understand the mind.</br></br></br>  <br>I would rather be dead, but the ironic thing is that I see no meaning in being dead either. <br><br>Its like being stuck in limbo.</br></br></br>  do anything you faggot.<br><br>just because it doesnt have a "point" doesnt mean you cant do anything with it.<br><br>its a video game. do anything you want.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's true.<br>Psychology is to Neurology what Astrology is to Astronomy.<br><br>One creates mountains of gibberish out of trying to make sense of apparent effects and has a shitty track record of helping anything, the other studies the causes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>its called the beginning of nihilism, their are too types of people in this world<br><br>1. Men<br>Accepting the reality of life with not making any magical excuses and coming to terms with how life has no meaning, this gives the man room to remove any pre con sieved notions towards how to live their lives and start anew. This means to set their morals given there situation while imposing their beliefs on others soley based on control.<br><br>2. Bitches<br><br>Not excepting how life has no meaning and adhering to a convenient set of principles forced upon them by the men. <br><br>Know your place.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ignoring the ad hominem.<br><br> Yeah pursuing a woman is totally full blown hedonism <br>That's exactly what it is. You have biological urges and you're obeying them. You're not asking yourself why you want a woman in your life, you're not asking why sex feels good or questioning why humans are social animals, you're just doing it.<br><br>You've chosen your answer and stopped thinking. Which is exactly what I said the solution to existential nihilism is.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I don't think that psychiatry and psychology will be useless at least for another century.</br>  <br>That's pretty cool advice, chap.<br><br>You're a solid dude.</br></br></br>  <br>there is no point to life. that's a fact<br>But what you can do is not be a bitch</br></br>  <br>Damn, linked wrong text<br><br>I'm kind of thinking the same thing, we're making strides in neuroscience, but I know for certain it will be far more than a few years. Our knowledge of brain function is still shockingly rudimentary. We're at the level where we understand that some molecule binds to some receptor and then X,Y, and Z happens in the brain. We still don't know the how a lot of this happens nor why, just that it does happen.</br></br></br>  <br>Ok, cool analogy nonetheless. I will not forget that.</br>  <br><br>there is NO answer you faggot.<br><br>you've already figured that out. THERE IS NO ANSWER.<br><br>so to wonder about the answer for the next 80 years YOU ARE A FAGGOT RETARD.<br><br>THERE IS NO ANSWER NOW GO AND DO ANYTHING / ANY ANSWER</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>there are too types of people in this world<br><br>those that know the difference between to, too, and two,<br><br>and those who put 7 billion people into two types of people.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah... blowjobs are nice. <br><br>But what about after the blowjob?</br></br></br>  <br> http://www.nature.com/news/scienti<wbr>sts-read-dreams-1.11625</wbr> <br> http://news.sciencemag.org/brain-b<wbr>ehavior/2014/08/researchers-erase-f<wbr>earful-memories-mice</wbr></wbr> <br> http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/st<wbr>ory/2014/07/researchers-shed-new-li<wbr>ght-on-schizophrenia/</wbr></wbr> <br><br>I doubt it will take that long.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't act like you weren't the one to resort to ad hominem first.<br><br> That's exactly what it is <br><br>No, it's not. Comparing want a woman to hedonism is like saying wanting a beer is alcoholism. Know the meaning of the words you pick to insult people with.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And this is the answer? That there isn't one?<br><br>Pepe.jpg</br></br></br>  <br><br>ANYTHING OR NOTHING YOU PICK THE NEXT APPEALING ONE.</br></br>  <br><br>In the same boat myself.</br></br>  <br> there is NO answer you faggot. <br><br>...yeah. I know. I said that here: <br> There is no correct answer, you simply pick the one you like the best <br><br>Emotion and Reason are mutually exclusive. Would you kindly step away and breathe for a minute or two so you can think again?</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br>of course thats the answer THERE IS NO MEANING TO LIFE.<br><br>so make the decsion to do:<br><br>A.) WHATEVER<br><br>B.) NOTHING AT ALL (since theres no meaning, you have to follow suit and do nothing, right?)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>then you're ready for existential psychology<br>i suggest you read:<br>Soren Kierkegaard <br>albert camus: the stranger<br>or at least take a look at this youtube channel<br>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7<wbr>IcJI8PUf5Z3zKxnZvTBog</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>JUST DOOO EEEETTT</br>  <br>Hey thanks, I'll take a look.</br>  <br>Ah, there it is. You have a derogatory view of hedonism, which is why you interpreted it as an insult.<br><br> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedo<wbr>nism</wbr> <br> Hedonism is a school of thought that argues that pleasure is the primary or most important intrinsic good. In very simple terms, a hedonist strives to maximize net pleasure (pleasure minus pain). <br><br>That's all it means. Seeking pleasure. Doing things that feel good. Doesn't mean you have to become an obese, addictive slob in doing so.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  If there is no point in living then there is also no point in dying.  Create a gaming backlog. My never ending backlog is the only thing that is giving me purpose to keep on living, which will probably keep on piling up until the day I die of old age.<br><br>Gotta finish it.</br></br>  <br>It also allows for things like exercising because in exchange for a small amount of physical stress and muscle soreness, you get to enjoy the increased strength, the improved physique, and the wealth of social benefits that come with those traits.</br>  <br><br><br> YOU MUST GIVE LIFE PURPOSE</br></br></br>  <br><br>not really.<br><br>just do stuff. or sit there.<br><br>nobody is going to be "THE ONE" that found "THE" meaning to life.<br><br>ponder a little, fuck around a little, sit there a little, or a lot... or or or<br><br>OR<br><br>OR<br><br>x1,000,000</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Also when I said, "projecting teen angst," I wasn't trying to imply that you were currently experiencing it, I was just saying that those memories were coloring your interpretation of me.</br>  <br>looks like you are dying at 40</br>  <br>make a purpose</br>  LIFE = MULTIPLE CHOICE<br><br>or sit there with a pencil in your hand crippled by all the choices.<br><br>YOUR CALL OPIE</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think I'd mind dying at that age.</br>  <br>Yeah, it's a multiple choice test with no numbers or letters that never gets graded.</br>  OP here. <br><br>Thanks for contributing everyone. I think I've found my answer: Make a purpose. <br><br>Now its just a matter of determining what that purpose will be.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>it gets graded if you care to listen.<br><br>but thats a choice down the list of multiple choices too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Think so. But for me its more like the laidback thing I can always tell myself. No matter what happens it doesnt matter. Do what u want nothing matters.</br>  <br>Just camp out until the singularity hits and life will get very interesting.<br><br>Or you know...actually go outside and do shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Another test taker saying, "hey, that looks good" isn't what I mean by grading.</br>  <br><br>then find jesus, faggot.</br></br>  Just live your life. Keep doing what your doing. Because although you might not become the multi billion dollar man (or woman) that changes the lives of everyone, your actions do influence the lives of the people around you, matter how big or small your actions are. And when you are on your death bed +50 years from now (I don't know how old you are), just keep in mind the fact that your actions influenced someone else's actions, who influenced someone else's, who influenced someone else's, who may have ended up influencing that multi billion dollar man (or woman). Just know that you are here for a reason, no matter how big or small. Otherwise the universe would have killed you off by now.  TBH, lately i have been thinking about whats tehe meaning of life, and ever since i started thinking that i have not been afraid of doing dangerous shit, and dont care about dying or something (not suicidal thoughts) Im normal guy, party in weekends work in weekdays (18 years old on education) But i still got no clue of wtf to do with this gift called "Life" you guys understand me?  <br>I've grown out of playing pretend, thanks.</br>  <br>Too bad the planet is already FUBAR</br>  Kill urself,lol  <br>Literally anything. As long as you put your mind to it, almost anything is possible today. The means to become great are there. There really is no such thing as being born a genius anymore. The human mind and body are capable of doing some fucking cool shit. Want to become the head engineer of a company that builds future space habitation? Go for it. Want to be the worlds top free climber? Go for it. The only thing holding you back is your own effort. Oh, and you know, the worlds racism, sexism, and plethora of other -isms, but you can ignore those as long as you try hard enough. Just know you can't go beyond the laws of physics.</br>  <br>no, its not. grow up.</br>  <br>10 year old detected.</br>  <br>You need a joint my friend</br>    <br>Duh you fucking faggot you're life is meaningful if you make it so. Simply being alive isn't a reason to live.</br>  <br> I tried to fill the void in my worthless life with the acquisition of material things. <br> Being this edgy <br><br>Usually men stop liking fight club once they realize the author was a gay communist. You're fucking stupid. Material things are great, stop buying into the bullshit commiewood told you, faggot.<br><br>Swear you sound like a fucking 12 year old when you do this shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're so fucking autistic, we all WANT for you to kill yourself. Like holy shit I thought people could be pretentious. I'm glad I found reasons to live again. Wouldn't want to be some huge beta faggot like OP.</br>  <br>Yeah man,<br>4 years ago I decided I wanted to become a artist for video games and movies.<br>It's been my single focus since then.<br>Every day, As much as possible, without breaks...<br><br>I'm currently getting paid to help make a game so, It was all worth it!</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thats some really awesome artwork!</br>  daily. Here is what i do, think, why die and become nothing surrounded by nothing and deal with nothing through an endless time, if you can instead live a life and have a chanse at experience something great in any way"  <br>Yup, I would post one of my own but trying to become a professional and having your work traced back to 4chan isn't ideal.<br>I fucking love all you vile people but I don't want that on my CV</br></br>  <br>See? As long as you put effort in, literally everything (within the bounds of the laws of physics) is possible.</br>  <br>We're all insignificant you fool, look at the size of the universe. The important thing is that you shouldn't think of yourself as a human being that is useless. We're all part of the universe, we are just particles bumping up against eachother affecting what happens around us. When we die we return to the universe in a different from, we just join the other particles. <br>Not everybody can do everything, but everybody can do something. There's a bigger picture /b/ro, once you realise that we're all part of something bigger, something that is beyond our control.</br></br>  <br>It's true.<br>Pick something you love, find a way to make money from it so you don't have to suffer a shit job. <br>I'm currently charging 46+ Usd per hour while I'm drawing shit for video games.<br>You can do whatever you want friends!</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>And i alzó like that pic m8</br></br>  <br>I know how you feel, OP. I have no life. I go no where. I have nothing to look forward to. Everyday is the same. I'm broke, I can't work because of health problems. My life is in the toilet and I have no idea how to fix it. Trust me, my life is pointless too. You're not alone.</br>  <br>Yes I have considered the scale of the universe. The seemingly infinite cosmos only exemplifies our infinitesimal existence. <br><br>By the scale of the universe, we barely exist, and yet somehow we still do. Which is amazing.</br></br></br>  <br>You will enjoy the singularity theory</br>  do a flip fagit  <br>Honeslty, my problem is my lack of effort, motivation, support, or self esteem. I'm lazy as fuck, I lose motivation over night (I will literally be pumped about doing something, go to bed, and wake up the next morning saying "nah, not worth it, won't work"), the things I do like to do manage to upset my parents and friends (such as videogaming, to name one thing. They know I can make money off of it, they just hate it when I play video games in general), and he things I do have some chance of getting good enough to charge money on end up being things I won't actually pursue because anytime I make any mistake, I end up beating myself up to a point where its hard to bring myself to the point I was at prior to said mistake. So yeah.</br>  <br>You came to a realization? Man, you wouldn't last long enough to even penetrate a girl, I feel sorry for you</br>  <br>I completely understand and empathise with your sitaution. I've met many many people who pursue art who have that very same problem and they quit. <br><br>Thats why it has to be something you want to do above all else. I used to play video games both WOW and LOL were massive timesinks in my life but the more I drew and painted and learned what game design was like the more those became bleak and boring short term dopamine hits that could never compete with the joy I was getting from doing what I really loved. <br><br>Life is a long walk towards your grave, you can however fill it with things you enjoy along the way. Go outside and ruin your moms garden and try to grow something, research what you need to do to make it grow the best. Fuck if I know if you will enjoy it but before too long you will have some homegrown tomatoes (or weed if you are into that).</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sounds good to me</br>  <br>Took me a second to catch that one!</br>  <br>There's always the: "Turn your life around and find some meaning" option, but since this is 4chan I doubt anyone will take that option seriously.</br>  <br>I know how you feel op, I'm on the same boat.<br>I got so low in my life, I don't even mind the future, I just do whatever comes to my mind.</br></br>  <br>No it's true.</br>  <br>that's my life, all the days i try to find a reason to dont't kill myself, and that's what you have to, consider the following: if you feel your life is empty, the best you can do isn't try to find something that make u happy? yes is easy to kill u, is way and you must decide if take it or not, but think first in your family, in your friends etc, what they'll say?</br>  <br>Congrats faggot you've realized the most important thing anyone with two brain cells to rub together will come to understand. Now quit being all edgy and just an hero or just live life in such a way that it pleases you already.</br>  <br>It's funny, because clearly you don't actually believe anything you are saying. You say nothing has meaning, but you take up the cause of proliferating that philosophy. You act like there is no truth that you care about, but clearly you care whether you are part of the "herd". You even admit that you "see no meaning in being dead". The fact is, whether or not there is objective meaning, human beings seek meaning. That's the funny thing about nihilism. It only ever spreads through people who aren't actually nihilistic.</br>  <br>this</br>  <br>I mean, I always have enjoyed designing characters. There's just something really cool about creating a character and having it come to life. Call it a god complex, but I just feel really accomplished when stuff like that happens. It's why I was really into online role playing. Creating a character and giving them life is just really fulfilling to me. I'm just not sure on how I could really end up making a living off of it. Like, I know there us character design for videogames, and I could also become an author, or maybe help with making a screenplay or something along those lines, I'm just not really sure on how to get from where I am to the end.</br>  <br>This is more my jam.</br>  <br>maybe i should get my life together just to get a bitch like that. life aint pointless if u got fun times</br>  <br>All the time.</br>  I feel the same. Want to be an artist but then realized that its pretty much impossible to actually get anywhere unless your god tier.<br><br>Thinking about suicide soon tbh</br></br>  <br>1nqfp8+50rplf7wp0qxc@sharklasers.co<wbr>m<br>I could try to help you in a direction if you want to but I won't be another negative voice in your life.<br><br>You don't have to be god tier to get work,<br>Just better tha the people who are doing the jobs atm.<br>Windmaker on deviant art is not a expert artist but he get's a lot of work.</br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br>  <br>Hey anon, I want to do concept art but I live in the UK and I feel as though its impossible.<br><br>Is it?</br></br></br>  The only thing I know to be true and worthy is fighting and winning.<br>And that OP is faggot.</br>  <br>But being god tier comes with practice. Just throw some effort at it (Okay, throw A LOT of effort at it) and you'll be able to become god tier. Nor reason to give up on something you like. It's possible. If somone else can do it, you can too. The only things different between you and that god tier artist are a couple genes. Otherwise, you two are still human. Yeah, they might just click with art, and to you it might be difficult. But with work you can get there. True, maybe a lot more work and time than other people, but the fact that you can actually get there no matter what should outweigh the fact that you cant do it now or that it takes less time for others.</br>  <br>"welcome to the shitshow" thanks anon, made me kek</br>  <br>Yeah but things like concept art require you to be the best of the best and there is no guarantee (especially if you're self taught) that you will be good enough or get anywhere.<br><br>Doesn't help when you live in a shit country.</br></br></br>  <br>not at all man,<br><br>We can get in touch if you contact me through that email and we can see about getting you pm your journey to working in the industry..<br>I'll be there for you every step of the way if you turn out to be a bro!</br></br></br></br>  Just find a purpose and try to make it happen. Simple as that. That could be anything, dont let your dreams be dreams.  <br>I couldn't get anywhere at the moment, my work is fucking abysmal.</br>  <br><br>Actually country has nothing to do with it at all if you are self-taught.<br>I'm currently doing work for a Canadian Client but I live in Europe.<br>Hardwork can make up for a lack of talent,<br>But talent can never make up for a lack of hardwork.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck is purpose?<br>Why aren't you just enjoying shit? Have you ever watched a movie?</br></br>  <br>My work was compelte garbage when I started too.</br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>sure.. i just found a way out is all</br>  <br>Prostitutes, drugs, sex, crime and murder. What are you waiting for?</br>  <br>Better than my work.<br><br>Pic related, its shit. I am doing a illustration course so I will be landed with debt soon and kill myself eventually.<br><br>But thanks anon, I will keep the email and will let you know when I am good enough</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>there are two kinds of people in this world<br><br>douchebags and ironic douchebags</br></br></br>  <br>I'll let you in on a secret.<br>Nothing matters. Not you, not me, not anything. In a million years who will give a fuck? No one because we will all be dead.<br>Hope that helps!</br></br></br>    <br>I mean, what normal people like me and the most others -&gt; they work 7½ hours a day, then they come home (gf my opinion, some family) And then the day starts all over again the next day</br>  <br>it's a throwaway mail, send me a email on it now so we can stay in touch man.<br>I've been where you are now artistically and I could really help you get to the next level with a bit of advice.</br></br>  <br>Seems rather shifty to be honest though.<br><br>I'll bite I guess.</br></br></br>  <br>Congratulations so is everyone else's. Meaning/worth/purpose is a human word a human idea. There is no reason to be alive just as there is no reason to be dead. If your life is empty then fill it with what you want.</br>  if you have nothing to lose, you shouldnt fear the supposed dangers of psychedelic drugs.... either you will find out you have something to lose, or maybe do something that may change you..  <br>No No, I'm not shifty. Just a guy who has had a shit life but finally something is working out for once.</br>  <br>Yes, it's called "being alive". None of our lives matter in the long run. Still that's no reason to bitch. Man the fuck up, and make your own reasons.</br>  BROWN GIRLS<br><br>INDIAN / PAKI / MIDDLE EASTERN<br><br>SOCIAL MEDIA FAP THREAD</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Wha if I can Google it?

After some additional chum covered sucks I'll make out with him and transfer his jizz into his mouth until it disintegrates from our mouths and tongues from making out so vigorously. During ganbangs I'll request my tops to cum in my mouth like a receptacle and I'll swallow the entire heap with pleasure. With two bottoms I'll get my ass filled with cum watch the other bottom get his ass jizzed then suffocate my face deep into that guys asshole usually with him sitting on my face then he'll slightly squeeze the semen out of his anus and directly into my throat where I'll eat it no problem but continue to rim said asshole and appreciate eating something so forbidden all while gasping for air  <br>Nigger what</br>  <br>tasty.

She's a pro. <br> Buries her face into my gut (I'd like to say "abs," here, but I'm just not fit. Didn't slow her down any) <br> I cum without warning her. <br> She helps me finish with one hand without pulling her mouth off me. <br> Looks up, closed-mouth smile. <br> Spits some cum onto the floor, then shows me the rest still in her mouth. <br> Swallows, smiles. <br> We both laugh like idiots. <br><br>And then we went back out and talked about hiking and mountains for another twenty minutes.<br>Hiking and mountains.<br>I swear to god.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Even if I was old I'm still not wrong.

She also looks like she would give you the ride of your life.</br>  <br><br>yes</br></br>  <br><br>No, there was a fan that couldn't be turned off and there was that airport hum, too. Plus people tried to open the door even though a light tells them the door is locked. And she was underage, so my imagination turned every noise of the door handle turning into a dozen cops bursting in to arrest me, but I just tried to ignore it until she got me into enough of a rhythm that I didn't care.</br></br>  <br><br>she always had baked bean juice around her mouth. i didnt like her that much</br></br>    <br><br>Such a hot story, thanks.</br></br>  <br><br>You friend with her on FB?</br></br>  BUMP    BUMPPP  <br><br>I have had a wildly improbable life, to the point that I have to wait for people to know me very well before I tell them many of the things that have happened to me or that I've done, or they'd think I was lying. But this is one of those things. I actually got a blowjob from an underage Maise Williams in an airport bathroom. Other shit no one will believe:<br><br>I am good friends with the man in charge of Disney for all of Asia, and will get to see Star Wars months before the premiere.<br><br>I found $8,000 in cash in a paper bag when I was 13. My parents took most of it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Those tits, fuck.</br></br>    she probably masturbates every single day on the shower... <br><br>she's a teenager, I can easily see her be wet watching some porn</br></br>  <br><br>And she swallowed your cum! Wasn't her first time anyway.</br></br>  <br><br>I know, man</br></br>  <br><br>Yes. And she was surprised I was circumcised because I'm not Jewish, and I got to explain America's circumcision fetish. So If anyone ever brings up to her the issue of how common circumcision is in America, there will probably be a split second where she thinks about the time she blew me. My life, /b/.</br></br>  <br>wait... because you actually thought we believed you??<br><br>dude, not only no one ever believed any story coming from 4chan ever, but you don't even have any writing skill: an underage girl deepthroating? really? are you 12 or what?</br></br></br>      <br>ugly fucking bridge troll</br>  <br><br>I want to squeeze them really hard.</br></br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br>she has nice tits<br><br>pink pussy and tight ass</br></br></br>  <br>I bet Maisey is the butch and Sophie is the bitch.</br>  <br>Thats why furries are still here then?</br>  <br><br>Did it look something like this?</br></br>  <br> thinks herpes are inside the mouth <br> doesn't know what a canker sore is <br>retarded high schooler detected</br></br></br>  <br>nah, look at the pics and the body language, Sophie is clearly the man in her relationships</br>  <br> you don't even have any writing skill: <br><br>I really don't, but it happened. And there's no way you could ever believe me, obviously. It would be pointless to try, because you'd need to know me to believe me, but if you knew me I'd never tell you, because then you'd know I'm a pedo.</br></br></br>   hundreds of trap threads with a large portion of 4channers lusting over men that look like women <br> still can't deal with a woman who looks like 10 year old boy with FAS <br>shig diggy /b/ get your act together, her pussy is probably the tightest thing on the planet too, could probably start fusion if you fucked her.</br></br>  <br>what were her little girl tits like?</br>  <br>her feet are overlooked because of her face<br>they're just so perfect</br></br>  <br><br>She was younger, and had no makeup on. Her hair wasn't done, she had street clothes on. She was wearing heels but they weren't so tall and they were sandal-like.</br></br>  <br>I wish she took a shit in my mouth and made me eat all of it.</br>  <br><br>would you jerk off on them?</br></br>  <br>me too xD</br>  <br><br>I mean her position.</br></br>  <br><br><br>motherfucking summer</br></br></br>    <br><br>Not very tit-like. Her chest wasn't hot, but the situation was hot.</br></br>  <br><br>Such a stupid question</br></br>  <br>K guys we're done for today. We can all go home now.</br>  <br><br><br>oh god.</br></br></br>  I saw in Bath once.<br><br>I was waiting to go to the Roman Baths, when she walked past a hoodie on saying 'MW'. I was really staring and she just looked at ne and smiled and kept walking. She had no make-up on and looked kinda ugly.</br></br>  <br><br>For her blowing me, yes. She just bent over at first without kneeling down, but then knelt down when she got in front of me.</br></br>  <br>she has roman feet</br>  <br><br><br><br> Lying on the Internet to seem cool <br> Implying you're not trying to compensate for a failed life <br><br>Kek, get the fuck out of here, no one believes the shit you spread.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>far more ugly irl than in pics, literal 2/10</br>  <br>is Maisie a sloppy sucker?</br>    <br><br>In a good way. She was a sloppy pro.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>You're fucking pathetic.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    bump  <br>summer's here I see</br>  I wish I could shit in her face and then fuck her stronger.  <br><br>I know the feeling. I've fucked Jessica Alba, Maise Williams, Charlize Theron and your mother, but no one believes.</br></br>  <br>I fucked katy perry once</br>  <br><br>Stop samefagging so obviously. The poster counter didn't increase.</br></br>  <br>I am Katy Perry</br>  <br><br>I want to do really bad things to them.</br></br>  <br>Did you actually grab her head and fuck her mouth?</br>    <br>First one looks much better. Second one looks genetically weak/ plastic/ and either mediteranean or semitic. Not to mention retarded.</br>  <br>June 25, 2014 In D.C do you remember me?</br>    <br><br>I did exactly that.</br></br>  <br>someone x-ray this</br>  <br>I knew that was bait but I couldn't help googling to see what old samwell has been up to.<br><br>Found this of him. He looks great compared to matt smith who is the ugliest male actor I've set eyes on. Something must've happened to Smith's mother while he was in the womb... He's like a young freddie from elm street...</br></br></br>  <br><br>Do you have more?</br></br>  <br>You must replay that memory and fap often.</br>  <br> poster counter <br>newfag detected</br></br>    fgbfhg  <br>Thighs too fat.</br>  .  <br><br><br>That's it.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Fap away (;</br></br>  <br><br>I did for a long time.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;629703536 <br>MODS</br>    Here you can see her feet are exhausted from all the ballet and wearing heels.<br><br>They're just begging for a nice massage</br></br>    bump  <br><br>Fuck off with your shit</br></br>  <br>kekekekekkek</br>  <br>uh wow, made my day</br>  bump  Who ever says they wouldnt destroy her is lying to themselves.  dont stahp  <br><br>Sure anon..</br></br>    <br>You know that sound everytime a cock pushes into a throat?</br>  <br><br>I'd "massage" them for hours.</br></br>  <br><br>Choking sound. Gorgeous.</br></br>  <br>I'm just thinking about young Maisie getting her throat fucked in a bathroom and making that wet sound. Don't even care if the story is real or fake.</br>    <br><br>It's real, and she swallowed at least some of me. She had my cum in her stomach and was laughing with me about how crazy sex can make people behave.</br></br>  My gf has met her. She was with a group of people doing some arty thing. They're FB friends. She in her cover photo with her. She just says she's nice.  <br>Did she swallow a lot?</br>  <br><br>She spat out most of it. There was enough left to see it in her mouth.</br></br>  <br>why is her face shaped like a dorito?</br>  <br><br> eating sweets in a pub <br><br>lol, bloody children.</br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw Sophie will never become Mistral <br><br>I'm not asking for much, i mean she's like the perfect fucking match.</br></br></br>  <br>christ those are some skanky feet</br>  <br>Lovely. Any other hot details?</br>  <br><br>It's a child thing innit?</br></br>  bump            bump    Fuck, this bitch is ugly. She better not ruin the upcoming season of Dr. Who.  <br><br>She's a qt.</br></br>   Maisie and Sophie will never share your lollipop   <br>she's hideous</br>    <br>Yeah, thats fairly obvious.</br>    <br>Is she tonguing her head?</br>  <br><br>She looked almost just like this at the airport, except maybe a little more tired looking.</br></br>  Gf's photo  <br>Yes. Why, who knows.</br>  <br><br>That's not all she tongues.</br></br>  <br><br>Remember her big beautiful eyes looking up?</br></br>  <br>i wish i was able to get girls like that...god dam i hate myself</br>  <br>Ugh them fucking shoulders. Shes like a man</br>  <br><br>How did they gather for this art thing?<br><br>Was this Maisie's bro idea?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I definitely think theyve fucked. Maisie is probably mostly straight though. I personally think Sophie is probably either still dating Hailee Steinfeld or is dating her "friend" Maddie Spalding.</br>  <br><br>Also there had to be another HQ pic of them together doing this art shit. Post alternative pic for proof</br></br>  <br>Agreed. Most people on here think fake tits and massive arses are hot. Probably virgins being as when i was in high school all of my mates that were virgins used to think girls that looked plastic were hot, whereas i always perfered more natural looking girls</br>  <br><br>Look at the picture <br>  No one  <br>  Knows we've fucked </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Sophie probably convinced Maisie to experiement with her.</br></br>  No idea tbh, I wasn't involved.  <br>Probably. Most girls will try it at least.</br>  <br>Sophie turner is a disgusting lanky ginger lesbian. She looks like shes always got a cold and i bet she fucking stinks. Ive always hated her i dont get the attraction the stupid bitch, she cant even act, it sounds like her voice is always breaking</br>  <br><br>This is great. I had no idea there were photos of her from around that time. It's really great at intensifying the memories. Much appreciated.</br></br>  <br>i'll admit it,<br>i'd fuck the living shit out of her and cum on those enormous eyebrows</br></br>  <br>Please kill yourself xD</br>  <br>She always looks stoned as fuck.</br>  <br><br>These photos are from this year. That's good though, I'm enjoying your story.</br></br>  <br>Why are so many people in love with her? She's ugly as fuck</br>    All the faggots who think Maisie is &gt;1/10    <br><br>Because you've been fucking dolls for soo long that you forgot what real women look like</br></br>  Your favorite porn website b/?  <br>your moms facebook page</br>  <br><br>Oh shit OP, I'm not sure if you'll be able to recover from that burn</br></br>  Btw OPs pic is melanie rios fucked in skinny jeans  <br><br>4chan.org/b/</br></br>  <br>love u, thanks</br>  <br>/thread</br>  Wankdb and xnxx are all I use  pornbusters, you're all welcome  So, /b/.<br>Are you close to getting a girlfriend?</br>  <br>https://www.google.com/search?q=hol<wbr>ly+earl+smile+gif&amp;biw=1680&amp;bih=905&amp;<wbr>source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CAcQ<wbr>_AUoAWoVChMIl7ev4cLvxgIVhSyICh0bCgo<wbr>K#tbm=isch&amp;q=holly+earl+<br><br>Reverse image search it you faggot</br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Go visit Dr. Huxtable he can help you</br>    test <br>test</br>  Pics you weren't to share!
