That's about as much spent on the entirety of console gamings life, for about the price of a top end PC. Checkmate PC tardos.</br>  <br>Like how every console that's ever existed has lasted well over ten years?<br>Now what are you trying to say faggot?<br>Your pissed because your DOS games will never work again?</br></br></br>  <br> you won't need to upgrade for 10+ years <br><br>Are you retartet? you wil bi gut vor at leest 50 jeers bicuz ps4 is best konsol eva ant pc gamas are stupit vor spanding mony on a think thad is to hart to use aniway</br></br></br>  <br>buying 5 new systems, new games each time because backward compatibility is broken or nonexistent , new controllers and accessories each time &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; upgrading a couple parts of your old one ever couple years and still having 5x better performance<br> responding seriously to b8 </br></br>  <br>ok, what.</br>  <br>Hey guys at least PC faggots make up for the fact that they way overspend on PC components but not spending diddly shit on the things that do matter like supporting developers and their games, by only buying them for $.50 on Steam sale!</br>  <br>yeah, they still fucking EXIST, but no one makes games for them past 10 years because the new version already came out and theyre already prototyping the version after that<br> dos games will never work again <br> has never heard of dosbox </br></br></br>  <br> being mad you dont get steam sales on consoles <br>:^)</br></br>  <br>How that's Batman Arkham Knight "better performance" working for you faggot? Or the other multitude of developer that don't give a shit about PC games because it's filled with cheap faggots who only buy games when they're 90% off because they don't understand supporting games and developers is the most important thing in the industry? Spend more time convincing people not to preorder games dumb bitch.</br>  <br>Yeah but then they don't shut the fuck up about how much better it is so they end up wasting so many fucking calories being complete elitist pricks. pcmasterrace amirite hurr durr</br>  <br>Nigger detected</br>  <br>I buy games I love at full price because that's how the industry makes money fuck face. Then I enjoy a 10% rebate on everything I spend along with free games handed out and great sales on Xbox.</br>  <br>Oh, you can't forget about shoddily user created applications that are 90% filled with viruses.</br>  <br>Does that image say console vs pc?<br>You serious?</br></br>  <br> Consolekids bitching about PC Master Race®. <br>MFW consoles are just shitty gaming PC's</br></br>  <br>actually every people I know owning console will buy one, It will maybe eventually die of overheating or something, then will buy another (you know, the new "slim" version).<br>in the meantime I would have bought only one computer. I'm not talking about games prices or network subscription.</br></br>  <br>Console people don't debate that, they just don't give a shit. I just want to play some fucking games not read for a few hours what my best configuration will be and then constantly be upgrading, bought a PS3 7 years ago or whatever and can still play any PS3 game I want. If I bought a PC 7 years ago without putting any money in it I might as well have a fucking brick.</br>  the point of a custom PC is not to build a low end pleb machine with low end specs like the PS4/XBone has. <br><br>Just remember that, consoles use low end PC parts.</br></br>  <br>devs outsourceing port to shitty company != inferior performance you buttmad autist<br>also site the supposed thousands of other shitty ports that were as bad as this ONE, because you seem to think thats the case.<br>go ahead, ill wait</br></br></br>  <br> Says things like buttmad autist to show how much of a buttmad autist he is </br>  <br>Enjoying witcher 3 with ultra settings at 60 fps? oh wait...</br>  <br> i dont have common sense and click on every ad banner i see and always install totallynotavirus.exe <br>ftfy<br>i use fucking microsoft security essentials, the most bare of the barebones featureless anti viruses in fucking history, and i used windows defender in the xp and vista days, and i have had 0 -count em- ZERO viruses ever</br></br></br>  <br>Second</br>  <br> i have no evidence so i must strawman: the post </br>  <br>http://www.bing.com/search?q=shitty<wbr>+pc+ports&amp;go=Submit+Query&amp;qs=bs&amp;for<wbr>m=QBRE<br><br>There's 6 million results for your retardedly salty bitch ass.</br></br></wbr></wbr></br>  <br> Blames viruses on people accidently clicking them and not the fag lord shittiest community of people in the world PC faggots for creating them in the first place </br>  12 and a half model 2 raspberry pi's  <br>and still running games in high 60 fps now i would like to see if a low end pc could do that faggot.</br>  <br>I'm enjoying it on a proper console and not some pirate prone shitty ass third party application... Xbox watch MTV, now I'm watching new episode of my favorite show while you're just sitting there, being a fag.</br>  The thing is most console owners also own a $500-$1000+ laptop/ prebuilt computer for browsing etc anyway . why not just put all that money into one good gaming computer that will last you 4 years? instead of having to spend $500 every 2-3 years replacing your broken laptop and a further $500+ every seven years replacing the console?<br><br>It works out about the same amount of money in the end, only with the PC you get better performance and a much bigger library of games including emulating old console games.. console exclusives are rarely good so really you only miss out on 1 or 2 games every few years you might have enjoyed but have a 1000 other games you've never played and will probably enjoy even more.<br><br>There's only one legitimate excuse for console peasantry and that's local co-op/multiplayer.<br><br> PC can be hooked up to TV <br> PC can use any controller <br> PC can be played from the couch <br><br><br>no. no console or low end PC can run a game at high settings, 1080p and still get 60FPS. lack of Anti Aliasing is a major issue too.<br><br><br> Actually watching MTV <br>kek</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Have never bought a second console in my life. RROD prone Xbox 360 and Xbox One still running perfectly fine years later. I have had plenty of PC parts shit out on me though, and you know damn well there's not even a number you can call other than the third party retailer to try and take care of you, which rarely ever works. Even Sony has better support when it comes to fixing consoles.</br>  <br>Yeah. The moment I let the most vile shit population on the internet start telling me what to watch right before I stick a knife through my throat.</br>  <br><br>Did you check it faggot? There's about a hundred games on the first page of results alone.</br></br>  <br>But... MTV.. I mean come on mayne.</br>  <br> low end PC can run a game at high settings <br><br>again where's your proof ?</br></br></br>  /b/ really is filled with underageb&amp;. I guess I shouldn't be surprised though, I started lurking at 14, 7 years ago.  <br>I never said that retard. I said neither a low end PC or a console could do that.</br>  <br> dual core <br><br>you're retarded consoles only last 4-6 years<br>PS3/360 is an exception because of the 2007-2009 economic collapse</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm going back to /g/ where people aren't completely tech illiterate, not sure why I even opened this board.</br>  <br>install gentoo</br>  <br>linux is for cucks</br>  <br>Are you not cool? Cause pretty much every cool person in existence watches MTV. Neckbeard detected NVM, I'm going to stop talking to you before I get sticky.</br>  <br> not aware of the meme </br>  <br>hahahaha, 8/10.</br>  <br>I am, i just felt like responding with a different kind of shitposting.</br>  A console is literally just a PC with a limit on what it can do.<br><br>\thread</br></br>  <br> taking obvious b8 </br>    http://pcpartpicker.com/p/mLTwvK  Obligatory.  <br>No, seriously. Semi-casual here debating PC gaming. I mostly play sandbox games like Mercenaries 2, Prototype, Red Faction, Just Cause 2 etc. How simple are PCs to operate? I'm a caveman. Mostly I noticed an abundance of MMOs (fuck that level 80 paladin /v/irgin shit) on steam, and a handful of games that interest me (like the forest) that end up on consoles anyways. Also split screen co-op with fiance is a must. Can I do that with PC? Is it worth it for me to switch over or will I buy a $1000 paperweight? Halp.</br>  <br> cod <br> bf4 <br> sports games <br> mgsv <br>Just a small few off the top of my head<br>:^}</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yes you can play any ps3 game you want as long as it looks like melted dog shit and has a fps of &lt;20</br>  <br>Bump</br>  how bout you all just stop being faggots and love both PC AND CONSOLE, PC is masterrace but having both is GOD RACE MUTHEFUCKERS. LEARN TO PUBSTOMP ACROSS PLATFORMS YOU FUCKIN PLEBIANS  <br>they're all games on PC that have higher graphical settings than consoles. i dont understand what you're trying to get at.<br><br>None of them are 1080p either, they're 720/900 upscaled.</br></br></br>  <br>Not true, first party ps3 games look great and run a sturdy 30</br>  <br>PC has a lot of great games.<br>Xbox.<br>PlayStation.<br>Nintendo.<br>All have a lot of great games.<br>The only thing about any of those is PC has a very bad lack of organization. That's important to me. When Microsoft makes Xbox games with achievements and everything for PC I play that. Steam is the most obvious rip off of that, third party retailer, they don't even invest in the games at all, not like consoles or anything, and haven't made a game in ages, Valve, just give all their money away to RTS and MOBA players in competitions. That makes you happy as someone supporting Steam? You're not supporting shit. To go from console gaming to PC games is to take 90% of the support you gave to the industry and shove it up your ass.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Everything a PC does better than a console:<br><br>A decent PC gives better graphics and game performance.<br>PC's are upgradable.<br>You can back up your saves on your hard drive.<br>You can take screenshots of your games.<br>You can install game mods.<br>You can enter console cheats (~).<br>You can play old games on a PC.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They're pretty easy these days. Putting one together is basically like playing with legos and with an hour of your time and an online guide you can put one together with pretty much no brainpower whatsoever.<br><br>As far as games go, these days most people just use Steam. Installing the game is one click to install, and a few clicks on a "next" button. Wait for it to download and go.<br><br>Some games are a bitch to get working, but most of the time they'll work without any real issues.<br><br>Split-screen co-op depends on the game. Some games don't have it, some games do. Some games that have it on console won't have it on PC.<br><br>As far as games go, you'll have a much greater selection, won't have the discs taking up physical space, and won't have to worry about backwards compatibility. The games are also much, much cheaper. There are also quite a few more sandbox games on PC than there are on console, though you may not enjoy all of them.<br><br>Operating a PC is pretty much no more difficult than a console at this point. Some different steps to take but overall an actual retard can figure it so you should be fine.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 30 <br> playable <br> not a stuttering mess <br><br>Fuck that shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not the listed for ps4<br>Those are native</br></br>  <br>nope, they're actually not. BF4 for example is 900p on PS4.</br>  <br>Cost sunk fallacy.</br>  How bout you don't be an autistic and build your PC   playing video games <br><br>Top kek I'm LMAOing at all ur lives</br></br>  <br><br>they also don't run at 60 fps on consoles.<br><br>My PC runs BF4 at ultra settings, 8x MSAA etc 60 fps, true 1080p.</br></br></br></br>   $200 GPU <br> $150 CPU <br> $150 everything else <br>you literally now have a console</br></br></br>  <br> sturdy 30fps <br>lmao are you serious, jeez that is like playing with major lag</br></br>    <br>Digital copies exsist on consoles too, pc's also have physical copies and still have the outdated hd dvd standard, games work with no configuration changes, ps now allows reverse, xbox will also have backwards, and ps plus has amazing discouts albiet for a monthly fee.</br>  <br>Fuck you, faggot. Do it yourself. Jesus Christ it's like a vast portion of people under 30 just magically became mentally retarded. Are you so fucking stupid you can't do some research?

You give money to Steam they give money to RTS and MOBA players. They don't invest in games like console companies do. They haven't create a single game in quite a while, definitely don't do it frequently like any of the consoles out there. Steam is a money pit. How you could play games and call yourself a gamer throwing your money into a hole instead of lovingly giving it to developers is beyond me.
