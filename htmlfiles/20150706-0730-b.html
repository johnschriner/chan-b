If you are just viewing [s4s] through the /s4s/ board, you don't see the green posts, the posts with letters in their ids, or anything numberless. Together, those make up about 40-70 percent of [s4s], depending on the day. So conversation will appear disjointed and spastic, because you won't be getting the full picture.<br><br>I actually just flipped over to the /s4s/ interface to make this post, and it's pretty funny how unintelligible [s4s] is like this.</br></br>  Hermione Penis Chart<br><br> Check your Penis size by the help of Hermione </br></br>  rallin'  rell  rolo  any greekfags around? is your country kill if you vote OXI?  <br>οχι, σε αυτες τις συμφωνιες παιζουν ρολο μονο οι αριθμοι</br>  <br>nai oi sklirotatoi epanastates</br>  <br>They are just brinksmenshipping.
