A bit drunk myself, normally drink dewars?</br></br>   Decided to drink by myself <br> One beer <br>Get the fuck over yourself faggot</br></br>  <br>Usually Johnnie Walker Double Black but wanted to try something new.</br>  <br><br>Others are in the trash where they belong shitdick, not everyone leaves their garbage all over the fucking place</br></br>  drinking henny and eating pizza, might roll up a backwood soon, playing csgo  <br><br>Mmmm double black, even though I'm more of a vodka man myself<br><br>What happened, friends busy? Just feel like staying in?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Could never get used to henny. Are you a nigger by any chance?</br></br>  <br>nope, i just like cognac</br>  <br><br>Fair enough. Wish I had some bud myself, the whole reason I'm drinking tonight, got any to share?</br></br>  Here with you op. But I was the one that fucked over a friend. Spending my birthday alone with this fire now.<br><br>And you fags.</br></br>  <br><br>Just felt like having some time to myself. My family drinks a lot of Vodka, SKY, Goose, Svedka, even Fris. I just happened to be the scotch man. Gotta love that smokey double black though.</br></br>  got barely any left, picked up a qp a while ago and itll be a while till i get more, enough for a few cones, broke right now  <br><br>That's okay, I've been known to do the same<br><br>Happy birthday anon, you drinkin/smokin?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'll drink to that, next round on me.</br>  <br>this beer is pure water rolf</br>  Just finished a couple Smirnoff Ices because I'm a basic hoe. Just finished a painting, too.  <br><br>Thanks man. Yeah I'm doing both but the beer is piss compared to the smoke I have.</br></br>  <br>Have fun with that choice in the morning.</br>  <br><br>I respect that. First time I had double black I picked up and held a metal fireplace that had been roasting for 5+ hours, the burns were unreal<br><br>Hell of a drink. <br><br><br>That sucks, just ran out of my NY diesel from the same friend that bailed. About to pick up some Jack tomorrow, favorite strain?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think 2 are going to do very much, all things considered.</br>  <br><br>Hope you take some Advil in preperation for your girly-drink hangover<br><br><br><br>What kinda smoke you got?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i picked up some mkultra that was wicked, sticky as fuck. buddy who got it for me said it was some top shelf stuff, never saw it again after tho</br>  Gonna kick it with you guys by the fire for now.<br><br>Until my phone dies.</br></br>  <br>It was my first scotch 4 years ago and its to this day is my favorite. Next to Glenlivet but thats the kind of scotch where I pull out the pipe and plush velvet robe by the fireplace with my leather bound books at hand.</br>  <br><br>That's unfortunate. The guy that bailed on me gets his shit from deepweb, I'm waiting for the day were chilling for the FBI to battering-ram his door open</br></br>  <br><br>Glad to hear it. How old are you anon? Any special gifts?<br><br><br><br>Haha I've only had Glenlivet once, almost yacked on impact, but I think it's more me than the liquor. Like anything other than scotch, or are you strictly top-tier?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>im in canada so im pretty lucky for local connects, i can get some primo shit out here in less than 5 minutes, its a perk but still its all reliant on whatever he gets in from his connect, so sometimes he gets ok stuff, other times he gets primo</br>  <br><br>26. Nothing special. I don't like gifts for my birthday. Went out for dinner with the parents tho.</br></br>  <br><br>I hear ya, a lot of my local guys (with bailers exception) are the same deal. How long have you been smoking? Preferred methods?</br></br>  <br><br>That's cool. Whatcha order? Please tell me a nice fat steak</br></br>  <br>Wouldn't really call scotch top tier, more like respectable. In order for me, Scotch, Bourbon, Vodka (Polish), Vodka (other), then anything else is just garbage. Rum and Tequila are just nasty. Beer takes priority but didn't have any and stores are closed.</br>  <br>26 and your parents remembered your birthday? I'd consider that a present in itself. Happy birthday though anon.</br>  <br><br>Ha you're god damn right I did. Even at 26 if the parents are paying I'm getting a fucking $30 steak.</br></br>  <br><br>Yeah 100% Polish here, was leaning towards it from my day of birth. 100% agree with rum and tequila though, that shit is garbage. What kind of beer you like?</br></br>  <br>on and off since early 16, if i had the choice id smoke out of a bong, but if im out and around, like in a car or walking around with friends id roll up a blunt</br>  <br><br>Thanks anon. I really mean that.</br></br>  <br>id say around 5 years, forgot to put that in</br>  <br>You get a pass, as long as you didnt buy them. Im no beer nazi but platinums are weeeird, id honestly rather have a bud ice</br>  <br>Guiness for a relaxing beer, New Castle for a long hard days of fuck this shit work.</br>  Shit tier beer + decent weed ready to go back to the fire.  <br><br>Damn straight. What you smokin on anon? Tell me some good shit</br></br>  <br>I drink wild turkey 101, and I'm a faggot and mix it with mtn. Dew or Pepsi. Ill drink it straight though. And smoke Marlboro black reds short. Not same anon</br>  I have 30 of coors and just worked on my day off. My friends are out somewhere but I dont feel like goin out. Probably play xbox , drink, record some music.  <br><br>Am sad that my phone always seems to upload the pics sideways. Not doing that on purpose.</br></br>  <br>Because you have an iPhone</br>  Drinking this and watching the second season of Rome on dvd. At the last episode.  <br><br>Nah I didn't buy them, I'm more of a fan of Bud heavys but I got the redneck blood so I'm partial to them<br><br><br><br>I hear ya, what you do for work? I work at a warehouse driving cherry-pickers and forklifts and whatnot, I wholeheartedly believe in the fuck-this-shit beer</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Good choice, can't ever go wrong with Chivas. I've only ever had it once, and I must say it was very good.</br>  <br><br>Weed is basically legal where I am (Lansing, mi) so I have no idea if it's called anything, but it takes several passes with the grinder to make it smokeable in my bowl.<br><br>  you can call me hues if you want btw </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't actually. S5.</br></br>  <br>Executive chef at a local resteraunt. After doing 16 hours a day 6 days a week and yelling at stupid fucks all the time, alcohol helps, at and after work.</br>  <br>Got some Louie in my glass with real glacier ice.</br>  <br><br>I used to smoke the black reds, figured fuck it I might as well spend the cash and went to straight reds<br><br><br><br>I hear ya, what kinda music you play?<br><br><br><br>I hear ya, my phone did the same shit in the OP<br><br><br><br>Ooo fancy, how is Rome btw? Been considering watching it</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's my first time tasting it. I was surprised it was so good.</br>  <br><br>S5 here as well, how you like it?<br><br><br><br>Lol I get the at, smoked a blunt at work last week and immediately drove a 6 ton machine to pick orders, ya gotta do whatcha gotta do<br><br><br><br>Ooo Louie, it's been awhile. What brings ya here anon?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rome is amazing. However; it only lasted two seasons though, since it was too expensive to maintain. I'm surprised though that season two went so well and not rushed because of this fact.<br>You also get to see Polly Walker totally nude in episode one. :)</br></br>  <br><br>That's enough incentive for me. What brings you here, plans falling through? Didn't feel like going out?</br></br>  <br>Hell yea. Seems like being under the influence is the best way to work.</br>  <br>Checking out what my /b/rothers drink on too.</br>  Sorry had to rebuild the fire.<br><br><br><br>Eh its a phone. At least Android still gives us a lot more power than apple does.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hmm, well I known the iphones make the pics go sideways, I just assumed<br><br><br>Straight reds ate fine, but I feel there's a stronger flavor on black reds. And my dad smokes em too so if I'm out we can share.</br></br></br></br>  <br>So far your /b/rothers are drinking top tier scotch, and shit tier beer.</br>  <br><br>Haha its true, just feel in the zone. Ever drink/smoke/enhance at work?<br><br><br><br>I feel ya, you smoke? Any other substances?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just came in to chat.</br>  <br>Beer is for those who cant man up to real alcohol or can't control how much they drink.. In other words beer is for bitches</br>  id be drinking mickys with my friends  <br><br>That's true. I keep my phone in my hood at work and when I bend down it sometimes slingshots the phone onto the floor and only the camera glass is cracked, S5 active though<br><br><br><br>That's true. I just feel as if blacks are the tobacco that Marlboro sweeps off the floor</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That's cool. How you doin tonite? Drinkin/smokin/abusin?</br></br>  <br>Smoke weed everyday.</br>  <br><br>Hues here checking in on that shit tier beer. Almost enjoy the sound of that.</br></br>  <br>Usually smoke weed at work with my employees. I usually bring a flask with me that has bourbon or scotch, and if my crew does a good job, ill buy them a round when we are done closing. Used to trip balls on some good LSD but those days are over. Good times.</br>  <br><br>Me too, favorite strain? You a bong or blunt man?</br></br>  <br>While im at work i vape dabs.</br>  <br>Nothing wrong with drinking beer. You should learn to pace yourself whether you drink any kind of alcohol. Alcohol is for enjoyment, not to get drunk. Getting drunk really isn't a good habit.</br>  <br><br>It's funny you say that, my highschool buddy/coworker just did 4 tabs at work, the hardest and fastest I've ever seen him work</br></br>  <br><br>Yeah I cracked my screen a few weeks ago while I was skating and let it bounce out of my pocket. No one to blame for that other than myself.</br></br>  <br>Dabs, pipe, and joints.</br>  <br><br>That's impressive, ever fuck up? I know I have after eating a whole brownie at work</br></br>  <br>If you're not getting drunk why drink in the first place?</br>  <br>Drinking.</br>  <br>I bet you mix soda in liquor dont you</br>  Guys I'm running out of burnable shit, and still can't figure out why my pics are sideways.  Ganna try the gf's new vap out at the theatres tonight after the gym. I figured I saw a dude there last week taping the shit so lets see if I can get away with a few sneaky ones in the back row ;)  <br>For enjoyment. Just because you're drinking alcohol doesn't mean you should drink to excess.</br>  <br><br>Whatcha sippin on anon? Clearly BLPs here, even though not even close to first choice</br></br>  <br><br>Somehow forgot the pic. I'm stoned</br></br>  Can any ausfag get dabs? Can only find hash occasionally  <br>Haven't crashed a plane yet</br>  <br><br>You work with planes? What do you do?</br></br>  <br>I'm drinking Chivas Regal.</br>  <br><br>OP here, fire still runnin strong there anon. No more logs?</br></br>  <br><br>Jk, I do quality control at a meat plant</br></br>  <br><br>Great choice. You normally a whisky man?</br></br>  <br>No, this is my first time trying whisky.</br>  <br><br>Haha I get the humdrum bullshit job. I know ive taken shit from mine, ever snatch any meat from yours?</br></br>  <br><br>Got like 2 or 3 more logs left.

I gave up about 2-3 hours in. Shit-tier game. I wanted to play it because of the "complex moral dilemmas", which was utter bullshit.  <br><br>Weapon system was pretty good for its time. And the art really makes you feel like you're under water.</br></br>  <br>I was literally forcing myself to continue playing it so i can find out what was that great about it, finally gave it up out of boredom.</br>  the gameplay and controls are clunky but I like it because<br>muh atmosphere</br>  <br>The game was good in its own rights<br>But not great<br>you want a great game go play HL3 shit was so cash</br></br></br>  <br>lew quelity bait</br>    <br>Bioshock 2 was easily the shittiest Bioshock.<br>You could remove it entirely from the series and lose absolutely nothing of value in terms of story.</br></br>  I thought the storyline and environments were very well done.<br><br>Would you kindly leave, OP?</br></br>  <br>You just now started playing this??? Are you fucking 12?? Lol</br>  <br>not a bait, seriously stop being a summer<br><br><br>storyline and environments won't make a game great when it has a shitty boring gameplay.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm so glad I'm me and not you</br></br>  <br>Fair enough. I agree that gameplay was tedious and boring at times.</br>  <br>You're complaining about a game that was made 8 years ago Anon. That's like going back in time to your middle school self and getting mad at him for not being in college yet.</br>  <br>This<br>Bioshock 2 contributed about as much to the first game as Infinite did</br></br>  <br>Levine even said that Bioshock 2 wasn't canon</br>  It's a classic. You just can't see it through our ADHD goggles.  <br>So what was the point of it then?<br>It was essentially "Rushed Big Daddy Cash Grab Simulator"</br></br>  <br>How the fuck does that work?</br>  you're a fucking idiot  Well maybe bioshock 2 is shit and boring, but not the first one, at all  <br><br>Or perhaps it's you who got shitty taste?</br></br>  Go play COD and fifa you looser  <br> implying Bioshock isn't a better soccer game </br>  <br>The series has potential but they just don't want to fucking weave a plot together that isn't multiple fucking universes mashed into each other.</br>  <br>Thats weird since I found bioshock 1 to be a mediocre and infinite to be complete shit.<br><br>2 improved on 1 in terms of gunplay and level design, and while it was essentially a rehash, I got mad dad feels from the daughter and actually was invested.</br></br></br>  Bioshock 4 looks pretty hopeful.  <br> soccer <br><br>wot the fok did ye just say 2 me m8? i dropped out of newcastle primary skool im the sickest bloke ull ever meet &amp; ive nicked 300 chocolate globbernaughts frum tha corner shop. im trained in street fitin' &amp; im the strongest foker in tha entire newcastle gym. yer nothin to me but a cheeky lil bellend w/ a fit mum &amp; fakebling. ill waste u and smash a fokin bottle oer yer head bruv, i swer 2 christ. ya think u can fokin run ya gabber at me whilst sittin on yer arse behind a lil screen? think again wanka. im callin me homeboys rite now preparin for a proper scrap. A roomble thatll make ur nan sore jus hearin about it. yer a waste bruv. me crew be all over tha place &amp; ill beat ya to a proper fokin pulp with me fists wanka. if i aint satisfied w/ that ill borrow me m8s cricket paddle &amp; see if that gets u the fok out o' newcastle ya daft kunt. if ye had seen this bloody fokin mess commin ye might a' kept ya gabber from runnin. but it seems yea stupid lil twat, innit? ima shite fury &amp; ull drown in it m8. ur ina proper mess knob.</br></br></br>  <br>I liked that game.<br>And It really gave me heavy feels.<br><br>I liked to be a Big Daddy that must protect and rescue Little Sisters.<br><br>It reminds me that I dont no younger sister, nor nobody to protect, and I came to the realization that I am a protector, I need to protect someone, thats my purpuose of my life.<br><br>And I'm typing this alone on my house.<br><br>What's the life of a guardian with nobody to guard and protect?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>because you don't like things other people like because you're special and deep</br></br></br>  <br>That last part where you were a big daddy was garbage.<br><br>Other than that, fantastic game.</br></br></br>  <br>These games were amazing when they first come out, admittedly I do not like "dark" games with depressing settings or horror games etc, so it took me a few goes of picking it up and playing for a few hours, then coming back to it a few days or weeks later and starting again, trying to get into it, but when I did I ws really suprised at how well made the game is, AI, combat, level design, and the story is brilliant, but it is manly told through the audio tapes.<br><br>Anyway the games get better as do the stories, and well Bioshock infinate is probably my favorite game of all time so far</br></br></br>  <br><br>The first game is good. <br><br>The Second was the foreshadowing of the decline.<br><br>Infinite was shit. Amazingly other than decent graphics it offered less than the other two games in terms of gameplay and replay value. Storyline did a good job of sucking you in but at the end one of the twists was so stupid it negates the entire buildup of the story. I got suckered into preordering it due to all the 'awards' it won before it was even released.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Bioshock infinite is probably my favorite game of all time so far <br>I really hope this is bait. Because if it is you did well.</br></br>   mechanic was great at its time <br> amazing boss fight <br> choice <br> complex story <br><br>what a shame OP for just starting the game now not when the game was released years ago. Guess you're the idiot for not understanding such a great game</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Art-deco design. <br> Original songs and covers from the 50's <br> Freedom to choose between being a savior and being a selfish asshole. <br> Mind-bending plot twist near the end. <br> Wicked plasmid powers that can be combined with fire power. <br><br>You just didn't put your heart into it and gave it an honest shot, anon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why the idea of being a Big Daddy bothers so many people?<br><br>I mean, I liked Bioshock 1; but Bioshock 2 carry more personal feelings for me.<br>But dont pay attention to my opinion anyways, it's more subjetive than objetive since I'm projecting my 'Protective Father' issues on a game.<br><br>On terms of gameplay, I liked more Bioshock 2 than 1.<br><br>I love to Drill Bash splicers.<br>But I agree that Bioshock 2 wasnt that good.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Infinite was shit <br> Infinite was shit <br> Infinite was shit </br></br></br>  <br><br>Seriously, when you introduce Time Travel into your storyline and a reliable Time Travel at that, that's it, your story is done, just use Time Travel to fix everything.<br><br>Srsly, there was no need to go back to stop the MC from getting baptized and killing him there, just jump back to before Wounded Knee and say 'hey, don't go to Wounded Knee'</br></br></br></br>  <br>It isn't the combat art design, story AI and well elizabeth make that game a fucking amazing game, and the DLC add to it, if you cannot see the beauty of that game maybe you should go back to playing minecraft</br>  <br>The idea is great. But they executed it awfully in 1 and then decided to fuck up a whole game about it.</br>  <br> nanomachines </br>  <br> 2 improved on 1 in terms of gunplay <br>The gunplay was already fine and never particularly needed improving<br> Level design <br>Besides minor details and way less atmosphere, Bioshock 2 didn't really change shit.<br><br> I got mad dad feels from the daughter and actually was invested. <br>I didn't. Because the game tries to implant feelings like a pushy psychiatrist. You are a big daddy. Here is your sister. She is taken. You now feel bad for her, I SAID FEEL BAD FOR HER.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What was the name of that game where you're at Custard's last stand and some future motherfuckers come in and save you at the last second? You go to different points in human history after that, like Pompeii and the civil war.</br>  Breaking it down, Bioshock 2 was a better shooter, Bioshock 1 was a better game. It's really that simple. Infinite meanwhile was pretty much perfect.  <br><br>WTF NO ONE HAS CHECKED THESE QUADS?!<br><br>What kind of summer fag festival has this place become?!?!</br></br></br></br>  <br>they didn't time travel you moron, the syphon held her powers back, but she was a powerful multi dimensional being, who after the syphon was destroyed she was able to travel (and take booker with her) to CHOICES... roads in a stream that lead to two different multiverses, but she couldnt make the final choice as booker had to for her to become a quantum superstition...probably a bit too deep for you to understand kid</br>  <br><br>In my opinion it was a brilliant game, but, the artwork and game design was built for its time.<br>Bioshock 2, its decrepit sequel, was absolute bullshit. It was if the developers had spurted shit all over their previous plans and decided "Instead of cleaning this, we'll go with how it is." It was terrible.<br>And finally, Bioshock Infinite, the true successor to Bioshock was , honestly, fun to play. I found the gameplay and story line very enticing and kept me wanting to play. Even finish it on the hardest difficulty, which drained away hours of my life. I found myself wanting more, even when the choices that you make in the game amount to the same ending.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Says the summerfag</br>  Infinite had the date rape plasmid, which is best plasmid. Like, what were they thinking, selling a fucking mind control drug in street vendors?  <br><br>Plebs like to pretend to like other games like that because they suck at CoD.</br></br>  <br>Half agree and half disagree.<br><br>I think the concept and the whole game idea was brilliant. As far I remenber (I played Bioshock 1 a few years ago) the story and plot were actually okay, at least for me.<br><br>What I found hard to 'digest' is not the idea of an underwater utopia, is the fact it had the '50 technology, and Rapture had ADN-bending genetical technology.<br>I know, it supposed to be an Utopia filled with the most brilliant human beings, but still find it hard to take.<br><br>What I actually agree with you, is that, if why I find both games so well executed, then whyy Bioshock 1 barely kept me intrested? And although, Bioshock 2 got me hooked me up for a while, it was for an emotional reason, not really for the game itself.<br>Now that I try to remenber, I recall getting tired of some parts, some scenarios and maps were really tedious.<br><br>I think the game developers forgot to give it the 'Magic touch'.<br>It was good, but it could be better.<br>I give it a 6/10.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This nigg knows whats up.</br>  <br>The gunplay is objectively awful. Guns are floaty, marshmallow cannons and only a handful of them are actually useful. Not to mention gun upgrading pressures you to favor one gun but the limited inventory and ammo is counter to that. Its just one example of the conflicting design choices in infinite.<br><br>The AI is god awful, actually challenging COD:MW 2 for the worst "run between cover shooting AI" in an AAA title. There are about 5 enemy types in the game with a various reskins to disguise it. The enemies themselves are just bullet sponges with no real mechanics other than to shoot at the player and occasionally lob grenades. Despite the fact that plasmid vendors are fucking everywhere, there's only a couple of powered enemies in the entire game, making the combat simple shoot loot repeat ad nauseum.<br><br>The story started well enough, but quickly goes off the rails into stupid town.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>What technically going to Wounded Knee was a choice wasn't it? <br><br>And anything quantum I turn my brain off.

Not because it was fun, but because headshots killed most enemies instantly and since the ai was too dumb to find you in 99% of cases you could find a nook and clear a combat stage in 2 clips.</br>  <br><br>the best thing to come out of bioshock is the porn. nuff said</br></br>  <br>Bioshock infinate<br>I have every achievement on steam apart from all blue ribbons in CITC, and literally just got the platinum in 2 play throughs last week on PS3, I love the game so much<br>It has replayability to me, because of the different engagements and vigor's, you can change your style of play each playthrough.<br><br>essentially If I get the winter shield gear I can god mode the game even on 1999 mode</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The only strong complaint I ever heard against it was that being a powerful big daddy removed the survival/horror aspect entirely. Which I didn't fucking care because all drill runs were fun and I enjoyed the multiplayer mode. <br><br>I think a lot of people have Nickleback syndrome with this series. A lot of teens look at it as a clunky boring game, but not realizing it had a lot of elements that were brand new to multiple genres and branches of gaming.<br><br>But I also hated mass effect and halo games so take my opinion as you will.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> why do people think this game is great? <br>because they never played System Shock 2</br></br>  Fucking agreed OP. I played all the way through 1 and 2 and ten minutes of infinite.<br>They are all fucking shit.<br>The concept is cool, but the execution is fucking horrible.<br>Even if you strategically set up traps you still end up wasting all your ammo shooting at dip shits with the worst fucking aiming and movement system of all time.</br></br></br>  Little girls, atlas shrugged, drugs, and mutha fuckin drills nigga.  <br> powerful <br>Good one.</br></br>  <br> I think a lot of people have Nickleback syndrome with this series. A lot of teens look at it as a clunky boring game, but not realizing it had a lot of elements that were brand new to multiple genres and branches of gaming. <br><br>I agree with this</br></br></br>  <br>I didn't even bother setting up traps in Bioshock 1 and Infinite, I'm yet to play through Bioshock 2 and I'm pretty sure I won't bother with setting up traps in it either, what a chore.</br>  <br>I mean unless you're a fucking pussy who can't play games the combos you could do with different ammo and mixing plasmids you could basically descimate any for with traps. Also drill.</br>  <br> But I also hated mass effect <br>Should have started with this. Opinion discarded. <br>(Hating ME3 is justified though)</br></br></br>  if it was shorter it would be WAY better, you just literally spend 15 hours of your life beating splicers with your wrench and listening to audio logs with a couple of cutscenes here and there, that's why i think it's boring.  <br>What.</br>  <br>Traps in bioshock 1?</br>  <br>Mass effect was so fucking boring. Literally the only game I didn't bother trading and threw in the trash where it belonged.</br>  <br> git gud </br>  <br>Out of curiosity. How old are you?</br>  <br>By traps in Bioshock 1 I meant the stupid electric wire darts.</br>  <br>Foe*</br>  <br><br>I can't bring myself to finish it.</br></br>  <br>The gun play is far from awful, as with all bioshock games, you are supposed to use a combination of vigors/plasmids and weapons, using ADS only for long shots, or after stunning the enemy with crows or shock jockey.<br><br>In every difficulty but 1999, you can max out every vigor and weapon without any problem, you just need to loot the game and dont die, which wastes your coins. in 1999 you need to generalize every weapon and vigor, because cash is scarce.<br><br><br><br>you dont need to run with any weapon at all, you need to pick up and drop them, change them on the fly, and although a sniper does high base damage, the hand cannon is more powerful, that is why it is the last of the weapons you get readily available.<br>WHat you are supposed to do is use vigors, to make your enemies vulnerable to shots, then shoot them, not pussy out across the other side of the area..</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>12 years old</br>  <br>This</br>  <br>I was gunna say 13</br>   ctrl-f System Shock <br> I'm literally the only one to bring it up <br>I knew /b/ was nothing but underage, but I didn't want to believe it.</br></br>  <br>I meant bolts, not darts, God I'm tired.</br>  <br>Mass Effect was amazing. The story, the amazing atmosphere, the characters, the locations, there really hasn't been anything like it since. Gameplay was a bit meh in ME1 but nothing's perfect.</br>  <br>Couldn't be helped. I just never found them interesting.</br>  <br>17<br>most people here already guessed it</br></br>  The only and only correct way to win Bioshock is using the drill, nothing else<br><br> Electric Shock <br> Winter Blast <br> Security Bulleye <br>Best plasmids if you go full tanky/drill basher</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Quads have spoken! <br><br>I liked bioshock. Fight me nigger.<br>what's your idea of a great game OP?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Anyone who played the game knew wht you were talking about the first time.<br><br>And awful. Traps in all the games were awful.</br></br></br>  <br>No don't get me wrong the scenery looked really good. Ran smooth, I really don't have any complaints. It just didn't interest me.
