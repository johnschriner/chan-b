I can't wait</br>  <br>They skipped 9</br>  <br>Next is 10, because 7 8 9</br>  Yeah. I wouldnt if I had to pay for it, but it's free and that's pretty cool. Hopefully it's not a cluster fuck and all my shit will run on the new OS.  <br>Not yet, because I'm a pirate, waiting for pirate version!</br>  Yes because Windows 8 is fucking awful unless you have a tablet.  <br> 7 ate 9 <br>that`s the most cancerous shit pun i have ever heard</br></br>  <br><br>That's retarded.</br></br>  <br>jesus christ anon, its fucking free...</br>  <br>implying some one cares</br>  yes of course. im also waiting to upgrade my phone until the next gen windows 10 mobile devices come out because im a raging faggot. i really enjoyed my lumia 920 before i broke it a year or two ago. . im looking forward to the 950  <br> jealous he didn't say it </br>  <br>No you fucking nigger, its not free!</br>  <br>windows 8 is ruining my life. can't wait for 10</br>  <br>Admit it, you laughed.</br>  <br>me as well. i will skip 8 and 9.</br>  <br>download windows activator tool<br><br>download windows 10</br></br></br>  I'm already running it. It's the Windows that has converted me from a Linux user. I really like it. Would definitely recommend. Especially to anyone running xp/7/8<br><br><br>The final release is already on torrent sites. See pic.</br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you proprietary slave? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class at Harvard, and I’ve been involved in numerous free software projects, and I have contributed to over 300 core-utils for GNU. I am skilled in Lisp and I’m St. IGNU-cius, saint of the Church of Emacs. You are nothing to me but just another unethical non-free software advocate. I will distribute the fuck out of your source code with freedom the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit about me and the GPL on the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my colleagues at FSF and your binaries are being reversed engineered right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your copyright. You're fucking dead, kid. Free software can be anywhere, anytime, and it can ensure your freedom in over four ways, and that’s just with the GPLv2. Not only am I extensively skilled at C hacking, but I have access to the source of the entire GNU userland and core-utils and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable proprietary code off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what ethical retribution your little “clever” program was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have ensured your users' freedom. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit free as in freedom all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.</br>  <br> implying it will be any better </br>  <br>It is in fact free</br>  <br>nigger your computer is a toaster and you play runescape<br><br>you are a fucking cuck if i've ever seen one<br>probably a strict console only gamer<br><br>go fuck yourself retard<br><br>tell me one reason why 8 or 10 beats 7<br>besides 7 8 9</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>only if you have genuine 7 or 8<br><br><br>I will be upgrading for many reasons:<br>league fag but it microstutters on linux<br>received free win8 key<br>win8 is shit</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>like if that worked.</br>  <br> no icon but recycle bin <br>Kill yourself</br></br>  <br>I'm gonna test it on my laptop first. If I like it I'll upgrade my rig as well.</br>  <br>GNU?</br>  <br>lol same. im staying on 7 forev</br>  <br>Your jimmies seem to be rustled my friend</br>  What if Windows 10 is meant to kill US, like in this movie, Kingsman?<br>Maybe that's Why it's free?</br>  <br>I'm not sure if this is how it works. I mean, they even said that upgrading to windows 10 won't make false licenes into real licenses. They're only giving it out free if your licence can be authenticated.<br><br>In other words: You'll need to re-authenticate when W10 has been released with a new activator tool.</br></br></br>  <br>nah<br>waiting for 15.10</br></br>  <br>Stay with 7, if you are a gamer, they are supporting it untill 2019 anyway, 8 is shit, especially for games, seems to be a trend with windows, 1 good OS then one bad, 10 will be good and gamers should get it, but it will have no use untill games start using hyper threading more and DX12 becomes the thing.</br>  <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU</br>  I don't typically think it's a good idea to be an early adopter on any OS. There's ALWAYS hiccups, and you're pretty much an unpaid tester for the developers.<br>Also, mandatory updates that I can't skip or Download when I choose?<br>No thanks.</br></br>  Windows is just an old fading dream in the back of my memory. Rather use linux or buy a mac,, I remember Microsoft, and I remember who they are. Crooks. Indifferenxe to anything they release or trying to cram down the throats of the public.  <br>Yes. Anyone who stays with 7 is retarded. Especially if you're a gamer (DX12). It's free and it's better.</br>  <br>Still on 7</br>  <br>dont have wikipedia, sorry. How can i buy it.</br>  <br>Have fun with all of that great compatible software................. ha</br>  Dear Windows 10-tards,<br>Enjoy your subscription-based OS.</br>    <br><br> 2015 <br> Never hearing that joke <br><br>Shit, son... it's been around since the 20s.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Only if you fucking have a windows 7 or 8 nigga!</br>  <br> Your computer is a toaster <br><br>This is my laptop. I obviously have a desktop, but couldn't be asked to migrate over to Win10 yet with all that shit on it. Gotta wait til I have time next weekend to do that. Also<br><br> Knowing that random R is Runescape when it can be anything <br><br>:^) caught u in a snafu my friend.<br><br>It's better than 7 because it seems better optimized (On my laptop's shit hardware), and has a lot of neat features. Also it looks much better. I can't speak for 8, because I've never used it, but 10 doesn't have that metro shit so there you go. Settle down anyway you neckbearded fuck.<br><br><br>Why would I have those when I can just open the start menu?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yea, whatever, now get the fuck out</br>  <br>Exactly what I'm doing</br>  <br>subscriptition?</br>  <br>I never tried to sort out why they skipped 9 but...<br>Jesus this joke is fucking bad</br></br>  there's no good games coming out on dx12 though, so why would i switch? i'm on win7 atm but i may go to win98 soon  <br>Install gentoo</br>  <br>kinda like mac os, free upgrades, the license just kinda serves as your subscription ticket i guess</br>  Windows look like shit  <br> still believing a rumor that was debunked a year ago </br>  <br>can somebody hack it?</br>  <br><br>it can't be worse. it looks like someone in their 20's works there now</br></br>  <br>You made me kek and I hate you for that</br>  what happens if i download w10? will my applications on 8 still run? and other files etc.  <br>is this virus?</br>  <br>It's not subscription based retard.</br>  <br>nothing will change except the OS</br>  <br><br>Microsoft's bullshit reason is "Windows 10 is the best and last, a solid 10", but I think they skipped 9 for compatibility issues. A lot of software that has 9x compatibility mode will see windows 9 as 95 or 98 and fuck up compatibility.</br></br>  <br>It's to avoid a lot of old programs which use the 9 digit to check 9x or xp compatibility.<br>Eg.<br>if $windowsversion = 9* then<br>A while ago someone did a global github search and found hundreds of projects using similar code.<br><br><br>And not yet and as i have win7 home i won't be upgrading, i'll be getting win10 pro instead as automatic updates installation without the ability to disable it is too fucking risky.<br>I wait at least 1 week after each batch of windows updates and then google each KB number before installing them. These days it's too risky to simply trust them not to fuck it up; see the recent kernal updates which borked machines up as a prime example.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>kek, well i suppose you're right, It's only uphill from windows 8</br>  Fair warning for all gamers: your games will not fucking work, my games keep having GRAPHICAL DRIVES STOPED WORKING and it does so too alot of fucking games dota, dying light, smite, etc so wait untill it fucking works, about too downgrade back too 7 in 10 minutes wish me luck boys  <br> 2007+8 <br> still using this spyshit of a distro <br>kill yourself</br></br></br>  <br>So everything should still be compatible?</br>  <br>What games are dx12 right now nigga?</br>  <br>9 is nein 'no'</br>  <br>But they upgraded 8 to 8.1</br>  <br>no, most will not be</br>  <br>Maybe cause you aren't using the finished product genius</br>  <br>DirectX is dying, the future is Vulkan.</br>  <br>yea when i was trying the snapshot it felt allot like a bunch of linux features were added to windows very well</br>  <br>aw fuk bye</br>  I already have windows 10 :P  <br>just fixubuntu.com and uninstall some crap apps and it's a great os</br>  <br><br>I have the same issue on windows 7, just do a clean driver install and it'll work. I'm just to lazy to fix it right now since i'm upgrading to W10 in a few days</br></br>  <br>Now doesn't matter, its about a year or two down the road.<br><br><br>Yes</br></br></br></br>  Yeah, I don't really care. I also have Lubuntu on my PC.  <br>yeahright</br>  I'm pretty sure they went to 10 and skipped 9 because the consumer base is a bunch of ignorant fucks. Ultimately it comes down to product support, over any sort of firmware compatibility.  <br>Yes, it's a pretty nice OS in my opinion. I wish that Microsoft would take note from many Linux Desktop Environments though, and let the music player controls integrate with the sound menu.</br>  <br>Yes, it's like a wild african cow sort of thing. Another name for it is "Wildebeest".</br>  <br>already have the tech preview from before it got taken down, it's pretty fucking good, gets rid of the shit from windows 8 and is new and flashy and has a lottttttttttttttt of features that I definitely don't take advantage of. 9/10</br>  <br>My God!!!!</br>  <br> I also have Lubuntu on my PC. <br>How hard was it to install that. I need to do it tomorrow and am undecied about partions (dual boot with xp)</br></br>  <br>pirate it already you fuckin idiots... kickasstorrents has a ton of awesome .isos for you to download..</br>  <br>Have fun with the botware if you choose the free upgrade</br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br><br>There doesn't seem to be an upgrade path from Mint 17.2.</br></br>  <br>Nope, sticking to 7 until they force me to change</br>  <br>Oh look its this kind of thread. <br>Pleb gathering again.<br>Get on my level.</br></br></br>   using anything else then windows 7   Was going to upgrade regadless.<br>But I'm getting the upgrade for free so obviously I will be updating asap.</br>  Hey guyz, I'm having issues with my technical preview. I'm still stuck on build 9926 or something and the piece of shit won't update. I've tried fast/slow ring, removing the download cache, rebooting 5 quadragintillion times, but no avail. Of course I can just wait for wednesday.  <br>Please stop telling the mouthbreathing idiots who inhabit /b/ that my favorite torrent site exists. These unwashed rejects will just ruin the community with their forced an unfunny meme regurgitation bullshit. Thanks.</br>  <br>check em</br>  <br>Your level looks homosexual and designed for the ignorant.</br>  <br>I'm gonna probably re upgrade back over to linux.<br><br>I put winblows 7 on my home server to use can software(that I don't even use) and the stupid thing crashes every couple hours give or take.<br><br>I ran linux on the same machine and it never crashed. I had it running for months on end with no interruptions.<br><br>Windows is a sorry piece of shit os</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>quite a beautiful operating system</br>  <br>Prove it faggot. And I mean from technical point of view not just because you are poorfag.</br>  <br>Take that cock out of your mouth before posting</br>  <br>Cam software****<br><br>I want to dig up steve jobs and shove this iphone up his ass.<br><br>The damn thing changes what I fucking write. I'm on a have to turn auto correct off cause it's to stupid to do any good.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> let me hate those fags bcs i dont have money </br>  <br>It's a system designed for people who are to stupid to be trusted with maintaining or repairing their own property. It's a system designed for people who don't mind if they get over charged for hardware as long as their software doesn't make them think too hard or remember things. They're for ignorant people like you who need everything explained to them.</br>  NO. None of my products I have are compatible with Windows 10, and they are still barely even compatible with Windows 8.1! Biggest mistake of my life updating from 7.  <br>*too</br>  <br>Kek my 250 dollar Acer laptop can run more games than that shit box</br>  <br>yeah thats why i guess every serious software and programming company has macs in their offices.</br>  <br>Correct<br><br>10 point awarded to gryffindor</br></br></br>  i'll upgrade after a few months when the kinks have been worked out, ad i know that it's as user-friendly as win7 (my current OS).<br><br>when they removed the start bar and made windows touch-friendly even on desk/laptops, i was just like fuck microsoft and their bullshit.<br><br>we'll see.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>it really is thats what i did<br><br>i got sad when they said pirates get a lesser license (and i had pirated windows 7 because my key didnt work on regular windows 7 only a toshiba brand windows 7 or something)<br><br>so i downloaded windows activation tool, certified my windows 7. restarted it and updated 500 updates<br><br>restarted<br><br>1 upate pending for windows 10<br><br>now i have professional windows 10, like i paid toshiba for but toshiba said fuck you</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You realize they only have those in their offices so they can test code on them for when they port their applications from normal computers over to OSX. Gotta make sure the code works before handing it over to people who should probably be wearing helmets 24/7.</br>  <br>Post proof or retract</br>  <br>as the post # states, this is common sense 101</br>  <br>also to further my point, i am now a winows 10 isnider with a professional equal license.<br><br>i got in before the doors closed, so to speak</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;630590425 <br>shes dead nigga get over it</br>  <br>i play dota 2 and league fine.<br><br>HOWEVER i had to reinstall my drivers after windows 10</br></br></br>  <br>it's funny that this is what they always say ("you're just jealous because you're poor") because it's exactly what easily-led people would say in that situation.</br>  <br>no faggot , they work on macs but what a fuck do you know , u use computers for facebook and porn <br><br>u want me to post pics of my company's offices? cant now its 11pm here</br></br></br>  <br>reinstall your drivers you fucking dimwit</br>  <br>You're thinking of audio/visual companies.

Keked</br></br>  Haha, i have a late 2009 iMac with just snow leopard, can't upgrade because of private things. Also, graphics card is ATI Radeon 2600 and i have 0.3MB of download speed. Beat that faggots. Still better than most of windows shit.  <br>love you anon</br>  <br>nice /b/ro</br>  How do we know whether it is going to be ready for our hardware yet? I have a sony vaio and upgrading to 8.1 was a fucking disaster. I had to go back to 8, wait for them to fix their shit and then could upgrade to 8.1 again.  <br> Not even knowing how to chance source code </br>  <br>google it. i have had 0 issues and now my laptop doesnt over heat as much</br>  <br> like i ever would go to the apple site </br>  <br>anybody who didn't laugh at that is lying</br>  <br> Hey Cortana <br> Yes? <br> Search for boobs <br> Uhm...okai... <br> Search for Cortana boobs <br> But..bu.. <br> Search! *picks up Ubuntu disc* <br> F-fine... </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>na wating a year or 2 for them to get the chinks out.</br>  <br>yup</br>  <br>Well fuck me I have to wait until November. <br>http://esupport.sony.com/p/os10upgr<wbr>ade.pl?&amp;template_id=1&amp;region_id=1</wbr></br></br>  <br> disc <br> not usb </br></br>  <br> [C] Windows 7 <br> Implying I can't run OS X on my rig </br></br>  [s]Windows 10[/s]<br><br>[b]Spynet 2.0[/b]</br></br>  <br>8 and 10 have non-disableable aero</br>  <br> Implying 8 and 10 don't disble DWM automatically when a DX program is run. <br>Try it.</br></br>   Vista master race reporting in   <br>Not a real Linux user.</br>  <br>kek</br>  <br>I will wait a month or 2 before downloading.<br>Bcuz windows 8 release.</br></br>  <br>I have a pocket SSD stick, 128gb, like I would waste writing on it and distros get updated once/twice a year, once if Ubuntu, so its better to have it on a disc, ready when needed.</br>  <br>No, I'm a 1337 H4xx0r so I use Linux Mint.</br>  2015 and still not using Arch.<br><br>  Muh games </br></br>  <br>nigga u gayyyyyyyyyyyyyyy</br>  <br>plebbitors are so easy to spot</br>  <br>its like he suddenly converted from buddhism to islam</br>  <br>What is arch built on? I really enjoy debian+lxde.</br>  Been running windows 10 technical preview for the past 7 months. I like it. Wouldn't go back to 8 or even 7.  <br>I can't upgrade because Windows 7 is a pile of corrupted shit and I'm gonna have to do a format to be able to and I have to get another hdd to backup my shit.</br>  <br> he thinks anyone outside of /g/ gives a fuck about linux (let alone Arch: The Autism Distro) <br>You didn't have any friends in high school because your expectations are unrealistic.</br></br>  <br>I thought DX12 is coming along with WIN 10. I'm pretty sure games are going to be having a major update to support DX12 and new drivers are gonna come with DX12 support. Oh well, we're just beginning. Like you said, we just have to wait until DX12 becomes popular.</br>  <br>In games like osu, running in windowed mode on 8 and 10 gives input lag with tablets because you can't disable aero.</br>  I would upgrade to Win10, used the preview for a while, but I have to wait till 29th to get proper drivers for my gfx card.  <br> tablets <br>kekd</br></br>  Been using Windows 10 since last September. No complaints so far.  <br>Seven ate nine</br>  <br>Only a fool would pass on a free upgrade</br>  <br>disable windows ink and/or (if wacom) disable windows ink support in tablet preferences</br>   willingly installing malware <br><br>ayy</br></br>  I'll probably see if win 10 is shit or not and switch to using Linux Mint if it is.

Pretty much everything works.

I'm using windows 8.1 it didn't even come with movie maker, and the fucking start screen is atrocious.  <br><br>Won't WIndows 10 detect that it's pirated and go into "HEY YOUR WINDOWS ISN'T GENUINE" mode?</br></br>  OS X El Capitan here. Fuck no.  <br>That's not how you cite. Give me the page you're getting your information from or shut your stupid little whore mouth, kid. Got it?</br>  <br>Newfag spotted</br>  Didn't like 8 still on 7.

If you refuse to take those dicks out of your mouth, why don't you at least update to a newer version of your steaming pile of crap?</br>  Was going to until they confirmed non-Pro licences would have Automatic Updates FORCED on. I get that security is a huge thing but my pc has been assfucked by windows updates before and I'd like to install on my own grounds.  <br>define non-pro</br>  so we get this on the 29th so long as we have w8.1 and went through their request "get windows 10" thing?  Had Windows updates turned off for over a year and was wondering why the windows 10 symbol hadn't appeared for me yet so I could reserve it.Googled it to see what was wrong and found out I had to be completely up to date to get the symbol to appear, spent 2 days updating. Over 500 fucking updates.<br><br>Windows 10 is reserved now, going to check some reviews and stuff when it comes out before I start the download, just to make sure it isn't fucked up and glitchy on launch.</br></br>  <br>No, they're not going to update hundreds of millions of PCs on the 29th. The internet would crash. It's a staggered roll out.</br>  <br>the free version that all 7, 8, and 8.1 users get if you don't already have pro/ultimate.</br>  <br>you can download before the actual release date..</br>  <br>It's free. I can afford free.</br>  <br>no, you pleb</br>  <br><br>wow, gave me a good chuckle!</br></br>  <br>Windows is never glichy and fucked up on launch<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=yHx<wbr>j-47csUU</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=jMT<wbr>oNsCyFQU</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as Windows, is in fact, NSA/Windows, or as I've recently taken to calling it, NSA plus Windows. Windows is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another expenseive component of a fully functioning Spy system made useful by the NSA core-spyware, reverse shell utilities and vital keylogging components comprising a full botnet as defined by Gen. J. Clapper.<br>Many computer users run a modified version of the botnet system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of spyware which is widely used today is often called "Windows", and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the NSA system, developed by the NSA. There really is a Windows, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use.<br>Windows is the cover: the program in the system that hides the spying resources from the other programs that you run. The cover is an essential part of a botnet, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete botnet. Windows is normally used in combination with the NSA spyware: the whole system is basically botnet with Windows added, or NSA/Windows. All the so-called "Windows" versions are really versions of NSA/Windows.</br></br></br>    <br>a true 1336h4xx0r would use kali. :°)</br>  <br> not recognizing the interjection <br>lurk moar</br></br>  <br>Excuse me, child?</br>  <br>show proof or return to the bottom of the bridge you were hiding under.</br>  <br> implying someone cares that you don't. </br>  <br>Can't, Mac is too old, newer versions lack drivers.</br>    <br> having a cluttered desktop <br>nigger level, the only thing on your desktop should be the bin and anything related to something you are working on.<br>Scruffy cunt.</br></br></br>  <br> 2008+7 <br> still using compiz <br>kekd</br></br></br>  I reserved mine, but I'm still on the fence about upgrading entirely. I'd wait a few months at best for stability, but until then, I most likely won't bother. <br><br>Plus the whole NSA spybox shit.</br></br>    how do I upgrade if my windows 7 is not original  <br>amazon</br>  <br>Poorfag detected</br>  <br>they see everything you do anyway, dont look at CP, dont plan to bomb shit and dont try to hire a hitman and you're good to go.</br>  <br>So close to telling the truth</br>  <br>buy windows 7 starter, its dirt cheap, you can then upgrade to windows x which is basically just one edition, none of that starter, premium, professional shit.</br>  <br>You have to have Internet Explorer installed, then update through Windows update. Afterwards you'll have the kb3033583 file, which is the Win10 upgrade.<br><br>I couldn't get the upgrade until after I installed Explorer. Uninstalled that IE garbage after I reserved my copy. <br><br><br>CP does get posted pretty often in 4chan.
