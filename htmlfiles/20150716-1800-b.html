Tell me why.<br><br>Feeling great? Tell me why.</br></br></br></br>  <br>feeling pretty down. how about you, OP?</br>      <br>Why do you feel down?</br>  I posted yesterday that I was gonna an hero. Still considering it.  I'm lonely, one of the girls I love won't text me back, and the other is in a relationship with a douche. I'm unemployed, in debt  Shitty have<br>Surgery tomorrow morning</br>  Feeling hopeful that my glitched Best Buy order's gonna go through. Gonna finally build a PC with the money if it does.  <br>Hey OP. How are you doing today?</br>  <br>Honestly, I'm feeling really good OP.<br>Really fuckin good.</br></br>  <br>lonely, I suppose.</br>  My favorite person in the world! <br>I'm doing okay tonight, actually. Nothing extraordinary happened today, but it was a good day. Just like last night! I was invited to a farewell party on Saturday for a friend who's leaving for Marine Corps training or some shit like that, so I'm really looking forward to it.<br>Hope everyone else is doing good! How are you doing, OP?</br></br>  <br>Feelin' pretty good.<br>Playing some video games with some friends and chatting over skype.</br></br>  <br>Most people in this thread have that problem. You're not alone in being lonely.</br>  Feeling great but nervous, i'll negotiate some services for first time tomorrow  I'm feeling sad, OP from other thread banned Renamon ;_;  <br>Feel about the exact same as yesterday, honestly.<br><br><br>Well that makes two of us.<br><br><br>Don't do that, anon. I would miss you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What class hero?</br>  <br><br>Dan the therapist?&gt;</br></br>  I'm doing pretty good. Just got paid. Gonna download Terra, see what that's about. Got some new PS2 games to check out, like Dark Cloud 2, Radatia Stories, and Rogue Galaxy. I'm 28, morbidly obese, and still live with my parents and I'm probably going to die alone. I also am going to get a new monitor soon, probably next pay day, cause I need a new tire for my car, so says my dad. So, I'm doing pretty good.  Had random urges to beat the shit out of my girlfriend. Like I wouldn't lose my temper to her or anything, in fact I loved her. We'd just be cuddling on the couch and I'd have an overwhelming urge to punch her. <br>I broke up with her today</br>  <br>Had a good day.<br>Now thay it's late and I'm alone, I'm obsessing over her again.<br>It's consuming me.</br></br></br>  <br>Also I don't know if I passed my physics test, if I pass I'll get into university, if not I'll get slain by my parents</br>  <br><br>well, then we can be lonely together. what are you guys up to tonight?</br></br>  <br>That's an odd order of things. Something good, something good, something bad, and then something good to cut off the bad. If you're happy with it, that's all that matters, I guess.</br>  <br>You could do that, but Just think with me for a moment, You do it.<br>What happens to your family?<br>Killing yourself doesn't make anything better, Ever.<br><br>Tips coming from someone who's survived a Suicide attempt, I regret it.</br></br></br></br></br>  I'm confused and lonely, confused on what I want in life, and lonely because all I do is lay in bed and wish I had a friend or someone to be with, I wish I had the answers for life, because so far I feel like I've done nothing but fuck up over and over.<br><br>I thought getting a job and improving myself physically would help with my confidence, and it did for a while, but now i feel like I'm right back where I started.</br></br>  <br>Doing well, actually.<br>Kind of stressed, though.</br></br>  <br>Do you want the Secret to life Anon?</br>  <br>Here I am again, feeling tired and empty, how about you, OP?</br>  <br>Just sitting here hitting f5 to this thread over and over.</br>  <br>Sure</br>  <br>dubs speak truth</br>  <br>I'm just waiting for work again. Go to sleep, go to work, regret not eating breakfast, go home, eat, sleep, repeat. Not very exciting.</br>  <br>I am just some anonymous stranger. how could you possibly have any affection towards a faceless being.<br><br><br>underclass hero<br><br><br>I have put some thought into it. Not sure whether my family will even care. Friends might not understand, but they'll get over me soon enough. Being a burden in death is easier on people than being a burden in life.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well atleast you separated yourself from her before you actually did hurt her.</br>  feeling pretty good, me and the gf have the day off tomorrow so gonna hang out at her place, catch up on doctor who, cuddle and order some greasy takeout  <br>I dunno man I hurt her pretty bad by leaving her<br>The worst part is I lied about why</br></br>  <br>The Secret of Life... Is 42.<br>Nah, Just shittin ya.<br>really though, it's no Secret, Do whatever makes You happy. Doesn't matter what it is.<br>If you wanna go put your dick on someone's feet, go do that.<br>You wanna go do a line of coke of that clowns asscheek?<br>Go do it.<br>Do whatever makes you happy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>what's on your mind? anything you'd like to talk about?<br><br><br> what kind of job do you have?</br></br></br></br>  <br>How greasy?</br>  <br>I don't think you've thought much about it.<br><br>I had a Friend who shot himself, Ezra was his name.<br>He had the same thought train, and not a day has passed that I haven't thought about him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>dunno<br>like 7/10 greasy<br>cheap pizza and 2 boxes of cinnamon sticks</br></br></br>  <br>Feeling better than I have in a very long time.<br>Finally coming out of a depression that fucked my life for a couple of years.<br>Actually doing things that make me happy again.</br></br></br>  <br>Just a job at Arby's. I do a little of everything there. Not staying forever. Just until college comes back.</br>  <br>I didn't even realize that I wrote that. My bad. I'm kinda tired, and my mind wanders. You know something, I wanted to do something with my life. I wanted to graduate high school and get into college. I had a half scholarship to Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College, because of my ACT scores. I wanted to graduate with a Networking cert or something computer related under my belt. I graduated seven years ago. Now I work at a Wal Mart in Texarkana, selling glasses as an optician. Which is cool. But it won't pay for college. So I feel that I'm stuck. Being 28 I feel I'm way too old to start turning my life around. Mostly because I look at my little sister, who has a husband, four kids, and lives in Mississippi. And I look at my little brother who has four kids and a wife and a house and a couple of cars and a good job. And I see succesful adults. ANd when the games load in the CRT I see a Fatlas in his parent's house, who never really had a life at all. But I'm happy. Because I guess I have to be? Yes.</br>  <br>that just makes you a good person, anon. I've got some gaming tournaments coming up. I want to compete in them... it's literally the only thing I'm looking forward to this year.</br>    <br>That doesn't make me a good person, I'm honestly not a good person.<br>Have you got any good friends?</br></br>  im a californian that just moved from mexico to florida. i lived in mexico for a year. leaving behind some great friends and shit. also, mexico is much more chill then america. but my wifi there was 0.5 mgps and here its 57 so thats good. no more waiting and hour for porn. still sad tho  <br>Not a nigger</br>  <br>I'm actually pretty worried I'll end up like that. Look at my siblings, see they are successful and remember all the hope my parents had for me as a child as I let them down. I'm glad you're happy, though.</br>  <br>You have no idea how happy I am to here that.</br>  Feel odd<br>I need a purpose.</br>  <br>Here you go</br>  <br>what kind of tournaments? i've been playing tabletop games in a bunch of local tournaments, and its definitely improved my life, it makes you get out there and meet new people, and after the games everyone goes out for the night for drinking and all that good shit, in a year i've expanded all my social skills dramatically, got myself a girlfriend and just generally improved.<br>try it out son</br></br>  <br>Do you have any Hobbies?</br>  <br>me 3 anon, how you gonna do it?</br>  <br>of course. I wanted to get a job before/during college as well but I could never find one unfortunately.</br>  <br>heh, thanks</br>  feeling pretty good, going out with the crew to dave and busters on sunday :)) hows your day going OP?  <br>hmm, not really.<br>just play games and stuff<br>well i do like archery, but im not too good<br><br>plus trips cheq'd mate</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I love tournaments. Usually some of the friendliest places you can go to. Maybe it's because we met people who have a passion for the same game, but I've never met a dick at a tournament yet. Albeit I've only been to 3.</br></br>  <br>Trips for doot.<br> <br>Do you do any Archery competitions?<br> <br>Also, what kinda games?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm actually feeling pretty good for once<br>Probably because marching rehearsals have started once again and marching band always makes me feel good<br>I also got a job so ynoe holler</br></br></br>  <br>I'm feeling really good hehe... i am trying this new thing where I talk like an LCS gamer / girl x3<br>because i flame a lot. I have played though 200 games of chat restriction on the same account and just got 100 more to do, down to 95 now teehee i'm so silly ^o^<br>and with this attitude and talking like this exactly like this instead of my usual talk helped me win more games and my teammates CARRY ME SO HARD every single game because i don't bring them down i guess. i don't even have to spam ping, if someone is playing bad and feeding or is really unskilled i leave them to die and say oopsie sorry ^-^ It's fun</br></br></br>  I'm depressed and trying to find a job to turn my life around and instead of supporting me my girlfriend decided to just check out because she envisions our future as her working all day and me playing video games with my friends all day.<br><br>So before I was just depressed but now I'm depressed and heartbroken because I feel like I lost a partner when I needed one the most. She says she cares and wants to remain a friend but has pretty much stopped talking to me and that makes me even more upset as if I meant nothing or at least not as much as she meant to me.<br><br>I hate my life and for the past month I've thought about giving up at least 3 times a week.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I got incredibly lucky. The GM told me straight up "Yeah, if it's for the summer, I honestly don't see a point in hiring you. It just looks like awaste of training." but she hired me. Not sure why.</br>  <br>Well, I'm the girl who did that shit to Mike. Now I feel pretty bad but also strangely numb.</br>  A little more sullen compared to last night on the thread. I drove from to a city south of where I live, about a 40-45min drive and couldn't even concentrate on driving. I pulled over and just started bawling. This has never happened to me before and it really caught me by surprise. I was just simply on my way to pick up new uniforms for work (since our HQ was down south).<br><br>But you know, despite feeling dreary and melancholic right now, it almost feels liberating that it happened. I'm hoping I wake up tomorrow feeling good.</br></br>  <br>no archery competitions just do it for fun<br><br>umm i play dark souls, demon's souls, bloodborne, etc.<br>Fallout,Dragon's dogma, FF6 ,that kind of stuff</br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't end up like this. The crushing loneliness can't be hidden by the games, and the work that you do during the day won't even take your mind off of it after a while. I suggest you do something that will change your life right now. If I could go back in time I would tell myself to study harder, do better. I don't know my times tables or how to read an analogue clock for Christ's sake. I would tell myself to lose that weight and join the navy just like I wanted to because I'll benefit from it.</br>  <br>Nothing really on my mind tonight. I have a trip coming up next week and am just trying to keep my mind busy until then.<br><br><br>Just because you are anonymous doesnt mean I cant care about you</br></br></br></br>  <br>I had the same thing man, If it ain't meant to be, it ain't meant to be.</br>  <br>ur so kawaii =^//o//^=</br>  Not all too bad, playing persona 4 golden for the first time on my vita, also becoming pic related  <br>just online friends.<br><br><br><br>There's an upcoming MTG tournament, not particularly good at MTG but I like the competitiveness thereof. <br><br>Then there's a League of Legends tournament hosted locally, 1v1 and 5v5 knock-out. <br><br>Another local tournament that's about to finish now is in week 8, I think I've done well enough to go to play-offs but I guess we'll find out.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  wonderful  <br>Great choice, anon. How do you like it so far?</br>  <br>Console or PC?<br> <br>I used to do archery, I was a boy Scout for a while and we'd go off to Summer camp where they had all sorts of that. have you ever been to a SHooting range?</br></br></br>  <br>I don't care about having a GF or anything, I just feel like I want to avoid the whole "living with parents" problem. I feel like it'd crush me and them. I feel like I'll always be lonely, but I wont have to be lonely while disappointing and weighing down on some people. <br><br>I don't to be rich, just have enough money for my own apartment to be alone and in peace.</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks anon, strangely I feel like your concern might be real.</br>  <br>Feelin alright.<br>Worked 13 hours, prepping for busiest weekend of year. But, shit got done, noone got hurt, so all in all, good day.</br></br>  Lonely i guess  still wondering why im here <br> be 19 <br> be obese <br> no job <br> no gf <br> no qualifications <br><br>I think the only reason im not a hero is that I still want to play fallout 4. Still got to find a way to pay for it...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Console, i only had a laptop and it just broke today<br><br>No, i've never been to a range but sounds fun</br></br></br>  <br>I hope you feel better sooN!</br>  <br>cheer up ^-^</br>  <br>Ayyyyy, you play some of my favorite games. Thanks for being another person that played Dragon's Dogma. I love that game, and it sucks not knowing another person who likes it.</br>  <br>I wish you the best I can and though it may mean nothing to you I will pray that you stay that way. Along with those on here that are feeling down. I wish I could help or do something more than some text on a site and a fun image</br>  <br>This is just temperary! This will look up! Trust me &lt;3</br>  Kinda shitty because I'm not attracted to her but I am at the same time and that's been fucking with me. But I got invited a Billy Joel concert tommorow so that's solid.  I feel great but I'm disappointed that r/coontown is getting banned.  <br>if you like the competitiveness of mtg, find a hobby store somewhere around you with a tabletop game called warmachine. its a game i play every week, its very tactical and competitive, and the models are cool. its also fairly affordable for a tabletop wargame. if you have a bit of disposable income check it out/come over to /tg/ and ask about it in the warmachine/hordes general</br>  Feeling great , I'm high and my girl and are are about to watch a movie. Pretty nice night for me.  <br>It's pretty decent, though I'm only up to just after the whole body hanging from antenna thing, I have good hopes for this game, was recommended to me by the manager at an eb games store near my house <br><br>I have a question, is it a possibility within the game to be with that yuki chick? if so I have a long day ahead of me</br></br></br>  <br>things** oopsie ^-^</br>  <br>hmm, maybe she saw some potential in you! or you must be very likable and convincing. either way, good job!<br><br>I wish I could talk longer, but I have to get some sleep. I hope you have a good night!</br></br></br>  <br>Lily?</br>  <br>Yeah i think it's great.<br>Never could get to the end of Dark Arisen DLC though :(</br></br>  <br>Good night c: sweet dreams!</br>  <br>Are you me? <br>I want complete independence solely for the sake of perpetuating my own lonliness rather than attempting to hide it from my family and friends</br></br>  <br>haven't decided on anything yet, was just entertaining the notion. Why do you wanna do it?<br><br><br>That picture is adorable.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Console's pretty chill, the Last actual console I bought was the Wii.<br> <br>Yeah, definitely go to a range, Even if it's just a .22. It's pretty fun, you get a little adrenaline rush.</br></br></br>  I hate driving. How can I cure this? Is there any place I can live where I never have to drive again?  <br>Feeling really great, weather wise the past two days, especially today have been absolutely perfect weather wise. So good that it just puts you in good mood.</br>  <br>Cool, i definitely will, thanks<br>Dubs=Cheq'd</br></br>  <br>Daw Thank you ^///^z</br>  Was fine until my ass decided it was going spew fire water feels real bad man  <br>By the end, you mean just killing the boss the first time, right? Yeah, he can definitely be hard. Nothing 3 Conqueror Perpiats can't totally fuck up, though. Just get on his face, Apply all three, Mash. I have to say, Bitterblack isles is my favorite place. Such a challenge.</br>  <br>I'm not a huge fan of it Either, Do you drive Standard or Automatic?</br>  Can't sleep. Job interview with AIG tomorrow.<br><br>It's my second choice unless they offer more money than this other gig.</br></br>  <br>You can move to the city. Like places like New York. Most everybody uses the metro to get around there.</br>  <br>I went through psychosis and basically for a whole year I did things to give myself a reason to kill myself without questioning the morality behind any of my actions, now that I'm in therapy and on meds and shit I sorta finally realized that I let it go too far and should probably leave this world, but on the other hand I still have my studies to tend to..</br>  <br>Auto</br>  <br>Yeah, real challenging.<br>I can never grind to a high enough level to get shit done</br></br>  <br>Try driving at night/in the rain OR BOTH! :O while listening to chillstep &lt;3 It's soo soothing</br>  <br>You have your Own car?</br>  <br> Feeling great? Why? <br>Had sex.<br> Feeling shitty? Why? <br>She was 10.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe I am you, and you're talking to the past. Who knows? But yeah, I feel like I wont get rid of the loneliness, but I'd at least be somewhat at ease by myself. Just feels like the way I want to go.</br>  <br>I live in a pretty backwater part of my country, so I'll have to drive a bit to get to a game shop. Closest one is about an hour away.<br><br>I've played Pathfinder and Dungeons and Dragons, but other than those I haven't really done any other table top games.</br></br></br>  <br>Hey anon, Im this fag.<br><br>I was in a similar situation to you. I was deep into a depression when my partner left me, which made it much worse, to the point of contemplating and planning my suicide.<br><br>Can't really help all that much, as some random fucker over the internet, but if the need is dire, consider seeking medical aid. <br><br>Sorry for the hugboxy ramble, and saying this is corny as fuck, but it gets better man. Find support from wherever you can, because there are people going through what you're going through, who want nothing else than someone to talk to.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>forgot picture hehe oops.</br>  <br>I don't particularly like driving either, didn't bother with DT, figured i'd just get my license at 18, but as it turned out, insurance companies didn't like that. I mainly just didn't want to have a permit so my parents could make me chauffeur. <br><br>My advice, find a car that you really like, maybe even a little sporty. When you have a car that you really like, it's actually fun to drive.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, I do. It's A Grand Marquis. Maybe I need to get a different car?<br><br><br>You sound like you want me to crash and die. I have bad night road vision, and the rain just fucks with my head.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Can Confirm this,<br>and I drive a Puny Standard, I fuckin love that car, and it's actually fun to drive.</br></br>  Everyone should be HAPPY ^-^ I can give you all FREE WARM HUGS!  <br>What class do you go? Ranger and Warrior clean that place nicely. Some bosses are almost fucking impossible with the warrior, though. The eyeball and the priest come to mind. I love the final boss, though. What level were you attempting it at? I think I usually beat it somewhere near 50</br>  <br>alright then</br>  <br>That picture is way too defining.<br><br>Also that sounds terrible. I'm sorry to hear that. My biggest issue is crushing loneliness and social anxiety, but there aren't any medicines for that.</br></br></br>  <br>Well... There's your problem, It's a buick.<br>Buicks are not fun to drive at all, especially the older ones.</br></br>  <br>Oopsie.. i didn't know &lt;3 maybe you can have some warm tear or coffee in your cup holder as you drive.. and sip on it during long traffic lights ^-^ and bring an easy to eat snack &lt;3</br>  <br>we meet again, arby's guy right? :) <br>I completely agree, just having some space to myself without having to answer to anyone while I'm there would be nice, I could read, think, do whatever and never be bothered, seems nice</br></br>  <br>ah, thats a shame. if you ever get around to itz the tabletop game hobby is really rewarding when you get your stuff built and painted</br>  <br>Words mean nothing, anon. I need a hug and I need it now.</br>  <br>Different anon here. <br><br>But this is probably one of my favorite things to do when I feel sad. Driving at night clears my head so much. Sometimes I listen to ambient or chillstep and ending the night at my favorite lookout over the city before heading home.</br></br></br>  <br>I need someone like you in my life.</br>  <br>I picked rougue both times i played it and i got past the second eyeball that's all i remember</br>  Alright. Met a girl and we been talking, she's really shy but we like each other.  <br><br>quit posting this thread fag<br><br>sage</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ayyyy, I was just talking about Arby's a bit ago, too.What's up, man?</br>    <br>It was a lot worse when she dumped me, it's getting better. I still feel lost and heartbroken though. I switch between sadness about not having her to lean on anymore and anger at her pretty much abandoning me. It's really a terrible spot to be in. I know I have to change for myself but I also want her back even though she's being pretty shitty to me right now. She has her own issues and baggage so I'm trying to be sympathetic even though she hasn't been very sympathetic towards me.<br><br>It sucks man.</br></br></br>  Anyone got information on "tinnitus"? How to make it less annoying or something  <br>It's an 08, so it's not so bad. I've been thinking about getting something like a small SUV with all wheel drive.<br><br><br> Oopsie.. i didn't know &lt;3 <br>No worries</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Implying /b/ doesn't have regular re-posted shit threads already </br>  My favorite anon ! <br>Typical here as I always say. <br>Just got home from work. Ate. Wife is watching Netflix. About to join her in bed .<br>All is well.</br></br></br>  <br>different anon, but same. I'm genuinely surprised there isn't an app like tindr but just for finding friends...</br>  <br>I dunno if this helps your situation but my social anxiety got pretty bad too, to the point where I would shake meeting new people and sweat and stuff and it was just a mess, but having a psychologist kinda helped and the antipsychotics I was on relaxed me a little, have you spoken to a doctor about it? sometimes they can prescribe things that calm you down a little</br>  <br>It's better than sitting on my ass lurking the chan every second of the day. I should go to /tg/ more often</br>    Feeling alright. My sister just asked my opinion of her boyfriend, I think they want to get married even though they're 19.  <br>Glad to hear everything is going good, anon.</br>  <br>inst it? are you not suppose to have casual sex with your friends?</br>  <br>Now, when you say "join"...<br><br>Gotta say, if you're life is working, eating and then netflix, I'm kind of jealous.</br></br></br>  <br>did you ever feel like you would never be able to find anyone who could love you? Because that's how I feel.</br>  yesterday my gf told me not to sleep long, now i woke up at like 8:00 started calling her and she texted back "i cant talk to you right now, go to sleep"  <br>Feel better /b/ro.</br>  <br>well I think tindr is for dating mostly, which is why you pick a gender to search for.</br>  <br>You're special in your own way and I just know someone will notice you who's just as special to you :)</br>  <br>just started persona 4G, haven't really eaten today (nothing seems appealing), most I've done is create a makeshift body turban for my dog who won't stop shaking in the cold, apparently she has a heart murmur though so it could just be that, you anon?</br>  <br>right ear guy?</br>  <br>SUV's are fun, Especially the Real big ones.</br>  <br><br><br>Yea there was a time. <br>Not gonna lie...I'm 37, she's 38.<br>Been married 8 years and it's still awesome. <br>Just give some time ...it will happen on its own.<br>I know that sounds stereotypical and shit but it's true</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It really does suck.<br>For me, cutting off all contact off helped me get over her. I got her out of my life, and out of my mind. I dunno if it would be the same for you, or if that's even possible given your situation, but it's just my two cents.</br></br>  <br>they're asking to be depressed in a few years imo, only serious conversation my dad ever had with me that wasn't about yelling was about to not get married young</br>  <br>That is a great idea. If I had any willpower or technical skills I would make such an app.<br><br><br>I haven't spoken to a doctor, I don't have much money for medication anyway.</br></br></br></br>  <br>A heart murmur? Sounds pretty shitty. I've got 4 mutts myself, but only one of them have any issues. <br><br>As for what I did, I woke up, went to work, regretted not eating, went home, ate, came here. Will repeat but at an earlier time tmr.</br></br></br>    <br>Yup, I fucked up bad</br>  <br>I'm kinda tired of big cars though. I had a Dodge Ram 1500 single cab short wheelbase for a while and I loved it, but I crashed the fucker (I was a noob driver, hydroplaned into a telephone pole, probably one of the reason's I don't like driving in the rain.) I kinda want something that size, but less...rear wheel drive.</br>  <br>You know, you say that, but I can't really picture myself in love. It'd just feel so out of my character if I was.</br>  <br>Only cars I've ever driven were a Chrysler 300 from 2001 and a mercury minivan from 2003. Surprisingly the minivan handles better than the Chrysler. I'm in college now, and don't have my own car.<br><br>Semi-realistic dream car would be a 2013 focus ST hatchback. Those things can fly.<br><br>same guy as  btw.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That filename.
