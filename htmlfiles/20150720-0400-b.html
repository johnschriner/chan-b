[ 10/10 Feet Edition  Mate, you are a dead-set fuckhead. Something went seriously astray with your genetics. Are you even a man? Do you even bear a fucking resemblance to the XY chromosome? Worshipping feet, what the fuck? Real men don't worship feet. You know what they did back in the day, back in the GOOD days, with guys who worshipped feet? They fed them to the lions. To the fucking LIONS. People back then, they fucking KNEW that guys who worshipped a woman's fucking FOOT instead of their own BODIES, had something seriously fucktacular happen to them while they were a sperm and ended up a mongo, and they were SACRIFICED. These days, you cunt, you should consider yourself thankful that we live in a fucking so-called "enlightened" age where shitcunts like you who can't even call yourself a man, are allowed to do this pissy shit without being torn limb from fucking LIMB.<br><br>Feet.

Please share more</br>  <br>Fuck all, I wish I could be a stand up comic. I likely don't have the balls for that. Standing up because I have to in peer review of my code and explaining the reasoning behind code I can do. But stand up comedy, fuck!!!! I wouldn't know where to start.</br>  <br>THERE ARE 4 LIGHTS</br>  <br><br>That was just how that area was. People were like termites. They know someone else is going to make a move to nab something, so they jump at the occasion thinking it'll be missed in the shitstorm. <br><br>It's kinda like when someone quits in an office environment and right after they leave, scavengers attack their desk for leftover office supplies and shit.</br></br></br></br>  Anxiety disorder.<br><br>Fucking reborn now it's almost over, though.</br></br>  <br>It's natural, remember that. It's natural that they die before you as their child. Just think of it if it was you dieing first, nobody wants to see their parents go through that. So stay alive and die after them.</br>  <br>No tendies for you!</br>  <br>Ok that makes a little more sense. Sounds like those around you were trailer trash bud.</br>  <br>death and taxes... the way she goes...the fucking way she goes</br>  <br>No wonder you wanted to leave. Where was this retarded asocial 3rd world nigger infested hellhole?</br>  <br>Honestly when it happens you just kinda deal with it. Life just goes on somehow. That fact also makes it a bitworse when shit actually happens because you can tell in that moment that dealing with it is just a necessary thing and you automatically manage it but at the same time it doesn't even really give you special skills to manage it better... Because in my experience it kinda comes naturally it's not like you gain a skill to deal with stuff later on.</br>    <br><br>Some were, others weren't. What was interesting was that the people that had my back through it all were the least well-off sort, and the ones that did the most damage weren't hurting for money...<br><br>I was a convenient target, I guess. <br><br>My car got destroyed because it was in a garage at the time. I think the owner figured if he sabotaged it, I'd have to leave it there. After X number of days, he could apply to the DMV to get the title as "abandonment by owner" and he would then own a $50k car for free...<br><br>I was tipped off by a friend, and when I went to pick the car up it was already trashed.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>New England area, near the Cape. <br><br>Funny thing is, no niggers there.

At that moment, you can effortlessly pop out of gear, no problem. <br>With a light pressure on the gas pedal, let revs slowly climb downwards as you flick the gearshift into the next position. If you do it right, it will go right in like honey. <br><br>Downshifting is harder. This requires a heavy press on the gas to get the rev's up, and then to slip right in.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I'm addicted to massage parlors<br>I make 50k a year and paid weekly. I have a girlfriend and she gives me sex when i want it but i still hold out to go to parlors. Does any one else obsess with parlors? Should I go today?</br>  I go occasionally, but I'm not "addicted".<br>I you can't control yourself with that, you've got a problem, m8</br>  <br>whats the most u can do with a girl there?</br>  Hell yeah. If you are setting aside money to pay all of your financial obligations by all means go enjoy a nice massage. You earned it.  <br>If you are in the states that is an expensive hobby/addiction. You should be pacing yourself for the same reasons women shouldn't go shopping every weekend: YOU CAN'T AFFORD IT! On $50k you should treat yourself twice a year. Why pay $60+ for something you can do yourself.</br>  <br>Condom full sex i go about twice a month $200 a visit</br>  Can you please please please explain in detail how these work, what goes on etc? I've been wanting to do this and have looked one up, but I'm fucking chicken :(<br><br>Also, do you have to strip naked/take a shower whatever? Importantly: are these places mostly old Asian ladies or are there really some that are young and pretty?<br><br>I'm the type that would rather jackoff than have sex with less than a 6-7. Please detail the experience and I'll award you 1,000 internets. Ty</br></br></br></br>  <br>that's so expensive<br><br>ive never been but ive always wondered what quality are the girls<br><br>are they like porn worthy girls?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> paying to have an orgasm <br><br>LOfuckingL</br></br></br>  <br>I'm thinking about hitting one up myself. Any tips for amateur?</br>  <br>i met my girlfriend at a massage parlors<br>and when she comes home from work i ask for a massage she says poor me i go to work and massage and i have to massage my boyfriend at home</br></br>  <br>is this a joke?<br><br>why would someone want to date a whore?</br></br></br>  <br>she wasnt a whore <br>she was a virgin and i broke her in</br></br>  <br>most girls are nowadays whores</br>  <br>The parlor i go to they have a young staff 20-30 but every now and then i have seen other parlors 30-40. The ladies rate average 7/10 unless they pass 30 then you get a 5/10 with big breast.i just got lucky with my parlor some of ladies have breast implants</br>  <br>I do, and I'm in the same situation you are, OP... gf who gives me all the sex I need<br>I spent SO long looking for the best masseuse <br>I finally found a massage therapist that is amazing, one in a million. She also gives me 2 happy endings in a span of the 90 minute session. Each session is only $100</br></br></br>  <br>Few porn worthy and yes worth it</br>  <br>Check reviews at rubmaps com</br>  <br>Is she asian</br>  <br>are they young and dumb?<br>or are they 35+and have no skills cuz and there cuz their husband ran off?</br></br>  <br>yes</br>  <br><br>This varies by parlor and location. In the US you typically pay a $40-60 entrance fee and then tip the girl another $40-$80. <br><br>At a nice parlor tucked away in an upscale area of a US City:<br>They will give you a more traditional message of your back and legs and then gently slide their hands over your hairy balls. They then ask you to flip over. they rub your chest and then they may ask if you like it hard or soft. Then they get to work. If you only tip the girl $40-60 she will leave her clothes on and you can lightly touch her while she works. If you you tip more it can be body 2 body where she is naked sliding all over you. For $200+ you can get vaginal intercourse. Not all of the "upscale" parlors offer this service because the more sexual the service the more likely the authorities are to identify and raid the site. <br><br>Cheap places in the US:<br>Again a $40-$60 entrance fee; However, the girls really are hookers and for $60-$300 they offer whatever you want. Typically a condom is required, but every girl has a price. I would avoid these places because you have a high likely hood of getting ripped off. All parlors have security and the girls will are unscrupulous and often keep uncharging for services. These locations are typically in shitty neighborhoods as they are basically brothers in waiting to be raided.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Good grief this is good bait because i am typing this.</br>  <br>I am also obsessed with this. Nothing better than getting a good massage and finish. Especially when you find that perfect girl that knows exactly how to slowly bring you to orgasm and stroke through</br>  <br>i did have pics of the bloody vag i am trying to find</br>  <br>not bait friend</br>  <br>Yeah i was just on that. I more concerned with how much Im supposed to tip, and how to initiate the contact. Shit like that.</br>  <br>They are all very classy and respectful..honestly they seem so sweet you would take her home if you didn't know</br>  <br><br>Brothers=brothels<br><br>but their are a lot of brothers at the cheap places. they want them white womenz</br></br></br></br>  Any tips, do you just ask them or wait for it  sorry friends cant find  <br>It runs the gamut. most upscale parlors assign the girl to you as you are paying for the message and not the girl. Sometimes you get cute young one who barely knows what she is doing or even resents what she is doing. <br><br>The best girls are the older ones. 45+ women who have been stroking for 30 years. They can read a man and know how you want to be stroked.<br><br>I like it soft, but i've had old and young girls stroke me raw so it is possible to have less than perfect experience. Jut like sex sometimes it isn't as good as others.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>is there an equivalent for aus?</br>  <br>locate the parlor on backpage, or look for reviews online. If you can confirm they offer hands before you go they will know why you are there.</br>  any websites where you can find massage parlours in europe. specifically holland (inb4 just go brothel, I prefer the discreteness of parlours)  <br>Take the table shower if you get hard show her and..touch her legs then ask her..you must show your intentions or they won't offer. Usually 40 for hj but sex is 120 -160</br>  <br>Is prostitution legal there? I feel AUS should be a sex work mecca.</br>  <br>You forgot about when they give you hard candy at the end...<br>I always get hard candy or mint at the end</br></br>  What countries you guys from  <br>yeah there are certain locations. you've got the professional places and some shady massage places that just so happens to offer these services but dont exactly legally advertise them..</br>  <br>America where they lie to us about our freedom</br>   tfw spent $500 in a strip club last night <br><br>If only adelaide had a decent massage parlor scene.</br></br>  <br>If you want a happy ending just locate the place online and go there. Ask for a message, they will collect an room fee, and when they lead you to a room take all your clothes off and lay face down on the table. The girl will enter the room and see you disrobed and understand what you want. Just follow the girls lead. <br><br>If you want sex do this:<br><br><br><br><br>These are girls at work. You should be less concerned with them and more concerned with it being raided.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it's really obvious where the brothels are and I'm pretty sure there is some kind of geographical zoning for where brothels and the likes can go. As a rational being would suspect it doesn't have "BROTHEL" writen on it. Normally has "massage parlour", or a neon open sign that go up some shady stairs or something</br>  Are there any in San Diego that you know of??  <br>If you are willing to spend $500 their is most certainly a girl willing to service you. In the US you can fuck a (not all but probably 40% of them) stripper for less than $300. Obviously not during the night shift because they busy fleecing guys like you. If you go to a strip club during the day shift and get a few lap dances the girl will exchange numbers and then you can call her to setup a visit to her place. usually for $200 you get vaginal.</br>  <br>anyone got premium that they want to share?</br>  Do they care if you have a small d  <br> strip club during the day <br><br>They aren't open during the day here.<br><br>Google found me a group of dudes who rate massage parlors in my city but there's no way to interpret quality.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>not OP, but I've been to many, many of these parlors and to be honest, they might not exist depending on where you live. I live in South FL, and they're absolutely everywhere here, but when I lived in the Midwest they were barely any.</br>  <br>You have $500 to drop in one night you should be able to locate your kind of place though trial and error. It isn't a cheap hobby. Overtime i go i regret spending money on service i can do myself, or ask my GF for. Usually i am just avoiding my GF's pussy because one hole gets boring.</br>  <br>No they are Asians and care only about the tip</br>  <br>One day you're going to get caught.<br>The girls that work there are likely Cambodian girls forced to do this by sex traffickers. The reality of all that human misery would prevent me from getting off.<br><br>And the cops usually make an example out of johns by posting their pictures / information on local news sites. <br><br>Also you don't make enough money to indulge so much.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Troof!</br>  <br>Where in the midwest? All major City's have these parlors. Asians export iPads and orgasms bro. <br><br>If you lived in the midwest 15 years ago it may have been harder to find, but if you know how to google you can find in any major city. I certainly agree their are more in south florida than in the midwest, but they are in the midwest.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Are you Jerry Seinfeld?</br></br>  <br>Me too..i like the variety without breaking up with my girl</br>  <br>Probably but i love it</br>  <br>They're not all like this.<br><br>I went to one were the chick spoke perfect engilsh and told me she's doing it for college money.<br><br>Also if you feel bad about it, use backpages.com majority of those girls are "selfmade"</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>no, they don't care. to share a personal piece of info, I was born with a dick disorder called hypospadias and I wound up having to have about 3-4 surgeries to correct the problem. needless to say, I'm not large myself, thanks to this birth defect and because my urethra had to be completely reconstructed, I have scars. No Asian chick has ever pointed and laughed, or said anything negative to me about it. Tip them $40 or so and you'll be fine.</br>  Do the girls laugh if I had a small dick  <br>dude i am too i been trying to quick. money is the big part of it for me,i have it down to once a month but i fiend for it alot. you just get HE or do you go for FS</br>  <br><br>US economic policy is the primary factor that is fueling world poverty today. Before the US it was european colonialism. <br><br>The least you should get out of US elites economically rapping the developing world is an affordable HJ.<br><br>Just because you are partaking in the service doesn't mean that you are the reason they have to participate. In order for you to afford a luxury such as a car, internet and running water most of the people in the world have to go without.

Yes, they definitely had them in Minneapolis, but very few and they were very, very discreet. Needless to say, they had none in Rapid City or anywhere in South Dakota, outside Sioux Falls. Nothing in comparison to what I have here in Florida. They're not discreet here at all. You walk in, get your massage and they start jerking your dick the minute you flip over. I've even have girls jerk me off while getting the table shower, and then jerk me again after the massage.</br></br>  <br>Haha yeah you are correct. I knew about Minneapolis having them, but i never been to SD and totally forgot about that shitty part of the country. You only have the deer to fuck up there.</br>  <br> I make 50k a year <br>How do you have time after your 12 hour walmart shifts to go to the parlors</br></br>  http://inex.cf\1  auafag here. just did this in sydney. my girl was early 20s chinese girl. amazibg massage, really hard and full body then she took off her clothes and gave the most amazing handjob i ever had. incredible d boobs on a tiny asian frame with perfectly straight butt long hair giving me this dirty fucking sidewaya gaze and all moaning and shit while she had a reverse grip working on my shaft while massaging my balls. 65 for the hour plus 50 tip. i slipped her an extra 50 just for being so fucking hot. couldnt believe that body!  <br>I prefer HJ.</br>  <br>LOL, only Indians fuck the dear there. I liked living there actually. The Black Hills are wonderful, but you'd have to go do Denver or Sioux Falls to get your cock jerked.<br><br>But dude, South FL is the place to be for asian massage parlors. they're fucking everywhere here.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm so jaded from these places I've considered asking some of my female friends for handjobs for money</br></br>  <br>Dallas Texas is a good area too. I lived in a $2.5k a month apartment and could walk to one. It was next to a dentist office in a medical complex. Very little shame when you don't even have to park out front and if anyone catches you they think you are walking to the Dr.</br>  <br><br>Im not op, or the guy you were responding to but nobody gives a fuck about poverty. If we werent raping the world someone else would be raping us. <br><br>Goddamn right they can go without so I can have my car, are you suggesting we should be equally poor?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I've always wanted to do this. I don't think it would go over well, but if a friend offered i would be in heaven.</br>  <br>Oh yeah, I bet Dallas is every bit the equal of South FL. LOL, the one I go to the most is in between a State Farm insurance office, and an OBGYN clinic.</br>  <br>Im in S Fl too i know there all over the Place. Im lucky tho im Happy with just HE some times. I dont go FS alot.</br>  <br><br>what are you two afraid of? don't go if you're expecting a good massage though. you might get lucky and get one, but most of the time the massages are just a precursor the handjob, so don't expect a great back massage.</br></br>  <br>You missed my point altogether. I'm saying that avoiding sex workers because sex trafficking exists is pointless because if you gave a shit about the plight of others you would need to forgo other luxuries to end the economic situation that creates cheap international sex workers and related trafficking. Im saying drive your $50k truck to a parlor filled with Cambodian pussy and take your pick because we can live like kings, pharaohs and popes if you got the $.</br>  If you have a preference in women, is that something they cater to? Or do you just get what you get?  <br>I used to go all the time. I was saying i always wanted to ask a friend to fuck me for money. That is a high risk question though. People know you asked that and it can impact your ability to network and earn money in the future.</br>  <br>I only ever get a HJ too. I'm perfectly happy with that. I'm in WPB area. What about you?</br>  <br>I was the same way. But i went in for massage and on the flip she just start jacking it asking if i was ok i said yes and tip her 40. Just look on online how to act in there and your fine</br>  <br>ah, I got you now. asking friends for sexual favors is almost never a good idea. resist the urge.</br>  I really don't understand you people.<br>How fucking desperate are you to pay more than 200 dollars just for a fucking handjob from some 7/10 bitch. Pretty pathetic.</br>  <br> Is prostitution legal there? <br>Only in NSW, and only in brothels, no street stuff</br></br>  <br>I'm talking about from a friend not an MP I've been to plenty of MPs</br>  <br>no one pays that. usually only costs between $100-$120 max.</br>  <br>Who pays 200 dollars..? I pay around 100 bucks<br>This is easily spent from some idiot at a stripclub and gets nothing</br></br>  <br><br>We are impatient bro. Quite honestly I'm too busy to waste time working over a girl for sex when i can get it over with 3 hours worth of compensation. Also I'm an introvert, so three hours salary for a guarantee beats fighting my autistic ways in a bar. Plus i have a GF so fucking girls form a bar is more akin to cheating.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;628983247   <br>I love in Miami area but drive up for work up to pompano beach. Some time i head to WPB no much tho. I use rupmaps to find places. Sometime backpage but i try not to use it. i only check out a place on bp when it not listed on rubmaps. but if you want HE only then never go to latin one it also FS and get mad if you ask for HE</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;628983247 <br>MODS MODS MODS</br>  Honest question. Is cheating worth it? I've been cheated on in every relationship and I've cheated once myself but that was an eye for an eye thing. I just got into a relationship with a girl that makes me very happy but I'm not that attracted to her physically.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;628983247 <br>My kind of /b/</br>  <br>this is the reason i stop going to stripclubs.</br>  <br> Is cheating worth it? <br>If you have integrity, no.<br>If you're about to dump your partner for a new one but haven't made it official, maybe.<br>If you don't care, well, cheat away.</br></br></br></br>  <br>MODS MODS MODS</br>  <br>I feel like getting a a HJ at an MP is not cheating it's just... an extended massage. I have a girl yet I don't feel that bad when I go pay for something and not swapping fluids. Emotional cheating is way worse IMO</br>  <br>Thanks brah</br>  <br>interesting. thanks for the advice. I've never been to a latin joint before anyway. I only ever go to Asian parlors. Been to about 3-4 of them here in WPB area. Most of the girls seem to be older, which I don't always like, but they're much better at jerking cock than the younger girls I've had. The older women are fucking cock jerking pros! they could draw cum from the balls of a 90 year old.</br>  <br>well, what are you gonna do m8?</br>  <br>want to bet that you were not the first person to "break" her in?<br><br>asian girls know every trick in the "I am a virgin" book. It[s almost like they can bleed on command.</br></br></br>  <br>its not cheating if you are paying for it</br>  <br>If you feel you can't live without her and truly care for her then yes. if not then whatever if your gonna cheat this is the best way. you go in and out just cash they dont go to your house or call you. no way she will find out unless she follows you or you give her std</br>  <br>It's legal in all states</br>  <br> but I'm not that attracted to her physically. <br><br>Women don't have much worth valuing bro. If you are not attracted she would need to offer a great deal of service to you in order for the relationship to work:<br><br>Cook a good nutritious dinner at least 4 days a week.<br><br>Clean the bathroom, kitchen and sweep the home.<br><br>Maintain a garden during the appropriate seasons to provide healthy food for meals. <br><br>At least give an HJ on demand. <br><br>Not say a goddamned word about anything i do. <br><br>if she does all of these then it might be worth it. You show me the hottest girl on earth and ill find you the man who is bored fucking her, but if YOU aren't attracted you better get a lot out of her. Your wife partially determines your status which can impact your future success in life.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yes but don't tell your fucking friends when you're drunk. chances are they will spill the beans if they're drunk and emotional around your girlfriend.<br><br>also like some other anon said avoid emotional cheating</br></br></br>  <br>Just go Bali, 200k rupee for 18+ 700k for under 18</br>  <br>You're right, I checked on wikipedia. It used to be just brothels legal in NSW but that was years ago. Nevermind...</br>  <br>I have never seen a parlor where all girls are 20-30. There usually is one on that range and the rest are 40+. <br><br>Not that there is anything wrong with that, still totally worth it. You come out feeling like a king</br></br></br>  mfw this thread has devolved into femanons pretending to be bros posting advice  <br>$20-70?. hmm...</br>  <br>There's that many in South FL? I lived for close to 20 years in Miami/Hialeah and never saw 1 parlor.<br><br>Can you tell me where to find them?</br></br></br>  <br><br>They weren't your friends if they imploded your spot bro. They were probably wearing your girls self worth so they could get a shot at her boring snatch. They did you a favor in the end.</br></br>  <br>overpriced cunts with aids sent from 3rd world countries</br>  <br>Plus flights and shit over there. But if you want good food, relax and fuck underage bitches then go Bali</br>  <br>Yeah, but how much for flight and hotel ?</br>  <br>fucking gook hater wood shot that ugly cunt in faggot face</br>  Do they care if you're a fat slob?  <br>Not to mention travel time. I pay due to impatience (and a little bit to feel ashamed of myself). If my time wasn't valuable i would just fuck ugly girls for free to get the same amount of shame and self hatred.</br>  if they wern't my friend before they definately arn't now. currently in court after I found out he slept "in the same bed but nothing happened man" the same night he told her and we broke up"<br><br>I broke his jaw and he's suing me for fucking assault the fucking faggot</br></br>  <br><br>They want your money, but you better be clean and smell good if you want service with a smile.</br></br>  <br>Flights from perth in aus like $500-600 return and for a good hotel/villa like 150-200 a night or if you want a hostel type thing, $20</br>  <br>you lived down here for 20 years and you never saw them??? you obviously were not looking because just about every parlor labeled "asian massage" will offer you these services. go look on rubmaps or naughtyreviews</br>  <br>Like 1k for ticket. Really ?</br>  <br>to<br><br><br>yeah he did but I couldn't see through the rage.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Worst story bro. I'm not even drunk or high and i feels now. good luck.</br>  <br>In Hialeah not many but north miami every other block. go to rubmaps</br>  <br>thanks. I envy you. I am drunk most of the time now</br>  <br>No 500-600 return means flights there and back......</br>  <br>So you are paying $1k+ and losing at least 48 hours of your life. I'd rather pay the $120 and stay local. I must not be attracted to kids because that hardly seems worth the trouble.</br>  <br>I have literally wasted thousands of dollars on hookers, would i do it all the same if i had my time again? Fucking oath cunt.</br>  <br> literally <br>why do you do this</br></br>  Hello guys,<br><br>Mark Zuckerberg here, i also found my current wife at a massage parlors.</br></br>  <br>would make sense for that jackoff to marry a professional handjobber.</br>  <br>I been with Costa rica 4 times each trip cost 1,500 total for 5 days and fuck like 3-4 girls a day. worth it. plane there is like 200-300 rooms are 60 - 80 at day.</br>  <br> basically brothels waiting to be raided. <br><br>That's my biggest fear. Go in for a simple tug job and end up on the six o'clock news as someone who supports the sex slave industry.</br></br></br>  <br>xD damn u r so relevant n funny anon</br>  <br>because he's highlighting that he's not using hyperbole?</br>  <br>be more of a beta pussy</br>  <br>how does that make sense, at all.<br><br>is the meaning of the word "literally" a mystery to you?</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah. I mean part of the fun is risking that shame of getting caught. I personally don't feel liberated afterward. I take solace in having the financial resources to waste on getting my rocks off, but it isn't something i want to be made public.</br>  <br>Asian girls no</br>  <br>What area you live in anon? I also live in south Florida and have heard that there is many but I'm to afraid to go look.</br>  <br><br>this is pretty accurate +/- $10 +/- condom +/- cupped balls +/- US (I've had the exact same experience in Japan without even speaking the language)</br></br>  <br>How would you go about finding one?<br><br>I live in Charleston SC, which is pretty stuck up and religious, but there is also a fairly large Filipino population here, and I could see the younger ones working in a place like that.</br></br></br>  <br><br>do you homework before you go to see if it is a place known to give happy endings and to see what the likely menu of services is. Each place will have it's own house rules. Many will be hand job only. Some will allow bj. some will allow fucking. It's not absolute with each girl, but you can get a feel for the place and know what they are not supposed to do or else they get fired.<br><br>Once you're at a place that you've read online offers a happy ending, you want to give her signals that you're OK and that you're here for the good stuff.<br><br>The easiest way to do that is to see if she lets you touch her legs during the massage. I do this fairly early on but not until after I've made some light conversation to put her at ease. "how long have you been in the United States?" "Do you like it here" "I'm glad I met you - what days do you work here so I can see you again".<br><br>Just start with very light touching. Read her body language. If she's totally comfortable, and even moves to make it easier to touch her legs, you're in good shape.<br><br>If she stiffens her leg and backs away so you can't touch it, a happy ending is probably not on the menu.<br><br>Once she lets you lightly touch her legs, you can let your hands roam. Lightly caressing her legs, moving up toward the ass.<br><br>Again, if she makes it easier for you and lets you get near her ass and then touch her ass, you've got a 95% chance of getting a happy ending.<br><br>After you flip from your back to your front, she will probably make the move, using body language to ask if you want a hand job, or she might say "what do you want?" If she says "what do you want" that probably means a blow job is an option.<br><br>I reply with motions instead of words. It's kind of an unwritten code that you keep the talking about sex acts to a minimum because that would be like evidence or something if you were a cop.<br><br>If she doesn't make the move, or if you want an upgrade, you can do something like point a finger to your mouth.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>there might be less but they are everywhere. I talked to one girl i always see what she tells me is most of the girls reason for doing it is. They ask the owner if they can get them to the us and the owner pays for everything but they need to work at the massage places until they pay there debits. so if you 70 for the massage 40 goes the the own 20 to there debit and 10 to them that why they do for thr tip to have money for other things or pay debits faster</br>  <br>this guys is right but i dont touch them while they are doing the massage i kinda feel bad. but alot of the times when they massaging your legs they will do your butt and rub across your ass and ask is this ok so that lets them know your down formore. try to talk to them they are always in fear your a cop. and the more times you see one girl the better it will get.</br>  <br><br>continued<br><br>If she doesn't make the move, or if you want an upgrade, you can do something like point a finger to your mouth to show you want a blow job.<br><br>If you go that route to ask for a blow job, she may ask you how much you're willing to spend. Cheap bastards think they should get a blow job for $60 or $80, but if I get real sex from a woman including a blow job, I start with a $100 tip. <br><br>Blow jobs: covered or uncovered? many places will want to do saran wrap blow job. They don't keep condoms on the premises because that would be evidence of prostitution if they get busted, so they have saran wrap which they will wrap your dong in. I HATE saran wrap blow jobs. it's not as form fitting as a condom so it's 100 times worse than having a condom on. In rare cases you might be able to get her to start without the wrap but put it on for the finish.<br><br>Most places are going to be hand job only. The options you may or may not get are 1) you get to touch her, play with her tits, maybe rub her pussy over clothes 2) you may get some access allowed under her clothes 3) she may take off her top, more rarely get completely naked 4) she may let you lick and suck her tits 5) she may let you play with her naked pussy. probably won't let you put your fingers in, but might. 6) she may allow extras like sucking your nipples while she jerks you<br><br>Some places offer BJs but not full sex.<br><br>A very few rare places offer full sex. Same as I said with a blow job, I start at $100 tip for that. I don't go much higher since I can get an hour at a brothel for $160 total and get whatever the fuck I want for an hour, so when they start asking for $200 on top of a $60 house fee just to get 5 minutes of fucking, I pass on that.<br><br>In our area, when I say "brothel", I mean apartment whores. You to go an apartment that has one or more whores and you get an hour of service. They advertise as "massage" and that might be part of her routine to start with a massage.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>holy shit, man.<br><br>you have honed this to a science.<br><br>i dont want to pay for a handjob from some random asian, but if it was my thing, then this looks legit to me.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Good luck</br>  <br><br>it all depends on what you're comfortable with and how much information you know going in.<br><br>I don't wait for them to rub my ass, or accidentally brush it to test me out. I feel like it is actually a bit rude since it puts the burden on them to decide if you're a cop. If they're wrong and you are a cop, they go to jail. But there's about a 0.00001% chance your massage "therapist" would be a cop decoy. So it's not a risk on your part like it is on their part. That's why I think the polite thing is for you to make the first subtle move to let them know it's OK to proceed.<br><br>You can touch their legs in a real subtle way. Easiest access is going to be to her calves which isn't like grabbing her tits. You can start by literally just touching. The first touch is going to tell you everything you need to know about whether you can keep touching.<br><br>If she allows me to touch her leg, I might say something to put her at east like "you have very soft skin".<br><br>That goes to light caressing... and if she allows, I start roaming, not covering too much new territory each time.<br><br>You'll get a feel real quick if it makes her uncomfortable. The ball is in her court. All she has to do is take a step back or sideways to stop you from touching.<br><br>What you'll find is, the guys who say "I didn't get a happy ending offered" or "I must be putting off the vibe of being a cop" are the ones who don't take the first moves to let them know you're ok. <br><br>I've never been denied service at a place that's known to give service.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>oh....random asian women are my thing!! Big Time.</br></br>  <br>think i know old vietnamese and other asian women too well.<br><br>theyd as soon cut your cock and balls off and fry it in a wok, as they would jack it off if the money was right.<br><br>YU WONT JAK COK?<br>OK<br>TUENTY DOLLA!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Aren't there any whores in Deadwood? Seems like there should be a few there.</br>  <br>High Five for Asian Girlfriends.</br>  I like escorts and parlors because they help me resist the urge to rape  <br><br>the vietnamese are the worst of the asian massage parlor whores.<br><br>they are much more mercenary. they will want more money for really standard stuff. I've know viet whores to ask for $150 for a hand job at a massage parlor and think that's actually appropriate when the local going rate is $40 - $60.<br><br>On the other hand, the viet places around here are more likely to include full service (fucking). But the viet whores will bitch and moan the whole time. Two minutes in they start saying shit like "Are you done yet?" 'You go too long" "not so fast/hard!"<br><br>Chinese, Taiwanese, Singapore, Japanese, Korean are all 1000 times better than the viet whores.<br><br>They are almost never jaded, rather compliant within their comfort zone - don't push their personal boundaries/rules and they'll treat you well and be very nice about it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>do you sometimes rape anyway?</br></br>  <br>Thankfully no but it cross my mind then i call up a escort or go to a parlor</br>  <br>ive never even been to a massage parlor but i agree completely.<br><br>shit thing for me though, is i am completely unattracted to asians.<br><br>they all look like generic clones of an undifferentiated fetus to me. no sexual appeal whatsoever. when they open their mouth to talk broken english, it gets even worse.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> she wasnt a whore  <br> she was a virgin and i broke her in <br><br>you get hand jobs and maybe blow jobs from her at an asian massage parlor<br><br>AND<br><br>she gives hand jobs and maybe blow jobs all day long at work<br><br>AND<br><br> OP says "she was a virgin" <br><br>SMH.......</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There are mexican/suramerican parlors and polish/russian parlors around here, if you know which is which you can enjoy many flavors. I got a bj at a mexican one for $60 total and got a 2 girl nude massage for 100 there too.</br>  I'm going to visit Ireland soon and I heard that escorts are legal there. Any advice?  <br>Inadvertently went to one once. We thought it was a strip club. My friend ended up paying for me, as I said I wasn't even interested, but he didn't want me to bail (he's autistic as fuck).<br><br>The owner/pimp was a massive greasy wop fagget who insisted we pay $80 for a massage and $40 as a tip for "da goils". I left my fucking underwear on because I got some crusty nigress who gave a shit massage, had hands like sandpaper, and the towel I was on smelled like mildew.<br><br>1/10 they played the Forrest Gump soundtrack in the background</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> shit thing for me though, is i am completely unattracted to asians. <br><br>you must have spent your formative years on /b/.<br><br>I swear, there are several really fucked up things about the local culture here. I don't mean /b/ being fucked up, that's why I come here, that's why we all come here, <br><br>BUT<br><br>there are two things in particular that are commonly accepted as universal truths on /b/ that just aren't in the real world<br><br>1) pussy lips are a bad thing. "oh man, that meaty pussy is wrecked. she's a fucking slut". aint how it works. aint real life. but seriously,the only "desirable" pussy for /b/ is one look like a 10 year old's. You even see people posting shit like "there's nothing uglier than looking at a pussy after you've fucked it" because these fucking /b/tards actually believe this shit and actually see nothing wrong with them saying they hate looking at pussy then they call you the fag for pointing out what a faggot they are for hating pussy all because of these "that meaty pussy is wrecked, she's a whore" posts.<br><br>2) this common, local, /b/ theme that asian women aren't sexy and are to be avoided. Sorry anon if that's just your personal taste, and you're entitled to it, but I do see this really bizarre anti-asian woman thing here on /b/ that just doesn't exist in the Real World. Quite the opposite.<br><br>&lt;/soap box&gt;</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>LOL when anon leaves his underwear on at a massage parlor and says his FRIEND was the autistic one.</br></br>  <br> had a small dick <br><br>If it's grown then they won't laugh. if you've got no penis, they'll laugh.</br></br></br>  <br> Do the girls laugh if I had a small dick <br><br>No, that would almost never happen. They're there to give sex to make money. You're there to spend your money to get sex. <br><br>  Win - Win <br><br>They don't care if you're ugly, old, fat or have a small dick. In fact, the asian whores in particular prefer a small dick because the big ones hurt their tight little pussies, especially since they're fucking all day long. <br><br>They see small dicks as a bonus because it means their cooter won't be worn out when they clock out and go home.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> and when she comes home from work i ask for a massage she says poor me i go to work and massage and i have to massage my boyfriend at home <br><br>and what do you do for a living, Anon? <br><br>Let's just say you work for the department of transportation filling in potholes in the street all day.<br><br>How would you feel if every day you got home she said "I hit pothole at end of street. I don't like hitting pothole. Go fix now for me"<br><br>Hmmm?<br><br>Yeah, that's what I thought.<br><br>BTW, do you make her use mouthwash after she gets home from work to get the taste of other guy's cum out of her mouth before she kisses you?<br><br> is there enough mouthwash in the world for that? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>High Five for asian whores</br></br>  <br> They don't care if you're ugly, old, fat or have a small dick. <br><br>caveat to that: they won't let it show. who knows what they say to their whore workmates when you leave or what they tell their cuck-husband at home that night. but that doesn't matter. While you're there with them they will give you the appropriate customer service and be perfectly nice and not make fun of your small dick, big belly or ugly face. They'll even tell you how big you are, call you "supa-man".<br><br>Sometimes in these whore review sites guys talk about how the whores love them because they're so handsome...or others worry they won't get service because they aren't handsome or well hung.<br><br>The whores only care about one thing. $$$$$$$$. That's it. If you've got the green, they've got the pussy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I remember a thread a few years back that posted a link to some site that shows parlors by zip code and had reviews on which ones do happy endings and which ones are shut down now, ect. anybody have it?  <br>There's a bunch dude, look at rubmaps or backpage</br>  <br>im 35 and oldfag.<br><br>i dont know where you got the idea that asian woman aren't popular here.<br><br>this whole fucking site was an angry weeaboo haven.<br><br>there are constantly, to this day, asian nude threads everywhere.<br><br>ive never been into asians.<br><br>as i said, they look like clones of undifferentiated fetuses to me. absolutely zero sexual appeal unless their body is busty, and even then id just as soon paper bag them as look at them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>feminists probably got wind of it and shut it down.<br><br>cant have men taking away the power of vagina from empowered women, can we.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm 51 and oldfag. kek<br><br>Your personal taste is to not like asian women so all you see are the Asian threads.<br><br>My personal taste is to love asian women so all I notice are the butthurt little boys saying things like "she's really cool and everything, but she's asian" and then the other butthurt little boys go on and on about how bad that is so obiously he has to ignore or or how he should still go for it even though it's obviously so awful that's she Asian.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why would you bother in San Diego when you can get the trolley down to Tijuana and go to the Hong Kong Club or Adelitas, and finger bang a bunch of hot strippers for $1 a time, before choosing one to fuck for like $30?</br>  <br><br>because Tijuana</br></br>  <br>I had my best luck with this on monday nights durring football ( american ) season. <br><br>The places were dead. $100 bucks later and there was sex in the champaign room. <br><br>A hood sign is when a stripper grabs your hands and shoves them on her tits while grinding you, or even better when she slides one of your hands down her panties.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tj isnt bad just dont get drunk. It isnt juarez</br>  <br>Where?</br>  <br>what can i say.<br><br>im not attracted at all to asians.<br><br>its just how it is and has always been for me.<br><br>i barely even recognize them as the same species.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>why would you pay to finger bang a stripper?<br><br>this makes no sense.<br><br>shouldn't she be paying you?<br><br>its not like women go to male strip clubs to jack off cocks for free.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Cross border. <br> Taxi's lined up 20m from border. <br> "Red light district please Pedro" <br> Fuck hot strippers for pocket change, whilst drinking cheap beers. <br> Taxi's lined up outside club. <br> Cross border back to US.  <br><br>Fucking awesome time, and the only beaners you even have to speak to are taxi drivers and hookers.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>all over.<br><br>I went to one near little Italy. Cedar and Ash. Thai Massage.<br><br>Got a blow job with cum in mouth. she offered full service but I wanted cum in mouth and got it. I think the house fee was a little steep, maybe $70. she didn't want $100 for the BJ but agreed to it when I told her it was all I had.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not so much that you're paying to finger bang her, but tip them a dollar whilst they are dancing on stage, and you can do what you want - finger bang, suck their titties, whatever - as long as you don't mind being watched by a bunch of horny Mexicans.</br>  <br>Top LOL</br>  <br>I'm British and white as hell. I went there, fucked strippers and got drunk as fuck. No problems, no trouble.</br>  <br> Thai Massage. <br><br>sorry, Cedar and Union. Right at the intersection. You can't miss it.<br><br>Funny thing was that I don't know the San Diego scene and couldn't find any reviews so I'm reluctant to try a new place and possibly just waste my money.<br><br>I was checking it out as I walked by wondering if they did or didn't give happy endings when this asian whore comes outside, in broad daylight, wearing lacy sexy lingere to empty the trash. Just walked right outside in "come fuck me underwear". <br><br>So I knew they were going to be giving happy endings, at least.<br><br>I went back the next night and had the experience in my previous post.<br><br>I looked it up on google maps. it's at 610 Union street on the corner with Ash.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>more power to you man.<br><br>I'm rich so I don't need to risk my life, even just a tiny little bit, by going into a mexico border town where gringos do get killed from time to time.<br><br>I don't like throwing my money away on overpriced strippers and whores, but I can happily pass on super bargains from Tiajuana.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fair play. I'm not rich, and had an awesome time. If I lived in SD, I'd do it all the time. Each to their own.</br>  <br><br>"Outside of poverty levels, crime statistics may be the most visceral indicator of the huge divide between San Diego and Tijuana, both cities of 1.3 million.<br><br>On the U.S. side of the border, crime rates are low, with San Diego and Chula Vista ranking among the safest cities of their size in the country.<br><br>It’s a bad year on the homicide front in San Diego if more than 60 people are murdered. In Tijuana, a hot spot for bloody violence during the drug wars of the late 2000s, relief comes when the annual number of homicides dip below 1,000."<br><br> 20 times more murders in Tijuana than San Diego each year <br><br> I'll pay $160 to fuck a San Diego whore instead of saving $130 to risk my life </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>epic story, though</br></br>  <br>I used to go to massage parlors for about 3 to 4 years. Loved them and had somw good times. It was way cheaper than strip clubs/hookers.<br><br>Coolest experience was this sexy milf asian....didnt even ask she just put a condom on me and fuck me food. She came too.<br><br>Most the time (however) you get old, fat asians who want to give you handys. So i got tires of the crap shoot.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this</br>  <br><br>we're lucky to have a huge variety of massage parlors to choose from around here.<br><br>there are some really skanky places with only fat old asian women, but those are to be avoided<br><br>we have plenty of places with hot, young asian girls, and then everything in between<br><br>I do find the older and uglier asian women tend to give better service and more options. It's the MILFs who know they have to compete that give the blow jobs and let you cum in their mouth or who will fuck you silly when the others only give hand jobs.<br><br> God bless America </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wouldn't argue against those facts mate. No doubt Tijuana can be a very dangerous place, but as I said, you can literally hop in a taxi outside the border, get out straight outside the club, and do the same on the way back. Also, to be honest I enjoyed the potential edginess of the situation. As a first world tourist from the UK, it was kind of a thrill. I went twice in 2 days.</br>  <br> She came too. <br>no.<br><br>she didnt.<br><br>but aside from that, hooker threads are always great in one sense:<br><br>rarely do i see such broship. <br><br>i think all men should fuck a hooker now and then. its basically the equivalent of male sexual liberation from the control of pussy and seems to do wonders for not having fascist/tumblr attitudes about sex and sexuality of males.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm from Chula Vista, and this sounds like some made up Dont-spend-your-money-outside-Ameri<wbr>ca bullshit statistics that scared white people tell themselves to feel better at night.</wbr></br>  <br><br>I hear you and salute your epic time.<br><br>I go to San Diego several times a year. I might just take up your advice one time. I honestly never gave it a thought of how to get to the strip clubs and was definitely never going to consider driving there myself. But since you laid it out so well, I just might find myself in TJ late one drunken night.<br><br> I don't know whether to thank you or curse you, BritAnon. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>this</br></br>  <br><br>the facts are the facts.<br><br>do what you want with the information, but them's the facts.<br><br> you're entitled to your own opinion, not your own facts </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Seriously bro. Just jump in a taxi and ask for the Hong Kong Club. You'll definitely thank me.</br>  <br>Oh, also, as a non-American, I had to queue at the border on the way back for about an hour with a bunch of Mexicans, which is a fucking ball ache, but if you're American you get fast tracked past the beaners.</br>  <br>you dont have a "parlor" addiction. you have a sex addiction</br>  there are loads of massage parlors in NYC but which ones jerk me off and what are their rates?  SoCal here. Thread is accurate. Local rate is $100 for massage and HJ<br>$150 for FS<br>FS places charge $50 / half hour and have locking doors, with a bunch of phoney medical equipment around. <br><br>The jack shacks are less hidden, have curtains, and charge around 55-60/full hour . <br><br>Also, mostly Thai. I've seen some milfy latinas if you're into that.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Op here I did it ... Just finish my session paid 120 for fs..she was Chinese and 24 and very cute .. She had kegel grip pussy  <br>a handjob is not sex.</br>  <br> &gt;I don't know whether to thank you or curse you, BritAnon. <br><br>do you fuck the strippers on the premises in a back room or something or do you have to pull them out of there and get a hotel or whatever?</br></br></br>  What shoes do you wear /b/?<br><br> pic related: I have an actual sense of style </br></br>  Bump  <br>The 90s called, they want their shoes back</br>  <br>Bump</br>  TNs lad  <br>hey my shoes are sweet</br>  ITT: Shoes niggers love  Waiting for them to release on Saturday, OP.
