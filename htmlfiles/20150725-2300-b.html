That's what another anon said</br>  Married slut when she used to share her pics  kerrinicole30 <br><br>Recently got married but will still send me nudes as she's a submissive slut <br><br>Do what you do best /b/ro's</br></br></br></br>  What a kik slut matching this description <br> big tits <br> not fat <br> actually cute <br> hasn't sent nudes yet </br></br></br></br>  Beast  <br>don't know what's gayer u for pretending to b a girl or that niggas small ass dick</br>  <br>they're both off the charts</br>  Anyone got more of these? Good way for nudes  Wut the fuck is funny about this hoe? Anybody who goes to see this fat dyke should be shot to save our species from stupidity. But I digress, why do you think people find her "hilarious"?  <br>I'm getting sick of her shit tbh. She just looks more and more like a pig by the second to me.</br>  <br>Because she makes comedy shows and movies and those are supposed to be funny.</br>  <br>Why is she even on our radar? Her jokes are legit worse then any other female comic and tasteless, what magic dick did she suck???</br>  <br>Comedy Central's CEO</br>  <br>She probably sucks a mean cock, that's how she got so popular.</br>  <br>Because there aren't a lot of funny women, so when a women who's sorta funny pops up girls make em famous.</br>  <br>LMAO countless people do that, hers suck, "my pussy this, my pussy that" stop for faint laughter "I suck so much dick" crowd goes wild, like wtf? Is that even comedy?</br>  <br>Still not popular with me, where's the line?</br>  As an ex-comic, she's by far one of the best female comedians of our time. Find a female comedian as good as her and I'll change my opinion. Feel free to &gt;&gt; me and I'll reply.  <br>Katherine Tate is actually hilarious. Leagues ahead of this fat fucker.</br>  <br>She's a Jew. Comedy Central's CEO is a Jew. The writer/producer of her new movie is a Jew. Her cousin, also a Jew, is a powerful U.S. Senator.</br>  <br> Ex-comic <br><br>You obviously weren't funny so why should we trust your judgement</br></br></br>  <br>Tig norato</br>  <br>You don't have to understand it, OP. You just have to deal with it.</br>  I need to research, like key and peel are hella funnier. Their shit is getting weak though and I think ita cause they're like, welp, this white bitch ain't even tryin and she already got two seasons and a mothafuckin movie. I wouldn't be surprised if they quit and comedy central becomes shit.  <br>DAMN dude.</br>  <br>This</br>  <br>Top kek</br>  <br>I aint bovvered</br>  <br> Tiny Fay <br> Amy Poehler <br> early Kristen Wigg <br> Sarah Silverman </br></br></br></br>  <br>Savage</br>  Liz limppussy is hella funny on roasts and takes it like a real women, id rather her have a show  <br><br><br>At least Katherine Tate is not a filthy kike hag</br></br></br>  <br>www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=TQQ7ZZytfsQ<wbr></wbr>  [ ]<br><br>cringe level bad, regret that I looked her up</br></br></br>  <br><br>I was the youngest writer on a handful of Australian comedy shows, not a lot of work but I got it out of a huge scene of people that never bothered to learn the basic formuli.<br><br><br><br>I personally know Tig, Even she would say you're wrong. Her relative material is EXTREMELY limited because of her unique situation (lez-cancer). This means she's unable to broaden her jokes believably. This limits her originality on most subjects that other comedians can pick up and use rather quickly and easier.<br><br><br><br>Tina Fey/Amy Phoeler are both owned by NBC they don't write a word that comes out of their mouth, also neither were stand ups both were improv kiddies... basically talentless and desperate.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;lists of overrated female comics, but worked hard to be overrated because they're mildly amusing </br>  <br><br>Same with Kristen wigg<br><br>Sarah Silverman is a winner though but not as good as Amy. Her shock comedy is similar but black something that was quickly outdated and now can't be pulled off as well.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Dubs don't lie.</br>  <br> I grew up the only jew in my town <br> Instead of calling me amy shumer the kids would call me amy jewmer <br><br>HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHH<wbr>AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH<br>AHAHAHAH<br>AHAHHAHHHAHAHAHHA</br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rosanne Barr</br>  <br>wow she actually is bad, I thought it was just 4chan being edgy misogynists but her material is garbage</br>  <br><br>Not in our time. She was great as a stand up in her just before she got famous though. seriously if you can find that stuff, you'd love it. After that she got lazy. Still a legend.</br></br>  <br> former ausi comedy writer that follows a formuli <br> calling someone talentless and desperate </br></br>  4chan is a healthy dose of misogyny, because we know when "equality" is really "talentless but good at sucking dick"  <br>God awful, just like the song.</br>  17:30<br>WhatÂ´s your name? Graison?<br>*audience laughter*<br><br>literally what?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>...Was neither talentless or desperate. I got a lot of offers. tbh it wasn't the life I wanted. Once you know what you're doing it get's boring and art isn't worth doing bored. The reason I got bored was also because of what jokes TV wanted... basically really safe shit. I was really good at shock because I liked it but the only people that would pay me for it were comedy clubs. I liked writing more than performing.</br></br>  <br>But, in her prime, leagues better than Schumer.<br>Ellen Degeneres is a similar example</br></br>  All of her jokes are just "hey girls.........vagina am i right hahahahahahahahaha......hey girls .....clit am i right hahahaha" fuking disgusting miss piggy jew cunt.  <br> female comedian <br>that's an oxymoron if I've ever heard one</br></br>  <br> she's by far one of the best female comedians of our time <br>That's like saying, "That one crippled kid doesn't fall out of his wheelchair as much as the other crippled kids do." Women are shit at comedy.</br></br>  <br>Kek<br>I'm telling you, she's literal shit, she must spray the whole audience with some good OG bud cause there's no way a real person would laugh</br></br>  <br> I was the youngest writer on a handful of Australian comedy shows <br>Which shows?</br></br>  <br><br>I agree on both accounts! ellen was fucking brilliant as a young stand up, I studied the shit out of her and David Spade when I was learning the ropes.</br></br>  <br>defeated that cunt with logic<br><br>cunts have weaknesses against logic</br></br></br>  <br> there are no dark/shock comedy shows <br>Lolok</br></br>  I would hit it then quit it  <br><br>I think she's funny. do all people need to agree? I have never cared what you find funny, and I don't intend to start caring now. go away.</br></br>  <br>The League of Gentlemen was deadly</br>   <br><br>Don't know if you'll remember them (depending on your age) Rove Live, Good News Week and a few others but not full time, I was full time on these two and I was 18 at the time.<br><br><br><br>Not in Aus, not any good ones that were open to any writers other than the creators. ie. Wilfred (the original) I had SOOOOO many ideas for that show, they weren't interested in punch ups grrr.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You serious? If you think Sarah Silverman is funny then there's literally no hope for you.</br>  <br>No, are you retarded?? I want to know WHY people think she is funny, why do you think she is funny?? God, even her fans get defensive automatically</br>  <br><br>Sarah Silverman was a good writer. Don't listen to this dipshit,</br></br>  <br>Agreed</br>  <br>911 confirms it</br>  <br> was <br><br>Also singing songs about your shit is low hanging fruit. Her segments go on entirely too long and lack depth. She can't trasition worth a damn either. Every moderately famous comedian has their gold material but i find her specials desperate and too self indulgent.</br></br></br>  <br><br>you didn't ask the question in those terms.<br><br>Why is she funny? She does sketch comedy in which the premises are semi-unique to unique, and she jokes about subjects that amuse me.<br><br>Again, is there a reason why we should agree?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Welp, this is probably going to die off with an answer of her being a Jew dick sucking period orchestrator. That's enough enlightenment for me. /b restore my faith in humanity... Ill probably never say that again, bye  <br><br><br> was <br><br>Also singing songs about your shit is low hanging fruit. Her segments go on entirely too long and lack depth. She can't trasition worth a damn either. Every moderately famous comedian has their gold material but i find her specials desperate and too self indulgent.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Women find her funny and men agree with them in order to keep from getting bitched at.<br><br>And women find her funny because most of them don't have a real sense of humor and just laugh at "outrageous" behavior that they would be too embarrassed to do themselves.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Saying bye at the end of the post <br>Are you a hormonal teenage girl</br></br>  <br><br><br>Sarah Silverman is still a strong comedian. She still practices her craft and has it mastered. if you don't believe me hers is actually one of the most visually inspiring careers of all time for any comedian male or female watch her earliest shit all the way to her newest. Mastery at it's greatest for comedy.</br></br></br>  <br>Wow, you must suck dick and are autistic. Congrats, even though you don't have to agree, you will continue to be fed shit by the Jews and sluts, enjoy your vagina comedy.</br>  <br>Are you autistic? Anon just said that she was as funny as Amy Schumer is, which doesn't mean much at all. Maybe anon thinks she is funny but that wasnt necessarily implying it.</br>  Who even is she  <br>I live in a world where shit don't end untill you say bye.. I had to do it, also stated into the distance as I typed it and credits were rolled</br>  <br><br>I'm off nice talking to you all fellow /b/tards.</br></br>  <br><br>Because she's tapped in the current phenomenon of "if you say I'm not funny, you're just a sexist pig!".<br><br>If anyone famous were to criticize her, all the PR departments in the world couldn't save them.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Your world's retarded</br>  I heard her new movie is a small sequel to Dark Knight.  <br>Bye person who is not funny anymore and an ex</br>  <br>fucken hate her</br>  <br>What's funny is she looks like Will Ferrell in drag.</br>  <br>Its autism. It strikes without a warning.</br>  <br>No she isn't. She, like the rest of females in comedy, try way too hard to be vulgar, and fail fucking hard.<br><br> AHUUUURRRR I FUCK BLACK MEN, HEY CHING CHONG MAN IN THE AUDIENCE... </br></br></br>  <br>She's so unfunny that a man in La. took it upon himself to bring awareness to this fact by shooting up a theater.</br>     hurr make a joke about my period and sucking black cock <br> im a successful comedian!!!!!!!1 </br>  <br> TFW when you take comedy seriously. </br>  <br>not her dumb cunt</br>      <br>Seconded. Also, she is a feminist pushing a morally bankrupt lifestyle by making it funny and cool.</br>  <br><br><br>Such Irish<br>much pale</br></br></br></br>  <br>Did you work on 90's GNW or late 00's?</br>  <br>Rove Live was kinda shit, but GNW was alright... Well that last incarnation of it was fair shit from what I heard, but the older GNW was pretty good.</br>  <br><br>Is that her?<br>Fuck. She was not joking about 90 mins make up sessions to make her look mediocre.</br></br></br>  <br>Can someone tell me why U.S comedy and media has a lot of Jews in it then?</br>  <br>murrica is Jew's bitch.</br>  <br>Agreed. She's a fat, nasty, unfunny, trying to ride someone elses coattails, cunt, butch, whore, slag.</br>  <br>I don't know anyone that finds her funny<br>I also don't now anyone who finds that centipede-eyebrowed, body of an anorexic 12 yo, dyke Cara Delvignoledges attractive either<br>But both bitches are being pushed and sold as the next big turd<br><br>I hate you America, hate your Jew run media, hate your sjws, hate that I know this people, and I hate the fact that I can't escape it</br></br></br></br></br>  I sense a lot of projection ITT.  <br>she is so unfunny, so terrible of an actor , that someone felt compelled to light up the theater</br>  <br>1) Throw away TV and computer<br>2) Move to a secluded cabin<br>3) ???<br>4) Profit</br></br></br></br>  Just watched about 6 minutes of the video posted. Seems like she's a comedian middle aged women would like because she's shocking to them.  I watched it. It wasn't funny. I didn't watch it again. <br><br>Why are we still talking?</br></br>  God, she's vile and comedy should be taking from a viewpoint that if you're not funny you don't deserve to be in tv, movie theaters or specials, I remember people used to get boo'd of stage, she's a perfect example of something that should've died in its own mother's womb  <br>R I P... Tonya Harding</br>  <br>it's only about 6:30 in the morning, eastern time for USA . Give them about 2 hours to start talking shit.</br>  I think her show and standup are funny<br><br>I'm also tired of her endless press and being held up as the ultimate everything for feminism.<br><br>if she were for real, beyond that one skit, she would stop wearing make up from now on and beyond the lonely cat ladies and angry borderline personality disorder chicks even other women would turn on her</br></br></br></br>    <br>Are you me?</br>  <br><br><br>two 911s confirm it.</br></br></br>  <br>Who gives a fuck? Stop shilling for this person.</br>  YES! BRITAIN IS STARTING TO WAKE UP!! <br><br>Get the Doctor out of the Tardis and HELP SHUT THIS HOE DOWN!!</br></br>  I wonder if she really said-- or was sorta misquoted with the "I'm 200lbs and can still catch dick"...or whatever that quote was.<br><br>Because she is smart enough to know that even the nastiest fat ho can find a guy desperate enough to fuck her. Probably even enough to keep her busy for a month....<br><br>captcha pic== RIBS ARE NOT STEAK</br></br></br></br>  <br> people make jokes about jews controlling media all the time <br> just think it's bait/trolling for a long time <br> currently doing course in film/tv production <br> all teachers are former industry specialists who are jews <br> all the jew students get extra special attention and treated as family by the staff <br> they get all the insider info and job opportunities before anyone else hears about them at all <br><br>YOU WARNED ME <br>I DIDN'T LISTEN</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I find it hilarious that comedy central can't find a legitimate funny woman and so they have to force this piece of garbage down viewers' throats.<br><br>Someone should really nuke hollywood, or all of Cali for that matter. Just a bunch of liberal kikes that will black out everyone and anyone that doesn't fit their agenda.<br><br>If you want an award you better make sure you have one or two token niggers and definitely some gays. Modern Family, the least funny show I've ever seen in my life, is getting Emmys while Always Sunny, a modern day Seinfeld, cant even get on a nomination<br><br>Fuck this world I'm gonna go shoot up and forget</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>While we're at it, is a shilling the same as a quid?<br><br>Is a pound the same as a farthing? <br><br>I don't get it. I tried google. They're stupid. I want a simple answer from someone in the UK.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>speaking of teh ghey...<br><br>retards who think anything that has "Fox" in the name is the exact same thing as Fox News. Fox affiliates are not Fox News. Fox Network is not Fox News. Fox Sports is not Fox News.<br><br>And even if they were... Fox Network had the gayest show in the history of ever, Glee.... So please STFU. <br><br>Not to mention Empire the OOH LOOK BLACK FO'K GOTS MONEY AND POWER TOO show</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know her comedy, so I don't know if she's actually funny or not, but Trainwreck seems like a really shitty movie that panders to slutty SJWs.</br>  <br>If you want to nuke something, please nuke SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH! If you ever get hold of a nuke, please program it to destroy MORMoN headquarters! They are the biggest cancer on Humanity!!!! DESTROY THEM AT ALL COSTS! And, Hey feds! Love ya.</br>  <br>Shilling - 1/20 of a pound<br>Quid - one pound<br>Pound - $1.55<br>Farthing - withdrawn; equal to a quarter of an old penny</br></br></br></br>  poor mans sweet dee. people just eat what jews are putting out, don't matter if its shit.  <br>I'll bring a full sized shampoo bottle to an airport next time I'm there. It's not a nuke but they'll at least treat it like one. Best I can do for you my friend</br>  <br>A quid and a pound are the same thing, <br>Quid is like how Americans say "buck" when they mean dollar...its just a nickname.</br></br>   female comedians = 100% trash <br> american comedians 99% trash <br>I don't watch much tv anymore, but everytime I put on Comedy Central I cringe like there's no tomorrow</br></br>  <br>You most likely don't understand the jokes.</br>  <br>had to reverse search who the fuck that is<br>feels good not being amerifat</br></br>  I think that she is a funny, intelligent woman, but I can't get over the way she responded to Jerry Seinfeld's "funny is funny" comment on JRE  How does this make you feel?  <br> nose ring <br>insta boner kill</br></br>  <br>confused. the left picture makes me assume the right picture will be a fat slob.</br>  <br> nose ring <br> tribal ear shit. <br>No thank you.</br></br></br>  WHY CAN I NOT HAVE SOMEONE SO CUTE IN MY LIFE!?!

Isn't he just the funniest guy around?! Oh my God.<br><br>I can almost see your pathetic overweight frame glowing in the dark, lit by your computer screen which is the only source of light in your room, giggling like a like girl as you once again type your little Banana thread up and fill in the captcha. Or maybe you don't even fill in the captcha. Maybe you're such a disgusting NEET that you actually paid for a 4chan pass, so you just choose the picture. Oh, and we all know the picture. The "epic" Banana guy, isn't it? I imagine you little shit laughing so hard as you click it that you drop your Doritos on the floor, but it's ok, your mother will clean it up in the morning. Oh, that's right. Did I fail to mention? You live with your mother. You are a fat fucking fuckup, she's probably so sick of you already. So sick of having to do everything for you all goddamn day, every day, for a grown man who spends all his time on 4chan posting about a fucking banana. Just imagine this. She had you, and then she thought you were gonna be a scientist or an astronaut or something grand, and then you became a NEET. A pathetic Bananafag NEET. She probably cries herself to sleep everyday thinking about how bad it is and how she wishes she could just disappear. She can't even try to talk with you because all you say is "I REALLY REALLY LIKE THIS PICTURE." You've become a parody of your own self. And that's all you are. A sad little man laughing in the dark by himself as he prepares to indulge in the same old dance that he's done a million times now. And that's all you'll ever be.</br></br></br>  <br>fkn lost</br>        lol! :p  <br>more captcha comics if anyone has em</br>        <br>that is great</br>        <br><br>lost hardcore.</br></br>  <br>My nerve gas brings all the boys to my yard.</br>        <br>how can we bring back the age of desu?</br>    <br>kek last</br>        <br>Spam 1+1ch or desu chan, eventually they get mad and spam.ylyl with desu, it happened a few months ago.</br>      <br>Dumb fuck shorted to ground and fried like a cartoon.</br>  <br><br>There is justice in the universe.

What's wrong with just living together for awhile?<br><br><br>Just go on ahead and do whatever you want, it wont matter in the long run. Everyone cheats anyway, sooner or latr. Be thankful you dont have kids. Without kids, you're still just practically dating. Kids mean something, they tie you two together, marriage is bullshit, just some papers. Its not too late.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm actually appreciating the advice. I just feel like debating points helps you reach a more informed solution, that's all.<br><br>If this back and forth annoys you, you're free to go.</br></br></br>  <br>Cheat on her but don't let her cheat on you. That's how real men roll.</br>  <br>Agreed. But the OP first post is not cucked. Knowing the difference will help you not be a faggot.</br>  <br>Try getting into 'murica being from south america</br>  peel the scab off it  <br>Real men can satisfy their woman. Slightly less than real men would just leave her. Pussies cheat.</br>  <br>Or just tell her, look here bitch I need to get laid and you aren't doing it for me.</br>  <br><br>Don't listen to the virgins saying divorce, if you love her and have a great life then you should recognize getting off isn't more important. All marriages or ltrs dip in sex, guess what - girls don't have a high sex drive - if they do they usually go slutmode hard. So appreciate what you do have, which is connection and partnership and don't be a faggot and cheat.<br><br>Source: 14 year relationship here</br></br></br></br>  Israfag here.<br><br>Let's face it, once you say you're Israeli on 4chan you're automatically an heavy orthodox Jew, Children killer, Kike, and cheap.<br>That's just proves how immature /b/ really is.<br><br> Israeli <br> Lefty  <br> Feeling bad for Palestinian children. <br> Atheist. <br> Thinks Palestinians deserve their own country. <br> Not Cheap. <br> Eats bacon. <br><br>Am I still a kike?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Yes, you fucking jew.  <br>It's /b/, everyone's either a kike or a fag, usually both</br>  ××××× ×¡×ª×× ×¡×ª×× ×× ××ª××  No. Jews are more valuable to humanity than arabs.

So on top of working out, i also ate much more on a general basis, every snack was like a sub meal, and I forced myself to eat twice the amount of food I really wanted to eat for the 3 main meals. Then there were protein shakes. Lifting took quite a bit of time for me to really notice any changes, I'd say about a month after first starting I felt much stronger than before.</br>  <br><br>I'm 5'11 62kg (136 pounds for the Americans), tried the GOMAD and eating like crazy and working out, put on a bit gradually, but literally miss a day or two and I'd lose it faster than it was being put on. I found it hard as well because I've never been a big eater, even when I've been quite active. GOMAD was surprisingly easier than force-feeding myself because I just find it impossibly hard to eat past my fill, and if I'm not actually hungry, I can't stand the thought of eating.<br><br>Anyways, I stopped because it became too much effort. I used to run half-marathons competitively and both my parents were my size when they were my age (they're not anymore, they look like normal humans now).

Even if I was bigger, I still wouldn't buy into the bro culture of knuckle dragging, chest thumping macho pabulum and I wouldn't start dressing like a closet-fag with a doucebag haircut, so what the fuck do I care about my body image? I've never actually cared about being small, and so rather than change that, I'll just surround myself with others who also don't care instead. No point playing the vapidity game.<br><br>A doctor once told me I had a metabolism and frame to die for, and that forcing myself to put on weight was moronic because there's nothing healthy about it, especially as far as "image" is concerned.

B-b-but what if girls laugh at my dick ? Get cut then, mutilate yourself for a bitch, you can still go full cuck mode.</br>  I'm British and cut, due to "medical" reasons when I was about 3. They had to cut my foreskin off and then add it to my shaft.<br><br>I hate it, especially now I've learnt it could of been avoided with other means.<br><br>I'm pretty sure this is a troll, being insecure about not being mutilated is bullshit.</br></br></br></br>  Hey Poster here I am from the U.S. So it isn't normal to be uncut  Uncut and no girl I've been with has ever complained so I've never cared  <br>WTF.

God, how stupid can you fucking be ?
