I'm a poorfag and I want a gaming pc but nothing too expensive (my current pc can't even run minecraft at stable 15fps).<br>Is this one good? <br>Also no buying parts because I'm paranoid it might not work and I'd waste money</br></br>  Build a PC you fag  <br>It's shit. Build your own pc and don't be an idiot.</br>  <br> even considering AMD <br><br>the price is amazing though, have to say that. but still. would invest in intel and nvidia hardware<br><br> inb4 the jews own intel and nvidia </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> buying a prebuilt </br>  I suppose this would be relevant then...<br><br>I'm looking to build a gaming pc on newegg, where should I start?</br></br>  <br>Op probably is a poorfag so amd would be best for him.</br>  <br>Start with a budget instead of looking at newegg first. Prices should not dictate how much you can spend.</br>  <br>He said he was a poorfag in the first sentence you retard</br>  <br>I don't know anything about what components I need and if they are compatible with eachother so i prefer to be safe</br>  <br>This shill brought to you by:Nvidia and Intel®</br>  <br>would prefer dual core i5 with hyper-threading to amd, still. Sorry, but even if anon is a poorfag, i want him to get something he won't regret the first time the tepmeratures start to rise.</br>  <br> tepmeratures <br><br>Stop posting and drinking champ.</br></br></br>  I want a PC for editing videos but I'm in the same situation. Don't want to waste the money  <br>http://www.logicalincrements.com/<br><br>here you go then faggot, also screwing the shit together is not to hard, there are tons on tuts on the web</br></br></br>  <br> temps <br>Just have a roomy case, a good heatsink and plenty of fans. That works for me with my fx 8350 and hd 7950</br></br>  <br><br>That's kind of hilarious. You want to avoid wasting money from buying parts so you're buying prebuilt? Very ironic. That will have the opposite effect, guaranteed. Have you never heard of an RMA? You won't loose money on the off chance you get a DOA part. Or buy from a solid local retailer so you can take it back directly to avoid shipping. If you think prebuilt system are guaranteed to work any more than building one yourself you delusional. Take it from a guy that fixes tech for living, I've seen countless prebuilt gaming and non gaming systems fail with days to months.</br></br>  <br>wait till you have atleast $1000 to spend</br>  <br>like I give a fuck, still can solve the cpatchas, can't be that bad.</br>  <br>Buy individual parts and ask a professional to assemble</br>  <br>Video card is hammered shit, processor is bearable, so dont get it</br>  <br>Firstly, not anon, but why hyperthreading? Do you know it's purpose and how anon is going to use it because I doubt you do.</br>  <br>have a qeustion for you and anyone who actually knows their shit. worok for IT company, rich ass motherfucker wants me to buil an uber pc for his retarded 12 year old son, this shit really needs to be fast as shit. was thinking maybe gbt980ti with 2-way SLI? Is it worth it? Would combine it with state of the art i7</br>  <br>the...price is amazing?<br>what.</br></br>  <br>tfw you'll never get to 3.4 gb unless you're gaming on a 4k screen<br><br>970 is a wonderful card for the money</br></br></br>  <br><br>Use DinoPC you fag, not shitty pc specialist.</br></br>  Delete system 32  <br>shadow of mordor hd textures 6gb vram required, star citizen 4gb+ vrram required, gta5 + mods 4gb vram required. keep dreaming faggot fanboy</br>  <br><br>Forgot pic.</br></br>  <br>including case, psu, OS? well, could be worse.</br>  <br><br>I'm currently using a EVGA 980Ti SLI setup and it's actually insane. Same performance as the glorious Titan SLI setup but with 6GB instead of 12GB. So unless he's rocking 3 4K monitors and the goal is just speed, then yes 980Ti SLI is supreme.</br></br>  <br> wonderful card for the money <br> i don't mind that Nvidia was deceptive <br> i'll never use 4GB <br><br>This is what Nvidiacucks tell themselves.</br></br></br></br></br>  ITT: Some faggot who wants a new 'gaming pc' so he can play Minecraft, but his parents don't want to buy him expensive hardware.  <br>little kid will rock the minecraft world, like no other.</br>  <br>My mistake on asking anons purpose, but the question still stands</br>  <br> 980 ti 2-way SLI / i7 <br> 12 year old retard uses it for minecraft <br><br>Stick an 960/290x and 8 core amd in there and call it a day</br></br></br></br>  <br>i just made<br>FX 6100<br>R9 285<br>4GB RAM<br>1TB<br>XFX 550W<br>sorta good 960 MB<br>some whatever case<br>for the same price</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  http://choosemypc.net/ i guess??  Bumping as a pull together a build on PCPartPicker.  <br>*I</br>  <br><br><br>as said, this guy is rich as fuck he doesn't give a fuck. at leat that's the way he communicated it. witcher 3, GTA V and shit will be stuff he will play<br><br><br>usefull info, thank you anon</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kek</br>  <br><br>Yeh see this would be the sensible persons reaction. But daddy is going balls to the wall for his spoiled bitch ass son, who will inevitably start another cancerous minecraft "gaming" YouTube channel. I'd say just do it for the experience of getting to build a 2-way 980Ti SLI setup. Would be fun to do.</br></br>  <br>no gaming with onboard graphics</br>  <br>Listen opfag, pre-built shit is never as fast, stable or as long lasting. They bottleneck those machines by cutting corners, using no-name mobo chipsets, slow ram, etc. And every fucking one of them ever made has a shitty made-of-tin taiwan power supply, which is responsible for converting the hardware-damaging AC current to the hardware-friendly DC current. Bad PSU's are by and far the #1 cause of system instability and early death.</br>  <br>seems like your forgot the fucking OS</br>  <br>i think you gonna build a pc for daddy xDD</br>  <br>intel p4 2.8<br>1 gb ram<br>windows 7<br>80 HDD<br>nvidia gf 6200 512 mb</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> buying windows  <br><br>kill yourself.</br></br></br>  <br>ill choose better hardware over an os any day<br>also,<br><br><br><br>but seeing as op has no knowledge about anything at all, maybe an os would be better. 100$ would fuck the build up though</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> invest <br>kek</br></br>  <br>yeah, whatever bro. at least I don't have to fuck around with cracks that stop working after a few weeks, only to have to look for another shitty as crack that prolly puty loads of other shit on your pc</br>  <br> ill choose better hardware over an os any day <br>you were trying to undermine my argument for the price, so I guess..you admitt to be wrong in this case? stay mad anon.</br></br>  <br>you must be advanced stupid, lol.</br>  <br> amd ever  <br> windows 8.1  <br>het</br></br></br>  <br>OP here<br>i have been reading your link and i think i would buy these parts<br> <br>GTX 960 graphics<br>i3 4160 cpu<br>212 Evo fan<br>ASRock H97 Pro4 motherboard<br>8gb ram<br>Antec HCG-620M power supply<br>HAF 912 case<br>would be around 600 euro, 100 more than expected but it seems fine<br> thoughts?(remember i'm very poor and it would take months to buy this one)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  AMD is actually alot better for the dollar, especially on a budget rig. Unless you're going for a high end PC.<br>That looks like better value than most prebuilts ive seen</br>  <br>You need to throw at least a mediocre GPU because that one is shit. And built it you faggot. Everything first into where it looks like it fits into.</br>  <br> being this fucking retard. </br>  <br>Yeah I had that problem, like a year ago. Gave me 30 days to provide a license #, didn't have it. Now I have a little thing in the corner that says this copy of windows is not genuine. If I open some, but not all, windows specific programs, such as calculator or photo viewer, it tells me that this copy of windows is not genuine. I click O.K. and continue. Everything still works, perfectly fine. Somehow, amazingly, even windows updates.</br>  <br>there,<br>6100<br>R7 265<br>XFX 430W<br>the rest is the same, didnt calculate exactly, might have some room<br><br><br>please, kill yourself. there, look up. happy now?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> download pirated copy of windows 7 or 8.1 <br> sign up for free windows 10 upgrade <br> install windows 10 next week, have legit windows <br> Profit! <br><br>Shits hard yo.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Listen Nigger, waste your fucking money, nobody cares. I've been using kmspico on my Windows 8 and 8.1 since it's reales, and LITERALLY never had it fail. I don't think you know what a "crack" is.</br></br>  <br>that sounds great anon! loads better then the shit you posted, but don't forgett about the windows! unless you want to fuck yround with shady ass cracks</br>  <br>nigger you just went full retard</br>  <br><br>do i have to buy it? cant i just download it illegally? because it costs a fucking lot</br></br>  <br>you can get an fx9590 for 150 quid, will match anything intel does for a fraction of the price, spend some of the savings on cooling the bastard though.</br>  <br>download steamos faggot</br>  <br>I only bought my license because I was so fucking sick of switching cracks every now and then. it works for me, and I had the money.<br><br><br><br><br>also topkek mates, it was a pleasure to make you upset.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Pc part picker ftw can find a rig for about any budget. It lists the parts for u. You just have to build it  <br>This guy just loves giving his money to billionaires and mega-million stock holders while their company makes the shittiest, laziest and most legendarily broken software on the face of the planet, all while firing their employees left and right every time there's a 1 in 10,000 possibility they might cut into their fortunes in the near-future.</br>  <br>of course you can download it illegally, but you will be confronted with cracks that suddenly stop working, especially if you have automatic updates enabled. it's your choice, seems to work for this guy:<br/></br>  IF I HEAR Fx9590 IS JUST AS GOOD AS ANY INTEL PROCESSOR I WILL FUCKING KILYOUR MOTHER AND CUT YOUR TINY ASIAN PENIS OFF, <br><br>FOR FUCKS SAKE YOU AUTISTIC FUCKS AMD IS NO WHERE NEAR AS GOOD AS INTEL</br></br>  <br>jesus christ, being this mad</br>  <br>yeah windows 8.1 kmspico master race here, no problem with updates, gonna update to 10 soon.</br>  <br>http://uk.pcpartpicker.com/user/New<wbr>manTheAlright/saved/dBrscf<br><br>This will run you about £390 after VAT or whatever. Could be slightly cheaper with a Haswell board and Pentium. Only reason I went with AMD is because it might play slightly better with games that use 4 cores, although a Haswell board would support a CPU upgrade in the future.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>this guy knows whats up</br>  <br>And download an early version of Win 10 in order to get the full thing once it releases.</br>  <br>You see, AMD and INTEL are each own by the brother of the other company. Seriously. There have been times that AMD has beaten, even slaughtered INTEL. The XP with the nForce 2 chipset, for instance, absolutely slaughtered the northwood p4's. <br><br>But it is no accident. They are in bed with each other. Literally. Having wincest.</br></br></br>  <br>for gaming it's actually better. and a lot fuckin cheaper, stay mad intel fanboys</br>  <br><br>Yeh man, they have been laying off mother fuckers left right and centre. It's really fucking disgusting behaviour for a company of that size. It's their loss though, it's the employee's that make a company successful, especially in the software realm. If your employees are designing and coding with the purpose of trying to hold on to their fraying jobs, they aren't going to innovate and do the amazing things that companies who nurture do.</br></br>    <br>Same fucking situation but I already got most of my fucking build.<br>So here it is<br>Rude me:<br>CPU:Intel Pentium g3258 (Learn how to fucking overclock and you're good)<br>MOBO:asrock b85 anniversary<br>GPU: Some 250 USD Shit (Nvida or AMD your pic, ya dumbshit)<br>RAM: 2x4gb RAM Chips for 8GB's<br>PSU:CORSAIR CX series CX500<br><br>Nice me:<br>CPU-Intel G3258 3.2 GHz LGA1150 <br><br>GPU: Haven't Decided on that yet but will cost me 250$<br><br>RAM- Crucial Ballistix Sport 8GB DDR3-1600 (PC3-12800) CL9 Dual Channel Desktop Memory Kit <br><br>Mobo-ASRock B85 Anniversary LGA 1150 Intel B85 HDMI SATA 6Gb/s USB 3.0 ATX Intel Motherboard <br><br>PSU-CORSAIR CX series CX500 500W ATX12V v2.3 80 PLUS BRONZE Certified Active PFC Power Supply<br><br>CPU cooler I would get the 212 EVO as well it's good, and any case would suffice just make sure it's an ATX.

HOW MANY TIMES WERE YOU CURB STOMPED AS A CHILD? HOLY FUCK THE AMOUNT OF DOWNS IN YOUR POSTS MAKES ME HAVE 'NAM FLASHBACKS</br></br>  <br><br>I hear you anon, but you can download the perfectly untouched original ISO with easy and burn it to disc, use the generic code for the version you want to use during installation, then use kmspico to keep it activated. It is NOT a "Crack" and ALL. It will never fail because it keeps the system activated with fresh codes when necessary. As I said, been using it since 8 released and literally never had an issue with anything at all. And it can easily be removed at any time in order to use a legitimate code if need be. Again NOT a crack.</br></br>  <br>Settle down aspie and turn off the caps lock.</br>  <br>it seems like a reasonable rig, but don't expect high end performance as for that you will need to upgrade to a dedicated GPU card.</br>  <br>I really enjoy your posts anon<br><br>pic related, my current setup. ignore the shitty as GPU, will upgrade when christmas is around the corner</br></br></br>  Op here. I have decided to stick with <br>and not buy the prebuilt. Months later when I finally get it, I will upload a post destroying the old pc(after scavenging the ram because it's the only useful thing) to thank you all</br>  <br>yes son better, as in superior, and much cheaper too. Perhaps if you had gone amd you could have the used the few hundred bucks you'd have saved to go on a short weekend break to ease your stress.</br>  <br>betriebssystem is german for operating system. Why are you from germany?</br>  <br> why are you from germany <br><br>wat? i'm from austria. and I guess i'm from austria because I was born here?</br></br></br>  <br> (after scavenging the ram because it's the only useful thing) <br>proves you are dumfag. old ram is worthless, and if you mix it with newer, faster ram, it will slow the whole system down. <br><br>Also, you have months to wait, but cant be bothered to learn shit? What do you do in all this spare time?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I doubt you would go over 3.5 GB for 1080p. <br>Anything above that though and I would be pissed if I had bought a 970.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But why?</br>  <br>i work and distract myself from eventual death</br>  <br>So you work but without learning? So you're like a hamster in a ball, right?</br>  <br> AYHEHO GUYS I'M basically running on an unlimited buttget, WILL THIS TOP OF THE LINE HARDWAR BE ANY GUD?! <br><br> MUCH THANKS CAMRADS IT'S FOR A FIREND </br></br></br>  <br>if you really need to know, my dad (from austria) moved to south africa, married my white blonde mom, and had me. because they were robbed twice and did not wish for me to get citizenship in nignog country, they decided to move to austria.</br>  <br> buying windows <br> mcafee the virus for FREE! what a deal! <br> gaming motherboard <br> warranrty <br> speakers instead of headset <br> dvi to hdmi <br> sdd <br>AHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<wbr>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I doubt you would go over 3.5 GB for 1080p <br>And? You are missing the point of that whole fiasco obviously.

This happens arounf 20 times a day while i download, play or whatever, and most things won't be saved. Also it is very shitty meaning that videos take long loading not for my internet but because firefox uses 70%cpu and adobe the other %.

I would personally never go AMD, but I'm not sure how well you grasp the basics of PC technology. Very little of what you just said makes any sense at all. Mainly because while yes the CPU does have an effect on gaming performance in a dedicated GPU rig, that difference is negligible between similarly spec'd Intel and AMD CPU's.</br></br>  <br>I have a budget of about $700</br>  <br>dude just download the windows 7 iso torrent with the most votes and download a "windows 7 loader" Mine has never stopped working until I formatted.

Either way temps are going to be fine unless OP is fucktarded and forgets to put paste between that and the cpu.<br><br> Wifi <br>Agreed. Ditch that shit and stay wired if possible.<br><br> Soundcard <br>Agreed again. Onboard audio is more than fine these days.<br><br> Broken GPU <br>Unless they're doing more than 1080p, they shouldn't/really shouldn't have an issue.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>doesnt that cpu has a boost mode? like from 3.4 to 3.9? wont the 3.9 generate more heat, thus bying a better cooler? just saying</br>  <br>The only critizism of the 970 have been the 3.5 vram which is a non-issue if you run at 1080p.<br><br>The actual performance of the card is great and you can overclock the card to match the 980.<br><br>Considering the price difference i'd say the 970 is fucking fantastic.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Cooler require for this reason </br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;629940446 <br><br>What do you want to do with your pc OP?</br></br>  <br>many titles now ask for about 4gb vram, what will happen in the next 2 years, youre investing in an broken card, already outdated for the tittles that will come in the future.</br>  <br>Right, I stand corrected. An aftermarket is the better route unless the OP gets a different CPU like  said.</br>  Just get this op http://pcpartpicker.com/p/Cd3mzy  <br>you forgot an 120/250 SSD and 8gb more of ram, but nice setup.</br>  <br>But what about 4 years? 6 years? Are you saying we have to eventually upgrade our system? And here i thought investing in a ''future proof card'' would last forever.<br><br>Im getting 70-80 fps with almost all the settings maxed out in gta 5 right now. I'm sure ill be fine in 2 years from now.</br></br></br>  <br>aprox $700.<br><br><br>to be honest, just to play games like bf4, arma3, gtaV, farcry 4... but i'm not worried about getting 60fp or anything like it, motherboard and cpu are most likely a gift so i cannot complain.</br></br></br></br>  <br>almost all the settings maxed, no mods. you said it, when you pass the 3.5 barrier what happens? hurr durr 50 43 30 20 12 10 fps. Why? cause nvidia fanboy.</br>  <br>someone told me that a cooler will be always necesary.</br>  <br>Its never going to hurt. i use a cooler to cut down fan speed/noise</br>  <br>I'm always far under the 3.5 barrier. The only time i ever went over was when i installed the HD pack for shadows of Mordor which had 6GB vram in the recommended settings. The highest i ever got in that game was 3.8gb and i didnt drop a single frame. I still played it smooth like a baby.</br>  as a warning i had those g230s and they broke. but i could just be a drunken idiot  <br><br><br>Heed my warning OP, you've been warned! Also if this thing is for gaming primarily you've saved money in the wrong areas and spent extra in the wrong areas. The key to a gaming rig revolves around the GPU. Pick something that works for your preferred gaming resolution and still has some extra VRAM overhead for future titles. Then design the rest of the rig around that to suit budget. If this is for gaming you'll be sitting pretty with a i5-4690 or k, for RAM you realistically only need 8GB of at least 1600MHz (beyond that speed the gaming performance increase is negligible on a dedicated GPU system). Integrated audio as other have stated is more than sufficient with a mid level gaming mobo so forget the dedicated card. Get a better PSU for that price range. These little changes will save money in the right areas and let you beef up that GPU a bit more.</br></br></br>  <br>good for you anon, youre the only lucky anon that doesnt have fps drops when hitting the 3.5 limit shit. im impressed.</br>  <br>A buncha faggots itt are going to tell you the evo is shit dont listen it can pretty much do any oc you want on any chip.</br>   sound card <br> n150 network card <br> Intel mobo <br>Why anon why.</br></br></br>  Graphics Card is fine.<br>Processor has overheating issues: opt for a 4790k or 4690k if you're just gaming.<br>I don't know the motherboard. Can't comment.<br>Hyper 212 Evo is good as long as you aren't blowing that thing up with oc.<br>Your power supply is fine, it's the one I use.<br>Wireless adapter is lol.<br>Sound card? Meh.<br>Headset is fine. Not as good as their others, but fine.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   meme doritos mountain dew tier overpriced headphones <br> soundcard ????? WTF??? literally placebo 0.000% sound improvement for the cost of driver and compatibility problems <br> meme tier PSU, just get a Seasonic its way better, but I know no Mountain Dew tier black color also you dont need more than 400W for that setup. </br></br>  <br><br>Say what now? Not one person said it was shit. In fact this guy  praised it for working well. Relax dude.</br></br>  <br><br>Intel mobo<br><br>kek<br><br><br>I give this set up <br><br>3.5 out of 4</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>does the wifi ever fail? like it doesn't work during a game?<br>my mother had wifi on her pc when it was first released. we used to have like 40% reception and I hated it</br></br>  amd 390 would have been much better  <br>not op but I don't plan on going over 1080p would a 970 be good still?</br>  Dont need an i7. 970 sucks. Shouldve gotten an i5 4690 and a 290x or 390  <br>  Broken GPU Vram <br>  4770 not K version <br>  Intel mobo <br>kek'ed</br></br></br></br>  <br>you fucking relax.</br>  <br><br>It's very borderline my man, gona be honest. It may or may not cut it depending on your lottery placing. I'd go 4GB VRAM minimum for 1080p gaming. That still leaves a little overhead for future titles to, but it far from "future proof", and I use that term very hesitantly.</br></br>  <br>why, what? xplain yourself smartass</br>  <br>OP, if you're serious about this, take another shot with the RAM, remove all the fucking accessories and ask </br>   intel board <br>why does intel make motherboards again?<br> nvidia gpu <br>i'll let you decide. I've always hated nvidia drivers. Sure, they work well on release only to never get updated again and thrown into the trash in terms of support &lt;2 years later.<br> gaming headset and sound card <br>sure you don't want good headphones and a good mic instead?<br> wireless n150 <br>can't n go to 800? pretty sure there are usb dongles cheaper that get better signal and speed than that pci card<br><br>cpu and psu are decent, though i'd have waited another 1-2 yrs for new chipset and gotten a better rated psu. And I guess some anon is claiming that cpu burns up. Why is your mousepad still rolled up? Where is the ram?<br><br>Overall i rate this build 5.5/10. I hope you got a good price.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>or spend half the money for similar performance and got an amd fx9590</br>  <br><br>I'm not claiming it burns up haha seeing as I've never owned one. I was just saying that it's far beyond well documented that the 4770 had serious heating issues.<br><br>You're spot on with the Intel board, it's rubbish.<br><br>Nvidia vs AMD for GPU is really just a matter of preference so again good take on it.<br><br>Again spot on with the gaming headset. DON'T buy audio hardware labelled "Gaming". Buy some top quality Audio centric headset and you'll get superior sound for cheaper.<br><br>Again spot on with the wifi card. A USB 3.1 Wifi dongle will outperform that card easily and be cheaper, either way always go wired if possible.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>correct</br>  <br>you are buying a computer made for console ports fuck that gay shit.</br>  Whoever said pay a lot less for similar performance with an AMD<br><br>Kill yourself you fucking Down syndrome faglord<br><br>Intel is far superior to any AMD processor</br></br></br></br>   audio card   <br>cooling issues aside, wrong, intel are better on single thread performance, games nowadays are going multi thread which is where amd starts to shine, and still for a fraction of the price. Fuckin intel fanboys</br>  <br>thanks for rating and expanding my review, anon. Here's a cool wall set up, though I hope he can turn off those lights easily.</br>  <br>and shush the fans...<br><br>I put my computer in the closet, and after some temp testing, am enjoying silent computing.</br></br></br>  <br> asks if this is good <br> has already purchased so our opinion doesn't matter </br></br>  О, я тя сёдня на харкаче видел.  <br>Waste of money.

Which is almost right up with the stupidly expensive 9 series.<br><br>It's all the same chip anyway, just binned.</br></br></br>  <br>my 9590 cost me £160, can't imagine the 8320 is that much cheaper, plus i can overclock mine even further, should i ever feel the need.</br>  <br>Should've got an EVGA 970<br>EVGA&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;everyone for Nvidia cards</br></br>  <br>This. I have fx cpu and I regret not buying intel instead. I have overclocked this piece of shit to maximum but still I should have spent a bit more money on intel for a lot better performance.</br>  you know vmodas have a mic built into them so you dont have too buy a garbage tier mic  <br><br>Basically this. Not because they outperform every other brand or anything, but because they are extremely well built, using high quality solid materials, and EVGA customer service is actually insane. They don't fuck around when it comes to satisfying the customer.</br></br>  Check it  nope  <br> need more performance? <br> let's add cores herp <br>It's not how it works. 3.5ghz quad core can be more powerful than 4.5ghz hexa core.</br></br></br>  <br>which fx cpu?<br><br>upgrade it to a 9590 and get some good cooling and you'll be laughing at those intel boys paying more than double for slightly better single thread performance.</br></br></br>  Jet fuel can't melt steel beams  <br> Sound card <br>Are you literally fucking retarded?</br></br>  gifs/webms or pictures that will make you WAT?  <br><br><br><br><br><br>Elite Yankee Saburo<br><br>Can't remember which episode I took it from.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's actually a sculpture on a rotary motor.

Seriously, people don't give the Internet enough respect.</br>  <br>She'll easily recover from this considering she will be seen as the victim, instead of a dumbshit for posting her picture on the Internet.
