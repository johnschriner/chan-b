Going to go take a dump now.</br>  I take at least 150-200 mikes every week or two. I also take mushrooms at times. Would recommend mushrooms over acid honestly. Much more smooth and everything is VERY fluid.  <br>Is acid worth trying at least?</br>  Just tried it for the first time a couple of weeks ago, keep in mind I went straight into acid, not trying mushrooms first. I tripped for 14 hours and watched "The Descent", holy shit, no noooooooooooo  <br>I bet your brain is a bowl of mush</br>  I had a horrible experience taking lsd.  <br>Absolutely! Make sure it's real. 25-I and other RC's are pretty common on street dealers. Had one bad trip on 200 mikes of that shit.

It's pretty beneficial to my mental health and stability. I'm a lot more happy and talkative for a few days after I trip/When i do trip</br>  <br>Drugs are for losers.

Only been scammed twice out of my 15+ Orders</br>  <br>Yah man i guess no coffee/ alcohol/ cigarettes for you huh</br>  <br>I like acid a lot more. Shrooms can get pretty weird, acid is a lot more beautiful.</br>  <br>Take 1 gram and see how you feel. If you think you're ready eat 2. If you REALLY want to trip balls. Take 3.5 grams and get ready to explore.</br>  <br>That's cute.<br> mfw do several drugs every single day and still way more successful than that guy </br></br>  All of theese faggots saying acid acid acid everywhere, wtf is up with that?<br><br>The high isnt even that good, its disturbing.<br><br>Shrooms masterrace.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Left agora during the huge ddos attack<br>They good now?</br></br>  <br>I bet you're excited to start high school this year</br>  <br>Acid makes things inside seem very interesting and more open to new ideals which I like, but mushrooms make nature feel beautiful no matter what. Im more of an outdoor person so shrooms are just my preference</br>  <br>In my experience, I got a little disconnected from reality because I didn't know what to expect. I was still in full control though and made sure I didn't do anything stupid or embarrassing. You will likely feel depressed/cry after it is over but it will only last a short while.</br>    <br>This is why I don't wanna do acid, I wouldn't want it to be 25-i, I hear that shit fucks you up hard.</br>  <br>Yes, I've been ordering from it the past few weeks, orders come in nice and on time as always</br>  <br>Nah you're right I'm not, but your argument is invalid. Just because you're too much of a pussy to try it doesn't mean that everyone who does drugs are losers. There are plenty of people who like to drop a couple times a year to reset.</br>  <br>DMT master race reporting in from the 72nd dimension</br>  <br>just coffee, maybe twice a week, loser</br>  The problem with acid is that you cannot fall asleep for 8 hours after dropping.

Is it worth it?</br>  <br>A drug user after all. Hypocritical turd</br>  <br>LSD is definitely a time commitment</br>  <br>ok. Drugs are for pathetic fucks and you know it<br>Man, all this butthurted faggots</br></br>  <br>Yep, cant waint for another trip</br>  <br>DO NOT MIX SHIT WITH LSD. Jesus fucking christ. That can fuck you up horribly. If anything take a couple bong rips.</br>  <br>tfw the only way to test for lsd is to do a spinal tap</br>  I had a red bull after a coffee and I had this crazy sugar buzz mixed with coffee it was crazy! that's like the same as lsd right?  <br>I found it the other way around. Think it depends on the person. Really like acid personally.</br>  <br>Yes. Just make sure you actually breakthrough.</br>  <br>Joe Rogan said, that dmt is the most extreme activity a human being can do. You literally leave your meat suit</br>  <br>Just make sure you get it from legit sources and there is NO taste on the paper/blotter. bitter taste = doi/doc or 25-i</br>  <br>you are just stupid, that's what all potheads says</br>  Nope. I have a salary paid job. I wish I could try though.  LSD was fun when I used to take it in the 80s &amp; 90s. Shrooms were never a favorite, but okay. Mescaline I only tried a handful of times 'cause it was difficult to come by. Still really miss the acid, though. All I can find these days in my old age is weed.  IF YOU'RE GOING TO TRY DRUGS, MAKE SURE ITS SOMETHING NATURAL (WEED, SHROOMS) AND NOT MAN-MADE.<br><br>Half the stuff you'll find on the streets that's man-made is polluted or imitation that will do serious and often permanent damage to your lungs/brain. Just stick to the natural stuff and be smart about it. Keep in mind there are people in this world who willingly smoke deadly things, so just because someone tells you they've tried something doesn't make it a good idea for you to try it too.</br></br>  <br>this was a joke so no faggiting plz</br>  <br>I did DMT a few times and went flying through the galaxy before being sucked back into my body. It'll give you an out of body experience but its not something you take for fun. It is very extreme and 10 minutes can seem like years</br>  <br>so thats a no go on the nitrous oxide</br>  <br>Maybe if your desk started warping and colors became more vibrant. But no. Take LSD and find out,</br>  I never did LSD, have some 125ug tabs, is it safe to take by myself at home?  <br>Weed brings back the visuals with this robotic edge, Nothing better than toking on the comedown</br>  Any of yall ever tried DXM?<br>What was your experience like?</br>  i'm too bussy having a succesful life to fuck it up taking drugs  <br>You. You, you fucking chav.<br>Drugs make 'you' stupid. And a period belongs at the end of every sentence that isn't a preposition or a question.<br>I have taken more drugs in my life than you can possibly imagine.<br>It has probably damaged my brain.<br>Probably.<br> take drugs, kid. be less of a retard. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm planning on doing some mental exploring as well as I want to see what it's like to become an astral entity and find out what's really out there</br>  <br>definitely not. nitrous and lsd will give you a bad time. even weed can give you a bad time if you're not careful.</br>  <br>you just take everybodies word huh? read up dosages on NBoMEs and DOM/DOC, 200mcg wouldnt have done shit.<br>P.S. Stop dropping so much your going to go even more retarded, if you have to actually trip to be happy maybe fix your life.</br></br>  <br> have taken more drugs in my life than you can possibly imagine. <br>you're such a badass</br></br>  <br>You must take lots then.</br>  Is it possible to Jack off on Percocet? Having no luck here  <br>Nope. Just old and positive that I know what I am talking about.</br>  <br>All fucked up like on downers, with black and white visuals. You usually travel thru space. You allways puke thought</br>  last friday i dosed up at 750 mikes how long until tolerance is gone???   I have taken more drugs in my life than you can possibly imagine. <br>holy shit man can I be you? your so cool you make my pussy so wet</br>  <br>LMAO</br>  <br> 17 year old brags about his shroom trip on the internet </br>  <br>Never had alcohol i take it</br>  <br>I dont trip to make my life happy. I do it so I can mentally explore and discover different horizons from an unusual perspective.</br>  <br>It can be done but it takes dedication.<br><br>Opiates + viagra if you want sex.</br></br></br>  <br>More often than not most DMT trips generally impose certain 'alien' aspects to the trip, like hieroglyphics and the like. I had this creature one time trying to give me what looked like a baby behind this huge black sheet of nothing nothingness but I came out before I could accept it and see what it was.</br>  <br>14 days from the moment you took it</br>  <br>Only a couple of days for your tolerance to return to normal.</br>  <br>What the fuck are you talking about? Nitrous on LSD is fucking incredible. You had a bad trip, that doesn't mean everyone else who combines other drugs with LSD will, you fucking nut.</br>  Omg bro im fucking out of it -rips bing- OHHHHH YEAAAAAAAAAHHHHH DAMN  <br> Nitrous and LSD will give you a bad time. <br>Quit espousing your subjective experiences as fact, lying ass snake.<br>LSD and Nitrous was fantastic. It counteracts the scrambling caused by LSD and gives you a glimpse into pure consciences.<br>Of which is filled with flying serpents and clouds but that could just be me.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm planning on doing some mental exploring as well <br><br>Nope.<br><br>Don't make any plans. Just go with the flow. It will be all you are able to do.</br></br></br></br></br>  yeah come to me with all your drug related questions I snort marijuana and inject lsd all the time.  <br>So do I but thats too often you arent giving your mind time to rest.<br><br>If anything get some DMT and explore with that, you'll discover completely new horizons and a whole new world.</br></br></br>  <br> mentally explore and discover different horizons <br>What, are you developing telekinesis? From anyone elses perspective, you're just sitting there with a dopey look on your face for a few hours. Nothing is ACTUALLY happening, retard.</br></br>  <br>Seriously? Fuck. I had brain surgery last week and have been on percs. I just want to fap. I'm supposed to hook up with my fwb this weekend because I can't get off. What about T3s? I was told to downgrade to those when I can tolerate it</br>  <br>When you become an adult, you'll understand. Until then, enjoy this rack you little scamp, you.</br>  I would recommend acid over shrooms if you have a weak stomach. Had a mate throw up a slice of shrooms about 30 minutes after eating them, shit kinda sucked for everyone involved. Plus, you get the shits for the next couple days. <br>Acid is also good if you're doing something, e.g. a festival or an adventure. Only reason I say this is because you could get antsy when starting to trip and it could be overwhelming and you could get the feeling of constantly needing to do something. And it's like 0 to 100 very quickly.<br> Shrooms is good to chill with but you could also do all the events you could on acid, but from my experience I had no want to go anywhere. Perfectly content with just spacing out and exploring my mind. <br>Also from my experience, acid has taken a larger mental toll than shrooms. For example, I felt the acid "hangover" for like 2 weeks after I tripped compared to feeling slightly out of it the day after shrooms. And I think that acid changed the way that I see the world and mash rooms guided change</br></br></br>  <br>200mcg of nbome is literally nothing <br><br>an average dose is like 1000mcg</br></br></br>  <br>I've always had nitrous turn my trip into something greasy and dirty. It's not just me either, all my friends wont do nitrous with L anymore. Molly, sure but not L, it messes up the chemical reaction.</br>  <br>seige heil Seitan</br>  <br> LSD and Nitrous was fantastic. It counteracts the scrambling caused by LSD <br><br>interesting, go on</br></br></br>  Who else here /diphendyramine/?  <br> yfw I take LSD every couple months, dropped out of college, and have been running a successful software startup for over a year <br>Steve Jobs master race</br></br>  <br>T3s are easier than straight opiates</br>  <br>I counter with a smug rack. I bet you don't even know the touch of a woman, squirt.</br>  got a story on shrooms. Me and gf ate 2.5g of mexican golden caps last summer. .. I remember listeting to Shpongle some time ago and decided to dl their album for the trip. The shit is amazing.<br> There is a lake surrounded by woods near a place where my parents live <br> We go there and make a fire <br> Around 10pm munched on those fuckers with some caramel and chocolate <br> I've tripped on acid once before but 1st time usually very confusing and I didn't quiet enjoy it <br> imfeelingitmrcrabs.jpeg <br> My point of view started to shift <br> It was like looking from outside of the body to the right <br> Leaves on the trees became all perfectly arranged <br> patterns everywhere <br> ground was covered in some inter-dimensional web (I have no idea how else to describe it) <br> The song came on called Shpongle Falls <br> The guy in the song says "This is a circular vortex spinning, spinning...' <br> I look at the fire logs and they began turning in synch with the music <br> it morphed into some Greek temple <br> I could see every detail, the stairs sculptures appearing right infront of my eyes <br> After about 30 mins I began feeling the vortex <br> Like my mind getting sucked out of the body into another plane of existance <br> Me and gf decided to go to parent's house (they left for vacation so we had a place to chill ) <br> We went to the backyard and were looking at the stars <br> Felt exactly like the cheesy phrase "when you stare at the universe, the universe stares back" <br> We ended up listening to only 2 songs for the whole trip <br> Monster Hit and Shpongle Falls <br> Euphoric as fuck <br> 10000 fedoras cannot compare </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I read it. The whole thing. It was informative, thank you.</br>  <br><br>Mushrooms are safer and a better high in my opinion</br></br>  <br>I tried it once.<br>I thought my little brother was sitting next to me playing Xbox with me and having a conversation with me then i looked next to me and realized my brother wasn't in the room and neither was my Xbox.<br> Mfw </br></br></br>  <br>Hopefully I've weaned myself onto those. I'm not a fan of percs anyway, they Fuck with my vision.</br>  <br>take a half tab first to get a feel of how strong it is, wait a week and take another and go to the park. Psychedelics are infinitely better when taken outdoor/EG somewhere with lots of trees.</br>  <br>Alright. I'm not sure what to expect but I'm absolutely ready break through and see<br><br><br>Im actually about to get some this coming week and finally explore to new universes and understand what everything is all about<br><br><br>Are you fucking retarded? You may have a dopey look but I'm experiencing more that what you ever will in your fat ass virgin beta-faggot life.<br><br><br>Didn't know RC's were so high of mcg sorry about that. All I know is I took 2 tabs which is normally 200mcg in LSD</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm pretty sure most of us drug users have better jobs than you... And have more fun in life on top of that. <br> beta detected <br><br>Go live your life in fear</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Alright. I'm not sure what to expect but I'm absolutely ready break through and see <br><br>Having an expectation of it will almost certainly impact your trip. Don't bring any mental baggage into it.</br></br></br>  <br>Whats that champ? Couldn't hear you over my nut splattering over your mother.<br> pic only mildly related <br><br>Maybe not, but I remember what it was like before I started fucking guys.<br> soft, warm, curvy, batshit insane, moody for no reason other than to control </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Very hard to explain, and in most cases I feel like I shouldn't, as if that's some unspoken rule about that possible plane of existence. Even now, as I'm explaining this, my mind's adopting the persona of one of the characters I met on the experience, so at a certain point it becomes increasingly difficult to differentiate which thoughts are really your own. <br>Nevertheless, it pops the question of why should I seek confirmation of objective reality at all. What if there isn't one? What if all those delusions you've casually dismissed over the reasons was actually just repression?<br>Hard to say, which is why I sit and trip and huff alone.</br></br></br>  <br>The concept of psychedelic-assisted introspection is utterly foreign to those who haven't experienced it.<br>Here's the thing: in the midst of a trip, you might find yourself believing in telekinesis or similar bullshit. When you come down, you understand that it wasn't "real." But that doesn't matter! What matters is how you felt during the trip, and how that shapes your future feelings and perceptions while sober.<br>Join us. LSD won't melt your brain, I promise. It's just a little vacation.</br></br></br>  <br>Im thinking about meditating and just getting some mental clarity beforehand since I cant meditate while on the DMT</br>  i mean its cool to find out the meaning of life and the nature of the universe and shit. but then life goes on a normal, you just have less existential questions  <br>Stop projecting, you lonely faggot. I'm just saying that "mentally explore and discover different horizons" is the most retarded thing I've ever heard. I've done my fair share of drugs and it was an interesting learning experience, but faggots like you that pretend you're floating in some astral plane and becoming one with the trees are the biggest retards on the planet. They just change the way you experience things, but the minute you start taking it seriously is when you need to grow up.</br>  <br>ya, like im a engineer and make bank.</br>  <br>also tabs now-a-days arent normally 200mcg, normal street doses are 75-150mcg if your not getting fake shit. <br><br>"If its bitter, its a spitter" remember this. If it tastes bitter call your dealer and bitch him out, he will blame ink but this is bullshit (he most likely doesnt know if its legit or not anyway). (all ink used on blotter paper is vegetable ink, obviously no taste to it)</br></br></br>  <br>i've heard really good things about Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds. They have LSA in them, which is a precursor to LSD. <br><br>avg trip is 6-12 seeds and is pretty mild. I think it's a good way to test the waters</br></br></br>  <br>or is that what the government wants you to think</br>   Looking for some near 901.  <br>Had it before but it seems to have dried up over the past few years.</br>  <br>luke use the onion</br>  Gonna have my second time in a few weeks with 160micros. This time I want to take it alone.<br>Any ideas on what to do the whole day beside listening to Psytrance?</br>  Can't fap and getting constipated. Opiates suck.  <br>LSD is probably my favorite drug. Obviously not for a club scene, but in general it is. It's just way more fun than DMT, you get to fuck around and feel like a child for 12 hours. DMT is crazy and mentally expanding, but it's not what I'd call fun. Probably the most intense drug I will ever touch.</br>  <br>wtf are you even doing in this thread?</br>  Me and 2 mates actually doing some lsd this weekend, any more advice?  <br> you need to grow up  <br>Argh you authoritarian, mature, salt of the Earth man. Gots beels and keeds and works a jerb. I respect and admire that, thank you for undermining my spacey little bubble. I'll be sure to act like you now.<br>Faggot</br></br></br>  <br> When you come down, you understand that it wasn't "real." But that doesn't matter! What matters is how you felt during the trip <br>Bad advice. Its fun to believe things like telekinesis on a trip but once you come down, you have to remember that this is REAL LIFE you're in and to live accordingly. People who delve too far into their fantasies are why we have furries and other freaks.</br></br>  <br>watch akira, i hate animes but that one is mind blowing</br>  <br>Fapping on opiates is great. Once you finally get hard you can go for weeks. Unless you want a quick fap, obviously.</br>  <br>Go outside</br>  <br>I buy mine online now and I normally get between 100-200mcg tabs</br>  <br>if it's bitter, it's a spitter</br>  <br>How secure is tor now and what site is everyone using?</br>  <br>Porn won't do it for me. I'll be having sex this weekend though so hopefully my dick figures it out</br>  <br> mfw someone is locked into a lifestyle not of their own choosing </br>  Where do you guys keep finding Acid? I've found it maybe once in my life and never again.  I am waiting for my dope to arrive. You are all faggots. I love heroin. Yes heroin. Pills are cool, but thats not heroin.  <br>Good. You're exactly the kind of overreacting faggot I hate to do drugs with.</br>  <br>stfu<br>just cause you can't handle it doesnt mean others can't. ever hear of candyflipping? jediflipping?<br><br><br>i've read several trip reports where people mixed acid with all sorts of other drugs, including n2o. they turned out fine, for the most part</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Real life is a consensual hallucination made more boring by retarded aspie fucks like you who see the impossible and think 'i could never do that'.<br>Eat shit and die.</br></br>  <br>I volunteered for a cia experiment and now I have unlimited</br>  <br>if you're smart you use DNMs <br><br>but most people ITT are obviously fucking stupid so they probably get it from their weed dealers</br></br></br>    <br>Please I sit in the closet and do absolutely nothing while I trip.</br>  <br>It was an appropriate erection to complete bullshit, I thought.</br>  I'm just starting to delve into drugs, but I want to only delve into psychedelics. Where do I start? A friend told me to get Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds and make LSA. Is that a good start?<br> inb4 LSA is a pussy version of LSD <br>Pls go. I'm beginning.</br></br>  <br>Until you know me, don't judge. We could be pals if you weren't such a colossal faggot all the time. &lt;3</br>  <br>Real life IS boring, faggot.

Google is being a jew</br></br>  <br>Basically if you're going to risk taking drugs these days you should be less of a dummy about it and make sure you are getting it from trustworthy sources, test them and even then make sure you are in good physical condition and live an otherwise healthy lifestyle, eat plenty of food and drink plenty of water while partaking and pay close attention to and respond to the signs your body sends you in regards to what you're putting into it.</br>  does anyone else experience depersonalization when smoking weed?  <br>nah if you have a fucking breaking bad style lab and god tier chemistry education<br>you can grow shrooms tho dog</br></br>  <br>No, you need a full lab setup</br>  <br>LSD is very much not easy to make yourself<br><br>unless of course you have access to all the precursors, most of which are heavily monitored by the FBI,<br><br>Better off just buying some from the DNMs</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you're supposed to try mushrooms first</br>  <br>You will need lab equipment. If you have a few thousand dollars to spend, you could set up a lab of your own and get to work. If you plan to deal, you'll have made that money back quickly (LSD has no real competition, so no danger there, except for the police obviously).<br>Otherwise just consider it an investment into your own life, just like how you would buy a high-end PC or a car or whatever.</br></br>  <br>how precious</br>  <br>Easier way: get some Hawaiian baby woodrose seeds, and extract the LSA from them. LSA is the precursor to LSD. Molecularly similar to LSD, and just as safe.</br>  <br>I can't even imagine trying to take acid as my first psychedelic. That long trip is just not something you want to experience as a first time tripper. I barely could deal with it even after doing shrooms and some RC first. Then again I took a crazy big dose for my first experience and it actually sort of worked out in the end.</br>  <br>Belittling this man's noble sacrifice to become a productive member of the herd?<br>Shame on you for arrogantly thinking you are above being appraised for your set of skills and service to humanity.</br></br>  <br>Lsd is far superior</br>  anyone ever take a hit of DMT while peaking on LSD or know someone who has?  <br>Dem spiders. Everywhere.</br>  <br>A lot of the people I've met at certain events claim that if you peak on LSD, mushrooms and molly all at the same time, take a fat line of ketamin and then blast off you're basically going to get as intense a psychedelic experience as humanly possible. But I'm usually just fine flying off big doses of each drug on their own (save ketamin because I'm not into disassociatives) so I think polydrug use is a waste. Like seriously why bother taking a bit of each when you can just take an eighth of shrooms or half a strip of acid or a couple points of MDMA and be golden.</br>  <br>LSD was my first drug. It went very smoothly. Took 2 hits, and people thought I was crazy because I'd do something like that before even touching weed. Still, just think about Albert Hoffman. He took like 10 and he never did any drugs before.</br>  <br>I had a four loko, a medium bottle of goose and took a tab of acid while at a party, not all in a row time passed during the night. Worst/Best trip I've ever had. started talking to hominids and they told me that my universe was insignificant to their world. they told me their world doesn't rely on space, time or dimensions, it consisted of something else my puny mind will never understand. this was huge for me. I was floored, I took it really hard and felt terrible. saw colors I've never saw before while everyone around me looked like plant people with leaves and branches with their faces morphing. felt one with all the trees and mountains of all the countries in the world. it changed a few notches my life.</br>  <br>I mean true enough I was fine somehow and I took three hits of some of the strongest blotters I've ever encountered and that was my first acid trip, and it was such a different trip than mushrooms I don't think my experience with them even helped much. <br><br>Probably mostly has to do with mindset. A first timer will go in with no expectations and an open mind and probably a lot of humility so as long as the setting is solid and no real-world horrible shit goes down the first time would probably be smooth enough.</br></br></br>  <br>As someone who as taken shrooms around 15 times and has dropped cid probably around 25 times I agree with everything you said. These are basically the same words I'd use to describe the difference between the two.<br><br>Love acid but man will it humble your cocky ass if you go into it thinking you're Mr. Invincible Tripper Man. Mushrooms are a wildcard and can take a big physical toll but the headfuck is much milder than that lucid acid mindfuckery. <br><br>I will say that if you ever faint on mushrooms you'll get crazy, DMT style visuals.</br></br></br></br></br>  ITT: animal abuse..<br><br>bonus points for cats / kittens</br></br>  If there is one thing /b/ unanimously agrees on liking it is cats.<br><br>So this is not the right place for your request.</br></br>  how did it take you to get your edge that sharp?  <br>true, but there's always gonna be some edgy summer fag who's posting, just for the lulz</br>  MODS   inb4 shoveldog   <br>i hope i can hit op's head into this shit like that mothefucker did with the cat</br>  <br>I'd post a webm of me and my uncle completely destroying a pig like 3 summers ago. <br><br>However, us fucking your mom is very private to us.</br></br></br>  OMFG MOAR!  <br>clever, but seen before... try again</br>    <br>I hate cats.

Do sociopaths derive pleasure from it? I was under the impression they don't feel any emotion - so is torture an attempt to "feel" something? Can an emphatic person torture/kill an animal for pleasure? Is it even pleasure? What is the motivation here? Can anyone explain?  <br><br>I had a cat that fucking mauled someone who broke into my house when I was gone for 1 night. Left the poor bastards blood all over my carpet and everything. My cat (jenny) didn't have a mark on her.</br></br>  <br>ITT Teens left unattended near a computer.</br>  benzin.avi  i just got done abusing a cat.. feelsgoodman.jpg  <br>I used to kill and torture cats, rabbits, birds etc<br>i would take their bodies in my backpack to the forest sometimes and draw out the suffering for as long as i wanted to<br>I did it because it made me feel powerful. It was an outlet for stored up anger/evil. It gets addictive.</br></br></br>  <br>It's just a stepping stone for antisocial spergtard virgins before they start killing people. Every mass murderer that's known has at least tortured and killed an animal before.</br>  <br>Fuck you!</br>  <br>Some people simply lack empathy, the emotion that causes compassion. Those are sociopaths, they're easy to spot and don't get far. Some people derive pleasure from it because of fantasies of power they imagine in their heads while they do it. These people are delusional, and can be harder to spot.</br>  son of a bitch just fight with a man  <br>*tweens</br>  <br>I can FAP to this , fuckin feline vermin</br>  <br><br>I keep bits of dead animals sometimes, I have a vodka bottle with a bumble bee and a pigeon heart in it.

Abortion is wrong under any circumstance. These girls are just like you and me.  Hell, a few months after Claire was born, I was driving in a Dillon's parking lot on a cold winter day when I spotted some harmless Knights of Columbus workers wearing vests which read, "HELP RETARDED CHILDREN" on the back and collecting money for their organization. You'd shit your pants if you saw how fast I jerked my car into PARK (delaying several cars behind me and coming toward me), hopped out of it, and jump-straddled some poor guy's ass for wearing such an insulting slogan on the back of his vest, as if HE himself was the one who designed the damn thing with hate in his heart. OMG! I shouted, "I AM THE PARENT OF A QUOTE RETARDED CHILD END QUOTE AND I DO NOT APPRECIATE YOU WEARING SUCH AN OUTDATED, RUDE, INAPPROPRIATE VEST!!! The PROPER terminology is 'special needs' these days!!!!!!!!!!!" Dude stood there speechless then said, "I'll pass that on. Thanks." I stormed off, got in my car, parked it, and bawled my eyes out for my sweet Claire, for her disability, for myself, for my family and how CHANGED our lives would now be forever -- whether she lived or died. It was so NEW... the "wound" so fresh. THIS KILLED ME. I will say, the next year I saw these guys out again, and they had on new vests which read, "HELP HANDICAPPED CHILDREN." For some reason, that actually felt BETTER to me. I stayed in my car this time and after much deliberation convinced myself I had indeed WON. Yes, I DO have issues. :) <br><br>http://www.thehartleyhooligans.com/<wbr>2011/05/suckerpunched-by-r-word.htm<wbr>l</wbr></wbr></br></br>    <br>This post genuinely made me laugh, because of how sadistic you are.</br>  Scott and I had a VERY loooooooooong talk about the whole ordeal, what Cal's punishment should be (for saying the word retard), and why our son would EVER do such a thing. We decided that his punishment would be this: He would have to call each of the other three children involved, apologize for using the word "retard" and explain to them why it is wrong and why no one should ever say it again. Secondly, he would write Scott &amp; me a letter about his own thoughts, feelings and what he had learned -- about his sisters, using that word, why it's inappropriate, why he won't do it again, how sorry he is, etc. It needed to be at least one notebook page in length. <br><br>http://www.thehartleyhooligans.com/<wbr>2011/05/suckerpunched-by-r-word.htm<wbr>l</wbr></wbr></br></br>    <br>Fuck off back to reddit, faggot.</br>  Lola now randomly gets B.O. in her right armpit only. I'm not sure if this is an accomplishment or not, but it seems huge to me. My little girl is growing up! (Don't think I didn't Google "Is it abnormal for an 8 year old to have B.O." before realizing that it is probably the most age appropriate thing she's done her whole damn life. Ha!) Claire didn't start getting stinky until she was 11 or 12, so this seems odd. However, others assure me their typical children start getting funky around 8-9 years old, so it's likely nothing to be worried about. Considering the girls don't sweat at all, I still find this B.O. vexing. But as with every other weird ass thing my girls do, I'm choosing to let it goooooooo! (In my best Frozen rendition! Don't judge. Last night Scott said to Claire, "Don't cry!" and then he said, "Don't cry for me, Argentina!" &amp; I belted out in my best opera voice, "The truth is I never left you..." and I don't even know anymore lyrics than that, but I totally felt like "the shit.") How the hell I got from B.O. to a title track from the musical Evita, composed by the great Andrew Lloyd Webber, NO ONE KNOWS, but once again, I wanna give a shout out to Google for giving me the 411 on that. (Did that "411" comment make me sound old or super awesome?!)<br><br>http://www.thehartleyhooligans.com/<wbr>2015/02/i-dont-know-how-to-put-this<wbr>-but-my.html</wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>Is this a shoop?

Would not surprise me ONE GOD DAMN BIT if she has made some threads before. Shes legit bonkers!</br>  Behold one of the most brilliant things I have ever seen my sweet Claire accomplish...<br><br> Yes. OH YES! Our girl is working on kneeling!!! I cannot believe my very eyes. Claire continues to amaze all of us with her desire to challenge herself, to work through her increased tone/cerebral palsy, to use her body/disability to her advantage! <br><br>I am speechless. Yes, I know that is not a common occurrence, but today I remain just that -- SPEECHLESS.<br><br>http://www.thehartleyhooligans.com/<wbr>2014/09/speechless.html</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was still young then, the underdevelopment wasn't clear then.

You will never achieve that overall hardness roid users experience. When you're at the gym and got that pump it comes near it, but a couple hours later it will be gone, but most roid users keep that hardness.</br>    READ THE RULES OR NO WINS! <br>  TRIPS WIN A GAME <br>  YOU CHOOSE!!! <br><br>  rules are easy /b/ros <br><br>  link to this post so i can find real trips easier <br>  post full steam id always while rolling even reroll <br>  you can reroll 2 more times i'm gonna check that! <br>  post the name of the game you want  <br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/629940366#p629940366">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Reroll</br>  <br>last reroll for DA:O http://steamcommunity.com/id/sunnyg<wbr>97</wbr></br>  <br>Reroll</br>  Yes im a gamer girl<br>Yes im a feminest<br>Yes i work out<br>Yes im a sexual being<br><br><br>SO FUCKING WHAT???<br>im so tried of being harassed by you nerds for playing games or working out as a girl</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> niggers.jpg <br> reposts this thread daily <br>are you even trying/10</br></br></br>      No rekt thread?
