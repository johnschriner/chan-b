Very subtle design and can easily use in public. The only complant I have about it is having the clean out the gunk out after about 6 sessions (10-15 minutes each). Also the oven is somewhat small, doesn't hold the amount that I would like but ohwell. <br><br>I managed to snag the Version 1 of the pax for $200 plus a 10 year warranty, shit so cash.</br></br></br></br>  <br>airrizer solo is hand down the best.. the pax is like the ipod of vapes... it does the job but it expensive for no reason except hte sleek design...</br>  <br>Also on that note, look into the Arizer Solo, decent vape aswell and slightly cheaper.
