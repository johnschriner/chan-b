The sample size I have for my interpretation of drug users is large enough that I feel comfortable in my views.</br>  <br>youre retarded. i know nobody like that who uses drugs. bill gates smokes weed.</br>  <br><br> very close minded <br><br>Welcome to /b/, the site where everythings made up and the points don't matter</br></br></br></br>  <br>You sound like a hipster. However I agree with you on most of these</br>  Niggers  <br>Mind you these were all 13-14 year olds, so they probably built their personas on this stuff around a stereotype, but it doesnt change the fact that this is what it was like, just because you didn't encounter anyone like that, doesn't mean they arent incredible common, hell my entire town has a huge drug problem and everyone here is also like that.</br>  people who think the government is constantly out to get them even though they do nothing illegal  <br> fat people <br>Right I forgot, I dont like these guys either, I'm generally fine with them though, it's the ones who claim that being fat is just 'another body type' and dont actually accept the fact that they are abnormal that bother me, same goes for the members of the lgbt community who promote this idea that 'hetereonormativity' is a bad mindset despite the fact that that is literally what we were designed for from an evolutionary standpoint.</br></br>    religious nuts <br>  sports fanatics  <br>  super opposed to drugs <br>  foodies and people who are super food picky <br>  druggies or weed smokers who try to hard to portray their drug use through their clothing or conversation <br>  people that look down upon weed smoking <br>  cops inb4 edgy <br>  obsessive hbo TV show or any tv/cable series watching and talking about <br>  Instagram hobby spammers and Instagram/Facebook alternate online personas  <br>  dudes who try too hard with their clothing <br>  women who try too hard with their make up </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Funny, because atheists typically have the "my team RULES we worked so hard to WIN" attitude of sports fans.

I haven't got the chance to buy any Metallica eps. just Kill 'Em All.</br>  <br>the actual vinyl?</br>  <br>yeah. the reprints were on the metallica website last time i checked</br>  <br>Yep, bought it before I had even heard them. I had to hear it after seeing the cover. I thought it would be pretty bad actually, but they really surprised me.</br>  <br>the first metallica song i heard was probably enter sandman on the radio. thought it was good but later ended up being the worst metallica song on my list</br>  <br>YOM CHOM CHOM CHOM CHADADADA<br>YOM CHOM CHOM CHOM CHADADADA<br>CHADADADA CHADADADDA <br>Y'TUUN Y'TUUN<br>CH'C'MAOW!</br></br></br></br></br>  motörhead's first album  <br>its 'cool' to dislike metallica lately, but their shit still holds up as kickass tunes.</br>  BEEF BEEF BEEF  <br>well i only dislike some songs of the black album. i love the rest, honestly.</br>  <br>I still listen to the first three. They had very cool sound back then, different than what was out there, and the songs were tough. I miss Cliff.</br>  <br>Metallica is for faggots, Sodom is the only good metal band.</br>  <br>totally man. battery from master and blackened from justice are kickass songs</br>  <br>nice opinion anon</br>  <br>Chronosphere sounds a lot like early thrash metal in my own opinion. Maybe a bit punkier, but still a good listen.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei<wbr>ezWqDGq8</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>i spent way too long trying to figure out which song this was only to realize it was the chorus to jump in the fire. i feel so /b/</br>  <br>OP here, thanks anon. i'll give em a listen</br>  <br>holy shit, you're right.</br>  <br>Another band with some early thrash sound. Intro isn't the strongest, but the rest of the song is brutal.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=I8t<wbr>h5LnfgxY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br><br><br>tallica was one of those bands i first learned about, then "grew out of" then eventually came back to. I agree, theres such a stigma of them with too many metalheads because they are popular. I even came around to liking the load/reload/ st.anger stuff in a different light. I dont listen to those records when i'm listening to the early era and goin nuts with friends, but in the right mood those albums rip in their own way.</br></br></br>  Drawing and shitposting  Draw me a head  If you're taking requests:<br><br>Draw an antelope head butting a jeep through a tree.<br><br>With you in it.</br></br></br></br>  Why aren't you faggots entertaining anymore<br><br>Why are you avataring 100% of the time now<br><br>Why would you make this place like that shit hole dumblr?</br></br></br></br>  Requesting a man doing heroin on a moving rollercoaster  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speci<wbr>al:Random<br>Requesting you personify whatever you get</br></wbr>  <br>Why are you wasting your life in this place when you do nothing but bitch and cry about it?
