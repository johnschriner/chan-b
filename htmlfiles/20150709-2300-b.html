I see you called someone a "faggot" I'm assuming you meant this jokingly, but I've been mulling this over in my head for several days and it does not sit right. Let me please (re)iterate you on this word. Not only does it aim hatred at a large group of people that I myself and many of my friends are a part of, the word has the power to tear down and undermine a fight that we have been fighting for decades. I don't know where you stand on the issue, but I'm assuming you value your rights to equality as a citizen of this country. You may think that this is only a word, a mere configuration of letters, but this word is the foundation that keeps LGBT people held in the depths of inequality, while men like yourself toss around hateful slurs in a joking way thinking immaturely that you are immune to hurting anyone. This is not true. Next time you throw this word out (however jokingly and privately you may thing you are using this- in this era NOTHING is ever private), think about those who have struggled for the right to feel safe in their own country. The word "faggot" creates a hostile environment and makes many LGBT people feel unsafe around those who have enough power in society to use such words. Don't make me feel unsafe. I have a right to my safety. And although I have tremendous pride in being a mature, strong, bisexual woman, it really sucks when your words get in the way of my pride. Thanks for your attention.  <br>stfu faggot</br>  this    <br>This bait fucking sucks.

Very interested in this sort of stuff.</br></br></br>  Because you dipshits won't believe me      What was the key?  <br>It's VEA starting at LINTU, I'm guessing, but it's AVE starting at the beginning</br>  <br>I'm confused now xD It's either AVE or VEA....(however ALOT of keys that are short are incorrect while they are correct, you have to unscramble it) being the one who solved it now I'm questioning the key I got because VEA worked for me at first</br>  <br>yes and AFW worked on this one<br>http://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/vige<wbr>nere.php<br>but not when I used this one<br>http://www.dcode.fr/vigenere-cipher<wbr></wbr></br></br></wbr></br></br>  Ok, original decrypter here, yeah I'm sorry, I used AVE, not sure where VEA came from but now I'm an asshole \o/ oh well I still decrypted it with or without the key xD  How about we get past the point of what the key is, and agree on the ACTUAL message  try doing it by hand, and not doing on a computer, it might take a longer time but you will see what code works  well now that it was solved what was the point in the sigma?  We know this. <br>Key: ( 1.AVE 2.

Maybe leave some emails made just for this occasion for op? As well as contact each other as well?</br>  yes, sounds like a good plan  1.Make email, leave for op, spam thread with : WE DECODED, EMAIL US: etcetcwtfetc, it could REALLY help op,  Maybe even a kikgroup lol, let's make a vote, Emails or Kik, email might be a bit sloppy  <br>I understand how it work, and why Ave is correct in this case, but I am wondering how the clue relates to the key, or how you got the key from the original clue</br>  email is 4chan4087@gmail.com  <br>We can talk about that later, trying to save op :P</br>  someone make a kik group  I say email  <br>this thread's starting to sp00k me</br>  <br>On it<br>-Decrypter</br></br>  easy peasy. <br><br>a=i<br>b=j<br><br>fill the rest, nigga</br></br></br></br></br>  Hey /b. I've been dealing with a lot of shit right now. Two of my friends have killed themselves, along with two of my close relatives being diagnosed with terminal cancer within less than a month. I was irritated with this girl because she didn't respond to a message, and told her to go fuck herself on a whim. I apologized and said I was being irrational because of what was going on, and she completely ignored everything I said and was focused on what a douche I apparently am. I usually don't do this, but can you please fuck with her? I'm very angry that someone can lack compassion in such a large way, especially considering she's one of those people that posts shit on Facebook about supporting suicide survivors and people on Facebook who she doesn't know that are going through rough times.

I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands.

I won't date guy gamers because they are mostly socially retarded and ugly.  <br><br>Great opening line, you fat ugly whore. <br><br>  My boyfriend is a bit of a jock... <br><br>If you had a boyfriend, why would we give a shit what he was/looked like? He is going to be a limp dick faggot no matter what if he is dating a worthless bitch like you.<br><br>  Yes, we do fucking exist.. <br><br>Of course female gamers exist. But anyone who even wants to assume the percentage of females who take gaming seriously is even close to that of men is simply stupid. Women regularly inflate their "gamer" numbers by adding on farmville users from facebook. When a guy says he is a gamer he means he dedicates to it like a hobby, doing things to improve his skill, be a worthwhile member of a team, and committing resources to his cause. When most girls say they are gamers, it is through a gift request for their stupid fucking farm on facebook. <br><br>Are there a few serious gaming girls? Absolutely. But none of them are defending the rest of you because, like any REAL gamer, they see you as the fucking casuals you are. <br><br>  No, I won't show you my tits <br><br>Then you have removed the only thing of value you could bring to this board and you might as well kill yourself.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Nigga thats smitten.  <br/>  <br><br><br><br><br>check em</br></br></br></br></br>    Samich...

You'll find several CD like disks in there. Break them all because they trigger the locking mechanism. When they're broken the HDD resets and you can use it normally.  Deleting system32 should unlock it.  ParrotOS or Backtrack should give you a start on getting past encryption if it's weak or you have knowledge in cryptography.  <br>here is the key bro</br>  this is what i mean by get it open, it won't initialize  <br>Corrupted then, that's why it was left on the bus.<br><br>Run linux from a flash drive and get more details about the partition.</br></br></br>  won't partition, won't turn online  <br>I cant fucking stand when i forget my hdd on the buss.

Delete that and you should be able to access whatever is on that drive.  <br>if its picking up the drive theres a chance its not corrupted or broken, but just formatted in an unsupported way (prolly EXT4)<br><br>boot linux from thumb drive and get some more info on it</br></br></br>  1. Just download Bootit Baremetal <br>2. make a bootable USB or CD with BBM<br>3. Startup from this USB or CD<br>4. Go to "partition manager".<br>5. Choose problem HDD<br>6. If "error" , try other setting change "BUS" into "BIOS direct" i.s.o. "BIOS" (upper left dropdown box in partiton screen)<br>7. Now choose "change disk type" and make it something else (change MBR into GPT) (this will lead to destruction of any unwanted DOS partitions, just "delete" + "clear boot sector" did not suffice for me)<br>8.

I mean, it makes you attracted to the same sex which means you can't reproduce. How is this not a mental illness, when you are doing something that it totally against human nature and evolution of the human species? Serious question though, discuss. <br><br> inb4 b8 <br>Not b8.</br></br></br>  It is a mental sickness, but its basically harmless. Letting Gays go off and do what they want is more cost effective and humane than offering treatment to a bunch of depressed people.  <br><br>You ignore everything said and that is a strong basis for your citations right.<br><br> the population will continue increasing. <br><br>So you are implying gays are saving the world from overpopulation. BUT (BUTT) this has never been a factor in the history of time. You literally pull a dick out of your ass with words on it.<br><br>And you began "present this simple fact"<br><br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/626789308#p626807202">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It is not harmless. It is an abomination.<br><br>eg. Jenner cutting off it's dick because emotionally can't cope with reality. This did affect the mindset of people all around the world. Most people went ugh wtf... that's the useful response. Reject cutting off dicks on all levels, sure. Smart. But some people for eg. thought ohh that's wonderful, now he/she can be his/her true he/she that they always wanted.<br><br>The issue was not fixed. All that happened was a dick got cut off. The issue was emotional struggles which happen to be God's specialty. Guess why He's expert.
