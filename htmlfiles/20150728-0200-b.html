[ Alright /b/. I just found this by work. Any idea what it is?  Here's the serial and a better view of the plug.  Great fingerbox you found bro!  <br>Black box maby?</br>  <br>It could also be a cúptö Vintage finger box</br>  <br>Looks like some kind of mag lock</br>  <br>That japanese from the early 80's? I didn't know that they where around?! Looks like an electronic model</br>  <br><br>I only wish. I've hear of the chrome ones but never seen one. I doubt this is it. No finger hole.<br><br>I don't think so. I can plug in the headphone jack but there's no power source so it doesn't work.</br></br></br></br>  NEW Pokemon MMO<br>Pokemon Revolution Online!<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=9IG<wbr>UP--6nFE</wbr>  [ ]<br><br><br>The game is currently in testing phase, but the full release is in the next 1-2 weeks from now!<br>JOIN TODAY, AND TEST THE GAME!</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If only you gave us a link</br>  http://pokemon-revolution.net/  <br>And a less faggy title.</br>  <br>This game looks better than the original games. I really hope developers finish it</br>  The developers will finish in 1-2weeks bro, it's been under development for almost a year.  <br>Any info on how many players are currently playing?</br>  At this very second, it's under maintenance.<br>But when the server is open again it's gonna be like 200 spots for people to test.<br>When full game will release, you can excpect 1000 spots.</br></br>  <br>Do you know how long will the maintenance last? Sorry for all the questions, but at least I'm bumping the thread.</br>  <br>play pokemmo you spastics</br>   Member exclusive areas <br>Fucking jews.</br>  <br>I just downloaded that, registered account and cannot log into game.<br>"the server is currently locked".</br></br>  Maximum 1 hour i guess, but you can do something else while waiting :) <br>My ING is Blue btw if you ever need help.<br><br>PokeMMO is dead and shit, PRO is next level!</br></br></br>  TO ANYONE THAT CAN'T GET IN:<br>SERVER MAINTENANCE ATM!<br>You can go to IRC on forums and chill while waiting.</br></br>  http://pokemon-revolution.net/PROFo<wbr>rum/<br><br>Get on in the chat before i get on in ya guts</br></br></wbr>  You might want to post to /vp/ instead of /b/ due to the amount of trolls around here.  This shit looks like 100000&amp; better than that fucking PokeMMO thing. Just,wich generations range has this game? from 1 to 6?  <br><br>What pokemans are at start?<br>Can I start game with my favorite - growlithe? Or I have to choose from few available at start?</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Are you a developer or something? <br><br>You don't seem to know how to use 4chan too well lmao. Try going on /vp/, but learn how to post first.</br></br></br></br></br>  Check the membership benefits, typical pay to win. shame  <br>I watched a video of someone playing and it's classic Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtle choice</br>  <br>where, link ?</br>  couldn't think of a name so i just used cirno  <br>this is the only thinkg i got and its not such a big deal. <br>There is not much of a difference between those two. As a non donator you are able to earn Coins in the game by putting some portion of effort. You can get a membership status by using coins as well. Donators may be given special areas for them and certain uniforms. However, you will be able to catch same Pokemon as they can but somewhere else.</br></br>  <br><br>Bonus 50% EXP!<br>Double Money Gained!<br>Access to Members Only Areas<br>Access to Members Only Pokemon!<br>Access to unique Members Only Clothes, Hats and Mounts!</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>wait isnt it like illegal to make money off of this?<br><br>since they kinda dont own the IP and shit</br></br></br>  <br>I personally think<br><br>is a good idea.<br><br>Games like WoW, Hearthstone and numerous other games make money from ingame boosts/items, why shouldn't you? Power to you. <br><br>If i like your game I will donate for sure.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  "There should be 'PRO64_Data'<br>folder next to the executable"<br><br>When they are both in the same folder. what to do?</br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure they don't have a licence to this. And since they're earning money from this, the game will be shut down a few weeks after it's released.</br>  <br>Yeah it is. That's why he's advertising on 4chan because he doesn't want attention probably.</br>  <br>This. It'll receive a C&amp;D so hard, it won't even be allowed at the concept level anymore.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Yes this is 100% illegal. Any profit made off this is profiting off Nintendo IP and copyright. <br><br>While Pokemmo is shit, it goes off fully from donations run on another site.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>fuck already signed up and was starting to wait, waste of time</br>  <br>Assuming we don't have permission to make this game. We wouldn't put in all this time and effort if we didn't have certain assurances.</br>  <br>So there's a loophole where game is technically free and donations are not considered as earning from the product?</br>  pokeMMO has been around for 4 years and you think this is illegal?<br>Nah man, you can go somewhere else if you believe someone would develop that long for an illegal purpose..</br>  <br>hhaha you're scared<br><br>If nintendo licensed this shit we would have known<br><br><br><br><br><br>So can we report this to NoA somehow?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the game is shit, pay to win, and im contacting nintendo right now so they sue your ass off for making money off their IP. Enjoy.</br>  I've already seen this shit when a certain s4league private server was made. They did a +50% ap from a purchase,than the day after it closed,so all the players that donated,got basically scammed lmao  <br>Write Reggie an email</br>  The pic of in game looks exactly like PokeMMO  <br>Why would you report it? Even if it is illegal, just let people play until Nintendo finds out about this. But as the guy before me said, they probably wouldn't develop it for a year and longer if there was a chance they'll get sued.</br>  <br>its illegal if you try to get money from it, OP<br><br>Nintendo doesn't just hand out IP, fuck off with your bullshit</br></br></br>  <br>Scared.</br>  <br>Why would I be scared? I couldn't care less if they got sued. Would I like to play the game? Yes. Will I feel sad if they get sued? No.</br>  <br> So can we report this to NoA somehow? <br>Yes, scroll to the bottom of this link.<br><br>https://www.nintendo.com/corp/legal<wbr>.jsp</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Unless they were completely retarded and are attempting to sell their shitty pokemon game to the public.<br><br>the Pokemon Company wont even allow support for pokemon amiibo out of smash, no way they licensed this garbage</br></br></br>  <br>Tell that to the people who were making that updated Super Mario 64 rom that was going to be free that got a quick C&amp;D shortly before completion.<br><br>Only way this continues is if Gamefreak's taking it all for themselves.</br></br></br>  PokeMMO is still Online, and it's been since 2012 and has been taking donations for the servers to keep running for almost 4 years now. You really think Nintendo cares?  <br>Why do people still think it's a good idea to make threads like this on /b/. You're just asking for this to happen.</br>  The battle system looks pretty shitty, but anyway seems to be a good game  <br>Donations on a separate site that goes right to the dev and offers no in-game bonus.</br>  <br>Relax, nothing happened to PokeMMO and nothing will happen to PRO.</br>  <br>Yeah, donations for the servers, that is strictly for keeping it running<br><br>these revolution assholes are saying HEY POKEMON FANS GIVE US MONEY FOR BONUS EXP.<br><br>no where does it say those profits are going to the server, its just the gay creators wanting to get rich</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you ever played PokeMMO (which you still can)<br>You register, download the game, and then you can see a donate button which grants following:<br>25% more xp and cash<br>10% increased shiny encounter<br>And even ingame points you can buy tons of items with.<br><br>PRO doesent do that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This. And as soon as Nintendo finds out about this, they'll shut the game down and take all the money they got from gullible fools.</br>  Nice.  <br>kek</br>  AHhahah<br><br>Should i really give you 5 bucks for a game that is not even in beta,risking a rollback when the game will be fully released,so i can lose all the items i got since the moment i given you those 5 fucking bucks? <br><br>Lmao fk u man,this is a common scamm when many people start to search for a private server of a certain game</br></br></br></br>  <br>PokeMMO has been running for 4years, and they have similar donate benefits..<br>25% more xp and cash<br>10% increased shiny encounter<br>And even ingame points you can buy tons of items with.</br></br></br></br>  <br>can i gibe 5 euro instead?</br>  <br>i cant wait for them to be sued so hard they are tyrones new bitchboi.<br><br>Pic related is op in a year</br></br></br>  <br>Well, how else are they going to earn the money before they get shut down?</br>  <br>You're money greedy fags, find another way to make people support your game without it being pay to win. scum creators i hope your game dies</br>  <br>The game is free you fucking retard, you don't HAVE to purchase membership. Nobody told you that.</br>  <br>Yes, but if you do, you'll become unbeatable. I hate pay to win games</br>  <br>idk why are you trying to defend your shilled up game on here when its nintendo's lawyers you are going to have to answer to. You think its ok to make money off another companies franchise? Holy shit you are dumb.</br>  <br><br>As i said i've already seen this scamm before <br><br>The basic concept of these scam is "Give those people what the original game doesnt offer". In this case a mmo with many functions that the original game doesnt like costumization,insta trade and whatevr the fuck they do.<br><br><br><br>I fucking know you stupid dipshit. Im saying that this type of scamm has become quite common in the last years</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  How many ice pokemon are in game?  <br>yeah but people who do will have a gay advantage. BS game awful</br>  <br>Nobody ever managed to shut down PokeMMO, Why is that then? :) <br>Good luck</br></br>  <br>And how is the server supposed to run without donations being made then?<br>And why would people donate if theres no benefits at all...?</br></br>  <br>It's gone in a month</br>  <br>Maybe you should state what the donations are for?</br>  <br>because they dont pocket the money, you thick headed fuck.<br><br>everyone help report this shit here <br>piracyscene@noa.nintendo.com</br></br></br></br>  <br>You think PRO does? <br>Everything goes to keeping the server UP.<br>Gl Mr.Lawyer</br></br></br>  <br>Hmm have you not seen other games that have ways to support the developers without it being pay to win? Aesthetics are a big thing, just make shit look cool for a price or something. Just things that dont affect the actual gameplay or give unfair advantages. there are many things like this that you could add.</br>  <br><br>Yeah,but pokemmo does run based on roms,and nintendo policy states that roms are illegal,so based on what you are saying,we should report them too</br></br>  <br>You think Nintendo didn't find out about a game played by hundreds of thousands players in the last 4 years? Holy shit you are stupid and this is one of the many reasons trolls like you are not to be taken seriously.</br>  <br><br>That doesn't make any sense you fucking retarded. Please read b4 posting bs</br></br>  <br> goes on 4chan to shill his pay to win game <br> doesnt expect trolls <br> gets btfo <br> gets reported to nintendo <br> going to get his ass sued for millions <br> getting scared as fuck <br> trying to argue with trolls as if they matter <br><br>Holy shit dude you are pathetic</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  We shall find out soon enough if this is legit or not, kek.  <br>And you are retarded if you believe any of what you just wrote.</br>  <br>shame shame shame shame shame shame shame shame shame shame shame shame shame shame shame shame shame shame shame shame shame shame shame shame shame shame shame shame shame shame shame shame shame shame shame shame shame shame shame shame shame shame shame shame shame shame shame shame</br>    <br>Pokemmo does not provide the roms, and the server doesnt use a rom to run (which is why everyone that plays must get their own)<br>PokeMMO essentially is just a fancy emulator that runs from a server</br></br>    <br><br/></br>  <br>Sweet meme you fag how long did you spend in windows paint to make that</br>  <br>oh and the official policy is "you should make a rom from your own copy of the game"</br>  <br> meme <br> windows paint </br></br>  <br>longer than you did cropping a screenshot and blowing it up</br>  <br> how long did you spend in windows paint to make that <br>holy shit how new are you? that image is almost as old as 4chan</br></br>   mfw OP about to get buttfucked by Nintendo   Then only reason gun laws haven't changed yet is because AMERICA IS FULL OF REDNECK MUUH MURICA MUHH CONSTITUTION OH MUUH FREEEDOMM in there is no logical defence for gun laws not being changed.  the b8 is strong in this one.<br>lets see you and your gf get raped by niggers and not have a concealed carry licence to protect yourself. liberal bastard.</br>  Its not the guns, it's the people.  <br>Again assholes, its got nothing to do with being liberal.<br>I am liberal, all my friends are liberal, and we have more guns than any of you redneck inbred Republican retards</br></br>  <br>fuck off. you know damn well most liberal politicians are pushing anti-gun laws. my general statement is widely seen as true and for that you can suck my republican gun totin money making corporate dick</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=t4O<wbr>SKZ1Qaus</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>This sums it all up faggots.</br></br>  You do realise, if guns are illegal that's not gonna stop people from getting tor or some shit and buying an ak47...  <br>please refer to my original post. watch your wife or girlfriend get raped then we'll see what your views are.</br>  <br>just watch the whole thing</br>  <br>call them leftists, not liberals</br>  <br>Well. here's the math and the statistics<br><br> USA  <br>Population: 318.9 million<br>OPs Claimed Deaths: 9,484<br>2014 Data: 12,551<br>Gun death ratio: 0.00003935716 (12,551/318.9 million)<br><br> Canada <br>Population 35.16 million<br>OP's Gun Deaths 200<br>2014 Facts 178<br>Gun Death Ratio: 0.000005<br><br> Germany <br>Population 80.62 million<br>OP's Gun Deaths 194<br>2014 Stats 81<br>Gun death ratio: 0.000001<br><br>I think you call can see the trend here.<br><br>POPULATION DIFFERENCES</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   relative that lives in Israel was telling me a story once of how his friend was burglarized in his home <br> robbers charged at him with a knife, he defended himself in his own home with his gun, killing the robbers <br> calls cops, tells story <br> in the end he gets charged with manslaughter and gets life in prison for defending himself due to the BS anti-gun laws in Israel <br><br>Be glad you're in America faggit</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Then only reason <br> Then </br></br>  <br>I am, watching it right now. It's funny, and informative. He's making some good points. We are catering to the 1% of fuckwits which is sad, and unfortunately if guns are banned the bad and the crazies will still obtain them in one form or another.</br>  <br>That and the fact that the government makes money off of people dying etc. Ayy lmao u dumb amerifags think your government is protecting you but they don't give a shit about you as long as they are in power, have money, and the people are complacent enough to control</br>  <br>what kind of world do you live in where you're constantly worried about your house being broken into and your family/gf raped? Sounds like Iraq or Afghanistan.</br>   Guns murdered   <br>however it would make it harder and more expensive for them to attain</br>  <br>That means the US still has a gun death ratio 8 times that of Canada though.</br>  <br>USA 0.00004 (4 0s) <br>Canada 0.000005 (5 0s)<br>Canada 0.000001 (5 0s)<br>So amerifags kill ~10x as many amerifags than hosers kill hosers or nazis kill nazis.<br><br>So the real trend is amerifags can't be trusted with guns. tbh I wouldn't trust them with scissors.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe not Russian mob bosses. But it just may stop Darnel from getting a pistol when he can't afford to eat out 2 nights a month. Illegal weapons quickly become very pricey when you can't get a 50-cal from Toys-R-Us</br>  LOL @ Guns did this!  <br>"No logical defense"? Seriously, you want to use that line in our nation's (USA's) line of politics? You ever follow the line of thinking of those who make laws, speak and even make policies here in the USA? You have the right wing who are Anti-Christ in the biblical way recruiting Jesus Christ followers to their side through capitalism and you have the left wing... everyone else as having the least power over the USA because they speak the mind of everyone... but most are not registered to vote because most hate the government and the elite (although most want to be them).</br>  <br>America. Where fuckwits roam free. Lets give niggers free money for their 11 kids, they buy an illegal firearm, kill a family of four for their money so he can fund his dream of owning a "tap house". <br><br>Our government is fucked and we know it, some cunts don't which is irritating as they are the ones that's running us into the found.<br><br>Not true. I actually went to Australia for a year after high school just to explore the world and even with exchange rates i could still purchase a .45 for under $1000 USD. Its easy no matter where you are.<br><br>Fuck off canada is a bunch of french pussies. "oh sorry didnt mean to look at ya sur have good day" It shows nothing. Crime rates in america are high due to many things, one is like i said government funding those in poverty. <br><br>Which country do you live in by chance? I'm sure your police force must be absolutely amazing, much like ours! There are more cops killing civilians now than ever. Months ago we passed last years cop kill count and we are on the verge of tripling it. So yes, fuck you and your pussy country.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Am I the only Australian that read this thread, and was surprised that there was actually 35 guns here??  <br>Its too fucking early to argue and spellcheck. Eat my proud American dick</br>  <br>Or you know... just avoid the niggerish areas, then you should be all goods</br>  <br>So much this. Lived in one of the "worst" areas of a city in AU, literally never feared anything enough to need a gun in my life. The idea of every "lawful citizen" having the power to kill scares me a fuck load more than ever getting broken into and gang rapped.</br>  Also, just saying this because i know it's true, im not going to change any of your minds. I know this. But open your eyes.<br><br>Great argument. Don't get shot by avoiding poor areas. Which, coincidentally, is being made more popular by the democratic government with welfare, food stamps, housing, etc. They are controlling us more than ever because people dont want to work for their money. Just my 2 cents worth here. Take it how you will.<br><br><br><br>Dont forget how your country came to be. It was literally founded by criminals. What's your argument now</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>like if you agree</br>  <br> 'knows' It's b8 <br> takes the b8 like a whore. </br></br>  <br>1) Guess<br>2) No it's corrupt as shit (clue #1)<br>3) Data pls<br>4) Data pls<br>5) You're proud to be an americunt? Wow. You shouldn't be.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>for a country founded by criminals there sure isnt a lot of gun deaths. Perhaps its our sane weapons laws?<br><br>Also seriously. You havnt got a pistol strapped to your leg 24/7. If niggers bust through your door (which statistically, should be pretty rare) i doubt youll have time to whip put your piece before you and your family are beaten to death</br></br></br>  I'm Canadian and I have a few guns I use for hunting deer/coyote. I don't know how easy it is for Americans but here I had to go through a paper/hands-on course, criminal background check, the whole 9. Would many Americans be against this process? If so why?  <br>Not trying to sound all "poor me" but when i was younger i was mugged with my family in a major city. (Pittsburgh) Three men with knives demanded everything we had, clothing too. A passerby saw it, and he was a concealed carry permit holder, he pulled out his gun and the men fled. Had it not been for him with his GUN i may not be alive today. So yes i am a supporter of the second amendment right.<br><br>We do have background checks, for responsible owners. Criminals get them from the black market, which will never be stopped.</br></br></br>  <br> in one year <br><br>What year? The year could be 1999 and have nothing to do with nowadays?<br><br>If the year is even figured out, want to give us some statistics on how many people were killed by stabbings?<br><br>The UK has gun laws, and people get shanked, stabbed, and murdered all the time. Gun prohibition won't solve violence, it just brings a different kind of fuck up.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I do know its bait, however just because Australia was dumb enough to eliminate guns doesn't mean he should shove his gunless dick down our throats.</br>  <br>im sorry for your experience. However, i do feel safer knowing that the majority of this populace does not have easy access to firearms. <br>Here, the only people that feel the need to arm themselves are criminals, and that's to combat other criminals.<br><br>There hasn't been a major firearm related massacre in Australia since Port Arthur (1996), and that's entirely due to the government stepping in and passing sensible weapons licensing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If they're getting them on the black market why do them libs want new gun laws? Or are they just plain retarded</br>   This entire thread <br><br> "Im european look how progressive i am jajajajajajaja xD" </br></br>  Hahahha fucking rednecks... I can walk around any area in city I live in ... In Australia... And not even have to carry a knife for protection. Only protection I carry is a condom... Just in case I run into a scared little american that feels lost with out his gun. Bunch of fags  <br>I do understand those statistics. Do you ever go shooting? Like on a firing range? It is genuinely fun. Its not completely about home defence and self protection, but it is a large part of it. Hunting can also be put in the category of fun, whether for sport or for sustenance.<br><br>kek</br></br></br>  <br>You're a fucking idiot, we don't have the massive nigger problem in Aus or as much mental illness. <br><br>Shall not be infringed Ameribros</br></br></br>  So many Australians giving that americunt shit in this thread<br><br>lovingit.jpg</br></br>  <br>I was in the ADF for 4 years out of school and loved going to the range. I have nothing against firearms or legitimate firearm owners. <br><br>I think our weapons laws arn't perfect, but they do seem to do what was intended : keep weapons out of the hands of the crazies.</br></br></br>  <br>Much love Ausbro.<br><br>And that's the sole problem, I do truly believe that every single gun owner in america should be required to take a mandatory psych evaluation to see if they are competent to own a firearm. Sure this wont stop all criminals, but at least it will cut back on mentally ill psychos from being able to purchase one</br></br></br>  <br>No they don't <br><br>Perhaps you remember the bikie war 2 years ago? Every major city had fatal shoot outs except Perth and Darwin<br><br>Or how about the lindt cafe? How did that crazy get a gun?<br><br>The fact is gun laws only prevent law abiding citizens from getting guns, the exact people who should get guns</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe try banning/removing dindus instead, I bet the murder rate would plummet.</br>  <br>You have a fellow Aus on our side. Rekt cunt</br>  <br>right because all of those involved massacres...<br><br>I lived on the Gold Coast during the 'bikie wars' and the most violent event (royal pines shootout) didnt even kill anyone. <br><br>The Lindt cafee ordeal was completely blown out of proportion by the media. Only 2 people died and 1 was shot by the cops.<br><br>check your facts m8</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>No facts to be checked, There were murders, with guns, from a country with a gun ban. Need i say more?</br>  I recommend watching these<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=9pO<wbr>iOhxujsE</wbr>  [ ]<br>There is three in the series</br></br>  <br>Sounds like how it is here in Ausfailia, fucking retarded. There is a few minor political parties/lobbyists pushing to have it changed so you can lawfully defend your self when threatened on your own property, but they just don't have the numbers/power to get anything done.</br>    Wow you think guns shouldn't be banned? OKAY let me get this straight: if there was no guns; so many people would still be alive. Fuckin guitarist Darrell Dimebag died by someone bringing a gun to his concert and shooting him!<br><br>So if you want to kill someone it is more fuckin personal rather than just pulling a fuckin trigger at them and BOOM they are dead without you thinking if you "should" kill them or not.<br><br>1 second it takes to kill someone with a gun, more than a minute to strangle someone.. btw as for being in army/military thats a different story..<br><br>So bad people won't have guns/good people won't have guns. Either side will have to accept the consequences for their actions than using a 1 second killing thing.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I stand by my original statement.<br><br>Crims use guns to kill crims. That happenes everywhere, regardless of firearm laws. <br><br>Australia hasnt had a massacre since Port Arthur due to sensible weapons licensing.<br><br>Anyone that says different is a peanut and belongs in the 'should not be allowed to own a gun' category.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A fellow Aus also can't do basic maths? There's a fucking surprise.<br><br>Go finish elementary school retard.</br></br></br>  <br>Proly because we know all to well in Australia how well gun control works. Thanks Howard, you stupid cunt, for wasting all that tax payer money on useless buybacks that did nothing to quell crime.<br><br>Sure is nice to be constantly shit on by the media and law enforcement for being a law abiding gun owner, meanwhile in Perth, criminals just make their own fully automatic sub-machine guns not giving a fuck about legislation. Criminals gonna criminal.</br></br></br>  i think trying to remove guns from Americans is not a great idea. I don't understand the culture or how dangerous and easy it is to be killed over there, so I can't really say, but I would still think that minimalising the guns people actually have access to would help somewhat. Have a sidearm for protection, sure, but I don't see the need for semi-automatic assault weapons and the like. That's just my perspective. Frankly, I don't give a shit if the law changes or not.  <br> muh feelings <br> I'm scared <br><br>This is the basis of all leftist policy.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Only 2 people died  <br><br>the one that was shot by the gunman was the only one who tried to do anything to stop him the other was shot by the cops and you're saying it's a good system<br><br>bunch of pussies in this country <br><br>Also Pt. Arthur was a psyop</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>lol<br>  You: "did nothing" <br>  OP: 35 gun deaths / year </br></br></br>  Stupid Murican trying to hold his 2 hot dogs: "The gun statistics of USA are a lie, much less people have died then they say!"<br><br>You seem to ignore the Australian gun statistics, with how little people have died and do die every every year compared to America.<br><br>Anyway governments do want to minimize population control anyway..</br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope you get the chance one day to be a hero. Im sure many people will mourn your death.<br><br> Port Arthur was a psyop <br><br>Tinfoil hat detected.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You've made no logical defense for changing gun laws, you british piece of shit.</br>  <br>The majority of gun crime is done with handguns, you just bought into the "scary assault rifle" propaganda</br>  <br>You nigger can't count. Merica still has 8 times higher gun death ration than canada. Faggot.</br>  <br>How many people is "many people" though? By that definition two is many people. We are both, believe it or not, on the same side. (Keep guns out of the hands of crazies)<br><br>Exactly, and look at our pops. We have a much higher population, therefore it would be counter productive to rid of guns.<br>Unrelated, the captcha's with the fucking street signs are really shafting me</br></br></br></br>  <br>Again, look at the population difference.<br>MORE FUCKING STREET SIGNS FUCK</br></br>  <br>So what?<br>You ignore your own numbers. Its normal that more population means more gun-deaths. However, Murrica's gun-deaths are abnormally higher than the average, PER FUCKING CITIZEN you nigger. Stop baiting me you whore.</br></br>  Guns should be legal because I should be able to collect anything I want.<br> I have a collection of alcohol bottles.  <br> I could break them on peoples' heads then stab them with the shattered remains <br>Whether or not it's a "deadly weapon" isn't the issue.<br>it is absolutely wrong to take my guns from me; I would never use them to kill, just as I would never use my bottles to kill.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Being this retarded must be painful.</br>  <br>I was trying to appeal to the masses of 'sensible' Americans but I guess there's no safe fence to sit on in a gun debate. I like Australia's gun laws whereby rifles and shotguns, large and easily detectable and identifiable weapons, are the easiest to get and handguns are strictly for use by security guards and police.</br>  <br>Its genuinely not b8 m8. If canada had a pop of 320mil then your rates would be exactly the same. No argument needed. Its society now you cannot stop it</br>  <br>Why don't you actually look into it. <br><br>The only 2 police officers within responding range were called away to investigate "jars of heroin" on a beach less than hour before the shooting occured.<br><br>Did Bryant set that up?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They're not wrong. <br>STREET. SIGNS. COCK.</br></br>  <br>the ease in which you could conduct a bottle smashing and stabbing massacre, combated to that of a firearm massacre is disproportionate.<br><br> i should be able to collect anything i want <br><br>Collect some books and get educated you NRA shill</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>not the dude you're responding to but relevant: i've been through all of the Port Arthur conspiracy theory shit. it's pretty messed up and makes it easy to question a lot of it. like his last stand in the house - there was apparently someone there with him or something. i've been through all the footage of the dead as well. pretty messed up.</br>  <br>very possibly. Its also possible that the moon landings were false or that JFK was assassinated by the Pope.<br><br>Still makes you a tinfoil hat</br></br></br>  <br>Just let them have guns it thins out the population of niggers and idiots.</br>  <br>You do realize you're more likely to get killed (accidental or voluntary) than saved because of the civilians with firearms right? <br>No? <br>Ah right, retarded American pussy shitting himself because he thinks he's gonna get a home invasion then will end up shooting his drunk son.</br></br></br>  <br>Just like our sandy hook fiasco. Staged for the sole purpose of gun laws being pushed through. look it up, im not wrong.<br><br>are you with me or trying to go against my ideas? if so you did a great job at proving all of my points, thanks anon<br>STREET. SIGNS.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If I read the right books I can orchestrate a massacre with chemistry knowledge. Illegalize books?<br>I can kill the same number of people with a propane bomb as an assault weapon. Illegality propane?<br>If James holmes had used a bomb instead of a rifle, he could have killed the whole theatre.</br></br></br>  <br>Exactly, both of Bryant's guns were damaged so much they couldn't do ballistics tests to match the bullets and yet he somehow he was firing at the police seiging him.<br><br><br>You are a little coward too scared to look at the evidence because the truth would destroy your statist illusion that the goverment cares about you and has your best interests at heart.</br></br></br></br>  <br>9484 in a country with a population of roughly 329,000,000 and 140,000,000 gun owners breaks down into 0.0000297304% of the population. Gun violence is by definition a very rare occerance.</br>  I'd like to refer you to the picture four spots above your post. eat that dick you auscunt.<br>another street sign. yay</br>  <br>No it would not be the same and you proved it. Gun-death ration means it is normalized per citizen. Learn2math you mongoloid.</br>  <br>again, refer to the picture above. rekt</br>   no good response for why I shouldn't be able to collect guns.  <br>Does anyone really believe it's easier to kill 100 people with a gun than a bomb?</br>  <br>i looked into that as well, not as in-depth though. i didn't find as much to make me think it was a setup and the theory that no one was actually at the school at the time is kinda paper thin. i'll never find out the truth to that so i don't really care too much.<br><br><br>either way, whatever the dude was up to, he was one fucked up cunt<br><br><br>actually, it's 3.5~ per 100,000 people. in contrast, Canada is 2.22 per 100,000 people.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ask a paki</br>  <br>The people murdering each other are going to get guns illegally anyways. They'd be more bold to use them if they knew chances were your an average citizen with no gun(cuz muh gun laws) and rob or kill you anyways. I agree with you</br>  <br>he wasn't alone<br><br>[spoiler]he got to bring friends[/spoiler]</br></br></br>  <br>Yes thank you for your propaganda</br>  <br>Propaganda lol. You are the one eating propaganda like a /b/tard and doritos. If you dont agree with it check the stats yourself, check the national sources, they'll all confirm.</br>  <br>it's easy to find images that support your side of the argument</br>  <br>all you have to do is google your argument</br>  <br>You're retarded. There are no real stats. Cool US has less violent crimes than UK but guess what, it's also way more lethal. I'd rather get my ass kicked four times than just be dead. Just my opinion.</br>  <br>Re: point #3<br><br>Better recheck that maths buddy<br><br/></br></br></br></br>  Since assault weapons are such a huge problem in america why don't we do this instead!<br><br>The fingerprinting smart guns are a good first step, but they still leave open a lot of room for abusive by an authorized user. I propose that guns should not only need biometric unlocks, but also that the user should need to call up 911 and have the operator remotely unlock the gun for use it they concur the user is in a legimate life threatening situation. Also, mandating cameras attached to all weapons, especially concealed carry ones, which record and transmit to a cloud storage.<br><br>Guns should also have a feature whereby they can only fire if they are pressed against the target. This will prevent mentally unstable men from killing children at long range.<br><br>Magazine limits are common sense, but also the first round loaded should be required to be a warning foam round. The foam rounds used by police forces are effective, but still require training to use safely, so the mandatory civilian foam rounds should be much less dense, and not designed to inflict pain, but to make sure an attacker 100% knows there is a gun present and give them a chance to flee- thus reducing overall gun deaths.<br><br>We should should also license free thought and speech. We can control the spread of bad ideas by putting biometric scanners on all computers, cell phones, video game consoles so that certain ideologies cant spread.<br><br>Obviously dangerous speech and ideas are easily concealed in various ways, so all information about our populace will be public record and searchable.<br><br>All people should have an override put into their voice box so that they can have their voices muted if they start saying something potentially hurtful or expressing dangerous ideas.<br><br>Help me come up with some progressive ideas that will help me target the greatest killer of this or any other century. I know with some time we can stamp out dangerous free speech and ideas as well.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you can develop that, you will likely be one of the richest men in the world.</br>  <br>about 9000 of those are nigger on nigger, take them out of the equation and we have gun crime comparable to Latvia or some shit. we have a nigger problem, not a gun problem.</br>  <br>Those who don't want laws against firearms because they're allowed in the Constitution are as stupid as those who believe everything written in the Bible or the Quran.</br>  <br>like europe being compared with the YOO ES AY<br>right?<br><br>face it - only jamaica, that beautiful land of paradise and relaxation (endless murder, rape, torture) tops america</br></br></br></br>  <br>oh fug, capped<br><br> one day this won't be satire </br></br></br>  <br>sorry, i checked the wrong column. Canada's homicide rate is actually much lower, 0.51 people per 100,000</br>  <br>Main problem with this image:<br><br> 200,000 times a year WOMEN use a gun to DEFEND against sexual abuse. <br><br>That's right.<br>America lets women touch guns.<br>America lets women use deadly force against a minor inconvenience.<br><br>"He touched my arm in a crowded train!!!" BLAM<br><br>Thank you guns!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>:) This!</br>  <br>Rekt</br>  <br>Not entirely but it does prevent timmy the spaz with aspergers letting loose in a cinema</br>  Average american protecting his girlfriend or wife from rape.  <br>In Brazil, the laws says that everyone can have a gun: 42.416 kills</br>  <br>why did car deaths go down so suddenly in 2006?<br><br>is that when 'Cars' was released in the cinema, and everyone developed an affection for them, so avoided 'hurting' them.</br></br></br>  <br>haha<br><br>the only thing i can possibly think of is advancement in vehicle safety</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks for drawing my attention to it.<br><br>haha<br>I look forward to this future.<br>Is there a way we can mute all computer messages too?<br>Perhaps in the way that microsoft allows multiplayer of its in built games in windows.<br>A carefully selected handul of preset phrases such as:<br>"Hi how are you"<br>"I'm fine"<br>"Your turn"<br>"Bye nice to meet you".<br><br>Most conversations could be covered by 20 phrases or so.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you even maths? Rate is rate, if the population is bigger, rate is the same.

The problem is give guns to muric... retards?</br>  <br><br>There's plenty of non lethal force that would suffice in that situation.

It's becasue of the Johnnys that we need laws in the first place... Society is only as good as it's weakest link  If we didn't have so many blacks and Mexicans there would be even fewer gun deaths. White america isn't the problem, white america needs to be armed against these minority pieces of shit.  Yeah white america needs to shoot up churches and cinemas... Your point?  <br>exactly</br>  If you didn't have so many readily available guns in the population... You would not have such a big problem... But hey... I can't see how american logic works.  <br>so true<br><br>Only the police and military should have cars</br></br></br>  <br>If that's what you think I am saying then you don't understand what gun control is in the first place you knobjockey</br>  <br>not in this statistic: the number of lives saved or defended with weapons.</br>  <br>no your argument is flimsy. you lack the basic understanding of human nature.</br>  Hahaha... Nice anon  <br>A rose, by any other name, would throw the country from a capitalist utopia into a socialist hellhole where feelings have value.</br>  Why the fuck does anyone have the right to tell me what to do? If we got rid of the niggers and low intelligence people, brought back eugenics, the world-and humanity could be amazing.  If guns are outlawed only outlaws will have guns.  <br>9484 of which 9000 were nigger ghetto gangbangers. <br>Pretty decent considering it's the only country where you can actually own a gun and defend yourself with it. <br>I'd rather see an increase in gun related incidents than take away the ability of law abiding citizens to defend themselves with guns. <br>Laws have consequences, yes there are trade always offs, but hey, who gives a shit about reality, when there's a nirvana fallacy to peddle.</br></br></br></br>  I still don't see the flimsy argument... U.S.a ranks up there with shittiest 3rd world countries with gun deaths... So either the us is a 3rd world shithole or your people need to sort out gun control  <br> spot the edgy kid </br>    <br>Newsflash. The government does not care about you. The government is comprised of individuas making decisions to improve their specific welfare.<br> Muh conspiracies <br>It far more logical that people are dumb, and are not in league with one another.

Yet you lot do not see this even when saying "I need a gun to protect my self and my wife from the rapist blacks and spics". Seems the blacks and spics could do a great job on fucking the us. No need for the euros  <br>Wrong on EVERY count.<br>But you won't factor that in, will you?<br>Obama wants to kill your grandparents!!</br></br></br>  <br>So it's up to individuals to protect themselves<br><br>therefore they the right to arms<br><br>checkmate gun-control faggots</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gram gram should have worked harder in her lifetime instead of pushing out 8 kids.<br>Or married better.<br>It is your family's fault. Inflation and COLA have existed for centuries.<br>Your entitled ass should be left in the desert. You bring the rest of society down to your level.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes. But you don' NEED a gun to protect yourself. It's just the best damn hand-held weapon in existence for self defense. Let's outlaw them, though. Hundreds of years of tech should be disregarded.</br>  Yeah just give everyone a gun to protect em selves... That will fix it   tfw anti-gunners always "forget" about Switzerland.   <br>bullshit<br>Australia doesn't have that much people killed by guns<br>The only thing we have to worry about here are sharks.</br></br></br>  <br>In retrospect I'm thinking it would be better if the can said like "high octane" and looked like oil. Right now, to me, it looks like Europeans hate their own threads and drink the cum of an American exporter.</br>  <br>For civilians yes... But not for people who should actually need them to police and protect. Problem is now... Too many fukn guns in america... So they won't ever ban them for that reason</br>  <br>Yeah, for like two weeks the murder rate would skyrocket, but it would taper off once our lower class kills itself off.</br>  <br><br>Brainwashed amerifucks</br></br>  <br>That is logical thinking... But could solve all the problems if it wasn't for nutters with guns</br>  <br>This (object) is more lethal in the hands of an uneducated person than in the hands of an educated person, assuming they were sane.<br>This is true for a fucking pencil, let alone guns.<br>Just educate the populus.Too many dumb fucks think that killing gets them anything but enmity with their fellow man.</br></br></br>    <br>you just outed yourself faggot<br><br>only foreigners believe the "beseiged by deadly animals" meme</br></br></br>   implying only Americans own guns.   <br>True, there are higher-class psychos. I imagine they are either better controlled, or better at staying hidden. So I can't imagine anything left would be anything but isolated incidents that would occur, regardless of the weapon choice.</br>  <br>Idiots like OP don't understand:<br>Changing gun LAWS doesn't stop the gun violence being done by law-BREAKERS.<br><br>It's not rednecks killing people on the streets, and it sure as hell isn't anyone getting guns legally in the first place.</br></br></br></br>  <br>American murder statistics include gun-based suicides. Dunno if its the same elsewhere. Just a point to consider</br>  <br>True. If I wanted to kill a guy, I'd call up my old buddy, ask for a heater, and waste the cunt.<br>Wouldn't be any law that would stop that</br></br>  SUOMI MAINITTU  <br>I'll tell you it's real and if you go surfing somewhere you won't see it coming.<br><br>I bet you're one of those who against shark culling</br></br></br>  <br> good people/ bad people <br>naive shitlord spotted</br></br>  <br> hurr durr laws dont do dikk <br> lets keep killing eachother <br><br>Nice solution there Joe</br></br></br></br>  <br>I do not consider this as a relevant factor within this debate, instead, I consider it relevant when assessing the reliability of information posted here.

You want to ban everything becausw it hurts your feelings, if you dont like guns or want guns then DONT FUCKING BUY ONE. most of the gun crimes happen in gun control havens anyways so WHY AINT THESE BANS WORKING????
