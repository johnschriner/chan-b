[ I've been thinking guys. What happens when the outside lava on the sun solidifies like it has on earth? I mean isn't it going to be dark here all the time? Solar panels aren't going to work anymore and we have to have flashlights on us at all times. Am I the only one that has thought of this?  Are you Fucking retarded?  <br>We would all freeze to death...are you retarded or just high??</br>  <br>there's no lava, It's one giant hydrogen explosion. no layers, just burning gases</br>  <br> lava <br>Ok</br></br>  <br>ITS NOT LAVA YOU FUCKING DIPSHIT DID YOU EVEN GO TO SCHOOL</br>  <br>How fucking dumb are you? Please be bait.</br>  <br>Kill yourself</br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br>Sometimes I wonder what would happen if the sun got out of orbit and smacked into the earth. I think it would burn up on entry, but it might land in the ocean and make it start boiling. I meaan if it can burn out in space where there's no air, it can burn under water.</br>  Mods please close this awful thread.    <br>Do you understand the size of the sun?</br>  <br>Did you go to school? Because the suns surface is not lace but plasma</br>  <br> thinking <br> outside lava <br> solidifies  <br> sun  <br>How retarded can you fucking be?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Duh, I see it every day, retard.</br>  <br>Im not even going to try and explain shit to you. Go fucking kill yourself</br>  <br>Clearly in the retarded here faggot</br>  <br> No layers, <br>Kek</br></br>     Everyone getting baited this hard to glowing neon bait     <br>Just having some fun, Anon</br>  As much as I know OP is full of shit, Im all too aware that there are people this dumb irl.  <br>The sun isn't composed of lava.<br>Beyond the core of a star are layers of superheated plasma.</br></br>  The sun wouldn't burn up on entry you dumb fuck, its already made out of lava. Its bigger than you think too, if it entered the atmosphere it would be like the moon was falling.      Last trap thread hit image limit. More traps.

COME ONNNNN  Someone make a poster about Xbox One being able to be modded for backwards compatiblity with 360 games but make them fuck up the drivers or the proccessor or some shit  <br>xbone has been done</br>    <br>why? because it's fun fucking people's stuff up</br>  <br><br>Has android been targeted yet?</br></br>  <br>ooh. I don't think it has. that'd be a new one</br>  <br>Cant you fuck with the files on android?<br>maybe something like that?</br></br>  <br>i mean, there's a file explorer... maybe you can delete boot.img and recovery.img and stuff like that. don't have an android so i don't know much about the os</br>  <br>Yeah but they could get that repaired easily.</br>  <br>Hey... Hey guy.... Why don't we just get all the android users to like ya'know switch over to apple. That will fuck up their day.</br>  Bump  bump  bumpa  anything guys? come on.  Tell people to unplug casefans to decrease dust intake?  <br>nah twittwats aren't smart enough to open their case</br>  Tell people that their CPU fans are clogging their CPU with dust and to take it off. Just going on google chrome will heat up the cpu's as they usually run 30 celcius when idling. When they are doing something they go up and without a cooler they exceed 110 celcius. So yeah to unplug their CPU coolers and that will do some instant damage :P  Because of the lipids in dairy cream it can be used to "watter down" gasoline and make a tank of gas last up to 60% longer  <br>it'd work, but... would anybody actually go through all that work to take apart their computer?</br>  <br>KEK<br>a little hard to believe, but that's gettin there</br></br>  <br>with picture tutorials from 'intel' im sure a lot of people will follow.</br>  Do you notice you computer getting slower over time? <br>This is because Ram has a shelf life and decays over time. <br>Slowly the transistors loose thein ability to hold a charge and this causes the speed of the ram to be gradually slowed. HOWEVER if you remove the ram from your computer you can revitalize dead ram cells and cause your computer to regain its factory speed. All you need to do is place the stick in the microwave for 1 minute per stick.</br></br>  now we just need people to make official lookin "ads". but this thread hasn't caught on :(  <br>good good, we're getting better at this</br>  maybe some faked "new drivers" they need for intel CPU´s and then tell them cause of the new drivers they wont need ther fans anymore  <br><br>Wouldn't really work. Anyone who knows how to remove RAM wouldn't even fall for it.</br></br>  <br>Add pictures of ram in a microwave and two Task manager screen shots and we are gold. Sombody bump with porn to keep thread alive</br>  <br>It's more accessible than iOS, but there's really not much permanent damage you can do without root.</br>  Want to coat your silver jewelry to look gold?<br>Put some diet cola in a small class, and drop your jewelry in.<br>Microwave for 1 minute. During this time, the cola and the surface of the jewelry will undergo a chemical reaction that gives it a golden hue. This will not rub off, and the only way to tell is to test the metal at a shop.</br></br>  <br>Ooh... this looks like something I could see someone falling for.</br>  .  <br>Throw in some pictures of cola in a microwave with a cheap stainless steel ring in it, then spraypaint the ring a golden color and add that picture.</br>  bump this shit  <br>Because that's what we do</br>  <br>I like this</br>  <br>Yes now add a picure of cola a regular quarter cola in a microwave and a brass coated quarter. Its a comon chemistry lab to create an alloy so this should be possible</br>  Bump  <br>the fuck does it do exactly?</br>  who are we going for as our "target"? like, what demographic? because if we want as many people talking about being screwed over by this as there were with the xbone one and the many ios ones, it'll have to be changed a bit. not /that/ many people have silver  <br> drop your jewelry in. <br> Microwave for 1 minute. </br></br>  <br>At best it fucks up your jewelry. At worst, your microwave gets rekt.</br>  <br>retards thats who</br>  <br>change silver to gold. or stainless steel. or anything metal, really.<br><br>idiots love shiny shit.</br></br></br>  <br>well duh. but retards with silver jewelry? nah. rephrase it a bit. something along the lines of transmuting "silverware" (flatware ofc) into gold, to scam cash4gold places and get quick money.</br>  <br>that could work the retards who try to scam places would try it</br>  <br>perfect</br>  <br>Experienced android user here. You can't do stuff like that without root. And there is no root exploit to easily do that.</br>  <br>That would get idiots all over to fall for it, people are always looking for quick cash</br>  <br>post it on a jewlery forum or somthing</br>  What would happen though?  <br>What would happen with what?</br>  <br>see <br>and </br></br>  <br>in older kernels you can get root via a buffer overflow, towleroot uses that bug</br>  <br>Not a jewelry one. Too many people there that could immediately shut it down.</br>  it'd need to get posted on twitter. find all the poortwats looking for something easy  Bump  Bump  <br>Never heard of it. Then I thought that it would be probably only for old phones and looked it up But nope, nexus 5, galaxy s5, note 3... <br><br>wow. But a software update probably already fixed it.</br></br></br>  Bump  <br>This</br>  Is there anyway to trick the macbook faggots to play loselose?  <br>yea, it did in most cases<br>but still its there on many phones <br>http://tinyhack.com/2014/07/07/expl<wbr>oiting-the-futex-bug-and-uncovering<wbr>-towelroot/</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>i'm goin to bed guys. hope you come up with something. i'll check back in the morning<br><br>best of luck</br></br></br>  <br>I've got free time. I'll work on a draft of Operation Silver Cola and have it up tomorrow night. It won't be pretty, but who gives a fuck?</br>  <br>this is amazing i had never seen it before</br>  I mean a macbook can go for so much cash. Loselose would pretty much brick it. It could work and it would be a lot worse then the Iphone  Hey guys, old fag here and im not 12.<br>Lets spread that pewdiepie died, that will fuck the media and the jews</br>  <br>Loselose?</br>  <br> what are you trying to infer </br>  <br>Bump!</br>  <br>www.stfj.net/art/2009/loselose/</br>  bump  It would be hard to target all android since companies change the software for their devices, unless someone finds a universal bug/exploit  Its a game kinda like space invader. But the thing is if you shoot the bad things it deletes your files. It could ruin your macbook  <br>Pretty or not, as long as it seems believable then they will fall for it</br>    <br>He releases videos almost daily, won't work</br>  How about some way of pretending that a service will encrypt or hide their photos (nudes) but actually just shares them to everyone  <br><br><br>it would'nt damage anything, the cpu would just turn off to protect it from heat</br></br></br>  <br>Prerecorded videos</br>  new s6 edge.we could do something with that  Bump  i know this is not bricking but maybe we could try and get a fake story on the news?  <br>This. There might be -some- chance of damage, but unlikely. They idiot proof those things for a reason, especially since the heatsink would provide minor protection at first.</br>  <br>Whats this?</br>  <br>microshaft would kill it</br>  For real damage loselose would work. We just gotta find a way  what do you mean  <br>it lets u get on the hidden boards</br>  <br>what do u mean</br>  <br>How are they uploaded?</br>  <br>could you disguise it as another file?</br>  <br>just try it</br>  <br>Actually, it blocks 4chan from your computer</br>  <br>scheduled uploads. he uploads them all in one day and sets them to show to public days later</br>  Pewdiepie recently assaulted his girlfriend, he tried to keep it on the down-low to protect his reputation, somebody talked and now we know.

The first time I tried it he recommended snorting it because it was stronger but I really didn't feel anything besides being a little more energetic. I thought it was bunk. A while ago my bf picked me up on a movie date and said that we were going to eat it this time. I remained skeptical because the snorting failed. 15 minutes into the movie I got the most overwhelming body sensations, rushes, tingling throughout my body, cold sweats, trembling, heart racing, I had a death grip on his arm and I began to hyperventilate slightly. (From what he said) He was concerned so we left and once I went outside I felt a lot better. We decided to go to his friends house and I was fine for a little while until the feeling of panic overcame me again. I didnt want to socialize with anybody but my lover. I sat outside in a hammock alone till we left. Once I got home I felt completely fine, and was rolling quite nicely and knew exactly that this was how It was supposed to feel. Nothing but love for him and everything felt completely fantastic. The second time I rolled I had a lot of the same sensations as before but a little less intense I had to lay down on the ground and "meditate" but after 20 minutes of that I stood up and I felt indescribably amazing and chatted with my best friend the entire night. Does anybody else experience incredibly difficult come ups? Is there any way to avoid this next time I roll? I do have a history of social anxieties so I wonder if that has something to do with it.. I tried 420chan they were useless.  <br>Take a little bit of benzo beforehand.</br>  God.. I would love to watch my fat gf get fucked by others. Would you?  me too B)  <br>NO absolutely not. keep her tied up in the yard man, noone wants to see that unclothed</br>  <br><br>yes, I'd fuck her fat tits, then bend her over and slam her asshole til I came inside her</br></br>  I'm almost up to that point with my gf She works at a bank and some guy has been hitting on her from a different branch. We've talking about this for almost a year and a half and she's thinking about it but she's afraid she might like it.

Look up other AA songs to make your mind up about them though, there are probably better songs out there.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Four fifths of fuck all. Gotta fix some shit on the car, but nothing new and exciting. Whats new with you?<br><br><br>Feels good to be able to post again. Hows it going?</br></br></br></br>    <br>Just jew it</br>  <br>Whats new m8?</br>  <br>Heya diese nutz</br>  <br>Howdy straya cunt</br>  <br>not much man still just chillin.<br>same as always.</br></br>  <br>Rocking it, of course. Not feeling good, so I'm cuddling a box of pizza and my phone. <br><br>I think I will, haha, well, if you want something lighter/ actual speed metal... <br><br>http://<span>youtube.com/watch?v=pOSaDbb9<wbr>gaQ</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Maybe another time :^)<br><br><br>Same shit different day, really loving this new TI album though. You?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Not feeling good <br>Thats been me all week. Don't think pizza will make ya feel much better<br><br><br>Wiper linkage fucked off along with my hood latch cable stretching. I've got some work to do on the car, and looks like I'll be working 6 days a week at the factory. So all in all, pretty much normal</br></br></br></br></br>  Oi, How are all you cunts? Lurker here, lurked for years I think?  <br> Speed Metal <br><br>I can't respect anything these guys do after watching that demo video from Michael Angelo Batio, nothing seems to compare...</br></br></br>  <br>Fucking hell hetty. Get a liposuction.</br>  <br>Hey, it's something to cuddle, and besides, I crafted this beautiful devil. <br><br>Still cunty, now with 50% more sand! <br><br>I haven't listen to much of these guys, I found this song from Guitar Hero and loved how difficult is was to play.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fucking cars man, front right brake dust protector has broken off just a month after getting the left one fixed, and engines making a funny noise when idling when engine is cool, more money more shit to get fixed.<br><br><br>Pretty good n you? Wish this shitty weather would fuck off tbh.</br></br></br></br>  <br>At least its something to do. I feel like I've been going insane but working on the car is keeping me even</br>  <br>Sounds like a hell of a dry spell if its got 50% more sand lol. <br>How longs this group of people been around making Sfur threads? I remember some fellas named gears and Harpo. And further back some fella in these threads made a game or somethin?</br></br>  <br>I do well fella, just cleaning and browsing threads. Don't socialize in these threads much, mostly a lurker</br>  <br>One thing good about those games was the variety of music it brought to people who never heard of those bands before.<br><br><br>I'm the same but with fishing, gets me out of the house and I can leave all the bullshit behind for a few days.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Since the beginning of 4chan, I think. I'm just an annoying newfag. Yeah, Gears and Harpo are still around. So is 8bit, and several others.<br><br>Theres others too, but I can't think of them all. <br><br>I'm based in California, and it's dry as fuck here, ironic, as we live close to a fucking ocean, but you know, gotta protect some stupid tiny fish instead of millions of jobs.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Fishing <br>Fuck, I gotta do that sometime soon. Paid for a license 3 years ago and never went<br><br><br>God I remember that</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Exactly. Though the idea was solid as fuck, kids didn't listen to very much good stuff (including me) back then. Rockband had great ass music thanks to MTV and Harmonix sponsoring them. <br><br>But Rockband sucked, and Guitar Hero was based. Back when I was in high school, in the after school club, I'd destroy anyone who challenge me. <br><br>And that band Amity Affliction is kick ass! <br><br>I do as well, back when I was a giant lurker. Though I lurked barely in 2012.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ahh, yea that list I recognize half the names. Lotta them ya don't see anymore, like that dragonborn fella. Had something up with his nuts or wang if I remember right, always used Skyrim posts. And I guess I'm newfag too, but 2012 one I think? <br>Hows all the fires and lack of water there goin? I happen to live in canada lucky for me, so lakes and water are no problem here.</br></br>    <br>Give it time m8, soon you will be namesyncing it up.<br><br><br>IIRC<br>2007-2009 - AuroraFurries<br>2010-2012 - FurryArrancar<br>2013- Onwards - sfur guys (if that's the name they go by)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably asked but my drunken ass cannot remember, what sorta fishing do you get in your area?<br><br><br>I missed out playing most of the games, I had the metallica one though. I will never forget the embarrassment of being booed off stage playing a song I could play on an actual guitar.......</br></br></br></br>    <br>I remember being annoyed and jot wanting to post when the threads were more than half filled with avatarfagging. My girlfriend and I would be like "We just want fur, what the fuck?" <br><br>My favorite deceased people were Dovah and Nameless. Though both avatarfagged a shit ton, they were pretty cool to see talk. <br><br>Well, fires are keeping us warm as fuck, and can not swim in lakes because low water levels, so.... Yeah... Wanna trade? <br><br>Hahahaha, what the fuck am I looking at? Only seen that once and still couldn't figure it out back then. <br><br>I tried learning electric guitar, but I can't read treble cleft for shit. So it sits, collecting dust, while I pretend I'm cool destroying songs on Expert. Like One.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Btw what AA songs are you liking?</br>  <br>Locally, we have black bass, rock bass, and a couple other I can't remember. A little drive away I could get pike, rainbow trout, and some others. I'm not a huge fisherman so I don't know half of what I'm catching<br><br><br>According to the top of the graph, its a dick length chart</br></br></br></br>  <br>All this. Loving it all so far. <br><br>Sorry for my slow ass posting, using my phone. Because reasons.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm sure you can figure it out..... Also what type of guitar?</br>  <br>My bad, I can't read for shit apparently, haha. <br><br>I got a basic one. A beginner kit, came with amp, book, picks, straps, etc. <br><br>A Stratosphere, I cannot think of the brand for some unknown reason, but it's a common as fuck brand...</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I dunno, I've been here an age, only really chatted few times, have helped keep threads alive way more often than I've yakked with everyone. <br><br>Yeahh, I remember all them, alot were interesting to see what they were saying. Although there is alot more people posting new content lately. And nahh, I live for mild summers and tons of hiking. California I'd actullay crisp and melt in, too hot down there. Hottest its been up here was like, 40 Celcius last summer, and that was too much for me.</br></br></br>      <br>I want to move to Colorado, it was beautiful as fuck over there. And I love the cold. I can barely survive the heat. Lately around here, it's been hovering around 105°F, not sure what that converts to (because Ameritard) but yeah, annoying. <br><br>The content varies from time to time, but otherwise, it's mainly reposts. <br><br>I need to go hiking and camping this summer. You enjoying your weather now?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sounds pretty neat, to get bass here is at least a 4 hour drive away. I know how you feel about not knowing shit though, when it comes to saltwater I basically throw back anything that looks bright and potentially poisonous...too many fish to fucking know what is legal and or safe to keep and eat and closed seasons and shit, I'll stick to river fishing.<br><br><br>I'm pretty sure all of those vids are from "Let the ocean take me" aka their latest album from last year, pretty good album, was funny when it was featured on the radio here and hearing people bitching about metalcore being on radio.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Can't keep whats in the local river cause its polluted as fuck. The water is literally extremely unhealthy for us yet it is piped to every fucking house</br>  <br>Fender Stratocaster, should keep it up mate, you'll only be as good as the amount of time you spend practicing.</br>    <br>Where ever the fuck you live, I want to move there. I don't even listen to the radio around here because it's just shit indie music, or talentless rap. <br><br>We used to have a hard rock station around here, called KRZR, that was legit kick ass. Got bought out and now only plays rap and hip hop from the 90s to early 2000s.<br><br><br>That's it! Yeah, that one. I want to keep trying, but I can't read shit other than tab. But I guess once I get it back from my "girlfriend's" house, I guess I could play it again. <br><br>Always wanted to learn how to make melodies and shred, though power chords sounded sexy as fuck. <br><br>Someone lent me their distortion pedal once, and I had so much fun pretending I was cool.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeeaahh, fuck 105F, thats 40 celcius exact. And I suppose it does vary yea, rare time its shitposted to oblivion with hetty or something. <br>Yeah, the weathers decent this week, but my buddies and I chose to camp last weekend and got rained out 2nd day in out of three. Ah well. It was still enjoyable, and if you have the chance to camp grab it, I always love escaping all the crap and busy-ness of the city. Colerado looks and sounds ok from what I hear, also heard Montana is like a slice of canada for mericans.</br></br>  <br>NOICE<br>O<br>I<br>C<br>E<br><br><br>Sure it isn't because of the mercury levels in the polluted fish? Do you live near a city? I hear that a lot of rivers and lakes in the US are fucked from pollution because of paper mills back in ye last century</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  nerds  <br>That comic made me realize just how much of a shamefully closeted vorarephile I really am.</br>  <br>do you know by anychance when the other collage was created?</br>  <br>Nope. The river runs through I don't even know how many other towns/cities before it reaches mine. Then it goes through a fuckton more. So we get pollution from them and we just pass it along. Also my town is on top of a huge limestone deposit so the water is half limestone</br>  <br>Hetty, off topic stuff, or Gorsha. But whatever, gotta keep on rocking it, yeah? <br><br>God, I want to camp so bad, but all my friends are lazy as shit. I don't wanna camp alone, that's just weird because I can't share the magical feeling of peaceful nature. <br><br>Colorado is pretty damn great, I wanna go there again, it snows there, and I love the damn snow. Great for drifting and snowball fights. <br><br>Montana is just too far for me, haha.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Triple J, it's an national indie/alternative radio station here in aus that plays anything and everything, you can stream live from their site and give it an hour to get the vibe if you care to. Honestly, around 90% of the bands I'm into I've found from this station, they're pretty based.<br><br><br>Same, tab pleb as well but really, that's all you will need unless you're playing in an orchestra or something. The best thing is just messing around and creating your own little melody by accident.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I do not know, but if I had to guess, 2012 or before then, because I saved it when I saw it.</br>  <br> Someon is posting Nicole <br> it's not watterson <br>You son of a bitch</br></br></br>  <br><br>Is that a tub of butter?</br></br>  <br><br>who said you had to share it?<br>Camping alone is one of the great things about the world.<br>Out there in the wilderness with just your thoughts and nature. It's quite enjoyable, at least for me.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>he eats butter<br>with salt though<br>so it's okay</br></br></br>   <br>Very True. And yeah, I hear ya on wanting to camp, my friends can be slackers too. That peacefullness of nature is relaxing, kinda pisses me off when people camping with ya are sour or can't absorb the tranquility. <br><br>And that makes sense being too far. I've only visited the states once myself, and NYC is crowded to shit, like a human ant farm. 2/10 Only visit once and never again</br></br></br>  <br>That sucks, come fish here, we don't have pollution but we have Pic related that have attempted to eat humans and horses alike back in the 1800's.<br><br><br>n00b</br></br></br></br>  <br>Said the N3rd</br>  <br>Damn. As long as I stay on land. Not a fan of being on boats</br>  <br> Camping alone is one of the great things about the world <br><br>Unless you have Possums, Foxes, Tawny Frogmouths and other seemingly harmless animals with bone chilling screams</br></br></br>  <br> Not recognizing Nicole Watterson's luscious booty when you see it. <br>Shame shame shame.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Ugh, that's disgusting.<br><br>How big is your waistline? or have they not discovered a greater measurement than a parsec?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>that's part of the experience<br>it builds character</br></br>  <br>I'm just not into indie music, I need something very fast, very angry, very depressing, very melodic, a good story, a good beat, a good flow, or any combination of that. <br><br>Something too chill tends to annoy me. Just not into it. But I did like Modest Mouse. <br><br>But I want to be able to "play professionally", I'm just weird like that. <br><br>I wanted to make a basic band with my friends, not expecting anything but fun times with my ex on keyboard/piano, buddy on bass, me on guitar and vocals, and find a drummer. <br><br>But yeah... <br><br>I just got used to at least having Neko next to me. I'll learn to go on my own soon enough. Just gotta find money and time, every time I get ahead, I get a new expense. Like I'm finally getting my new phone finally. <br><br>Oh for sure. I love swimming in that melted snow water, the fresh air, the hiking, everything! Sleeping under the stars for a bit and then going to your tent is just.... <br><br><br>I miss it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Anyone got tomboy otters?  <br>Give me a sec to take a pic</br>  <br>he doesn't look like a fat guy<br>just some spanish fuckup who blew loads of moneu</br></br>    <br>Said the puppy<br><br><br>Honestly though, I thought the Murray was safe, unlike the top end of Aus where they have crocs and shit, friend showed me a photo of his friend catching one of these fish near Adelaide, I googled the town and fish name and found some old ass newspaper article about them attempting to eat horses and a german immigrant swimming. Not going swimming ever again.</br></br></br></br>  Posting with my morning wood  <br>not sure why you named that pic after me</br>  Goddamn, that end, that recording. 4:03 until the end.    <br> gotta protect some stupid tiny fish instead of millions of jobs <br>If you're talking about desert pupfish, don't hyperbolize the situation. The land that's separated for their conservation wouldn't even require thousands of employees to wring dry. The basis for California's drought, from what I know, is a gradually decreasing snowpack in the Sierra Nevadas; that's well east of the pupfishes' habitats.</br></br>  <br>Said the Dinosaur<br>Even in satire. never say you don't swim<br>swimming is the best thing ever</br></br></br>  <br>Nigga I only weigh 150</br>  <br>I'm just not a huge fan of deep water.

Stop smoking cigarettes so you aren't as faggy or as big of a tool. Or stop vaping and continue to smoke cigarettes to have a chance at being somewhat normal.</br>  The ecig is pretty much retired in favor of nic lozenges. Might start making my own since I already have 100mg/ml nic and flavorings.  Mine  <br>Don't smoke <br> be cool  <br><br>You actually believe those dare programs and the truth advertisements on TV that say you're cool if you don't smoke? That's like saying being a virgin and abstinence is cool to do, you just look like a boring, fun sucking crybaby</br></br></br></br>  <br>$40-$50?</br>  <br>Nic lozenges? What? Like nicotine gum? People are actually doing this? Care to show examples?</br>  <br>hey dan</br>  <br>Here's what I picked up from Walgreens because I didn't want to vape that weekend. They're 4mg.</br>  <br>what kind of RTA is that?<br>seems badass with so many juice flow holes</br></br>  <br>Just go to a vape store and get a starter kit. Basic vape with a simple tank setup, like under $80 for everything but juice, usually has sample juices. Then just get some juice. If you get super into it, you'll move on to upgrading it, and change to more advanced systems, if you just want something that works, you'll just keep it and just keep buying juice, having something that works and doesn't require crazy dedication and setup, does what it is intended to.</br>  <br>To add to this, some look more like cough drops/hard candy. The kinds I'll probably start making will basically be hard candies with some nice in them.</br>  <br>You made it sound that people are quitting vapes and making nicotine lozenges, not what you meant that you are switching. Also, yes we can all buy them from the store, you said you were going to make them, that's what I asked, not store bought ones.</br>  My current setup  how many ohms are you guys running  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=lbf<wbr>sZDFzZ58</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ewK<wbr>9rLvCOvA</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=z4p<wbr>1DUz-6UI</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=oKN<wbr>Azl-XN4I</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>About tree-fiddy</br></br>  <br>I retired the vape, just the little ecig. I think making nic lozenges might start to catch on but it's not as flashy as blowing clouds. <br><br><br>.6 at 12.1W because I'm funny like that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>God damn lochness monster over powering my vape, making harsh builds and ruining my coils. It was at this point I realized that the guy building my coil was a 10 foot tall prehistoric monster draining me for my money. Not again, you won't trick me ever again you bastard</br>  <br> subtank <br> istick <br><br>you are a disgrace to vapers</br></br></br></br>  <br>because vapes are fucking terrible roflfaggotnoob, if u cant handle smoking dont smoke</br>  <br>0.5 at 25W</br>  <br>How can you correctly identify his items and still be so clueless?</br>  here's mine  <br><br>Yeah I got that now but originally you made it out to sound like it was a huge craze and that it was becoming huge where people were quitting vapes and making nicotine lozenges instead. It actually doesn't sound bad and could be pretty cool, plus it's even healthier to use gum over vapes, plus Making your own gum sounds pretty damn cool, plus it's something that requires real intelligence to do, not just slap a tank on, change voltage, and talk about your homemade build as if you made it from scratch, sourcing the components, soldering it together, etc. They buy pre-made shit designed to work, and be compatible, then change the ohms and it's supposed to be revolutionary or unheard of, as if they're some pioneer in creating something new to the world. Like bro you are running 2 ohms on a v2? Holy shit, I saw dude do 1.8 ohms on v1 but you just blew my mind!</br></br>    <br>using Subtank for Rebuilding coils<br><br>only newfags do that<br><br>protip:<br>get a proper RTA or RDA if you want to really enjoy the world of rebuildables</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Mine</br></br>  <br>Being this mad isn't cool either so stick that with your cancer, you cancer.</br>  <br>No</br>  <br>lol so what's a proper RTA, for someone that doesn't want to drip and drive? I like my Lemo 2 but I'll look into whatever you suggest.</br>  <br>Yeah fag, how dare you use something that is designed to work and do what it is intended for. You're not a real vaper unless you use a device that you have to constantly take apart, rebuild, maintain, and keep filling which ends up taking more time than you can use. Devices that work properly and as intended are so gay. Do you even blow clouds into random people's faces? They know I'm fucking awesome by blowing clouds by them, like damn this guy probably hangs out at a store jerking other vaper off, instead of getting laid.</br>  a while ago i had a shitty ego twist. but for a while ive been looking into getting into actually vaping, only problem is im the king of poor fags. so what is a good combo on a small as shit budget  <br>I like my Samsung Galaxy 5.. You can make phone calls and leave voicemails with the px99 mod</br>  <br>When you try to smoke a real cig by me I'm going to destroy your vape, then when you go to smoke near your mouth fedora faggots, they'll start coughing and be like "what a loser" and walk away. You're like a half black dude, blacks think you're a faggot, and whites still hate you</br>  <br>Please be joking that your vape integrates with your fucking phone</br>   started using e cigs before most people <br> never tried the liquid <br> I use something similar to .jpg <br>As most smokers go, I am a creatures of habit. I chose one e-cig brand... It worked for me and I stuck to it ever since. I enjoy the no maintenance of disposable cartridges instead of something that I have to clean and gets nasty.

A bong is more about smoothness and reducing throat hit as much as possible. Vaping is much more flavor oriented, and airflow is much more important. The drag is much more important than a bong, since the flavor experience is the centerfold, followed by a 10 minute buzz. When you hit a bong and cough for 2 min off an ass hit It doesn't mean anything when compared to 3 hours of Being stoned as payoff.</br>  <br><br> smoking shitty Marlboro <br><br>Shit taste detected, faggot.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Pic?</br>  Fuhatan mech mod, little boy rda, "snap" peach tea juice<br>22g wire and 35watt battery<br><br>also have a cherry bomber box w/ troll rda. shit rips</br></br></br>  im getting a vape and a practice butterfly knife to keep my hands busy when im bored or doing something else, also, when you start modding is when you turn into a mouth fedora tool fag  <br>im comparing prices to what you get, not nicotine to weed</br>  FAGGOT FUCKING NIGGERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR<wbr>RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR<wbr>RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR<wbr>RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR<wbr>RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRS<br><br>NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER</br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr>  On/off thread  <br>i hav 1</br>  <br>Any idea where she's goin to college?</br>  dang this bread is better than 95% of the last 10/10's i've been in.<br>thank you anons.</br>  Snapchats who regularly post tits? <br><br>Lewd Raven is a good one.</br></br>  post titson here or snap?<br><br/></br>  <br>inhumanity</br>  <br>please lick her asshole<br><br> only way to confirm your idnity </br></br></br>  R8 my Mexican dick  can u cut my lawn?
