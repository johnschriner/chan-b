Have you ever cheated on someone, how did you feel afterwards and did you keep doing it?<br><br>I ask as I currently am cheating on my 42 year old husband with a younger, fitter 19 year old man who gives me the best sexual thrill of my life. But yet, I feel like a cunt for doing it though but like I need it honestly. Because I do love my husband, I'm just not sexually satisfied.<br><br>What about you /b/. Pic unrelated.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Fucking cunt  You're a piece of trash cheating on your husband without telling him...  You sound like a selfish vapid bitch. If you want to screw other men have the decency to be up front about it and tell your husband what the deal is instead of being deceptive.  fucking cunt  You marry someone out of love. You cheat with someone out of lust. Lust is bad. You are bad.  <br>I think we all have needs and desires. If you are unfulfilled then that is your husbands shortcoming. However, if you have failed to communicate this to him in a way that let him know that you were to the point of considering an affair then that is your shortcoming. Having said that, I think you may want to ask yourself if you would be ok with him having a sexual relationship with a young woman to satisfy himself while still feeling love for you. If you would be ok with this then the two of you need to discuss an open sexual relationship. This could be a great way to not only be satisfied but to also explore something new together. If the thought of him with another woman isn't something you are 100% ok with then you really need to stop this affair asap.</br>  <br>Nice trips</br>  <br>Don't worry about it. I'm sure your husband been through half your friends and a few bookers himself</br>  Yes it is. Why do you even have to ask?  <br>suggest swinging lifestyle to husband. that way you both get fucked</br>  I've never cheated on anyone, but a couple of girls have been cheating with me. <br><br>Fuck I can't help but living in. To cum inside of a girl, treating her like the slut she is for cheating and then send hem home to cuddle with her bf with my cum inside of her. <br><br>But talk to your husband. Make a deal wher you both can fuck other, or you might find out it turns him on to know that you get fucked.</br></br></br></br>  <br>And now that I have given you solid and thoughtful advise and got dubs, you owe us tits and you damn well know it.</br>  errrm...all I get is abuse. I bet it would be ok if I was a guy right. typical delusional idiots who get angry at someone they DON'T know.  Just shave balls and you'll be fine.  <br>Women cheating is wrong<br>Men cheating is fine</br></br>  <br>I'm married, I met this girl, this was all online, mind you, it lasted a month because I could not bear it anymore. I never told my wife because it would kill me to cause her any pain, and I love her too much to lose her.<br><br>There was the possibility of meeting with this girl, she kept insisting, but when it got too much I ended it. All it took was imagining my wife doing the same, I could not endure that.<br><br>Even if this post is bait, I don't judge you, just be honest or don't get caught at all.</br></br></br></br></br>  Fucking whore. You knew what you were getting into when you got married. The fact that you view your vows as just so many worthless words says a lot about you.  <br>What he doesn't know won't hurt him. Same as what I don't know won't hurt me.</br>  <br>Hi all, my name is Brad...first I wanna give a SHAVE BALLS shoutout to all my homies back in the 256! To answer your question, it's okay to do so when God says it is.</br>  <br>Bullshit. When you get married, you know what you're signing up for. Don't like it? Don't take the fucking vows.</br>  <br><br> morally <br><br>Morals, on /b/ ? <br><br>The spread of Venereal Diseases and STI's is a concern when sleeping with others while in a committed relationship. <br><br>The security of knowing you can spray hot sticky stings of cum into your woman without getting sick is beneficial to my emotional/physical well being. <br><br>Cheating is cheating, people lured by bright and shiny things, the grass is never greener on the other side. Simply put if you find something more interesting..leave the boring person.<br><br>Only women can have their cake and eat it too, but 99% of the time it blows up in their faces as well.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yesterday was my 10 year anniversary with my wife. That's about 9 years and 8 months longer than my previous relationship. I fucked as many chicks as I could, whenever I wanted, however I wanted BEFORE I was married. I have NEVER, and would NEVER cheat on my wife, not sure how I could even look her in the eyes afterwards if I did. She is amazing in bed and still absolutely beautiful, has maintained her physical and mental beauty perfectly, and does the dishes every night.</br>  <br>Hey, I didn't abuse. I gave real advise. I gave the same advise I would give a man for the record.</br>  He's most likely bored with you, do you do anything to try to get him interested? Or just lay there and bitch about shit, and expect him to do all the work.  <br>Yeah seriously. What a fucking cunt. Those are life long vows and they mean nothing to you. I hope you fucking an hero.</br>  <br>Your fault for marrying a sloth.</br>  <br>whore, simple as that you can talk to your husband and make everthing better but you like better the young so whore the same to the man cheating but is worse for a man if you get pregnat the little bastar would never know in some countrys is ilegal a dna test</br>  <br>Maybe he is cheating on you.</br>  <br>But he will know one day. He will absolutely find out somehow. Do you want to add dishonesty to unfaithfulness? What if a conversation full of honesty could bring about a sexual revolution in your marriage. It could be the best decision you ever make.</br>  <br>Now that's a wife.</br>  <br>Shit happens. What I want to know is why you picked some teenaged punk who drops his load in 5 minutes or less? At least get yourself a respectable guy with some fucking game. Not some pimple faced loser whose only real concerns are tendies and where his next vidya game are coming from. What do you two talk about afterwards his gamer rating? Fucking laughable.</br>  <br>of course it's morally wrong, you brainless cunt.<br><br>your husband may be a retarded piece of shit, but nobody deserves to be cheated on. if you think they are deserving, you shouldn't be in that relationship to begin with. <br><br>jesus fuck people are stupid.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Because I do love my husband, I'm just not sexually satisfied. <br>if that were true you would buy a fucking vibrator, not cheat on your husband.</br></br>  <br>Tits or gtfo</br>  He's probably paying for you to live and I'm sure he's putting a roof over your head and this is how you repay him? Fucking kill yourself.  <br>it depends on how cheating is defined<br><br>if it having sex with someone when you have another person that you have explicitly entered into an exclusive sexual relationship with<br>then yes it is wrong<br><br>if it is having sex with someone that isn't your SO, but you and your SO have arranged conditions that they are OK with you having sex with someone else and you do so under those conditions<br>then no it is not wrong</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You a cunt. <br><br>That said: <br><br>The terms of a relationship between two consenting adults can and should be re-negotiated when necessary to maintain a healthy relationship. If you have children, they should be your primary concern at the moment. If you are barren, then why did you get married in the first place?<br><br>Talk to your husband and figure out if the partnership still works, knowing that his wife is humiliating him behind his back.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're misusing tits or gtfo</br>  <br> What he doesn't know won't hurt him <br> "honey, why does it burn when I piss? what are all these sores and warts on my genitals? why do I have a rash on my balls?" </br></br>  <br>You're such a saint for not doing anything, you should be so proud. Actually you should tell your wife about the whole thing so you can be proud together.</br>  <br><br> responding to feminist rhetoric <br> ever </br></br></br>  <br>Thats pretty fucked up OP.<br><br>You should probably kill yourself. Live stream, of course.</br></br></br>  Speaking of bait...  <br>I've never had someone to cheat :/</br>  Tits or gtfo  spoken like a true sexless neckbeard<br><br>let me know when you know how relationships work<br><br>oh wait</br></br></br></br>  <br>I met him from work ;) it's amazing how easy guys get interested in you when you're married.</br>  <br><br>I don't believe in 'right or wrong'. I think choices are like gambling.<br><br>DEF action(life):<br> FOR choice IN life:<br> IF choice.benefit &gt; riskOfBeingCaught * consequences:<br> return TRUE<br> elif:<br> return FALSE</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    I mean I've cheated at the end of relationships when the relationship was clearly about to end and I was just too lazy to break up with the girl but I'd never cheat on my wife. If you cheat on your wife, you're a fucking cunt.  <br><br> implying you dont get people tested before fucking them bareback <br><br> did you learn nothing jon snow, blowjobs/handjobs/fingering before fucking, check dem goods <br><br> if you want a regular sex partner you dont just stick it in there </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're a fucking whore. I hope your husband finds out and divorces you. Shame on you.</br>  OP, the majority of us have been very real with you. Sharing experiences and advise. There are trolls as always but we have offered alternative viewpoints. Why are you still so angry and combative? We are trying to help you come to terms with this. Clearly you feel guilty. Otherwise, why come here to discuss it. Now that your fears are being confirmed you are deflecting and that isn't helping at all. I really hope you just talk to your husband. Even if you don't tell him about the affair, at least try to go forward in a more honest way.  <br>real talk, why is it that when men do it they high fave and slap dicks, but when women do it, men call them cunts?<br>Can't we all just be cunts together?</br></br>  You're a fucking cunt. You should be grateful anybody wanted to marry your disgusting pussy. I bet you have genital warts or some shit. If your husband doesn't want to fuck your slimy ass then live with it and let him fuck some other whores, but don't fucking think you can fuck other people. Your place is at home, cooking and cleaning and making sure your husband is satisfied, bitch.  <br>Kill yourself please. People like you are why men cheat. To hedge their bets against getting burned.</br>  <br>My problem is... I do love my husband on a spirtual, emotional level. But over the past 20 years (yes I was 21 when I got married) he got fatter and less attractive. I feel withdrawn but I still love him. I need him and that's what people don't understand. Yes I feel guilt like you, but he doesn't have to know. I save the marriage, and i get what I need :)</br>  <br>He speaks the truth.</br>  <br>First of, you don't NEED it. A need is something you need to survive. You were just being a lustful slut. If it really bothered you that much, you could've just talked to him about it. Cooked him some healthier meals...lazy slut.</br>  It depends on the circumstances  <br><br><br>No he fucking doesn't.<br><br>Men fuck women because they are horny.

There are other ways of dealing with your lack of satisfaction that don't involve infidelity.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm sorry you're getting all this abuse. I understand why you would want to cheat. You deserve to be sexually satisfied. Remember that. It's up to a man to sexually satisfy his wife.</br>  <br><br>Like a rotating lactating 360 degree walk in suite with a vibrating pulse fuckeroo 9000.</br></br>  <br>You don't get what you need. You think cheating won't have repercussions on the way you think and how you interact with him? You're just trying to justify your actions. This is why women are cancer. Actually...wouldn't even call you a woman....you're just a stupid girl.</br>  <br>As long as you're not spreading STDs, getting pregnant and either:<br>1) your partner is fine with it or <br>2) your partner never finds out<br><br>ignorance is bliss</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>kek he took the bait</br>                            Nope dont care.<br>Cheated a few times never felt bad.<br><br>Sex is fun. end of story.</br></br></br>  <br>tits and time stamp or gtfa</br>  <br>you have to accept the fact that women have needs.</br>  <br>So you want me to end up an ugly old worn down hag who has NOBODY and expect me to remain unhappy sexually the rest of my life? And I'm the selfish one? haha</br>  <br>Hi<br><br>I just recently got out of a long term relationship where I found my fiancee had been messaging guys on a sex site. We have a daughter together and I went to counseling but it just didn't work out. I tried, but I just can't trust or respect her after that.<br><br>After that while I was single I started fucking a married co-worker. She sounds a lot like you. "Oh I love him so much"<br>"I can't tell him, it would crush him"<br>She, like you, is perfectly capable of living a lie for the rest of her life because of her own selfish agenda.<br><br>Let me just tell you, that you're filth. Subhuman, even.<br><br>Fix yourself, then fix your marriage or end it. It's the only decent thing to do.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I do love my husband on a spirtual, emotional level. <br><br>You clearly don't. If you did, you'd show some fucking fortitude and stay faithful. No one would say something like "I love my cat on a spiritual, emotional level, but I just hate the way it looks and I have a need to kick cats so I just kick him whenever I see him." It would be clear to everyone that this person does not love her cat.<br><br>It's clear to all of us that you don't love your husband. Because you're a lying whore.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>So...whats the point in pointless baiting?</br></br>  <br>True or not, I sincerely hope that you kill yourself.</br>  <br><br>if they think its wrong, its wrong...<br><br>i can have sex with guys because i wont never have a relationship with a guy so she doenst see it as a threat. other girls on the other hand i cant have sex with. Though i still try to convince her becasue iam not get any near enough my needs.<br>moral of the story, talk with her you piece of ass</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>My wife cheated on me I was working in Saudi at the time their divorce system beats ours hands down No alimony no custody problems :)<br><br>Her parents tried to get me charged when I returned to the uk. though as I hadn't been present at the stoning there was nothing I could be charged with.</br></br></br>  <br>Repeating once again, they aren't needs...just wants and desires. You made the commitment. You could've talked to him about getting healthier and supported him throughout the process. You just found a temporary solution to a long term problem. Pft. Women and their limiting thinking.</br>  <br>Worthless whore. You need him but you aren't willing to sacrifice anything for that need. This is why men don't respect women. You're fucking children with no concept of give-and-take. You should divorce him. Even though it's your fault, you'll get the house and kids anyway. He'll be destroyed but at least he'll know where he stands. Don't fucking act like you care enough not to do it. That's what'll happen the moment you can't have your cake and eat it too like a little child.<br><br>p.s. You're fucking 41? The only reason you're getting any action is because you'll spread your legs for anything, plus the other dude probably gets off on cucking your beloved husband. Don't act like your husband's the only one that let himself go. You're uglier than you think, unless you're a fucking immortal elf or vampire, you dumb cunt. You're way past the sell-by date, don't kid yourself.</br></br></br>  <br>That's a fine picture of a naughty girl who needs to be spanked.<br><br><br>Oh, also this thread is fake. No women old enough to be married to a 42 year old man would be here.</br></br></br></br>  <br>checked</br>  I only cheat on my wife with guys.<br><br>For some reason I don't feel that bad about it.</br></br>  <br><br>Not true. There are a lot of old timers on /b/. Not everyone who showed up at this board was 15 like moot.</br></br>  The trick is to not get married. I'm 38 and I fuck girls 18-25 all the time. Just go to the gym and take care of your skin. They love it.  Divorce first then you're free to do whatever.  <br>needs aren't just things that help you survive. needs are something we need to keep us healthy and happy, otherwise there would be no point in life anyway.</br>  <br>Translation. I like the security and support marriage offers me. On the other hand, I like fucking doofuses young enough to be my child because it reminds me of when my body was firm and attractive. Not like when I look in the mirror now, seeing saggy tits, a drooping ass, and wrinkles all over my face. Grow old gracefully you cow,</br>    <br>pedo</br>  <br>THANK YOU! A person with common sense. Looking at this thread, you all sound like lonely virgins and angry because you're simply NOT attractive enough to cheat with anyone and jealous that I have the freedom to.</br>  Yes you are fucked up individual  <br><br> 'not to', not 'to not' <br><br> you're 38 and still make this mistake </br></br></br></br>  <br>When you get my age, and they're throwing themselves at you... Do you honestly think you'll say no? I bet not,</br>  <br>:* luv you too, bae. You're too stupid to hate</br>  <br>How's that confirmation bias working out for you?<br><br>You know, I'll bet OP, if she were real, wouldn't find this so reasonable if it was her husband cheating on her. But that's how woman logic works. "I deserve this because I want, no, NEED it!" Yet "That bastard is a selfish disgusting slezeball, why can't he sacrifice for me?"</br></br></br>  <br><br>lol "What that guy is doing is wrong! because I'm jealous that I am not that guy!"</br></br>  <br>Are you literally retarded? It's a needs vs wants argument. They're totally different things. People live their lives without sex. Not saying that you have to. You had other options such as a divorce or talking to him about it. You just wanted sex so you had sex, focusing on your own selfish agenda like the person above said. You're on /b/, a forum where people post gore, child porn, and rape videos, and everyone here still thinks you're a terrible selfish bitch.</br>  kek. All these fags are taking the b8. <br><br>Stop being so retarded.</br></br>  <br>Feel like a cunt ......<br><br><br>Get it? GET IT?</br></br></br></br>  It's morally wrong. That said, I cheated on my wife constantly with much younger girls. I'm simply okay with being morally wrong.  <br> There are other ways of dealing with your lack of satisfaction that don't involve infidelity. <br><br>im genuinely interested, care to elaborate anon? i can only think of masturbation and that is sort-of cheating if you fantasize with someone who isnt your SO</br></br></br>  <br>You must be new here</br>  OP is not a female, just some neckbeard laying bait.<br><br>But on the subject of cheating. I've never done it and I don't see myself ever doing it in the future. I've had plenty of opportunities to cheat on my girlfriends but I never went through with it.<br><br>There's some lines you just don't cross and that's one of them for me</br></br></br></br>  I'm hungry so I enjoy taking the bait. Ever think about that?  <br>Yet you still posted ITT.</br>  Women, am I right?  <br>I haven't fucked a girl in 2 years because how broken I was from her cheating. Men don't just fuck because their horny,</br>  <br>Well, you are a cunt. If you're actually not a neckbeard.</br>  <br>You never grew up. You think like a child. You may have a career, a salary, an education, a house... maybe even a kid. But you never grew up. You never matured.<br><br>Grow the fuck up.</br></br></br>  Buy a dildo you slut  <br>you should kill yourself</br>  <br>You just summarized the female mind.<br><br>Which is behind the feminism movement and the liberal agenda.<br><br> I WANT THIS BECAUSE MY FEELINGS TRUMP YOUR LOGIC AND FAIR PLAY </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think it's unusual or morally wrong. I'm convinced that MOST people cheat. Who's to say your husband isn't banging a college girl himself?<br>However, you should divorce him if you see infidelity as an ongoing thing.<br>Also - trust me - you're gonna get caught.</br></br></br>  In a scenario like this, you know the husband is out working trying to provide for her while she has tons of free time to fuck random 19 year old guys. You're also a selfish bitch because you're trying to get the both of both worlds. You can't have both with two separate guys just because you think you're entitled to a "redo" or because you fucked up by marrying him. I'm sure you aren't a 10/10 or anyone to ogle at yet he still works to provide for you. You're worthless and a lost cause. (If you're not baiting)  <br>I'm not OP. and people also die, you know? there's no real reason we have to survive anyway so why do you define needs as what makes us survive?</br>  <br>Thread</br>  <br>you mean else, not elif</br>  <br><br>If it took you two years to get over a worthless whore, you deserved that desert dick.<br><br>Not once have I thought "well, she might do it, so I might as well get hard and fuck this bitch til I cum". You want to fuck her; so fuck her.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh. No. It's the grammar police. I'm gonna go stand in the corner now, mommy.</br>  <br><br>Good, stay there.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;631683521 <br>She probably is, you sound like a huge fag.</br>  <br>that's because men and women have different roles in life. we have to be protectors.</br>  <br>Says the man in an affair with a married woman, drinking the poison that killed his earlier relationship</br>  <br><br>It both works out. I usually use 'elif' because if I changed the equation down the road I would also have to change the 'else'</br></br>  <br>I understand what you're saying but needs are already defined. Food, water, shelter. Technically speaking, anything else is just a want or desire. While you could use the word "need" to describe something you REALLY want. Eg. "I need Fallout 4 when it comes out. I can't live without it." You could indeed live without it. She didn't need the sex to survive.</br>  Wow. At least have the decency to leave him...  <br>.........<br>What the fuck does that have to do with his point<br><br>There's like, no correlation there. At all.</br></br></br></br>  Never cheated on anyone. Got cheated on in college tho. That shit sucks, will drive you mental. People who cheat on their spouses are weak, sad, pathetic people.  You should just poison him and kill him. That way you get all of his money and you can run off with the 19 year old stud.  I can't believe how fucking hypocritical people can get. Things ain't black or white. Sure, being cheated on sucks balls, but her reasons are perfectly understandable. It's not "right", of course, but she already knows that much. She has needs and urges to satisfy. It's that simple. No matter how much she could hurt her husband in the long run; you don't get to call her a whore.<br><br>Most of you fucking subhuman pervs would instantly jump at the slightest chance of an affair. You guys are just taking the chance to let out your grudges against all those women who wouldn't fuck you. Most of you will stay this way for a long time, maybe even forever. And that's a goos thing.<br><br>That said, OP, just let it be. Either keep this going or don't, but never tell him if you can live with the guilt. The way I see it, you'll just make him suffer and your marriage will break down. Nobody wins, everybody loses.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm gonna need a sauce on that little princess</br>  <br>oh true</br>  <br><br>I know, right? Listen, I can shut every cunt in here up with one teenage quote; you know the kind, the one that young'uns start spouting when they realise life is finite.<br><br>You all have your ideals, your morals; you spout wisdom and tout truths, but at the end of the day...</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh fucking well, if it weren't me she'd just be fucking someone else. I'm not lying to anyone or breaking my vows, if she wants to be a piece of shit that is her business. And I do let her know that I think she's a shit person for it. I think she gets off on it.</br>  <br>So OP already know her actions are wrong so why is she continuing them? Like anon posted above, it's a short term solution to a long term problem. No need to do it behind his back. Otherwise he's being mislead and deceived for his entire life.</br>   married, throw party <br> get drunk. absolutely wasted <br> make out with best friend's fiance and best friend's wife at the same time <br> play with both of their tits for a very long time <br> get both of them to give me a handjob at the same time <br> wake up next day <br><br>what. have. i. done.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Im thinking arbys</br>  <br>Your best friend had a wife and a fiancee?<br><br>How the fuck does that work exactly</br></br></br>  Will give my two cents, either if it's bait or not. <br><br>I never had problems with getting pussy, so I started dating girls at 14 or so, fucking them and whatsoever. Until 19, I always had stable relationships. Got cheated a lot.<br><br>That shit fucked something up in my brain, so right now, 25 years old, i've got a stable girlfriend, 4 fuckbuddies, and 2 girls who i say i love you twice each week and they grant me pussy. I also fuck everything i can.<br><br>and for the gf i use her for caressing and that shit, that i also need.<br><br>i lost every morality abt this some time ago. no regrets. feels good. just takes a lil bit of skill not to be caught.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>two different guys. the 3 of us are the three fucking amigos</br>  <br>"Most of you fucking subhuman pervs would instantly jump at the slightest chance of an affair."<br><br>Just an assumption. Maybe they use 4chan as an outlet so they don't. Long term solution. Tard.</br></br></br>  <br><br>That's some French English if I've ever seen it. How's the vigne over there, my nigga?</br></br>  Cheating on your husband instead of talking to him and potentially fixing the problem? But no, you'd rather risk ruining your relationship over your whorish tendencies of getting off. You don't deserve him. Die in a fucking hole somewhere you vapid selfish cunt. Have fun when karma bites you in the ass.  <br>So, as long as you get what you want, you consider lying to the face of someone you supposedly love to be a 'win'? Typical feminist logic</br>  All out of fucks to give today and you're a cunt. Hit me up if you're in 813 though  <br>Yeah apparently not if you're fucking around with their women<br><br>some fucking amigo.</br></br></br>  <br> were </br>  <br>I bet you'll say that he's a fucking traitor when he decides to do the same thing and eventually leave you for some younger tart.

Great food and people.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm 14 and this is deep </br>  <br>  <br>Doubt it because OP said he's fat and unattractive</br></br>  <br>i know you are but what am I</br>   pretending to be grill <br>Yeah nice, I so do not believe.<br><br> be me, many moons ago. <br> stuck my dick in 3 friends wife. <br> only 1 was with approval. <br> all 3 hate me now. <br> moons pass, me now married. <br> would go for highscore if you dicked my wife. <br> I'd start out with people who owed you money, and work up the list. <br>  I don't tell this story to anyone, but felt the need to share today. <br><br>Yes it's hypocritical. she and I started in an open relationship, and are now married, so I know all sides of this spectrum.<br><br>Being an oldfag, IRL, life is short, do what you NEED to do, not what you WANT to do. If he gets drippy dick from you fucking niggers, consequences will never b the same.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But fucking bullfighting, man. I just hate this country because of old fucking fashioned traditions</br>  <br>Probably bait. Sex is sex just like masturbation. If you needed the boy to get off should have talked to hubby would have probably been cool if just sex. <br><br>If it's not just sex you are a human piece of trash. Also tits or GTFO</br></br></br>  "Because I need it" whoooooooreeee  This is now a cum on face thread  <br><br>And we still sing 'God save the Queen'; to each their own, my /b/rother. Tradition dies eventually. Be proud of where you come from.</br></br>  <br>Because doing wrong or right is besides the point. Never considered the possibility that her having sex with another man might actually help their marriage? She gets what she needs (or considers she needs) and keeps her marriage going despite this. If he finds out he'll have every right to go apeshit and dump her. If he doesn't, things will stay OK. That's all there's to it, really.</br>  <br>Tru</br>  <br>9/10, would rape.</br>  Is OP Hispanic? If so then it is perfectly acceptable. Those beaner chics are worse than fucking niggers when it comes to impulse control.  <br>Well by that logic, the hubby and marriage does matter and marriage is a life long bond so she's going to be with him her entire life. By that, it would be her interest to find a long term solution, not a short term one. She asked for advice and the path she took is going to leave her with a broken marriage and a broken life.</br>  HOW<br><br>IN THE FUCK<br><br>DO YOU NOT COMMUNICATE<br><br>IN A RELATIONSHIP OF 20 YEARS<br><br>HOW THE FUCK DO YOU NOT COMMUNICATE YOUR NEEDS TO YOUR <br>LIFE PARTNER<br>OF TWENTY FUCKING YEARS<br>YOUR SEXUAL DESIRES<br>AND YOUR NEEDS<br><br>HOW THE FUCK DO YOU THINK IT'S OKAY TO<br>CHEAT ON YOUR FUCKING HUSBAND, YOUR PARTNER OF TWENTY YEARS<br>WITHOUT EVEN FUCKING TALKING IT THROUGH LIKE A NORMAL HUMAN BEING<br>AND WITHOUT EVEN TRYING TO GO ON ABOUT IT WHILE BEING HONEST TO YOUR SIGNIFICANT OTHER AND HAVING A FRANK DISCUSSION<br>WHY THE FUCK DO YOU THINK THIS IS ACCEPTABLE<br><br>REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<br><br>REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<br><br>GET OUT<br><br>REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE</br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>      <br>/thread</br>  <br>Guyyyyzzz anon said right and wrong is besides the point so I'm gonna go stab, kill, and rape 5 children because I NEED to or else I can't live anymore.

Instead of fucking someone else, try to tell your partner that things have gotten stale, and try to work it out from there.<br>If you can't, break up.

You know that's true, and it doesn't have to be.<br>Leave the poor guy.</br></br>  <br>My bad kek. My friend's dad never cheating on his wifey even though she coudn't provide because of the pain she was in. OP just took her hubby for granted and is now cheating on him. She makes it sound like she has succcch a hard life.</br>  <br>Yes, you are a fucking cunt for doing that.</br>  <br><br>It was 10 years ago, so sadly, no; you can have a story instead if you want.<br><br>So it's Christmas, she's been visiting me for 5 months at this point; it's freezing outside, but we want to know what it's like to fuck in the open. We sneak downstairs and outside at about 2 am, it's minus temperatures, all we have is a towel to sit on.<br><br>I sit myself down on a little outside storage box, my house was on a back-street so it was out of sight, no one really to bust us. Anyway, she starts by sucking me off, and let me tell you; I don't know if you've felt minus temperatures on your balls and butthole, but that shit ain't nice. <br><br>The only thing keeping me hard was her hot mouth and her slightly warm hands rubbing my balls. She started shaking, her nipples were like diamonds standing out from her skin. Two people walk up an alley-way next to my house, we ducked but there's no way they didn't see us. We waited til they fucked off and ran inside, my dick was freezing cold at this point. We just kept going once inside the house on the floor, I slid it in her and my god, that difference in temperature put me over the edge faster than I could comprehend what was going on.<br><br>I told her I was going to cum and she asked for it on her tits; I thought fuck that, you're getting it in the face. "Okay", I said, lying. I pull out and move up to her knowing full well I wanted to get her in the face; she still has no idea it was on purpose. Her thin face and neck coated.<br><br>She forgave me after I went for round two and came in her instead. Also I kissed her after I came, so she saw that as payback.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Hope you get doxed, then someone tells your husband you whore  <br>Well not anymore apparently</br>  <br> 18~25 <br> pedo <br>You keep using that word...</br></br></br>  <br>Nice! Kek'd at the cumshot part. <br>Old girlfriend: Stops sucking for a second and says "You're not going to cum in my mouth are you?" <br><br>Me: "Nope"<br><br>Two minutes later, load blown down her throat.<br>Classic.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I was cheated on and lied to...the lying was worse to me. Don't be a liar AND a whore. Tell him and let him decide what to do with you. If he wants to be a sorry cuck then whatever. If he wants to divorce you then good. Marriage isn't for humans anyways. We need variety. No one should get married, ever.</br></br>  <br>Also, I have a story about fucking a girl in a laundry room on a dryer if you or anyone is interested.</br>  <br>DUBs checked.<br>You I like. Thanks 4 being honest.<br>Being older, married, etc myself.

Learning Japanese requires more of learning the written language, because the writing system was developed first, then spoken. English is the opposite it was spoken first then written down, so there's a lot of stuff you have to learn from hearing it and speaking it. But this is mainly if you're talking about improving speaking English.<br><br>Reading English helps a hell of a lot to be able to communicate better in writing. Japanese has more value on their writing system to write, read, and speak it.</br></br></br>  <br>Write something correctly so I can reply to it.</br>  <br> Women use pussy as a weapon, they always get their way. Always. <br><br>Beta as fuck.</br></br></br>  <br>kek<br>japanese was first written and then spoken? wtf</br></br>  <br><br>blah blah blah</br></br>  <br>Absorbed myself in it all forms of media, it's mostly memorization of the writing system. Japanese is easy because of this. It's very literal. The kanji is the worse to remember, but once you memorized about 2000 you're functional with this amount. The katakana is genius. I really like the language.</br>  <br><br> dat list <br>Are you a grill?</br></br></br>  <br> because I'm so wanting to go to Japan to meet Japanese men who barely have sex with their own women, let alone trying to get a foreigner <br>Girls don't watch anime.</br></br>  <br><br> Algorithms. The brain is an analog computer. I programmed myself. <br><br>That's the most autistic thing I've heard all week. So you're probably telling the truth - some autistic people are really good with language.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Girls don't even exist.</br>  <br>だめだ<br>俺の日本語が悪いけど、君の日本語の方が悪いと思ってる。</br></br>  <br><br>They read plenty of homosexual manga though. Go to any bookstore in my country and you'll find shelves full of that crap.</br></br>  <br>同意します。</br>  took a screen cap so you can't copy/paste to google translate.  <br><br>They're not factually speaking. Language has an implied sense of emotion, it's stimuli that isn't self created hence why so many autistic people are mute, or simply grunt to communicate. <br><br>Autism is the anti-communication illness. It forces one to recess deeply into themselves and stay there until death. <br><br>If you put 10 hungry autists locked together in one room, with a fresh pizza at the center, not a one would take a bite or go near the pizza out of fear of the actions of the other people in the room. <br><br>Savantism is a parlor trick, Camilla Parker Bowles nephew Dereck Paravincinni is a piano savant with autism, he cannot read/write/communicate meaningfully or tie his own shoes. <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=cbq<wbr>jxmTNivQ</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>what about the grammar?</br>  <br><br>Stop asking questions, he's a lying weeaboo who got rekt ITT and is dancing around questions now.</br></br>    <br>edgy</br>  <br>You got rekt, buddy. </br>  <br><br> nice...sittinggood...nnhhh THE RUMBA 1234!!! <br><br>kek</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> implying that's not the same person <br> implying that I care about people obsessed with a dying nation full of disease infested degenerates </br></br></br>  <br>Just more memorization.
