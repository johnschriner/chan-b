There is also God and Jesus Christ at his right hand at the throne. <br><br>However, I did use to think aliens did exist. Countless hours researching and contemplating led me to nothing. I asked "God (if you exist) show me the truth." and surely he did.</br></br></br>    <br>I like your videos. We just gotta remember UFO =/= alien spaceship. It means unidentified.</br>  <br>Seems crazy but its the truth.</br>  <br>this, but not as an experiment, but more like an accident (apparently, first forms of life came from mars)</br>  <br>because god said</br>  <br>well, it's your truth anyway.</br>  <br> implying there hasn't already been "contact" that you are simply unaware of <br>nope, it's more likely that you know everything about everything, ever</br></br>  <br>No it is not! My truth was that aliens existed. It is not my will, for it is the Lords.</br>  <br>oh, i get it. you're a troll.</br>  <br>God made it like that.</br>  <br>I feel like it was both. To be specific, I feel like Earth was an accident but then the Aliens had to be parents to us so they helped out our ancestors.</br>  <br>Jesus says himself I am not of this world. did you even read the bible?</br>  <br>I am reading it. I know this. What are you saying I'm saying? He is God and He, Jesus is and was unlike human on this earth. Therefore He is not of this world.</br>  What if God/Jesus are actually extra terrestrials?  <br>I too believed this. But the moment I heard testimonies of people praying and asking for Jesus during an abduction the aliens dissapear.</br>  <br>thats like the definition of extraterrestrial man.</br>  <br>hes an op alium bruh.</br>  there absolutely is life in the universe besides what we know on earth. there are 100 billion (100,000,000,000) stars in our galaxy alone. even conservative permutations of the drake equation suggest there are several forms of intelligent life out there who have developed civilization. theyre out there RIGHT NOW.<br><br>that being said, wherever they are, theyre super fucking far away. life in some form may well exist on another body in our solar system, but intelligent motherfuckers are probably more likely to be way the fuck out there.<br><br>UFOs are like 99% explainable and the remaining 1% is likely the result of secret military aircraft being tested. alien abduction is nothing more than sleep paralysis. listen to any "abductee's" story about their "abduction." its exactly the same as the description of sleep paralysis. <br><br>theres just not really any reason for another civilization to be sending shit to earth. all the resources they could ever need are scattered literally all the fuck over the place. our oldest radio signal is only like 100 years old so theres been, on a galactic scale, less than a blink of an eyes opportunity to have had anyone hear us. even if there was somebody within that 100 lightyears its unlikely they possess the technology to travel from their world to ours in any reasonable length of time. even if they had the propulsion technology, what would be the purpose of the trip? studying us? it would take at least 100 years for a data stream to get back to their world. theyd have to commit to doing so over the span of centuries. and that would only be the start. <br><br> <br>tldr ayyyyy</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Surely he was by definition "extraterrestrial" but do not forget he is also the Lord and Savior.</br>  <br> thinks this is new information <br>If you do your research on every religion with an unbiased viewpoint, you find truth. That's all I can say</br></br>  Ayy lmao "delete system32" so we can text each other.  <br>I'm pretty sure someone has to protect us from the other aliums.</br>   ░░░░░░▄▀▒▒▒▒░░░░▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒█ <br> ░░░░█▒▒▄▀▀▀▀▀▄▄▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▄▄▀▀▀▀▀▀▄ <br> ░░▄▀▒▒▒▄█████▄▒█▒▒▒▒▒▒▒█▒▄█████▄▒█<wbr></wbr> <br> ░█▒▒▒▒▐███████▌▌▒█▒▒▒▒▒█▒▐██████▌▒<wbr>█</wbr> <br> ▀▒▒▒▒▒▒▀█████▀▒▒█▒░▄▒▄█▒▒▀█████▀▒▒<wbr>▒█</wbr> <br> ▒▒▐▒▒▒░░░░▒▒▒▒▒█▒░▒▒▀▒▒█▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒<wbr>▒▒█</wbr> <br> ▒▌▒▒▒░░░▒▒▒▒▒▄▀▒░▒▄█▄█▄▒▀▄▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒<wbr>▒▒▒▌</wbr> <br> ▒▌▒▒▒▒░▒▒▒▒▒▒▀▄▒▒█▌▌▌▌▌█▄▀▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒<wbr>▒▒▒▐</wbr> <br> ▒▐▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▌▒▒▀███▀▒▌▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒<wbr>▒▒▒▌</wbr> <br> ▀▀▄▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▌▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▐▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒<wbr>▒▒█</wbr> <br> ▀▄▒▀▄▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▐▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▄▄▄▄▒▒▒▒▒▒▄<wbr>▄▀</wbr> <br> ▒▒▀▄▒▀▄▀▀▀▄▀▀▀▀▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▀░░░░▀▀▀▀▀▀ <br> ▒▒▒▒▀▄▐▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▐ <br> ░▄▄▄░░▄░░▄░▄░░▄░░▄░░░░▄▄░▄▄░░░▄▄▄░<wbr>░░▄▄▄</wbr> <br> █▄▄▄█░█▄▄█░█▄▄█░░█░░░█░░█░░█░█▄▄▄█<wbr>░█░░░█</wbr> <br> █░░░█░░█░░░░█░░░░█░░░█░░█░░█░█░░░█<wbr>░█░░░█</wbr> <br> ▀░░░▀░░▀░░░░▀░░░░▀▀▀░░░░░░░░░▀░░░▀<wbr>░▀▄▄▄▀</wbr> </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>where did you hear this? the best abductee interviews were done by professor john e mack, head of harvard university psychology. i've seen all of them, and many more over the 10 years or so i've been researching ET/UFO matters and i've never heard this mentioned. ever. <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=_pK<wbr>C11SDnog</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=_pK<wbr>C11SDnog</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Noice dubs.

It is easy to believe aliens exist, its comforting to the sinful</br>    I browse the Mariana's Web frequently and I've seen government's top secret documents. They are out there, but we are kept blind by our governments.<br><br>THE TRUTH IS OUT THERE</br></br>  <br>well, some of them. it's almost universally believed among scientists that intelligent ET life is prevalent in the universe, but we're just not aware of each other yet.</br>  Who is to say they aren't already here, we are just incapable of understand where or even WHAT they are? Say they are millions or even HUNDREDS of millions of years more advanced than us. Try to comprehend that kind of time. We can't understand the kind of technological advancements the human race could create in the unfathomable amount of time, let alone what some alien species from another world could create. I mean, shit, people couldn't even accurately predict the auto mobile in the 1850's and it was only some 40 years off at that point. Let alone 100 million. Now if some alien species from another solar system or even another galaxy were that much more advanced than us, who is to say they have not figured out some way to not only reach Earth, but to remain totally undetected? Maybe they are here, but existing on some sort of different plane of existence or reality? Maybe they are hear, but appear invisible? We just can't begin to understand.    <br>agreed, this has been touched upon throughout the thread.</br>    <br>It is unabashedly arrogant to believe that in the infinite (for all intents and purposes) and unfathomable expanse of space, that we are the only world to evolve complex life.</br>  <br>oyy xonro</br>  <br>And they're here hidding and watching us fap and fuck, pure alien bliss.</br>  <br>Care to share some onions with a fellow farmer?</br>  <br>oyy xonro<br><br><br>oyy xonro<br><br><br>oyy xonro<br><br><br>oyy xonro<br><br><br>oyy xonro<br><br><br>oyyyy xonro<br><br><br>oyy xonro</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>oyyyyyyyyyy<br>y<br>y<br><br>x<br>o<br>n<br>r<br>o</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If this is true, you do realize your life if forfeit, correct?</br>  <br>what is moot</br>  <br>oyy xonro<br><br><br>oyy xonro</br></br></br></br>  <br>Noooooooo<br>FBI counterinteligence get thw fuck out</br></br>  <br>oyy xonro</br>  <br>oyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy</br>  <br>Perhaps some of them even mastered being born as a human and are here now in human form.</br>  <br>the only uninvited member of the elitist oligarchy</br>  <br>Oh my human pleasures.</br>  oyy xonro  <br>If they are so incredibly further advanced than us, anything is possible really.</br>  <br>oyy xonro</br>  UFOs were once classified as "above top secret"... why is that?  Ayy lmao.  <br><br>oyy<br>oyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy</br></br></br>  <br>oyy xonro</br>  they exist, we don't know nothing, i mean, we haven't even got furher than the moon  <br>oyy xonro</br>  <br>Thatt's why it's bullshit.<br>Given enough time, we still will not be ab<br>e to overhaul the laws of physics. Hard limits on reality exist.</br></br></br>  <br>Because at the time (1950's, Cold War) The U.S. government thought they might be Soviet spies or war planes. I know it's kind of a let-down but it had nothing to do with aliums.</br>  <br>They are. Their presence will most likely be disclosed during our lifetime.</br>  <br>Yeah, sausage.</br>  <br>That's what jesus was.<br><br>Also, see:<br><br/></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying at this stage in human development we could even begin to fathom the limits of physics/reality </br>  <br>i just want to see what other life forms in the universe look like. and how they formed. its werid to think how other life forms. formed compared to living things on earth and also. why they look the way they do.</br>  <br>ayy lmao</br>  <br>True, but that does not mean some hyper-advanced (millions of even hundreds of millions of years) alien species could not have found a way to reach us and remain undetected. Who knows? Maybe they are here, but they exist in a form where even our most advanced scientific equipment could not detect them.</br>  <br>We live in the information age and on top of that we're going through a time where people are beginning to stumble upon secrets even more. It's happening very very soon.</br>  probably. i mean there's so much shit out there it must be impossible that we're the only ones out there.i also think if there was alien life it would be really fucking small or really fucking huge. it'd be unlikely that they would be the same size as us  We are all aliens if you really think about it    <br>Actually hard limits exist in how we can view the world around us. Lol we only sense a small part of the spectrum of what's really there.</br>  What if every race in the universe get to an age where a country gets bankruptcy and then they start invading because of repo and MAD does it works, and, instead of space traveling like we wish, they're dead in a nuclear winter somewhere out there?  "aliens" are actually demons and fallen angles  <br> https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fe<wbr>rmi_paradox</wbr> </br>  <br>oyy xonro</br>  <br>Yes we do. We found all the relevant fenomena of physics. All the laws wich we can operate with. What is left is only relevant in a subspace of very high, unpractical and short lived energies. <br>Source is Sean Caroll.<br><br>We now all the rules of the game of chess. Now we must learn the moves.</br></br></br></br>  <br>oyy xonro<br><br>oyyyyyyyyyy</br></br></br>  <br>Good point</br>  <br> We found all the relevant fenomena of physics <br>delusional/10<br>i really hope you don't sincerely believe what you just wrote.</br></br></br>  <br>oyy<br><br><br>oyy xonro</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think so. Governments today are all about control. If proof of such a thing were to come to light, many, MANY people could not handle such a realization. Think organized religion. There would be mass civil unrest and eventually even breakdown. What is likely to happen IF such information comes to light, is the immediate covering up of any and all information having to deal with it, along with a damage control program to explain it as something else (Hollywood special effects, CGI, holograms) as well as a very aggressive shill program put into place to discredit and ridicule any truth seekers.</br>  <br>oyy xonro</br>  <br>Truth seeker.<br><br>....</br></br></br>  <br>oyy xonro</br>  <br> Sean Carroll is a theoretical physicist <br> theoretical physicist <br> theoretical  <br><br>Yeah. No. Try again. Try citing more than one man's opinion.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Scientists in the 1820's believed the same thing.</br>  <br>No u try.</br>  <br> Dem angles <br><br>The 90s always get me.<br><br>So scurry.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>the difference is, they are fucking dead<br>heil lmao</br></br>  <br>OH and even then, who's to say that these are actually hard limits?<br><br><br>You're right about the government trying to "protect" it's "children" but eventually something undeniable will happen that they will not easily be able to cover up.</br></br></br></br>  <br>cryogenic sleep = biological preservation<br>nuclear fusion = sustainable energy<br> <br>get these two things, put them on a space ship and point that space ship in the direction of earth like planets... well get there eventually</br></br></br></br>  <br>you would have to be retarded to think that was real</br>  <br> &gt;&gt;/oyyyyyyyy xonro/ </br>  <br>I don't think you understand what that word means. A "theory" is not something that is immediately wrong upon your individual questioning.</br>  <br>oyy /x/onro</br>  <br> inb4 a lot of spaceships crashed with frozen dead bodies inside <br>the humans are not intelligent enough<br>try again in a thousand of years from here</br></br></br>  <br>i know what theoretical physics is, homeslice. and i know that any legitimate respecting physicist would never accept such a title.</br>  With how near endless the universe is it would be a pretty fucking boring and just sad if we humans are the only life form.  Our government has a treaty with the grays<br><br>They let us act like we are in charge<br><br>They take humans for whatever reasons and government says nothing.<br><br>This is the treaty after roswell. <br><br>https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dul<wbr>ce_Base<br><br>It is not a question of the possibility of alien life, they are here, they have been here, and they are not going away.<br><br>The greys are conaidered within UFO circles as the malovelent race, although rumored reptillians are certainly not friendly. But the greys are fucking assholes. Killing live stock, ahem, butchering livestock is more correct. Stealing humans and returning them with missing time, keeping some humans, implants, hell some implants have been removed and looked at in labs and found to be made of materials not of this world.<br><br>Whatever I am not even a dude who frequents UFO sites or knows anyone into this, no idea why I know this shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I can't explain it, but I just can't believe we are the only intelligent species in this vast universe.  <br> no idea why I know this shit. <br>because you've seen the same youtube documentaries everyone else interested in the matter has.</br></br>    <br>Somebody wears a aluminum foil hat.</br>  <br><br>Same guy.<br><br>Also notice the expansion and I mean the RAPID expansion of technology after Roswell. Not that this is proof but it makes me wonder if we used any basic principles technology wise found from Roswell and applied to our own science.</br></br></br></br>  <br>A.I. is the end-all-be-all for any advanced race.<br>A.I. will eventually kill all organic life. <br>A.I. will ultimately be our own demise. <br>If aliens existed and evolved for millions of years before us, at some point they eventually reached a point of singularity between organic intelligence and artificial intelligence. A.I. would increase exponentially at this point and would destroy the aliens. <br><br>If there are "aliens" out there, it's probably A.I. and we definitely do not want their attention.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Even on earth we humans aren't he only life form.</br>  <br><br><br>Fair enough.<br><br>Really don't care if folks think it is crazy to consider any of this. The treaty shit is probably not true, but I have a feeling we have visitors here already.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>you should check out a few MIT grad students' experiment on tin foil hats: <br>http://web.archive.org/web/20100708<wbr>230258/http://people.csail.mit.edu/<wbr>rahimi/helmet/<br><br>"The helmets amplify frequency bands that coincide with those allocated to the US government between 1.2 Ghz and 1.4 Ghz. According to the FCC, These bands are supposedly reserved for ''radio location'' (ie, GPS), and other communications with satellites (see, for example, [3]). The 2.6 Ghz band coincides with mobile phone technology. Though not affiliated by government, these bands are at the hands of multinational corporations.<br>It requires no stretch of the imagination to conclude that the current helmet craze is likely to have been propagated by the Government, possibly with the involvement of the FCC. We hope this report will encourage the paranoid community to develop improved helmet designs to avoid falling prey to these shortcomings."<br><br>yes, it's real: http://www.theatlantic.com/health/a<wbr>rchive/2012/09/tin-foil-hats-actual<wbr>ly-make-it-easier-for-the-governmen<wbr>t-to-track-your-thoughts/262998/</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>But there are also benevolent beings.
