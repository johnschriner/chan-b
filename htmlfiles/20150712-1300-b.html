Been tryna find the number of this chick named Talia whom I met in Oregon a couple weeks ago, she looks almost exactly like this chick. Can anyone help a /b/ro out?  Bump<br>just want to post this image</br>  Stop being a little bitch and ask her for her number instead of looking for it on a singaporean imageboard  were the 90s objective a better time than now, or is our perception just colored by nostalgia?  <br>Both. We finally got over the post-war mayhem from Vietnam completely. Lasted until, well, 9/11. Then America started losing its shit</br>  <br><br>Yeah um....I'm still kind of waiting for us to stop losing our minds put a part of me knows that's never gonna happen. <br><br>I don't understand why we didn't just leave Iraq when Sadam was killed. Furthermore we didn't need to occupy Afghanistan to get Osama. He fucked off to Pakistan almost immediately and the military spent years playing where's waldo.</br></br></br></br>  <br>american wars are for profit, they're not meant to be won in any meaningful way, just prolonged.</br>  <br>I think they were. Despite the fact that cultural degeneracy was occurring, it wasn't as rampant. It was progressing though. By the early 2000's hip hop culture was becoming extremely prominent, and it has lead to a lack of decency. I believe reality TV also contributed to this, as did the prominence of a non-nuclear black family, predominantly single mothers.</br>  i also think that the rise of social media contributes to a lot of general malaise in the population  well, what i remember most is that the sandniggers were more sand and less nigger  <br>it all sucks, some might feel the decade they where born in sucked less <br><br>tl;dr everything is crap</br></br></br>  <br>I give it 30 more years and the societal ebb and flow will pull this god forsaken country into a new personality</br>  <br>Wow that's actually really profound and I agree</br>  <br><br>Highly insightful. <br><br>In impoverished areas people revert back to simple, tribal culture. Hence gang wars and men not sticking around to help care for children.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br> <br>Samefag</br></br></br></br>  <br>Thank you. I additionally believe shows like "jersey shore" are terrible for society. They normalize indecent, excessive, immoral, unnecessary, unintelligent, and morally irreprohensible behaviors. I've noticed certain people who habitually watch these programs begin to emulate certain behaviors, creating more drama in social circles.</br>  <br><br>The tribal culture post is mine. <br><br>Learn to samefag you twat.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br> <br>How is that so "profound" or "insightful"? He basically blamed it on niggers and the Kardashians</br></br></br></br>  <br>I loved wishbone</br>  <br><br>And?</br></br>  <br>I grew up in the 90s and they were shit.</br>  Not blaming blacks at all. I said hip hop culture. It would be ignorant to believe that blacks are also responsible for the commodification and distribution of it.  <br><br>Hip hop music went to he'll when it stopped being about the struggles of poverty and started being about who you're having sex with and how much money you have.</br></br>  extremelyoldfag here, i'd say that the "downhill" began around the kennedy era, and ever since then i've seen a decade-by-decade erosion of morality and social cohesion in this country and the west as a whole, now it's no longer a place of morals and values, just a place to make money. and some people would even call you a fascist for insisting on morals and values, now, not wanting to marry a used up whore is "misogynistic".  you know the drill  <br>rollings stone</br>  this target  <br>getttttt</br>  Drug discussion thread (cont.)  Ahh, regrouping :) Anyone jamming to music? currently jamming to a Kygo set  <br>listening to some old Kanye whilst stoned as fuck and watching some adult swim bruh bruh</br>  Gggggentlemen :) (old op) <br><br>Music is a good topic. Currently a Canadian rapper called dillan ponders! He's pretty darn good. Ironically nearly all of his songs are drug related</br></br>  <br>For all my stoners out there I'd recommend checking out Mick Jenkins- The Waters, especially the song jazz which is all kinds of chill. Another good rap song in my opinion is old English by young thug, great tune.<br><br>Anyone got any recommendations for music to listen to whilst rolling/stimmed up?</br></br></br>  <br>nice, rolling on .25 ecstasy and jamming to music while playing with dogs :)</br>  <br>Oh man liking this so far!

Thanks to the OP too, this was chill.</br>  <br>Peace brother. Nice chatting</br>  <br>not sure rap wise, he's pretty unique, I would definitely recommend listening to some Kendrick if you haven't listened to him before and also some Mac Demarco- Salad Days for some lazy, greasy stoner summer guitar riffs.</br>  <br>Think you should give Vince Staples a listen. Reckon you'd like him, dude</br>  <br>night bro<br>heres a pic of the GF cause you're cool</br></br>  <br>Cool I'll check em not sure if my bro will be cool with it but check my mates sound cloud out.
