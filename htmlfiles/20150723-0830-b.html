Let us know how that turns out for ya in another couple decades.</br></br></br>  <br>The poster thing is a pretty funny accusation, actually; I have no posters on my walls at all. Way more nihilistic.</br>  <br>happiness, laughter, self betterment, pure clean ideals &amp; objectives<br><br><br> try to not screw things up for other people. <br>if it doesn't come back on you though who cares, morality becomes a moot point, redundant. no fear of no repercussions, the environment is infinitely maluable and subjective, riddled and ridiculed with error and imperfection. objectivity is no longer achievable because of the interconnected fate of the human species. a critically sad error of time to be born. a bad era<br><br>dystopic psych associators should just kill themselves right now, you are the bad breed, its not about genes or blood, its individual judgement of consciousness, redundant fucking untelligence. murder god</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I have experienced that same feeling.<br><br>Answer is: its true. Life has no meaning. Because of that, the only thing you can do is try and enjoy it while it lasts.</br></br></br></br>  Sports<br>Now go set a goal and work towards it. Lose some weight and gain some muscles. Boosts self-esteem and makes you happy</br>  <br>Because my desire to explore and experience all the cool shit this world has to offer is greater than my desire to waste my life searching for answers that simply don't exist and waste my life.</br>  <br>It's the sad truth I feel; nihilism. I don't have any advice for you other than don't get hurt by people.</br>  <br>In other words, happiness is a biological impulse, so the best way to achieve it is with biological stimuli; food, sex, exercise, narcotics, social interaction, etc.</br>  <br>I've been down that road. And yes its satisfying to have a nice looking body. You feel better in your own skin, more comfortable with yourself. <br><br>However, at the end of the day, its just another superficial trait.</br></br></br>  <br>have kids</br>  <br>So you argue with my initial post...<br><br> This is the unpleasant truth to which all rational thinking eventually leads. There is no correct answer, you simply pick the one you like the best, or you end it. <br><br>...even though that's exactly what you've done.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The purpose of live is to feel good and have fun. You don't need anything else. Hang out with friends. Drink, do drugs, have sex. Find a way to finance your pleasures. Create something.</br>  <br>anon wouldn't by chance happen to be a USfag now would he?<br><br>an entire country, devoid of philosophy, producing generations of this shit.</br></br></br>  <br>being healthy is not a superficial trait you retard fuck.<br><br>injury pain is real</br></br></br>  <br>yeah, having kids solves all kinds of problems.<br><br>...and totally doesn't dump all your problems onto them.<br><br>lol</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Both of which are obviated by death, which is inevitable.</br>  <br>Being healthy is normal as far as I'm concerned. <br><br>Looking good while doing it is superficial.</br></br></br>  <br>nice dubs and nice post</br>  <br><br>well dude, then welcome to real life, just deal with it</br></br>    <br>Like...a mass shooting?</br>  <br>A lot of people never really have that epiphany and find it melodramatic sounding personally I think they just haven't learned enough to see it. It never changes once you realize it, although sometimes you might not actively think about it all the time but it doesn't really go away.<br>I've found having a strict job gave me a sense of purpose. Usually the average person can't really use a lot of their freedom and rights to do much so giving a few of them up is worth what you get out of it.</br></br>  <br>I meant I'm beyond thinking along the lines of "oh no existence is so pointless that I should just kill myself". Once you get older you realize you've just been thinking about stuff like that because your life is literally pointless for the first 20 or so years.<br><br>It's very unfortunate and twisted that our society has gone this way, some of our best years are completely wasted. Things didn't used to be like that.</br></br></br>  <br>if you're bored and have no purpose in life then have kids. They will give you a purpose unless you have mental problems.<br><br>Have a problem with my post? well eat my buldgy mushroom cock you fucking faggot</br></br></br>  <br>But thats just the thing. Wouldn't living be pointless once you come to this realization? <br><br>I think I'd rather be dead than other sheep in the herd of mindless people living their purposeless lives.</br></br></br>  its all a state of mind. sometimes our feelings manifest as groups of words that later on we'll realize we didn't really mean, or we might not understand. everyone knows positive attitudes exist, but not everyone can ward off being negative all the time. you have to discipline and push yourself and if you work hard enough, really simple/easily taken for granted things will start to seem like miracles.  <br> I meant I'm beyond thinking along the lines of "oh no existence is so pointless that I should just kill myself". <br>You're not actually reading what I'm saying, you're just projecting your teenage angst onto me.<br><br>I'll repeat it:<br>  There is no correct answer, you simply pick the one you like the best <br>Is exactly what you've done. You chosen an answer. Indeedn, you've chosen a really stereotypical answer: hedonism. Doing things that feel good. Like animals do.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> muh 1800s thinking <br> subjecting kids to my bullshit makes me feel better <br>lol<br>guess again faggot, and having kids won't solve your fucked up marriage either.<br><br>Have kids because you can afford to give that kid a wonderful fucking life, not because your selfish ass thinks they'll be a band-aid for your problems.<br><br>It just creates kids with fucked up upbringings that need therapy and shit up the world further as adults.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not true at all really it has to do with mood.<br><br>see <br><br><br><br><br><br>you may feel like that today but you know it's not the only thing you feel. it's mood/perspective.. the mind is tricky. i'd say you're normal but from personal experience working my balls off tends to make me more optimistic when I'm done.. just sitting drinking some tea is wonderful</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> not depressed, just have empty life and thinks there's no point in living <br>this is the DSM definition of depression retard</br></br>  <br>but the DSM is bullshit anon, its really hard to argue/explain and i'm probably not the best person for the job, but it's bullshit.</br>  <br>Well, Other than that trait, I don't feel depressed at all. <br><br>I laugh, love, function socially, blah blah blah. I just see no meaning to life.</br></br></br>  I'm going exactly through that, OP  <br><br>The DSM is more of a political tool that offers descriptive guidelines. The entire field of psychology is likely to be rendered obsolete by neurology in the next few decades.</br></br>  <br>Blowjobs are the only thing in life.<br>I can't enjoy sex, but blowjobs are always there for me.<br>Even if my gf is bad at them :(</br></br></br>  <br>You've got me interested, explain more about this neurology? If you know, what a gift that would be to have a likely smart person share some rare knowledge on /b/.</br>  <br> I think I'd rather be dead <br><br>You know this to be not true, or you would be in the ground instead of posting on /b/<br><br><br><br>Not sure how you could say I'm the one projecting teenage angst when you are acting like the classic annoying pseudo intellectual that just discovered Dostoevsky and despite not comprehending any of it acting like you've attained enlightenment.<br><br> hedonism <br><br>Yeah pursuing a woman is totally full blown hedonism, you've earned a fedora tip for that one.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>all anyone needs to know. also work hard</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm kind of thinking the same thing, we're making strides in neuroscience, but I know for certain it will be far more than a few years. Our knowledge of brain function is still shockingly rudimentary. We're at the level where we understand that some molecule binds to some receptor and then X,Y, and Z happens in the brain. We still don't know the how a lot of this happens nor why, just that it does happen.</br>  <br>I can't go into very much detail, since I'm not a neurologist. But basically if the mind is analogous to a computer, psychology is learning how it works by sitting down with a keyboard, mouse and screen and trying to use it and neurology is learning how it works by opening up the case and see what all the little components do.<br><br>Essentially, we're still just animals. Our brains aren't fundamentally different than other animals, they obey all the same physical laws, they're just a little bit more complex. When we understand the brain, we'll understand the mind.</br></br></br>  <br>I would rather be dead, but the ironic thing is that I see no meaning in being dead either. <br><br>Its like being stuck in limbo.</br></br></br>  do anything you faggot.<br><br>just because it doesnt have a "point" doesnt mean you cant do anything with it.<br><br>its a video game. do anything you want.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's true.<br>Psychology is to Neurology what Astrology is to Astronomy.<br><br>One creates mountains of gibberish out of trying to make sense of apparent effects and has a shitty track record of helping anything, the other studies the causes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>its called the beginning of nihilism, their are too types of people in this world<br><br>1. Men<br>Accepting the reality of life with not making any magical excuses and coming to terms with how life has no meaning, this gives the man room to remove any pre con sieved notions towards how to live their lives and start anew. This means to set their morals given there situation while imposing their beliefs on others soley based on control.<br><br>2. Bitches<br><br>Not excepting how life has no meaning and adhering to a convenient set of principles forced upon them by the men. <br><br>Know your place.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ignoring the ad hominem.<br><br> Yeah pursuing a woman is totally full blown hedonism <br>That's exactly what it is. You have biological urges and you're obeying them. You're not asking yourself why you want a woman in your life, you're not asking why sex feels good or questioning why humans are social animals, you're just doing it.<br><br>You've chosen your answer and stopped thinking. Which is exactly what I said the solution to existential nihilism is.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I don't think that psychiatry and psychology will be useless at least for another century.</br>  <br>That's pretty cool advice, chap.<br><br>You're a solid dude.</br></br></br>  <br>there is no point to life. that's a fact<br>But what you can do is not be a bitch</br></br>  <br>Damn, linked wrong text<br><br>I'm kind of thinking the same thing, we're making strides in neuroscience, but I know for certain it will be far more than a few years. Our knowledge of brain function is still shockingly rudimentary. We're at the level where we understand that some molecule binds to some receptor and then X,Y, and Z happens in the brain. We still don't know the how a lot of this happens nor why, just that it does happen.</br></br></br>  <br>Ok, cool analogy nonetheless. I will not forget that.</br>  <br><br>there is NO answer you faggot.<br><br>you've already figured that out. THERE IS NO ANSWER.<br><br>so to wonder about the answer for the next 80 years YOU ARE A FAGGOT RETARD.<br><br>THERE IS NO ANSWER NOW GO AND DO ANYTHING / ANY ANSWER</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>there are too types of people in this world<br><br>those that know the difference between to, too, and two,<br><br>and those who put 7 billion people into two types of people.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah... blowjobs are nice. <br><br>But what about after the blowjob?</br></br></br>  <br> http://www.nature.com/news/scienti<wbr>sts-read-dreams-1.11625</wbr> <br> http://news.sciencemag.org/brain-b<wbr>ehavior/2014/08/researchers-erase-f<wbr>earful-memories-mice</wbr></wbr> <br> http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/st<wbr>ory/2014/07/researchers-shed-new-li<wbr>ght-on-schizophrenia/</wbr></wbr> <br><br>I doubt it will take that long.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't act like you weren't the one to resort to ad hominem first.<br><br> That's exactly what it is <br><br>No, it's not. Comparing want a woman to hedonism is like saying wanting a beer is alcoholism. Know the meaning of the words you pick to insult people with.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And this is the answer? That there isn't one?<br><br>Pepe.jpg</br></br></br>  <br><br>ANYTHING OR NOTHING YOU PICK THE NEXT APPEALING ONE.</br></br>  <br><br>In the same boat myself.</br></br>  <br> there is NO answer you faggot. <br><br>...yeah. I know. I said that here: <br> There is no correct answer, you simply pick the one you like the best <br><br>Emotion and Reason are mutually exclusive. Would you kindly step away and breathe for a minute or two so you can think again?</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br>of course thats the answer THERE IS NO MEANING TO LIFE.<br><br>so make the decsion to do:<br><br>A.) WHATEVER<br><br>B.) NOTHING AT ALL (since theres no meaning, you have to follow suit and do nothing, right?)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>then you're ready for existential psychology<br>i suggest you read:<br>Soren Kierkegaard <br>albert camus: the stranger<br>or at least take a look at this youtube channel<br>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7<wbr>IcJI8PUf5Z3zKxnZvTBog</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>JUST DOOO EEEETTT</br>  <br>Hey thanks, I'll take a look.</br>  <br>Ah, there it is. You have a derogatory view of hedonism, which is why you interpreted it as an insult.<br><br> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedo<wbr>nism</wbr> <br> Hedonism is a school of thought that argues that pleasure is the primary or most important intrinsic good. In very simple terms, a hedonist strives to maximize net pleasure (pleasure minus pain). <br><br>That's all it means. Seeking pleasure. Doing things that feel good. Doesn't mean you have to become an obese, addictive slob in doing so.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  If there is no point in living then there is also no point in dying.  Create a gaming backlog. My never ending backlog is the only thing that is giving me purpose to keep on living, which will probably keep on piling up until the day I die of old age.<br><br>Gotta finish it.</br></br>  <br>It also allows for things like exercising because in exchange for a small amount of physical stress and muscle soreness, you get to enjoy the increased strength, the improved physique, and the wealth of social benefits that come with those traits.</br>  <br><br><br> YOU MUST GIVE LIFE PURPOSE</br></br></br>  <br><br>not really.<br><br>just do stuff. or sit there.<br><br>nobody is going to be "THE ONE" that found "THE" meaning to life.<br><br>ponder a little, fuck around a little, sit there a little, or a lot... or or or<br><br>OR<br><br>OR<br><br>x1,000,000</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Also when I said, "projecting teen angst," I wasn't trying to imply that you were currently experiencing it, I was just saying that those memories were coloring your interpretation of me.</br>  <br>looks like you are dying at 40</br>  <br>make a purpose</br>  LIFE = MULTIPLE CHOICE<br><br>or sit there with a pencil in your hand crippled by all the choices.<br><br>YOUR CALL OPIE</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think I'd mind dying at that age.</br>  <br>Yeah, it's a multiple choice test with no numbers or letters that never gets graded.</br>  OP here. <br><br>Thanks for contributing everyone. I think I've found my answer: Make a purpose. <br><br>Now its just a matter of determining what that purpose will be.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>it gets graded if you care to listen.<br><br>but thats a choice down the list of multiple choices too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Think so. But for me its more like the laidback thing I can always tell myself. No matter what happens it doesnt matter. Do what u want nothing matters.</br>  <br>Just camp out until the singularity hits and life will get very interesting.<br><br>Or you know...actually go outside and do shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Another test taker saying, "hey, that looks good" isn't what I mean by grading.</br>  <br><br>then find jesus, faggot.</br></br>  Just live your life. Keep doing what your doing. Because although you might not become the multi billion dollar man (or woman) that changes the lives of everyone, your actions do influence the lives of the people around you, matter how big or small your actions are. And when you are on your death bed +50 years from now (I don't know how old you are), just keep in mind the fact that your actions influenced someone else's actions, who influenced someone else's, who influenced someone else's, who may have ended up influencing that multi billion dollar man (or woman). Just know that you are here for a reason, no matter how big or small. Otherwise the universe would have killed you off by now.  TBH, lately i have been thinking about whats tehe meaning of life, and ever since i started thinking that i have not been afraid of doing dangerous shit, and dont care about dying or something (not suicidal thoughts) Im normal guy, party in weekends work in weekdays (18 years old on education) But i still got no clue of wtf to do with this gift called "Life" you guys understand me?  <br>I've grown out of playing pretend, thanks.</br>  <br>Too bad the planet is already FUBAR</br>  Kill urself,lol  <br>Literally anything. As long as you put your mind to it, almost anything is possible today. The means to become great are there. There really is no such thing as being born a genius anymore. The human mind and body are capable of doing some fucking cool shit. Want to become the head engineer of a company that builds future space habitation? Go for it. Want to be the worlds top free climber? Go for it. The only thing holding you back is your own effort. Oh, and you know, the worlds racism, sexism, and plethora of other -isms, but you can ignore those as long as you try hard enough. Just know you can't go beyond the laws of physics.</br>  <br>no, its not. grow up.</br>  <br>10 year old detected.</br>  <br>You need a joint my friend</br>    <br>Duh you fucking faggot you're life is meaningful if you make it so. Simply being alive isn't a reason to live.</br>  <br> I tried to fill the void in my worthless life with the acquisition of material things. <br> Being this edgy <br><br>Usually men stop liking fight club once they realize the author was a gay communist. You're fucking stupid. Material things are great, stop buying into the bullshit commiewood told you, faggot.<br><br>Swear you sound like a fucking 12 year old when you do this shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're so fucking autistic, we all WANT for you to kill yourself. Like holy shit I thought people could be pretentious. I'm glad I found reasons to live again. Wouldn't want to be some huge beta faggot like OP.</br>  <br>Yeah man,<br>4 years ago I decided I wanted to become a artist for video games and movies.<br>It's been my single focus since then.<br>Every day, As much as possible, without breaks...<br><br>I'm currently getting paid to help make a game so, It was all worth it!</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thats some really awesome artwork!</br>  daily. Here is what i do, think, why die and become nothing surrounded by nothing and deal with nothing through an endless time, if you can instead live a life and have a chanse at experience something great in any way"  <br>Yup, I would post one of my own but trying to become a professional and having your work traced back to 4chan isn't ideal.<br>I fucking love all you vile people but I don't want that on my CV</br></br>  <br>See? As long as you put effort in, literally everything (within the bounds of the laws of physics) is possible.</br>  <br>We're all insignificant you fool, look at the size of the universe. The important thing is that you shouldn't think of yourself as a human being that is useless. We're all part of the universe, we are just particles bumping up against eachother affecting what happens around us. When we die we return to the universe in a different from, we just join the other particles. <br>Not everybody can do everything, but everybody can do something. There's a bigger picture /b/ro, once you realise that we're all part of something bigger, something that is beyond our control.</br></br>  <br>It's true.<br>Pick something you love, find a way to make money from it so you don't have to suffer a shit job. <br>I'm currently charging 46+ Usd per hour while I'm drawing shit for video games.<br>You can do whatever you want friends!</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>And i alzó like that pic m8</br></br>  <br>I know how you feel, OP. I have no life. I go no where. I have nothing to look forward to. Everyday is the same. I'm broke, I can't work because of health problems. My life is in the toilet and I have no idea how to fix it. Trust me, my life is pointless too. You're not alone.</br>  <br>Yes I have considered the scale of the universe. The seemingly infinite cosmos only exemplifies our infinitesimal existence. <br><br>By the scale of the universe, we barely exist, and yet somehow we still do. Which is amazing.</br></br></br>  <br>You will enjoy the singularity theory</br>  do a flip fagit  <br>Honeslty, my problem is my lack of effort, motivation, support, or self esteem. I'm lazy as fuck, I lose motivation over night (I will literally be pumped about doing something, go to bed, and wake up the next morning saying "nah, not worth it, won't work"), the things I do like to do manage to upset my parents and friends (such as videogaming, to name one thing. They know I can make money off of it, they just hate it when I play video games in general), and he things I do have some chance of getting good enough to charge money on end up being things I won't actually pursue because anytime I make any mistake, I end up beating myself up to a point where its hard to bring myself to the point I was at prior to said mistake. So yeah.</br>  <br>You came to a realization? Man, you wouldn't last long enough to even penetrate a girl, I feel sorry for you</br>  <br>I completely understand and empathise with your sitaution. I've met many many people who pursue art who have that very same problem and they quit. <br><br>Thats why it has to be something you want to do above all else. I used to play video games both WOW and LOL were massive timesinks in my life but the more I drew and painted and learned what game design was like the more those became bleak and boring short term dopamine hits that could never compete with the joy I was getting from doing what I really loved. <br><br>Life is a long walk towards your grave, you can however fill it with things you enjoy along the way. Go outside and ruin your moms garden and try to grow something, research what you need to do to make it grow the best. Fuck if I know if you will enjoy it but before too long you will have some homegrown tomatoes (or weed if you are into that).</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sounds good to me</br>  <br>Took me a second to catch that one!</br>  <br>There's always the: "Turn your life around and find some meaning" option, but since this is 4chan I doubt anyone will take that option seriously.</br>  <br>I know how you feel op, I'm on the same boat.<br>I got so low in my life, I don't even mind the future, I just do whatever comes to my mind.</br></br>  <br>No it's true.</br>  <br>that's my life, all the days i try to find a reason to dont't kill myself, and that's what you have to, consider the following: if you feel your life is empty, the best you can do isn't try to find something that make u happy? yes is easy to kill u, is way and you must decide if take it or not, but think first in your family, in your friends etc, what they'll say?</br>  <br>Congrats faggot you've realized the most important thing anyone with two brain cells to rub together will come to understand. Now quit being all edgy and just an hero or just live life in such a way that it pleases you already.</br>  <br>It's funny, because clearly you don't actually believe anything you are saying. You say nothing has meaning, but you take up the cause of proliferating that philosophy. You act like there is no truth that you care about, but clearly you care whether you are part of the "herd". You even admit that you "see no meaning in being dead". The fact is, whether or not there is objective meaning, human beings seek meaning. That's the funny thing about nihilism. It only ever spreads through people who aren't actually nihilistic.</br>  <br>this</br>  <br>I mean, I always have enjoyed designing characters. There's just something really cool about creating a character and having it come to life. Call it a god complex, but I just feel really accomplished when stuff like that happens. It's why I was really into online role playing. Creating a character and giving them life is just really fulfilling to me. I'm just not sure on how I could really end up making a living off of it. Like, I know there us character design for videogames, and I could also become an author, or maybe help with making a screenplay or something along those lines, I'm just not really sure on how to get from where I am to the end.</br>  <br>This is more my jam.</br>  <br>maybe i should get my life together just to get a bitch like that. life aint pointless if u got fun times</br>  <br>All the time.</br>  I feel the same. Want to be an artist but then realized that its pretty much impossible to actually get anywhere unless your god tier.<br><br>Thinking about suicide soon tbh</br></br>  <br>1nqfp8+50rplf7wp0qxc@sharklasers.co<wbr>m<br>I could try to help you in a direction if you want to but I won't be another negative voice in your life.<br><br>You don't have to be god tier to get work,<br>Just better tha the people who are doing the jobs atm.<br>Windmaker on deviant art is not a expert artist but he get's a lot of work.</br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br>  <br>Hey anon, I want to do concept art but I live in the UK and I feel as though its impossible.<br><br>Is it?</br></br></br>  The only thing I know to be true and worthy is fighting and winning.<br>And that OP is faggot.</br>  <br>But being god tier comes with practice. Just throw some effort at it (Okay, throw A LOT of effort at it) and you'll be able to become god tier. Nor reason to give up on something you like. It's possible. If somone else can do it, you can too. The only things different between you and that god tier artist are a couple genes. Otherwise, you two are still human. Yeah, they might just click with art, and to you it might be difficult. But with work you can get there. True, maybe a lot more work and time than other people, but the fact that you can actually get there no matter what should outweigh the fact that you cant do it now or that it takes less time for others.</br>  <br>"welcome to the shitshow" thanks anon, made me kek</br>  <br>Yeah but things like concept art require you to be the best of the best and there is no guarantee (especially if you're self taught) that you will be good enough or get anywhere.<br><br>Doesn't help when you live in a shit country.</br></br></br>  <br>not at all man,<br><br>We can get in touch if you contact me through that email and we can see about getting you pm your journey to working in the industry..<br>I'll be there for you every step of the way if you turn out to be a bro!</br></br></br></br>  Just find a purpose and try to make it happen. Simple as that. That could be anything, dont let your dreams be dreams.  <br>I couldn't get anywhere at the moment, my work is fucking abysmal.</br>  <br><br>Actually country has nothing to do with it at all if you are self-taught.<br>I'm currently doing work for a Canadian Client but I live in Europe.<br>Hardwork can make up for a lack of talent,<br>But talent can never make up for a lack of hardwork.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck is purpose?<br>Why aren't you just enjoying shit? Have you ever watched a movie?</br></br>  <br>My work was compelte garbage when I started too.</br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>sure.. i just found a way out is all</br>  <br>Prostitutes, drugs, sex, crime and murder. What are you waiting for?</br>  <br>Better than my work.<br><br>Pic related, its shit. I am doing a illustration course so I will be landed with debt soon and kill myself eventually.<br><br>But thanks anon, I will keep the email and will let you know when I am good enough</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>there are two kinds of people in this world<br><br>douchebags and ironic douchebags</br></br></br>  <br>I'll let you in on a secret.<br>Nothing matters. Not you, not me, not anything. In a million years who will give a fuck? No one because we will all be dead.<br>Hope that helps!</br></br></br>    <br>I mean, what normal people like me and the most others -&gt; they work 7½ hours a day, then they come home (gf my opinion, some family) And then the day starts all over again the next day</br>  <br>it's a throwaway mail, send me a email on it now so we can stay in touch man.<br>I've been where you are now artistically and I could really help you get to the next level with a bit of advice.</br></br>  <br>Seems rather shifty to be honest though.<br><br>I'll bite I guess.</br></br></br>  <br>Congratulations so is everyone else's. Meaning/worth/purpose is a human word a human idea. There is no reason to be alive just as there is no reason to be dead. If your life is empty then fill it with what you want.</br>  if you have nothing to lose, you shouldnt fear the supposed dangers of psychedelic drugs.... either you will find out you have something to lose, or maybe do something that may change you..  <br>No No, I'm not shifty. Just a guy who has had a shit life but finally something is working out for once.</br>  <br>Yes, it's called "being alive". None of our lives matter in the long run. Still that's no reason to bitch. Man the fuck up, and make your own reasons.</br>  <br>I just came to your realization too. <br>Felt good</br></br>  <br><br>oh my god I can hear the individual gears in your brain working<br><br> pre con sieved </br></br></br></br>  <br>It ain't shit man. Well, it may be shit compared to some other art, but that's only because that art and this are different styles. This art style is actually really cool. And the fact you think is shit means your not a self centered fag.</br>  There is no real purpose as an individual, aside from consuming more and achieving new heights of consumption/hedonism. But you can subscribe to any number of causes which deal with the relationship between your species and its environment.  <br>You sound like me. Brushing off that attack so casually. The nihilism has sort of just worn me down and made me so tired. Conflict doesn't interest me. I feel too tired to be bothered. <br><br>But oh well, such is life. Off to beat my dick like it did something wrong then. Have a good one, not that it would matter though.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Kierkegaard is my homeboy<br><br>I'm not even a christian</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nobody lives forever, so just do the shit that you want to do and ride it out. Doesn't have to be a long life, but atleast try to make it enjoyable, because here's the thing: there is no god, there is no higher power watching or judging you. If you're that worried or depressed or whatever, just remember that when the end comes, it's JUST YOU, so make this life enjoyable for who matters most, YOURSELF.</br>  <br><br>I fucking would, I'm 38 now and I'm having a FUCKLOAD of fun. I travel the world, play music, teach, skydive, drive my old, battered Mercedes Benz, and generally have a fucking awesome time. My wife chooses chicks for us to bang together, occasionally we orgy, man I don't wanna die - I've only just figured all this shit out!<br><br>Also, for anyone who's struggling - "Those who restrain desire do so because theirs is small enough to be restrained". You are the only limit in your life, and you are the only things stopping all of your dreams from coming true. When you decide what you want, you will find a way to get it.<br><br>Good luck. You are the reality engineer, and what you say and think affects the universe every second of every day. So go and get some of whatever it is you want.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Don't listen to people telling you to make your own purpose. If there's no purpose in you, it would only be fantasy<br>I would just say don't jump to conclusions. Maybe there's more to reality than you think and there is something out there that can satisfy you if you try hard enough</br>  <br>I don't know anon<br>stop looking at porn and start enjoying the light of day</br></br>  <br>I'm experiencing it right now. You're probably just bored.</br>  <br>Dafuq you doing in this place? You need to be in a lecture somewhere inspiring young minds!!!</br>  Hey artist /b/ro, it's awesome to see you helping out another anon. I love that you're doing it, I love that you offered, and I wanted to tell you that you have just made my day.<br><br>Other artist bro, get on that shit and accept some help. You'll be able to pay it forward to someone else one day, but if you say no... well, 'no' shuts doors, but 'yes' opens them<br><br>'Yes' allows the universe to happen.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I see this advice all the time. I just don't understand why this is a solution. Why would I do this? For what purpose? If I had desired to do this then I would have without someone telling me to. Do I suddenly have a purpose to exist by just going off and fucking around in a different setting? <br><br>I think people don't usually understand that this type of thinking isn't necessarily brought on by circumstance. I've had a great life. I was raised upper middle class by two great parents, I'm a straight white male in a good college, I have a girlfriend that I care a lot about, I have a lot of friends, and I'm quite smart and can do very well academically if I apply myself even at all. There is just no end goal. I have no motivation to move forward. I have no desire to work 60 hours a week for a big company to get a big paycheck. I have no desire to get married or reproduce. I don't care for my hobbies much now. At best, it seems life is literally just 70-80 years of killing time while you wait to die. I don't see a purpose in all of this to persist besides happiness, but happiness is only a goal because you no longer ponder these questions. If happiness is the reason to exist and move forward then the meaning of life is literally just to find a way to avoid thinking about the meaning of life. <br><br>So that's why I think life is pretty gay.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I will be soon! I start work in 90 minutes, anon - I'm an ausfag.<br><br>Just about to jump in the shower, but this thread has made my fucking day already. I hope you all go and make something happen, tomorrow if you're not in Oz. Start with a shower and good music, then write a list of all the things you want. It might take a little while, but if you really want them, you can have the things on that list (keep it reasonable, no breaking the laws of physics and/or space-time).<br><br>I fkn love it when people's dreams come true, I want it to happen to you.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No problem man!<br>Keep Arting!</br></br>  <br> Garlic bread <br>Everytime</br></br>  <br>it's called being an adult</br>  <br><br>You don't need to do any of those things, you need to travel so you can see what else is possible. At the moment you are surrounded by your culture, and it's only a very small percentage of the world that lives like that. When we travel, we broaden our experience palette. This means we can create more varied realities, for example... go live with some hippies and you'll learn that you can exist off the grid, grow your own food, and have a whole lot more time to learn music, play with kids, hang out with hot hippie girls, study alternative architecture/ whatever.<br><br>Go live overseas and you learn that you can buy a house for $8000 in Jamaica, or live like a king for 6 months in Thailand or Vietnam.<br><br>You might prefer working on a dairy farm somewhere, which is hard work but could be, ultimately, exactly what you want to do. Finish your degree, and then take a year to explore the world - it will give you new ideas for what you might want your life to look like one day. The skills you learn in your degree might be very transferable, and just having one puts you in the top 4% of the world. Go and teach English in China, it'll blow your mind. Go to India for 6 months and live in an Ashram. Whatever, your life is only as dull as you make it, and right now you're shaping a pretty ordinary existence. Me, I want more.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Threads like this only seem to generate one kind of answer: Life is meaningless, so man the fuck up and start living your dreams.<br>I don't buy it, personally. Life is full of good things, like careers and relationships, but you're right to feel dissatisfied with the idea that this is all there is. Don't try to ignore this feeling; If you pay attention to it, it can be a compass that will point you towards something better. Don't lose hope. You are not alone in your struggles. You are loved.<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sehns<wbr>ucht</wbr></br></br>  I found this in my sister's bedroom when she went to work. I dont know what to do. I dont want her to be addicted to drugs, and i have suspected for a while she has been smoking marihuana cigarettes.<br><br>Should I report it to the police so she can get help to get off the drugs?</br></br>  <br>blaze that shit right in front of her. THEN RAPE HER. In the ass.</br>  Blaze it, faggot.  <br>1st of all. calling the cops? lol they are going to hang up in your face i hope.<br><br>Secondly this is a cigarette. no weed in this nasty shit.<br><br>ps: its would be WAY more angry if my little sister smoked cigarettes than weed.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>fuck off and mind your own business</br>   Doesn't want her to ruin her life by smoking <br> Wants to get her sent to jail </br>  shit nigga thats 1 whole marijuana?<br>heard thats lethal</br>  <br>Kill your parents, then kill yourself.</br>  <br><br>I dont want to rape her, but I think throwing it into the fireplace while she watches is a good idea.</br></br>  <br>put it in your spaghetti, faggot</br>  Nice spaghetti, FAGGOT  <br>And what will she learn from it? To hide her shit better. Doesn't solve the problem at all dingus</br>  <br>Being a broke stoner myself it would be a gift from the heavens if I found something like this in a siblings bedroom. Why were you sneaking around her room anyway you creep? I sometimes scavenge my brothers rooms and raid their weed stashes but you seem like a creepy ass guy</br>  <br>Copy pasta.</br>  <br>maybe she'll punch you right in your cock-hungry face</br>  <br>Say drugs make u crazy. <br>Then blaze that shit. <br>Then rape her. Violently :) really enjoy that shit<br>She wont go near drugs again for at least 15 years till she get prozac then kills herself and ur partents</br></br></br></br>  <br>lol really... spaghetti?</br>  <br>Well, I dont know how old she is, but, if she's a proper adult and she has her life under control, I dont see why having some fun is wrong. <br>Well, IF she has her life under control. Marijuana is not exactly addictive. Some nice steak when youre high is amazing.</br></br>  <br><br> eating noodles with a McDonald's napkin under the bowl <br><br>Nigga, you're the one addicted to marijuana you fucking stoner</br></br></br></br>  THE SPAGHETTI IS RIGHT THERE  <br>Fuck off with your pasta</br>  <br>You got this image from a thread yesterday retard</br>  <br>that same pick was OPs choice for perfect joint rolled thread about 3 days ago<br><br>you can't OC a rolled joint?<br><br>re-examine your life choices</br></br></br></br></br>  Tell her you want head or buttsecks or you are calling the 5-0  Gr8 b8 m8 r8 88/8 no h8!  <br><br>I'm sorry bro. Your sister is probably already dead</br></br>  <br>I went into her room, because I am concerned about her. Ever since I moved into her place 3 months ago I think I can smell marihuana smell sometimes. I think it would be sad if she starts harder drugs, so if I can help her stop at marihuana i think it would be the best.</br>  You're a fucking faggot, OP. Calling the cops on your own sister for weed. The police ought to throw you in jail for being a little bitch.  No don't report her to the cops. You'll only make her life worse.  <br>I live in colorado and i smoke for recreational use(i smoke occasionally for workout/good food). <br>I am nowhere near any other drugs. I never even considered doing other drugs.</br></br>  How can you judge her when you have no idea what you're talking about? You obviously have no experience with drugs and only know what you've been told. Smoke it, then decide.  <br>But what if she starts doing heroin? Then I'll have to live with the fact I could have helped her before.</br>  <br>Youre a troll. get the fuck out fag lol.<br>Fkin marijuana leading to heroin.</br></br>  <br>I have a question for Colorado people... Even though the drug is legal for recreational use, do employers still administer a pre-employment drug test and won't hire you if you test positive for marijuana?</br>  catch a fyah, faggit<br> inb4 educate yourself </br>  <br>Way to steal a picture faggot</br>  <br>Marijuana<br><br>Marihuana is how faggots spell it.</br></br></br>    <br>Yeah some do. Especially around law.</br>  <br>looks like it's been reused you can get aids that way better call the dr phils</br>  <br><br>Carry on, Hunter!</br></br>  <br>Report her when she starts doing heroin then</br>  <br>If you want to help her from doing heroine, let her smoke pot. If you take away the weed, she'll have no money and buy heroine because it is cheaper. She also won't have to worry about you finding it because:<br>1. It doesn't smell.<br>2. She won't have any in her room because she'd do it all 5 minutes after sucking dick for it.</br></br></br>  <br>Congratz op, you have received the Social justice white knight seal of fagottness, you just have to be an hero to receive it</br>  <br>Made me lol <br><br><br>Firstly that pic looks like it is taken from Google, secondly you are a fag if you think weed is going to harm your sister</br></br></br></br>  <br>Carry on, hunter</br>  <br>Carry on, Hunter.</br>  <br>death to the partents!</br>  mom's spaghetti  Observations:<br>1. OP is eating spaghetti with plate on mouse pad<br>2. Napkin is McDonald's napkin <br>3. Cannot identify book located at the end of middle finger but looks notes decorative outer markings<br>4. Object on book resembles computer mouse<br>5. Age lines on hands resemble an age less than 30</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kek'd</br>  <br>Yeah man. Weed is kinda pricey with recreational places but they ARE legal and theyre pretty good. <br>I get good workout in when high and food tastes much better. I had bison sirloin steak yesterday and it was fkin great.<br><br>The law requires you to not to be high at work or on the wheels but again, most places are pretty flexible with the marijuana law unless its around law.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>someone posts that shitty joint on here every day with a different story</br></br>  Call the police NOW she is in grave danger first is marijuana then heroin  <br>I heard excessive pot use makes the uterus implode. Worst thing is, it just feels like period cramps so she won't even notice anything is wrong until gynecologist discovers it. By then she won't be able to have babies and it will be all your fault.</br>  <br>ur right /b/ro marijuana is a gateway drug soon she will be injecting heroine and huffing crack and aerosol cannisters</br>  <br>Carry on, Hunter!</br>  It's just pot, faggot. Meth, heroin or crack would have been an issue.  <br>I hope she does this</br>  <br>Carry on, Hunter</br>  <br>Just smoke that shit and keep eating your spaghetti. <br> marihuana <br>fucking kek</br></br></br>  <br>Carry on, hunter.</br>  Yes, definitely call the cops, its the best way to save your sister from being... being.... wait, the worst thing about it is... no, just forget it, just call the cops, thei're the best  <br>Carry on, Hunter</br>  <br>That's what i thought.<br><br>Who weould be the best people to contact?
