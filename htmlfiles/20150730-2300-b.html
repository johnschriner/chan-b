If you had ever been objectified in the fashion that most women are exposed to daily, then you would not be making pointless jokes in an effort to make white, cis-male, privelaged assholes laugh. What do you know about anything? Where do you get off? "Omg, I see this WOMAN clearly being objectified by a MALE savage and all I can think about is making jokes?" What are you thinking? How is this acceptable? We, as a culture, need to check in and evaluate our beliefs if a MAN, who is virtually incapble of caring for anyone other than HIMself, feels the need to objectify a WOMAN by displaying privelage in a public setting. Yes I am triggered, and no, I don't think you care.</br></br>  Please 4 fuck  Roll  roll  Roll  r√∂ll  <br><br>pls laci</br></br>  r0ll  Rollin  K mate  <br>God damn that's unfortunate</br>  This is oppressing me  4 please  <br>No u</br>  124 get  SUP  God damn  ralling  Roll  K there goes  <br>Rooool</br>  who is 8?

If their family doesn't know what's going on, they'll find out pretty soon. <br>Maybe tomorrow if we're lucky.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>They're in fucking Alabama, what do you expect?

Any news of Lani  <br>/b/ did something fantastic.<br>and it's fucking hilarious.<br><br>whose got the updated collage? I have this one right here</br></br></br></br>  <br>Will try and find out what's going on. They're most likely asleep as it's around 4am over there.</br>    <br>Brad vision is how she graduated...</br>  <br>this ones my favourite</br>  I honestly home Brad kills himself. That would be fucking hilarious.  <br>she looks naked in that picture 10/10</br>  <br>if dubs, brad is rip.</br>  <br>We all hope he an heros. If he doesn't, he'll probably get shanked in prison or something.</br>  <br>rolling for dubs<br>/b/rad is kill</br></br>  <br>fuck i meant this one<br/></br>  I would masturbate to a picture of his corpse suspended in the air by a rope  <br><br><br>haha miles ahead of me. now if we could combine brad vision, and replace that balloon with giant testicles we might have a masterpiece.</br></br></br>  brad is in severe pain, he is a wanted felon  <br>You must be retarded His dad, her mom, students , twitter school facebook the town is small Brad won't be going to work anytime soon and the local paper and news are reporting a coach/ teacher form the only high school in town is suspended for sexual with student, brads wife will likly be moving out he will probably need to ask relatives and friends for money to get attorneys for the divorce and sex defence being 24 and just out of college on a teachers pay Brad is fucked</br>  <br>Brad's life is kill<br>#Shaveballs</br></br>  We should make a petition for Brad to kill himself...we'll all be signing it as anon of course but still...  I heard he is on the run from the police  I have not been on 4chan for like a month. <br>Who is brad?</br>  <br>Leave new fag</br>  <br>Sure. Someone find a petition to start it at.</br>  <br>you realize her 18th birthday was September 2014, he only violated school policies.<br><br>brad is fine, he'll tell his wife, some kids are playing on the computer. <br><br>lani is who i feel sorry for. she's just going into college, i assume, and there's all this naked photos, she might an hero, and i would honestly feel bad, she's too hot for that. maybe we should invite her for an ama or whatever you guys do on here.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>See<br/></br>  <br>where did u hear that?</br>  <br>I don't feel bad for /b/rad nor Lani. I only feel bad for his wife and daughter.</br>  <br>check 'em bait</br>  Brad is just relieved that no one found out about his secret husband.  <br>no, it's against the law to engage in sexual conduct with a student who is under 19 in Bama. it's a felony.</br>  <br>I think one of the student's said he was hiding. I'll go find the tweet in a second.</br>  <br>Fuck you shaven balls</br>    <br>I doubt she'll an hero.</br>  <br>haha he's going to lose his career over this. no way he's getting another teaching job. those pics are career death for him.</br>  <br>wwwwiiiicked</br>  What can we do to worsen the situation?  it was on the news here    <br>What's the news called? This could go national. There was an article about it in washington too.</br>  <br>looooool wife and daughter, of course. like you actually feel? come on... just tell me honestly you don't really give a shit, oh boohoo his wife and kids collateral damage. <br><br>Look everyone has jesus, so it'll be fine.<br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/KB0b5VYc2qI?t=14s  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> New fag because he's not on 4fags everyday... Especially /b/ <br>enjoy your trap threads</br></br>  <br>lol there is a sheriff's investigation and the superintendent has place him on leave for the investigation.<br>you act like his wife is just looking up from watching tv and asking him "what's going on?"<br>"Nothing" <br>"oh ok"<br>and that's it.</br></br></br></br></br>  Saw a tweet from one of Lani's friends saying to stop making fun of it because she was already thinking of killing herself over it. Can't find it now, might be blocked for #ShaveBalls, but it was Holly something I think.  this has the potential to be national news yes  <br>Alright, you see right through me. I actually don't give a shit</br>  <br>i don't think he has a kid. no pics or anything have surfaced showing them with kids. lani doesnt mention his kid at all.</br>  <br>I'll check out the student's twitters.</br>  I'd literally cum myself if she an hero'd  <br>Anyway, my point is a Lani an hero isn't off the table. Then we can look forward to a few years of "too soon" and "the day /b/ went too far" and get to explain our exploits to the even newer cancer newfags.</br>    So post more Lani nudes  <br>I believe he does? Don't know where I saw it but there was a picture of his wife and a child right by her. It was an instagram profile picture I think.</br>  <br>Screencap in here if you find it. She also bragged that she defended Lani to someone that responded by blocking her. That one was more recent I think. Appreciated.</br>  /b didn't actually do anything other than distribute public information to some douche's wife.  <br>Haven't seen hard evidence, but people say he does. Super fuck Jesus freak in his 30s has gotta have at least one.</br>  <br>lol /b/tards were up all night last night emailing different staff and the superintendent the nudes and vacation pics</br>  <br>Nice TRY FBI<br>I herd reddit has all the Lani nudes, you should go to that sooper cool website sir.</br></br>  <br>he's 28. I haven't seen any evidence at all of a kid.<br>seen a number of pics with him and wife, none with a kid in the middle or holding a kid.</br></br>  whats the moms name again? any updates from the family other than her asking for prayers?  <br>Kek<br> too soon </br></br>  <br>Your kek is contagious</br>  <br><br>You're right. No one's really bringing up "his child" or anything. Not even the students. <br>It'd be funny if his wife was currently pregnant though.</br></br></br>  some random lani videos here<br><br>https://www.bottlr.co/user/94472960<wbr>5984624640</wbr></br></br>  <br>The fucking school website said... <br> He had a kid <br> the fucking school website <br> school website <br><br>They took it down - his teacher profile so hopfully someone capped that shit.. Same one that gave his dogs name, Think it was his coach one.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I aint clicking that shit nigga</br>  <br>Thank you anon. Will try and find a screencap. People from previous threads had most of the information.</br>  <br>Yeah I've definitely seen the screencap in a previous thread</br>  <br>whatever it's just some vine site</br>  <br>Missed this before. The school fucking knew?!? A year ago!?!? Fuck, they are boned if that gets out.</br>  <br>Here it only mentions he lives with his wife and dog.</br>  <br>people def capped his bio. never saw shit about a kid. you'd think he'd be holding his kid in pics with his wife at some point.</br>  <br>no kid</br>  lol at this guy<br><br>http://t11baf.tumblr.com/<br>https://twitter.com/t11baf/status/6<wbr>23885309089071108<br>https://twitter.com/t11baf/status/5<wbr>15598576257605632</wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>I'm searching for a screencap of the bio but unable to find one. People from previous threads most likely have the screencaps.</br>  <br>pic from his dad's facebook.<br>uploaded july 28th. wife next to brad, none holding their kid.</br></br>  <br>no kid</br>  <br>Student's suspected him. It's possible that some of them told the authorities but no one did anything due to lack of proof</br>  <br>How do I play the videos on mobile anon? They won't open on my phone</br>  <br>We need a picture of the bio or something. I now highly doubt he had a child.</br>  <br> inb4 your phone gets hacked </br>  <br><br>So maybe brad is not that fucked... yet?</br></br>  <br>Date at the back could prove that things were happening for a while? April 2014. She turned 18 in September or something.</br>  <br>just get the vine app and look for profile Hannah Sharriee I never use this vine shit, and that's just what came up when I searched.<br><br><br>dumb cunt</br></br></br></br>  wheres the mega doe  <br>nah he's fucked. def lost his job, this bitch doesn't know anything. he had an inappropriate relationship with her while she was still in school. goood luck defending that to the cops.<br>she just graduated in may, it's not like this happened a long time ago.</br></br>  <br>yea i think birthday is sept 28th, that one tweet is sept 24th talking about them, pretty sure he was on it before 18, that's the point right? his whole jesus swag actually makes me sick.</br>  <br>https://mega.nz/#!YUxAiZIA!8_IzjJF0<wbr>vc3U6zCTn-AD_GdoUIMKIDuieeNeisUPuCk<wbr><br>I believe it was this?<br>Also<br>http://imgur.com/a/nIMJJ</br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>doesn't matter if before 18 because it's a felony for him to have a relationship with a student under 19.</br>  <br>Same here. He's a fucking retard.<br>Plus people from previous threads said it's illegal for the teacher to fuck around with the student if she's under 19.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, but the scrncapped texts in the mega file suggest they were waiting for something<br><br>Could be that he railed her legally?</br></br></br>  <br> Jesus gets the pussy for brads shaved balls </br>  <br>it's very illegal for teachers to be with students. and she's only been a non-student for 2 months now.</br>  <br>Ehh, I believe in the very beginning it was illegal but then she got her diploma and what not and they ended it because she was guilty.</br>  I saw something on twitter yesterday about his wife being pregnant with his child  <br>Going to check out the pics they took together and find more clues.</br>  <br>the question is how does he get more fucked, how is this not on cnn or some shit?</br>  <br>Kek now that's fucked up. That child is gonna have daddy issues or something.</br>  <br>the pics show they had more than one vacation. all looking like they were before graduation, but maybe not. <br>it doesnt look good for him. remember there is now an official sheriff's investigation, so he;s going to have to come up with some answers.</br></br>   if you shave them.....they will cum   <br>Some guy from yesterdays thread kept saying it was on CNN. I believe it was a troll though.</br>  <br> amen </br>  <br>cuz he hasn't been charged yet. there's prob several stories equivalent to this in the other 49 states. but there arent enough juicy details for national news to care.</br>  <br>It was a troll</br>  You fucking plebs, thank you.<br>Lani and I ran off to Mexico together this afternoon. We just landed and got into our hotel room. We will be making another album, but this time we are keeping our shit private. <br><br>Anyways I wanted to thank you guys for pushing me into the best decision of my life. I get to fuck a hot ass blonde girl, while you keyboard cowboys sit behind your computers and accumulate fat and ultra-virgin-status. <br><br>Brad</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>topkek</br>  <br>Bait is real</br>  <br>Lurk more</br>    <br>timestamp !</br>  Who's house is this? I can't identify the family photos.  <br>did anybody download the video that had lani in it?</br>  <br>Is it in the mega link?</br>  <br>Yeah, I remember that TruthTenter. I had to block her. She was all up in my shit the first day of #ShaveBalls</br>  <br>talking about the youtube video?</br>  if they have nothing to hide why have they shut their twitter accounts?  <br>Def not looking good. What i meant in the previous post was that it seems he is just fucked, not fucked and skinned.</br>  <br> http://t11baf.tumblr.com/ <br>Fucking tumblr man.</br></br>  <br>People will also know when he cut his hair.</br>  <br>Holy shit? Was he thinking of divorcing his wife or something?</br>  <br>what link?</br>  <br>Confirmed.</br>  <br>See<br/></br>  <br>I know in my area, Tampa, some nigger just killed a tranny. So our plates full. Nobody here knows about #ShavedBalls.</br>  haha alabama passed a law specifically for this kind of case. Making it illegal no matter if she consented or was of age no matter what as long as she was a student.  <br>never gotten a ban faggot?</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=99g<wbr>clFZGQv4&amp;index=1&amp;list=LLNNscDsJEKi1<wbr>iQkqEqsrk2A</wbr></wbr>  [ ]<br>Are you talking about the video where Lani cried about the mustard story?<br>They made the video private.</br></br></br>    <br> hot ass girl <br><br>Sure, asshole. She'll still look good at 34. Fucking redneck face.</br></br></br>  <br>There's proof in the text messages that she was a student when this shit was happening. They were talking about feeling each other up in class or something.<br>Plus, the student's suspected something was up with both of them too. <br><br>RIP /b/rad</br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks for sharing anon</br>    <br>Guess he did<br>..and then changed his mind</br></br>  <br>My nigga Rocky said something about it wasn't the first time she sent out nakeds.</br>  <br>No he is fucked. Had a teacher fuck student and 2 years after graduation he got the hammer. He is currently a sex offender for it.</br>  <br>Holy shit.</br>  <br>they'll be able to subpoena all that shit. the cops won't have to go on the mega files. <br>he's fucking hosed bad.<br>his computer and phone will both prob be confiscated and searched like hell.<br>remember that they're not waiting for the family to press charges, he's knee deep in it already</br></br></br></br>  <br>Brad probably already deleted the text messages but I'm sure they'll find a way to find them again.</br>  <br>Yeah, i was hoping someone had downloaded and can reupload it to youtube.</br>    <br>Old collage. There's an updated one but I don't have it.</br>  <br>Can't they subpoena the phone company? Not sure how that works.</br>    <br>Pictures started in April 2014.</br>  <br>They prolly will.</br>  <br>He's used to niggers, he won't have a really rough time in jail.</br>  <br>http://money.cnn.com/2013/05/22/tec<wbr>hnology/mobile/smartphone-forensics<wbr>/<br>doesn't look like it's a done deal if he deleted the texts.</br></wbr></wbr></br>    <br>The only thing I don't get is the "shave balls" part. Someone cares to explain?</br>  <br>Get the mega</br>    <br>There's a newer one apparently. It had a picture of the article and superintendent</br>    <br>I'm not losing 400mb of space for those retards man.</br>      <br>Thank you, based anon</br>    <br>Fair enough :)<br><br>At least the whole story prompted me to clean my phone etc...</br></br></br>  Is it just me or did Brad look so much better with long hair and the beard. Without it he looks like a fat pedophile.  <br>HAH and this was posted 53 weeks ago. meaning it was posted at least during the summer after her junior year was completed. so they had to have had time to do all those matching outfits during her junior year. <br>he was at least in the relationship during her junior year methinks.</br></br>  <br>Technically everything ever saved on your laptop/phone never truly get deleted. People can always recover files/text messages/everything.<br> inb4 paranoid </br></br>  <br>I agree. He looks uglier without the beard.</br>  <br>Omg, I thought it was a joke. Is it his actual to-do list?

If yes, why did you like it? If you don't, why wouldn't you?  i had sex with a chick on her period<br>we did it on top of a towel so there wasn't a mess and I was wearing a condom.<br><br>I took my dick out and it looked like the texas chainsaw massacre but overrall it wasn't too bad. Periods make a chick's vagoo all sensitive and shit so she had a proper good time</br></br></br>  <br>I have by accident, she didn't know she started, it's a pretty strange consistency, wouldn't recommend,</br>  I've done it a few times, with and without a condom<br>Feels the same, aside from the coppery smell and somewhat sticky feel of the blood afterwards.</br>  Been there, done that, don't give a fuck.  only stuck it in once w/out a condom, multiple times with. I never cared that much.<br> eating her out <br>lolno</br></br>  <br>it is normal thing to me to have sex during her period. Im not afraid to get messy. And advantages are great as her period ends faster, during sex lots of endorfine is released so it milds her cramps. She will be grateful later. and the fact that she is basically infertile during those days lets you do the business without condoms</br>  <br>I've done it. Revolting.</br>  I've got my red wings. Not that much fun. Had to wash my face after. She didn't know she had started her period. I didn't know till she was about to cum. Couldn't just stop, mostly because her hand was forcing my head down.<br><br>Let me tell you something about women in their 30s. They're crazy in bed. They know what they like, and literally will let you do anything to them.<br><br>A 20 year old girl can be shy in bed, "no I'm on my period grossss" or "no not in the butt"..... 30 year olds, never.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is possible to conceive during period. Not common, but possible.</br>  <br>Just invite her to take shover, clean her up, the blood does not goes out all the time, but rather in periods, so you can lick her pussi after shover and then fuck her. <br><br>I think the hardest part is to convince woman to have sex during her period, as she is insecure about that and thinks its gross.</br></br></br>  <br>Blood makes great lube!!</br>  <br>thats is why I want to find a good looking milf and date her</br>  <br>/bro/ I'm telling you, these hot tiny tight little girls posted all over /b/ are definitely boner inducing, but I'm guessing only about 1 out of every 25 of them will let you tit fuck her, then ass fuck her, then blow your load in her face.<br><br>3 out of every five 30 year olds will let you do that on a regular basis.</br></br></br>  <br>This guy know's where it's at they don't say dirty at 30 for nothing</br>  <br>and that I have milf/mature/cougar fetish even makes this better.</br>  <br>Another thing.... not only do they let you do anything, they literally want sex all the time. Way more than men in their 30s.<br><br>My wife is now 32, and I can't keep up with her. She wants it every day. Literally any second of any day I can have a blwojob. Anytime. Doesn't matter when or where.</br></br></br>  Having sex with a girl on her period can be really good, but if you want to do this, first get some knowledge about the chick vagina.In period, it's get 100% easier to have a sexual disease.<br>Second:prepare yourself, you'll see a lot of blood, and if you don't want to se your penis getting smaller during sex just because a bunch of blood, you should do some mental work before getting your penis inside a blood river.(repeat:"I love blood, please blood I want to get my pepe inside your blood, lord blood")<br>Third:if you know well the girl and she see no problem trying this, go and do it.it's a good opportunity to cum inside without the baby problem.</br></br>  <br>Yes I heard those stories. In my last relantionship I had years younger girl, and I wanted to have sex 2-3 times a day - when I wake up, midday and before bed. But for her it was like once in a 4-5 days and very very short. and boring as well, only one position and asked to finish as soon as possible. Fuck that</br>  <br> yes <br> red velvet creampie </br></br>  ITT we write a bit of code and anons gues what language/program it is used in<br><br>var X : int = 10;<br><br>while (X&lt;=0)<br>{<br>transform.translate("Vertical") * Time.deltaTime;<br>}<br><br>//pic unrelated</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  On !:TEXT:*:# {<br> If ($nick == #NICKNAME) <br> .msg $chan Hello, $nick<br> } <br>}</br></br></br></br>  <br>now there is javafag shit unlike the other shit you dipholes thought to be java</br>  <br>php?</br>  So tell me /b/, why the fuck are you so upset over tumblr SJW's and ultra-feminist catladies?<br>I understand that your tolerance and bitchiness-threshold is very low, and anytime you read an opinion which you find ridiculous you get upset (i.e. trolled). But every single time you actually react to this stupid shit (along the lines of "HURR DURR STUPID FEMINISTS"), you're playing into their game and become exactly as primitive and stupid.<br>Why not let them have their "STOMP THE PATRIARCHY" fun? It's not like this is going to change anytime soon, if ever.</br></br>  shut the fuck up dumbass  Okay literally nobody asked  <br>the truth hurts mang?</br>  <br> It's not like this is going to change anytime soon, if ever. <br><br>And the weakly-willed sub-males will enslave themselves as they are already doing, leading the rest of us to shit (implying we are not already in it)<br><br> replies to bait <br> replies to a feminazi <br><br>pick a reason to kill me</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  If woman are so fucking equal than why in America do they not have to sign up for the draft. A woman will never be equal to a Man plain and simple not that Men are better than woman there is just more required of a Man in todays society.  stop blabbering and check these dubs  Men and women are, in general, mentally and physically different.<br><br> mfw this is true regardless of how much butthurt it causes, and regardless of how many people deny it </br></br>  <br>check'd</br>  <br>hm... nice...</br>  <br><br>the dubs dont lie</br></br>  <br>Have you ever rolled quarters across the middle of the cafeteria when the special kids are eating? Its funny because they pretty much riot to grab the quarter, Then afterwards you kinda feel bad and question your worth as a human being because they're retarded and cant help it. With feminists its the same thing, but theyre not retarded. So instead of questioning your self worth, you kinda get mad at how mind numbingly stupid perfectly normal well off people can be.</br>  Because they don't just have their fun, but brainwash women into believing in their psycho world, who then vote for Dems or whoever is further left, and those Dems then enact policy that affect men, like forcing all universities to use a 50.01% standard of evidence for rape even if they wanted to use a higher or criminal standard of evidence.<br><br>That's literally why. If they just sat in their chambers I wouldn't give a fuck.</br></br>  <br>where the FUCK are all these threads and posts? can someone link?<br>never once in my years of either 4chawnch or dumblr have i seen a single raging feminist post<br>i am genuinely curious</br></br></br>  <br>goddamn</br>  <br>So that's your argument? It all comes down to "it's bad because it puts rapists in jail instead of allowing them to just deny the whole damn thing under the support of a mostly male-driven justice system"?<br>Damn bro...</br></br>  <br>I like to think of us more like dogs. We don't seem to care what we stick it in.</br>  <br>i get that it's stupid, but if someone gets trolled by stupidity, then i got bad news for them...<br>there's way... WAY more than just tumblr feminazis...<br>and hence the question: why allow yourself to be trolled by feminazis when none of what they say actually fucking matters? (i'm not actually directing the question to you, personally, but rather the butthurt average /b/tard)</br></br></br>  <br> why the fuck are you so upset over tumblr SJW's and ultra-feminist catladies? <br>They directly affect what I like and are purposely invading my space.<br> you're playing into their game and become exactly as primitive and stupid. <br>Wrong. They don't have the metal capacity to make games. :^)<br>Also they are more likely to get flustered from this and become even more extreme in their thinking which causes them to become less legitimate to rational thinkers and more legitimate to irrational thinkers.<br> Why not let them have their "STOMP THE PATRIARCHY" fun?  <br>It's a cancerous idea that needs to be stopped.<br>You think problems solve themselves. That's okay for you to think like that. You probably don't take care of a lot of things.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>oohhh shit nigga'</br></br></br>  <br> So tell me /b/, why the fuck are you so upset over tumblr SJW's and ultra-feminist catladies? <br><br>Because i'm actually for social progress and these idiots managed to latch onto some social buzz issues and are using it to promote their insane regressive authoritarian agenda<br><br> Why not let them have their "STOMP THE PATRIARCHY <br><br>Because of their obsession with intersectional theory, that's precisely why you can't leave them be</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  this is not new, idiots.<br><br>cunt's predate any SJW or muh feminisms or trollin or butthurt or any other faggot shit you assholes parrot around the internet.<br><br>it's just cunts. you start a thread to discuss cunts.<br><br>op. fuck. you.<br><br>/thread<br><br>im out of this bullshit</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>See answer here:<br><br><br><br>They leak out into the real world and literally make the laws, crazily.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> They directly affect what I like and are purposely invading my space. <br>what the fuck are you talking about? what space? fucking tumblr?<br> Wrong. They don't have the metal capacity to make games. :^) <br>you understand that "games" in this case isn't literal?<br> and become even more extreme <br>so... they'll create A SECOND BLOG? god help us...<br> It's a cancerous idea that needs to be stopped. <br>do you actually believe shit like "cancerous idea"? first of all, the expression doesn't even make sense, although I understand that you're just trying to emphasize a point. but "must be stopped"? nigga world hunger MUST BE STOPPED. fucking CANCER must be stopped. a nuclear holocaust MUST BE STOPPED. not fucking tumblr feminists.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Because i'm actually for social progress  <br>If you're for social progress, then ignore them. Taking their shit seriously is the only thing that gives it any legitimacy whatsoever.<br> Because of their obsession with intersectional theory, that's precisely why you can't leave them be <br>That's a moot point, since as OP said, the patriarchal nature of society is not going to change any time soon, if ever, regardless of what tumblr sjw's want to achieve. This is a fact.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Op. Some people can form cogent arguments.<br><br>This is /b/ we can only scream and fap to socially unacceptable porn. Somebody has to do it. Let reddit debate. I kinda like the screaming. Its less pretentious, even if we are being trolled.</br></br></br>   expects some good jokes about SJW nonsense <br> sees... this  <br><br>Goddamn, dudes</br></br></br>  this is what hitler was trying to prevent    <br>This and Jews, mostly</br>  <br>Because their shit actually affects the law.</br>  <br><br>OP here, that's a really fucking accurate description of /b/. My questions are answered.</br></br>  <br>How? How has the law been affected?</br>  <br>Lets see, women's rights group managed to get paternity tests to be illegal in France.<br><br>In California, if a woman rapes an underage male and she ends up pregnant as a result, the rape victim has to pay child support regardless of his age.<br><br>Prison sentences for women are getting lower and lower. In fact, female pedophiles don't get that much jail time, while male pedophiles get plenty of years in prison.<br><br>And in Canada there's a guy that's in court now for disagreeing with feminism. He's possibly going to end up in jail.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>      <br> If you're for social progress, then ignore them. Taking their shit seriously is the only thing that gives it any legitimacy whatsoever. <br><br>Can't because their campaigns paint anyone that doesn't spout their exact social views as [insert 'ist]<br><br>I tried having a discussion recently about the boston riots about how i didnt want to unanimously support every rioter because i didn't want to support black nationalist or personally believed in wanton destruction. So i was going to lean my support towards the peaceful protestors and help support their voice.<br><br>I was attacked like I was some terrible racist.<br><br>I cant ignore them, because they throw around the racist and sexist term for everything. Socially whenever those are thrown around people begin to be wary of those who were the targets of such labels<br><br> That's a moot point, since as OP said, the patriarchal nature of society is not going to change any time soon, if ever, regardless of what tumblr sjw's want to achieve. This is a fact. <br><br>It's not a moot point, learn about inter-sectional theory. The whole point of it is to inject identity politics into every faucet of life. To the point if you wanted to be a chef they'd demand you micro analyze the historical and current plight and how YOU cooking your dish impacts cultural relations with said ethnic group your dish is based from.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> Lets see, women's rights group managed to get paternity tests to be illegal in France. <br>No source. Don't believe.<br> In California, if a woman rapes an underage male and she ends up pregnant as a result, the rape victim has to pay child support regardless of his age. <br>Conservatives could argue the same. (i.e. hurr-durr no abortion, pay child support!)<br> Prison sentences for women are getting lower and lower. In fact, female pedophiles don't get that much jail time, while male pedophiles get plenty of years in prison. <br>No source. Don't believe. Show statistics.<br> And in Canada there's a guy that's in court now for disagreeing with feminism. He's possibly going to end up in jail. <br>"In Canada there's a guy"? It's complete retards like you with absolutely fuck-all arguments that make opponents of ultra-feminism seem like complete goddamn idiots. "In Canada there's a guy"... fuck me man, PLEASE never use this again as a valid argument.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>*salutes*<br>You got my last two coherent posts of the

That its ok to let the requirement to PROVE someone guilty slide if it suits you?<br>Damn bro...</br></br>  ITT: men complaining that there are dudes who are legitimately victims of domestic abuse but noone gives them a tissue to whipe away their tears.<br>Hey, if you're a dude and get "domestically abused" by your woman then you are a fucking disgrace and shouldn't even consider yourself a MAN.</br>  <br>http://www.nydailynews.com/news/nat<wbr>ional/new-york-woman-lied-dad-rapin<wbr>g-prosecutors-stand-conviction-arti<wbr>cle-1.1550095<br>http://www.chinasmack.com/2012/pict<wbr>ures/3-men-in-wuhan-crawl-in-leashe<wbr>s-to-promote-womens-equality.html<br>http://sf-criminaldefense.com/wp-co<wbr>ntent/uploads/2013/03/KaninFalseRap<wbr>eAllegations.pdf<br>http://swedenreport.org/2015/02/09/<wbr>sweden-to-gender-adjust-history-boo<wbr>ks/<br>http://www.mommyish.com/2014/06/07/<wbr>child-rapist-mom-gets-light-sentenc<wbr>e/<br><br> PLEASE never use this again as a valid argument <br><br>Look up Gregory Alan Elliot, Stephanie Guthrie and Heather Reilly if you don't believe me.<br><br>Also </br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></wbr></wbr></br></wbr></wbr></br></wbr></wbr></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Just like women who get abused by men should grow the fuck up, right?</br>    <br>shameless repost</br>  <br>Nope, that wasn't EVEN implied.</br>          <br>Really? Dudes complaining about women grabbing their junk? That's a goddamn dead-end of evolution right there.</br>                  <br> <br>Love how that other anon stop posting after you show source</br></br>  damn that samefag posting all this feminism junk must have burning butthurt...  <br> nigga world hunger MUST BE STOPPED. fucking CANCER must be stopped. a nuclear holocaust MUST BE STOPPED <br><br>Let the poor and dirty die from hunger. <br>Let the inferior genes die from cancer<br>Let the tinfoil hats rave their insanity<br><br>But you niggers need to BURN</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>If it bothers you so much, then go back to Tumblr. Problem solved.<br><br><br>I didn't mind him asking me for sources, but his arrogance reeked of Tumblr.</br></br></br></br>      <br>I'm not op, I'm completely anti-feminist but if that's your reasoning for hating feminism fuck off</br>    <br>fuck no, that's the whole point, which seems to have just whooshed above your head like a goddamn F-16. i don't give a fuck about tumblr and especially the feminazis contained therein, and I was just curious to see why in the world morons like yourself give so much of a fuck about stupid people saying stupid shit that will never affect your life in any way whatsoever.<br>and if you think it will, then you get your tinfoil hat right back on because the likeliness of an alien invasion is higher.</br></br>  <br>Because they affect the law. And stop acting like it's only people on 4chan that hate feminism. There's plenty of people outside of this website that don't support feminism.</br>  <br>What is this bullshit?</br>    <br>It doesn't affect jack shit unless YOU yourself aren't some pathetic dumbass with 2 braincells that goes around putting his dick in women who have no self-control whatsoever, regret every fucking thing they do and immediately blame men for all of their own shortcomings.</br>    <br>It DOES affect the law, and it's not just in sexual things that feminism causes trouble.</br>              <br>So women are pigs aswell<br><br>yay</br></br></br>  <br>And I completely fucking agree with that picture. If your woman beats you in the middle of the fucking street and you cower like a pussy little bitch then I will laugh AND point fingers at you because that shit is hilarious. And if you think "it's not funny because it's serious" then you need to get rid of your balls because a MAN would NOT tolerate shit like that and would get up off his ass, leave that bitch the second she goes psycho and go fuck 500 other women who want his shit.</br>  <br>I do believe that if a man gets hit by a woman, he should have the right to hit her back. Unfortunately people have deluded themselves into thinking it's NEVER alright to hit a woman.</br>  <br>This is a troll. Do not feed the troll.</br>    <br> If you're for social progress, then ignore them. Taking their shit seriously is the only thing that gives it any legitimacy whatsoever. <br><br>This is false, as I pointed out here: </br></br></br>  <br>I think both are wrong, because physical violence is no answer to anything, but usually a last-resort of a simple-minded ape whose mental capacity has been maxed. But if a woman beats a dude in the middle of the damn street and he cowers like a pussy instead of just upping and leaving her psycho ass, that's comedy.</br>  <br>Reminds me of this one vid of a teacher that was getting arrested for abusing her students. The cop was arresting her and she started throwing a bitchfit and slapped him. Once he slapped her back, which wasn't even that hard, she cried as if she had gotten punched in the face.</br>  <br> How? How has the law been affected? <br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campu<wbr>s_sexual_assault#Obama_administrati<wbr>on_efforts<br><br>In 2011, the United States Department of Education sent a letter, known as the "Dear Colleague" letter, to the presidents of all colleges and universities in the United States stating that Title IX requires schools to investigate and adjudicate cases of sexual assault on campus.[64] The letter also states that schools must adjudicate these cases using a "preponderance of the evidence" standard, meaning that the accused will be responsible if it is determined that there is at least a 50.1% chance that the assault occurred. The letter expressly forbade the use of the stricter "clear and convincing evidence" standard used at some schools previously.</br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br>      <br>Right, and that's a case where she was wrong, should never have become a teacher in the first place, and assaulted a police officer in front of witnesses. I would highly doubt that she would have gotten away with that (most people don't).<br>And as for your picture: it's called "circumcision" which is a religious practice, which as most religious practices, come from men.</br></br>  <br>Hey...hey, did you see these?<br><br><br><br><br>Source cited. Your rebuttal?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It happened in Romania, so I'm assuming their laws are more strict.<br>As for the picture, I posted it because of where the foreskin is ending up, which in all honesty it's rather disturbing.</br></br>  <br>And also, just remembered something. Why is that male circumcision is a-ok, but female circumcision isn't? As in, the one in which they remove the clitoral hood, not the kind practice in Africa and the middle east.</br>  <br>I think the least disturbing thing about that picture is where the piece of dead skin ends up, while the most disturbing is how a male-invented practice revolves around cutting off a piece of a newborn boy's penis. <br>And the Dave Chappelle skit? Absolutely brilliant, and agreed 100%. Slutty girls gonna slut.</br></br>      <br>For one thing, the aim of male circumcision is not to disable pleasure gained from sex.<br>Second, there is, to my knowledge, no medically performed female circumcision (quite possibly for the above reason), and as such most is done illegally and so at a threat to the girl's life, not to mention psychological health.<br>Third, female genital "circumcision" (or, in more realistic words, "mutilation") is done around puberty. Male circumcision under normal circumstances is done days after birth. I'm sure I don't have to explain the importance between the two.<br>As for the bigger question: why is that male circumcision is a-ok? I have no fucking clue! I think that shit is terrible.</br></br></br></br>    <br>They were asking for it.<br> Going out in short skirts </br></br>  <br>Reason I asked is because I've run into some women who actually support female circ. Apparently there's more than one type. Removal of the clitoral hood, removal of the vaginal lips and removal of the clit, this one being the most common, unfortunately. And those women I ran into support the first two forms.<br><br>As for why male circumcision is still done? I know the Jewish still think it's needed. I think Islam also thinks that, but there's no reason for Christians to continue doing that.</br></br></br>  <br>It's called having testicles?</br>    Feminazis are effecting my favorite:<br> movies <br> tv shows <br> video games <br> comics <br> books <br><br>I honestly didn't give a fuck about them until they started fucking my favorite shit up.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gone_<wbr>Girl_(film)<br><br>This is the favorite movie of feminists.</br></br></wbr>          <br>this one takes the cake</br>  <br>Why any woman would support female circ, I have no idea.<br>Why any man would do the same, I have no idea.<br>As for your theory that Jews and Muslims still think it's a good idea, while there's no reason for Christians... it's moot. It's so far ingrained culturally that it's a norm. Many many many boys these days in the U.S. get circumsized not for any religious reasons, but simply because it's how daddy is and so it's how they are. I personally know several families who had male kids and did the same (including my nephew) while the family itself is atheist/agnostic/whathaveyou, NOT religious in any sense.</br></br></br>  <br>Just look at the broad writing the article; shes probably never had an alpha dick in her life.</br>  <br>I've seen atheists supporting circumcision claiming that it supposedly prevents STDs and shit, which honestly doesn't make any sense to me. They also use the "easier to clean" excuse a lot as well. Though, the worst excuse I've ever heard for it is the "it looks better". Who gives a fuck how a dick looks? The important thing should be for it to be healthy.</br>      half the shit here has to be fake, right? RIGHT?  <br>Unfortunately, no.</br>  <br>The "prevents STD's" thing makes sense only in the logic that "if it doesn't exist then it can't get sick". But of course one can say the same about anything: if I cut off any body part of mine, I quite obviously won't be able to contract diseases affecting said body part.<br>Easier to clean? Idunno son, my shit ain't circumsized and it don't smell like a fucking trashcan either. (probably because I shower every day and go through the ridiculous effort of pulling it back before washing it). <br>It looks better? Ain't never had a complaint either in the U.S. or here in Europe.<br>And you're right - all it needs to be is healthy, which it can do the best intact.</br></br></br></br>  <br>half of it is fake and the other half has nothing to do with anything.</br>  <br>I have spoken to women who support male circumcision so staunchly that they absolutely refuse all intelligent discussion concerning the same, and these same women would lose their goddamn minds if you talked about docking/cropping a dog's ears or tail because regardless of potential health reasons or visual appeal it's just plain abusive.<br><br>It's fucking insanity.</br></br></br>  <br>This is the world i live in now? Wow. Fuck this planet.</br>  <br>Where I come from, circumcision isn't common at all, and if someone's dick stinks, it's usually because they haven't showered in over two days. Same goes for some of the women here.<br><br><br>That's another thing I noticed. Most of male circumcision supporters tend to be females.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Don't even get me started on that shit!!! Cutting a dog's tail and ears is "inhumane" but cutting off a piece of a boy's fucking PENIS is not only ethical but straight up EXPECTED? That's the kind of shit that makes me want to leave this whole planet.</br></br>  <br>Same here, although I spent a lot of time in the U.S. where it's ridiculously common, and as I said, practiced by many many many families who aren't religious in any sense. And yes, if one washes their dick (foreskin or not) it won't stink. And yes, if one IS circumsized, their penis can still smell like rotting fish anus if they don't shower.</br>    <br> probably because I shower every day and go through the ridiculous effort of pulling it back before washing it <br>That's no small feat</br></br>  <br>What's your opinion on guys who willingly get circumcised because they think it looks better?</br>  <br>Eyy patriarchy, naw mean</br>  <br>inorite</br>        <br>The same as my opinion on any cosmetic surgery, that shit is ridiculous. I'd never let a goddamn knife near my junk in a million, million years.</br>  Because men and women are not equal. Equality, is not about being the same, it is about being treated the same. Additionally, we hate the SJWs specifically because they are a bunch of authoritarian fucks.  <br>I think I would only understand keeping circumcision legal, but only in cases of emergency. Like, a guy's foreskin getting some serious infection. Like gangrene or something.</br>  <br>Not to mention that when someone of a minority calls them out on their bullshit, they either assume the person is a white, hetero, "cis" male pretending to be a minority or they cry internalized discrimination.</br>  <br>Well yeah, but that's sort of true for any/all limbs. If one gets an infection serious enough to call for amputation then they take basically any limb they can without endangering your long-term well-being.</br>  Before anyone gets confused about this image, the girl painted her knuckles with red sharpie to make it look like she punched a guy when she didn't.  <br>I was serious, man.<br>In my case it 31 years * 365 days * 1 second = 11315 seconds / 60 = 188.58 minutes / 60 = 3.14 hours lost<br><br>All because my parents didn't mutilate my body without my consent.</br></br></br></br>  <br>"more time doing something productive like fucking yourself in the ass"<br>I won't lie... I kek'd</br></br>  <br> Last updated 2010. <br><br> pic related updated 2013 <br><br>How many more years do you think we'll have to wait before they add a line about counselling being available for women who are concerned about becoming violent and committing violent acts? Ya know, since a whole shitload of acts of domestic violence are perpetrated by women against men too, might be nice if they could receive that kind of support like men do.<br><br>At least they're fucking admitting men can get abused now. That's a plus.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Cringed</br>  <br>Yeah. Think that the need for cosmetic circumcision will ever lower in the future?<br><br><br>Mhmm. I wonder what made them change it, though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>i once picked a feminazi up and she was hell bent on anal</br>    <br>No idea, really. Quite possibly because of what I mentioned earlier, it's culturally ingrained, not even just religiously anymore. Stuff like this tends to stick around regardless of how ridiculous it is.<br>Not to mention most circumsized men have a certain ego and "pride" that will never EVER let them admit that their penis has been mutilated and is therefore "ruined" to some extent. Think about it... literally hundreds of millions of men in the world admitting to this? Not even ONE would.</br></br>  fuck i wish i was dead  <br>is that syndicate?</br>  <br>I'm french and this is wrong.

Please?</br>  <br>No idea, but I am hoping it's a hoax, though wouldn't surprise me if some people were retarded enough to claim they got pregnant through some virtual shit, considering how there's women who claim they can get pregnant if they have sex with horses.</br>  Have some fatty fun times    <br> women who claim they can get pregnant if they have sex with horses. <br>Would explain the  fanbase though.</br></br>  <br>Pony fanbase is cringe as fuck.

Fillyfooler for the lesbians and coltcuddler for the gays.</br>    <br><br> It's okay, as a guy I can afford it. </br></br>  <br>This woman is trolling. I read her twitter. She either is speaking in jest, or is clinically insane.</br>    <br>I hope it's in jest like the one in this image.</br>      <br>so you're getting upset over shit sarah jessica fucking parker says and the tumblr reaction thereafter? c'mon man...</br>  <br>No I did not know that. Frankly, I'm a bit concerned for you now.</br>  <br>If you're concerned because you're wondering how I know that, you can thank deviantART.</br>  <br> Roaring_Womyn <br>That's a /b/tard if I ever saw one.</br></br>    <br>I also support this. Older women should be allowed to fuck boys but grown men shouldn't be allowed to fuck little girls.<br><br>When I was a young kid all I wanted to do is be fucked by an older lady</br></br></br>  <br>ay bro i literally just had lunch and almost regurgitated that shit immediately. fuck you.</br>  <br>I wonder how they would react to the young girls in Japan who genuinely seek older men.<br><br><br>You're welcome.</br></br></br></br>    <br> deviantART <br>Never gone there. First exposure was through /b/ posting cretinous statements so I never visited the site. Also, can't draw for shit so no use going there.</br></br>  <br>Well, one doesn't just post drawings there.

I used to go there every once in a while, had found a group of the good guys of the site. What has happened?
