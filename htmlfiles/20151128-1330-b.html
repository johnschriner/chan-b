There is a safe that looks 100 years old. I'm trying to crack it and see what's inside. Posting a photo. Any help or advice would be appreciated! I've been losing sleep over wondering what might be inside! Help me 4chan?  timestamp  Post it to Reddit... Reddit loves safes.  Post on Reddit, maybe there you will find people who care.  Whats your lockpicking?<br><br>Looks like a master to me. <br><br>Go find Cait in the combat zone and have her pick it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Post it on reddit, they go nuts for that shit and will tell you how to crack it</br>  Proof needed for my attention.  Timestamp it, then get a plastic solo cup  <br>Agree</br>  My phone doesn't do timestamps, but ask me to make any hand gesture or sign before the safe, an I'll do that right now as proof.  Post proof and I'll help. Used to drill open safes a few years ago. <br>Nothing criminal though</br>  <br>do you have access to dynamite?<br><br>it's the best way</br></br></br>  <br>Dubs are proof of retardation</br>  <br>The Shocker or Hawaii thumb and pinky</br>  If it's locked, it needs to be drilled open. Find a drill point or hire a locksmith.  <br> My phone doesn't do timestamps <br>beeing that new</br></br>  so many people recommending reddit. what a weird time.  tumblr hate thread a go    I want to believe that all of this delusion and lies comes from one person, and that the IQ of the world will average up when they inevitably die. <br><br>In truth I know deep down that there are many, that my taxes are or will be paying for their survival, somehow they will breed, and pass on their traits to unsuspecting offspring. <br><br>I weep.</br></br></br></br>    OC.

I realize reading is hard for you, but reading the tumblr and understanding what it means isn't difficult.<br><br>Here's the attention you were incapable of earning in real life. Your bait is stale and anachronistic. Find some other quirky 4chan bullshit to play make believe over. You won't, of course. Being an antisocial adolescent manchild is so ingrained in your daily routine you wouldn't know what to do with yourself if you tried to behave like a real person whose life has value. ;)</br></br></br>  <br>does she actually go to Blow Job University, or does she just wear the shirt?</br>  <br>We need proof of pussy, tits arent enough, even bruce jenner has tits</br>  <br>he*<br><br><br>Sorry faggot but he clearly has a penis<br><br>In the webm where he is thrusting against his boyfriend he has one of them silly trap skirts on and you can clearly see his penis pushing against the skirt<br><br>you are confirmed as a shit tier troll :)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>he cant prove it and he knows it he is just bored and trolling</br>  <br>Thanks for being the predictable little failure at life we all knew you were all along.</br>  <br>where is his chin...nice adams apple tho!</br>  <br>Thanks for being a poor ass trap loving troll that we all know you are :)</br>  <br><br> they don't understand how burden of proof works because they went to southern schools <br>xD</br></br></br>  <br>Awww, wittle babby has to parrot because he knows he's not smart enough to think of his own reply.<br><br>Awwwwwwww.<br><br>*pats you on the head like a dumb dog*</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br> Pic related <br><br>1/10<br><br><br>I know this guy is really REALLY bad at trolling..way too obvious</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I honestly wouldn't mind masturbating to it, provided it proved it was female.<br>Since it refuses to show its pussy to verify female sex, then I will not masturbate to it.</br>  <br> I know this guy is really REALLY bad at trolling..way too obvious <br>I noticed you didn't address the content of my post.

More proof you're just a manchild who never grew out of adolescence with the rest of his peers. Tell us about how ashamed your parents are of you. But pretending you've won internet fights must be what makes you feel better about your failings as a man.</br>    Don't give a fuck if it's male or female I want to see it naked  <br>I think maybe you fell for it, are now sexually confused, and you're this butthurt about it <br><br>TOP KEK</br></br></br>  <br>post the webm</br>  <br>see here <br> the facts are there the fact that HE has ab adams apple is scientifically impossible that a girl can have an adams apple ..there fore you are a faggot, now please go kill yourself.<br><br><br><br>Kill yourself homo<br><br>pic very much related please follow the instructions</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>im sure op has it i dont download trap crap</br></br>  <br>who is she?</br>  <br>Google exists.
