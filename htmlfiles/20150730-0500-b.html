Look it up on pill reports, faggot</br>    <br>i think they are about the 200 mg range. never had them before but I saw blue ones in a pill report.</br>  <br><br>I know that, one pill report says North East US. One says CA, I am in AZ. I've heard reports of people all over using them though. Must've been a big import from Europe.</br></br>  What has been the best pill you guys have had?  <br>i got some blue tesla but i live in europa</br>  Why the fuck brand a drug with a car company?  <br><br><br>Yeah they both have roughly the same amount of MDMA</br></br></br>  <br>im sure they come from holland. germanfag here, the dutch people have some awesome, high quality pressed pills like heineken, burger king, instagram etc.</br>  <br><br>I've heard of heineken being pretty good but haven't heard of the other two.</br></br>  <br>kek we had snapchats in aus for awhile, bunch of people died though, so everyone sorta stopped with them</br>  <br>in germany there are a lot of pills around. some are really bad and mixed with other chemical substances. but most (thats what i can see) of them are 120+ and they become more and more stronger</br>  <br>The blue ones were around Orlando in early June. They were awesome. No clue about the pink ones.</br>  <br>i dont take pills often but this guys blew up my head</br>  <br><br>Same a lot down here are mixed with some bad shit so I was happy when I found the Orange Tesla's, went ahead and bought me 15.</br></br>  I've had blue tesla in Wales, ~215mg per pill they fuck you up, but they're amazing, not too sure about the glow in the dark bit tho, I'd be careful with shit like that  Sleep tight, street light<br><br>IGNORE THESE:<br>rekt , cringe , YLYL , gore</br></br></br>  <br>Sleep tight, street light</br>  Sleep tight, street light  <br>Sleep tight, street light</br>  Sleep tight, street light  Sleep tight, street light  Sleep loose, street lamp  <br>sleep tight, street light</br>  Sleep tight, Street light   Sleep tight, Street light   Sleep tight, street light  Sleep tight, street light.

Moreover an enlarged liver causes weightloss.

I was eating it in my vehicle in the parking lot and listening to an audio book when I glanced up and saw the McDonald's worker I ordered from was outside having a cigarette.<br><br>She waved at me and I nodded and had to wait 7 minutes before she went back inside and I could eat in comfort again. I don't think that employees should be bothering or even trying to socialize with customers outside of the McDonald's restaurant or drive through, but that is another story.<br><br>I went to McDonald's for dinner last night and got a Big Mac combo and a 10 piece Chicken McNuggets with barbecue dipping sauce. As I was driving to the second window the same girl was still working. She was acting somewhat obsequious and attempting small talk when she asked, 'why don't you come eat inside instead of in the parking lot'.<br><br>That really bothered me for many reasons. First of all, I don't want my routine or actions to be tracked by a fast food employee. Secondly, she should not try to tell me how I should live my life. I do not want to eat inside because I find it less comfortable and would much rather be inside my vehicle listening to an audiobook and enjoying myself and my privacy.<br><br>Overall, I think it was very unprofessional to bring this up. I should have a clean slate with each drive through visit, not have to get the third degree because I committed some sort of faux pas. Which I don't think I did, because I often see people eating in fast food parking lots. How does she know I am not busy going to work or somewhere in a rush?<br><br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/631236622#p631236622">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kill yourself please you pretentious little shit.
