It's proper, it really is. England is a great place</br>    <br>At least they don't say you're.</br>  I like their cute words for everything.  <br>give me a for example you guttersnipe</br>  <br>The model of how an Islamic nation should be.</br>  <br>Terrible food<br>Free sex<br>Boring</br></br></br>  <br>You mean that entire language that we shared with almost the entire world.<br><br>You're welcome.</br></br></br>  I love how the britfags on /b/ get so worked up over USA guns, fat, niggers, war, etc, and they are ignore that they're drowning in in rotten tooth drunks and muzzies.  What's not to like, they enjoy drinking, sports and banging skanks.<br>And they live on an island so that's cool too.</br>  <br>they ALL have bad teeth. just look at those ugly tards in the pic for fuck sake. pic related.</br>  English humour is best humour  they're all fat too  <br>not sure if bait or just retarded</br>  They were in to cuck way before it hit mainstream America. All about getting your wife shagged by builders.<br><br>It's because there wives always cheat on them with Europeans</br></br>  <br>you insist on using different words for nearly everything on a car.</br>  <br>summer</br>  bad teeth and cant hunt  dumping Brit teeth  <br>I do enjoy British humor</br>            They're a bunch of cucks that let shit-skin immigrants prostitute their daughters. The police and media don't do a thing about it as "that would be racist!"  We should all go to Britain and get their preety women before mudslims and niggers get them all!    <br>worst army too<br><br>look at that specimen, usa could beat them hands down</br></br></br>  <br><br> junkies </br></br>    <br>1500 children can't be wrong!</br>  <br><br> kek <br><br>says the land of blacks taking your women</br></br></br></br>  <br>I never said we were much (if any) better</br>    <br>fucked up teeth</br>  <br>They both have raging clues</br>  <br>I dare say sir, methinks you meant to say NIGGERS.</br>  <br> not actually European, just island trash <br> every last one of them is inbred and retarded <br> they may have been the original English speakers but you sure as fuck could never tell <br> total pussies, have no worldly presence in this age <br> give up their women to any blacks, indians and arabs that they import <br> have literally no historical imprint in Europe  <br> "but english is the #1 language in the world!" Because of America you chimps <br> also over reliant on the amerifats, without America they would have no tourists or a big brother to hide behind <br> culture sums up to drink abd punch eachother over football and then pretend that the islands are so diverse </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Anyway, wtf is with britfags teeth? Developed country and still britfags can't wash their fucking teeth?    <br>I'm still astonished more wasn't made of this. I heard briefly mentioned on the BBC for a couple of days and then nothing. Meanwhile some nigger criminal gets shot in the U.S. for assaulting a police officer and all you hear is how racist white people are.

Industrious and polite to a fault. I don't think they've ever recovered emotionally or culturally from the two World Wars. Cucked by their government into letting a ton of smelly brown people into their country that are seriously fucking shit up. I really hope they get it together and reclaim the respect and pride they once had.</br></br></br>  <br>hah i forgot about this.kek</br>  Name my group.  <br>are britts really annoyed by americans good teeth? ive heard that numerous times and it makes no fucking sense</br>  I'm British... My teeth are yellow.<br> kek </br>  <br> I don't think they've ever recovered emotionally or culturally from the two World Wars. <br>lol<br>while true, modern USA, when compared to pre-war USA is certainly not one to talk, especially considering it was barely in them. You guys did a total cultural 180 and have never been even remotely the same since.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Fuck off.<br><br>Nearly nice bait though.<br><br>Better to have once had respect and pride than to never have had it at all.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It is something Americans are obsessed with not British. I never see them take the bait and get annoyed by it.</br></br>  <br>no, not really, they make fun of those of us with ridiculously artificial looking teeth. ...teeth which have been ground and shaped and whitened til they glow in the dark. Teeth we're all used to seeing now because every actor &amp; actress on tv does it and now every housewife with too much money and no sense does it too.<br><br>Teeth aren't naturally supposed to be blinding-white. It's just as ridiculous as niggers having gold teeth. Absurd body art.</br></br></br>  <br>OI! WAT TIME DID YA SAY THE TROLLEY WAS LEAVIN YA DUMB WANK</br>  <br>Confirmed, we suck.</br>  <br>This summed it up pretty well</br>  <br>I don't disagree with that at all. My impression is that Brits just seem to feel defeated even though the Allies won. Survivor's guilt? I don't know.<br><br><br>Wasn't b8, m8. America's got a whole bunch of respect and pride we didn't earn or deserve, but for whatever reason Americans seem to keep their heads high.

WOOF WOOF WOOF!!  <br>shhhhhh....</br>   no more sissy threads <br> mfw </br>  fuck off faggot  I've been abusing Vicodin 10/325's for about a month now. I've never had any history of addiction, however, I just stopped taking these because I understand their crippling addictive properties. I know that a month isn't long, and I've been taking around 4-6 per day during my boredom-inspired drug use. Anyways, I stopped today and I'm pretty on edge, no doubt a sign of withdrawal. Also, my hands are freezing... probably a side effect of stress due to withdrawal. I'm not going to cave in and take anymore of the drug, I got rid of it anyways.<br><br>My question is this: How long is this shit going to last?</br></br>  Where do you get them?  <br>I had an injury and didn't take them as much as I was expected to because honestly it didn't hurt too bad. I had them all left over.</br>  depends on how long it takes to get the shit out of your body 3-5 day with a lot of exercise 2 weeks without  Go easy on that, OP.<br><br>You do know what that 325 is, right?<br><br>Take too many and it's goodbye liver.</br></br></br></br>  Found this and googled it<br>Says its vicodine but im not sure<br>What is it?</br></br>  <br>I'm part of a boxing gym, so I'm pretty active. Part of the reason I realized I needed to stop was because I've been getting my ass kicked lately due to my norco reflexes. 3-5 days isn't anything, thanks for the reply.</br>  <br>Pic didnt load</br>  <br><br>Hes right. <br><br>10/mg of hydrocodone and 325 of tylenol if i remember correctly</br></br></br></br>  when my teeth were bad I took way more than you for a few years on and off. Get something to watch, a series or videos on youtube and hold up in a room. Maybe a week. You'll get sweats and chills.

However 4-6 a day for a month is enough to make you dependent. <br><br>What you're going through tho, sounds more like a mental withdrawal. Youre going to feel like that until you simply get something to occupy your mind. On top of that, you're going to have a hard time sleeping for probably 1-2 weeks, possibly more.<br><br>I used to be a heroin addict, your symptoms sound mild but nothing to snub your nose at.</br></br></br></br>  Opiate withdrawal from a habit like that probobaly 4-7 days, days 2-4 being the worst. Also as other anons said, be careful with all that apap, if youre going to take them to get high, use cold water extraction to save your liver. Opiate addiction is a slippery slope. If there is one thing I can say is get out and stop before it gets worse. Im a 150-200mg a day oxy addict. Im wealthy enough to support my habit but I honestly couldent imagine not being able to afford it. Suffer the week, and youll save yourself a lifetime of pain.  <br>bro im currently trying to shake a weed addiction, and yes it is addictive you fuckers, but anyway honestly the best thing thats gunna help you is exercise, meditate/deep breath whatever, and lots and lots of water. and chill as much as possible outside of exercise. play some nostalgic vidya or something</br>  <br>Switch to kratom, it helps a lot</br>  <br><br><br><br>Thanks of the APAP heads up. The bottle suggested 4 per day throughout the day for mild pain so I'm so too worried about the effect of APAP on my liver. Regardless, yeah the symptoms suck right now but I'll get through it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>3-6 days if you only used for a month. 2 weeks to feel 100% normal again though. Exercise helps a lot.</br>  <br>So your skin can turn yellow and you can spend all your money. God drug addicts are fucking sad....just an hero faggots</br>  <br>Shake weed? Lol you have no will power. Its as simple as that. Don't blame weed cuz your a loser</br>  <br>Marijuana, you in here for some Marijuana? Marijuana is not addictive, I used to suck dick for coke, you ever suck dick for some Marijuana? Boo this man! BOOOOOOOOO!!!</br>  Fight the demon blood. When its done you will be stronger for it. It shld be uncomfortable so then u dont get bored and f ur a again. Remember this feeling  <br>Try getting a life and not taking pills you fuck up.

You are going to have the shits for a day, you are going to feel pretty restless and uncomfortable and probably won't sleep much for a night. I'd say max 2-3 days, but more likely 1-2. Just know I was taking 3-4 a day for about a month (10 325) and I had a pretty shitty night and following day at work.. I didn't even know why, I thought I just had a little illness.

That game was fucking epic</br></br>  <br>Why do you consider this underrated? I completed it when I was a kid (14 maybe). I liked it at the time, but it really was nothing special. Average graphics, average gameplay. Pretty shitty, would never play again.</br>      <br>i am literally looking at pirated CD of this game on my shelf right now</br>  <br>Dual fucking wielding</br>  <br>this my friends<br>this<br>this is the shit i wasted nearly my entire youth on, playin it online<br>i had more friends on my server than in real life but fuck it was worth it<br>i miss all the people from my old clan</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>tell a fun story please.</br>    <br>this one time, i was flying to our clans homebase (we just had a small sector pretty far outside), and when i approached my friends ship i thought it would be fun to torpedo his ass while hes afk, then when he came back he just told me that i just destroyed nomad weapons worth a few billion credits<br> mfw i destroyed our clan storage ship </br></br>  Wet - The Sexy Empire. Super old school economy simulation in the porn industry. kinda old now but still worth playing if you haven't already :)  By far the best game ever. Even after going out of business right after release the servers and game were stable and balanced enough to continue to be amazing. I just wish somsone would remake it like that.    <br>YESSS</br>    I fucking loved this game. Never completed it though, tough as nails  how i fucking loved this game  Gothic and Gothic 2 (with expansion) are extremely popular in Germany, Poland and some other parts of Europe, but I think it's underrated and forgotten in US        So is this a nastolgia thread vidya game edition?

Does anybody remember this little rare gem?  <br>Remember playing it on my cousin's PC and then on mine, when I got it. Freaking great</br>  There was this fuckong badass PS2 game where you were part of a terrorist response unit and the city had been taken over by rioters. The shooting was fuckinh awesome you could get slow motion shots of guys getting their face blasted off. Had rag dolls too, I can't remember the name though  Such a lost and underrated game for it's time.  <br>I actually rather enjoyed this game but forgot all about it... might have to play it again</br>  <br>That was seriously my first T rated game, I played the shit out of that game on my GameCube. The music and sound made you feel like you are in a bleak war painting and the muted colors helped that feeling too</br>  You can't forget about these classics.  One of the best CoDs.  WAR OF THE MONSTERS  <br>I do. Dunno if rare gem applies though.</br>    Speaking of forgotten games...  Don't worry guys, I have a little known game that takes the cake.  <br>this is like my favorite game</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>i like these</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>its time to stop posting autist</br></br></br>  am I the only one who played this?  <br>mw3</br>  AHH, Please tell me atleast one person remembers this game?  <br>because its not underrated</br>  /b/ pls      Please, Soldner - first game I ever played with open world, so many vehicles and no invisible walls. Also multiplayer was awesome.  This one's coming out of my special collection, pretty rare game (at least in my opinion).  <br>Anyone else ever played this gem? It was so fucking good.</br>  <br>Only used beanbag shotgun and always had the max score.</br>  Does anybody remember this one, even I barely can anymore.    <br>Roger that, Black Hammer</br>    Who remembers this little known classic?  Loved this game. This was before I got introduced to the Baldur's Gate series on PC.  <br>All of my yes</br>   627685802 <br>That was the first game I played online on my ps2 ... Played so much on the zombie servers. Miss that game</br>  <br>oh fucking hell, I remember this.</br>  <br>Hard to believe that was a 360 launch title.</br>  True Crime: Streets of LA  <br>SHAKE SHAKE, MUTHERFUCKER! Seriously underrated gem on the 64. Took me ages to get the full ending. Will never attempt again but I still go back and listen to the soundtrack from time to time.</br>  <br>Shit tier imo</br>  <br>You niggas have no idea how fun this was at the time. The mode where you try to fuck yourself up the hardest was goat</br>  <br>all of my yes</br>  <br>best lightsaber battle game ever</br>  <br>Ahahaha kill yourself newfag<br><br>Anywho, here's the most underrated great game.</br></br></br>  <br>Still my favorite 007 game, sorry golden eye</br>    that game was so fucking great. really want a new title for 3DS with better graphics and gameplay.  fuck you Zelda, this game was the best  <br>My nigga</br>  <br>nobody has ever beaten this game without cheating<br><br>it is known</br></br></br>  <br><br>It's based off a pen and paper RPG that is very popular, numerous other games have been made since based on the universe. Check /tg/</br></br>  <br>Are you that fag who posted about how awesome Gamecube was for Phantasy Star Online?<br><br>Now this shit?<br><br>Dreamcast was so beyond it''s time</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Motherfucker<br> Moa and cheetah <br> ican'tcontrolhyron </br></br></br>  <br><br>It came out in 2001 so don't expect good graphics but the humor in this game is the toppest of top tiers and so are the game mechanics.<br><br>Basically you feed souls to your silly drunk workers who build you buildings so you can fly helicopters, throw tornadoes or rampage around as a giant monster.</br></br></br></br>  <br>such a great game<br><br>wtf was with the story though? adventure around, kill monsters. spell cast on you - you can talk to monsters &amp; animals, but not humans. you realise humans are the true monsters. you team up with animals. you go to heaven and fight God<br><br>fucking trippy as shit game haha</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's actually on steam and on sale right now. The multiplayer is far from dead.</br></br>  <br><br>Eh, only the first and second were good. 3D ruined it.</br></br>  <br>I fucking loved that game</br>  Any play this?    <br><br>Multiplayer using all bots = sit back and watch hilarity ensue</br></br>  <br>This</br>  <br>Chase that time bending tornado!</br>  <br>I 2nd this! I still play it, and it is still as good as always.</br>  <br>yes</br>  <br><br>It's not very stable though. I hope war for the underworld doesn't turn out shit.</br></br>  <br>MediEvil was a fucking masterpiece <br>MediEvil two was a great game, but not QUITE as good<br>The remake makes me want to punt small children.</br></br></br>  <br>Mine is stable. I bought the optimised version on GoG and I have never had any problems with it.</br>  I can't be the only one who played the shit out of this as a kid  <br>Wasn't bad<br>Wasn't great<br>Good for what it was</br></br></br>  Niggers, how has this not been posted yet  Anyone remember this?    I really should finish playing Dark Cloud 2 some day  <br>been looking for the name to this game for years</br>  <br>TIMESPLITTERS!</br>  <br>Because its not underrated or forgotten, it has been remastered recently.</br>  <br>loved it , have you played second part?</br>  bump  <br>where have you been lol?</br>  <br>FUCKING THIS AND 40 WINKS WAS MY CHILDHOOD MAN</br>    <br>my nigga</br>    <br>what? I know it was taken down few months ago, but it came back and thepiratebay.se works just fine. I know there's a rumor it's an fbi honeypot or something, but I'm downloading movies, music, ebooks, games and other stuff from there and haven't had any trouble at all. I'm from eastern europe though so maybe they just can't reach me here.</br>  <br>teris is the best the game ever made<br><br> chekt </br></br></br>    I love this game. It's a shame that there was no sequel      <br>god tier</br>    <br>Never finished the game but it was indeed awesome</br>  <br>My nigga</br>  <br><br><br><br>major nostalgia</br></br></br></br>  Anybody?  <br>oooohhhh yes</br>  is this what the feminists want?  <br>THANK YOU GIANTESS</br>  <br>this is my dream</br>    OP is... weird... but definitely not a faggot  <br>Aaaahw yiss, Thanks you giantess!</br>  <br>basically yeah, well unless the guy has a huge foot fetish</br>  <br>don't know, but it is what I want</br>  <br>fuck no</br>  <br>No. Crushing men is raping them.</br>  <br>what if they consent to?</br>  <br>Women can't rape so the crushing would be done by other men</br>  <br>The woman is still being raped.</br>  <br>this makes me fell... small</br>  <br>My apologies anon I meant to say that the women is being raped</br>  <br>gtfo faggot</br>  <br>kek, I can totally hear them say it even in such situation.</br>  <br><br><br><br>MOAR</br></br></br></br>  <br> gtfo <br> stating the truth  <br>Buthurt?</br></br></br>  animooted  <br>Oh ok thankyou annon</br>  no but it's pretty much what I want  this is a sad fetish to have because it will never be real no matter how handsome, rich or intelligent you can be    <br>I think this is a great material for raiding some feminist forum and, impersonating one of them, starting a discussion on this topic there.<br>Results could be interesting and show their true face.<br>And also many lulz could possibly have been had.</br></br></br>    <br>;_;</br>  <br/>  <br>Raiding a forum there for the purpose of equality in modern society....<br><br>Well done you Misogynist, showing your true colours</br></br></br>  <br>This is terrifying.
