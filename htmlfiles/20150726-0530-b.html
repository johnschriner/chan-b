My name is Max. My world is fire. And blood. Once, I was a cop; a road warrior searching for a righteous cause. As the world fell, each of us in our own way was broken. It was hard to know who was more crazy. Me... or everyone else. Here they come again. Worming their way into the black matter of my brain. I told myself... they cannot touch me. They are all dead. I am the one who runs from both the living and the dead. Hunted by scavengers. Haunted by those I could not protect. So I exist in this Wasteland. A man reduced to a single instinct: survive.

Not always but it still fucked it up.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The ending sucked, basically ruining the rest of the show.</br>   Kiefer said he isn't returning to 24 <br> you will never see a new episode of the Jack Bauer Power Hour in your lifetime <br>Feels fucking terrible man.<br><br>What's a great intense action show like 24 that I can watch to fill the void?<br>Burn Notice ended too.<br><br>I hear there's some British 24 clone.

And I actually quite like the show. But they're very different. The way Woodhouse writes, to be fair, doesn't naturally translate to the screen, but the show really comes across as more of an homage than anything else. It's like someone said, "I love these characters so much that I just can't stand not seeing them on telly."</br>  <br>Wow. Autocorrected "Wodehouse" to "Woodhouse." Presumably because of that famous author...Woodhouse?</br>  Modern family    <br>everything before they switched network. yes</br>  <br>Community / Chuck already mentioned.<br><br>Psych.</br></br></br>  Is Rick and Morty any good?

You should know this being a /b/tard yourself. Normal Banner is just kind of a simmering cranky. Hulk is 2000% MAD. He stays a little pissed off all the time, and that becomes his norm.</br>   predator <br> high tech equipment <br> cabt see shit through mud </br></br>  <br>This</br>  <br>they don't have mud on his planet.</br>   inb4 "why didn't gandalf get the eagles to fly them over mount doom and drop the ring in"   <br>it would make sense to me that a batshit insane criminal with batshit insane plans would work out for him, especially when the hero is batshit man.</br>   pretty much all animu <br> bad guy is stronger than hero <br> he could kill him instantly <br> they keep talking and talking <br> hero somehow gets stronger or discovers hidden power <br> kills bad guy </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it is kind of bad writing, cause come on its a batman movie, but you are correct in that is supposed to be the point. The joker just doesn't give a shit if his plans work or fail. And they actually DO fail in the movie. Just up till that point they were the kind of plan that is "So crazy it just might work"</br>  <br>pride goes before the fall</br>  <br><br>They discovered after it happened that it has the ability to cloak its heat signature, which is why they thought it was missing. Some bullshit like that.</br></br>  <br>If you rewhatch the movie and look just close enough, you'll see that the somewhat controlled Hulk is the result of Banner accepting the 'other' as a part of him. I'd guess if the movie had like 30-40 more minutes we would prbly get a less hidden explanation.</br>  Ton of movies have this hole but Law Abiding Citizen. He lines up 350 things that all rely on every person being exactly where he expects them to at exactly the right time.

You've never traveled through time either!</br>  <br> The joker just doesn't give a shit if his plans work or fail. <br><br>then why is he pissed when neither boat blows up?</br></br></br>  <br><br>It did have a chip, it was smart enough that it figured out where it was and got it out somehow.</br></br>  Gazelle from Kingsman The Secret Service<br><br> She had a chip in her head <br> didn't blow her head when Merlin activated the chips </br></br></br>  <br>he changed the future and there was no head on the photo<br>this means that the photo was changed because the future changed<br>so the photo was taken in that alternate future<br>this means the in the alternate future there was no head<br><br><br>i like that movie too but it is full of plotholes</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this<br><br>organising a group of people who all have you attention to fucking raise their hand at the same time is a fucking mission in itself. you'd expect trained professionals to know it's a bad idea to rely on such precise co-ordination.<br><br>This is why Breaking Bad was cool when he hit all those people in prison within like a 60 second window. They actually made it out like "omg dude that's fucking impossible" and Walt became a LEGEND for doing it</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah but in the movie the tracker was fuckin huge.</br>  <br>cause he just wanted an excuse to blow both boats up</br>  <br>Yes. But that was after it escaped. When it was in the cage they should have pinged it instead of all going into the cage.</br>  Just everything about Bruce's broken back in this movie.  <br>cause he thinks humas are shity and thats the only constant - they are cruel and he is cruel because he afterall just wants to be like a normal person - in what he thinks a normal person is - all the joy he gets out of this is his enjoying being a person, when those boats don't blowup this is messing with his perception of what it means to be human</br>  <br>good answer</br>  <br>this over 9k times</br>  <br>His whole plan would have been fucked if the prison decided to put a guard outside his cell to watch him at all times.</br>  <br>pretty sure she, and the villain had different chips, or they just didn't have them.</br>  <br><br>So it can get it out easier so the plot can get moving.</br></br>  <br>that magic healing rope tho</br>  <br>This</br>  <br>Or if he was sent to a different prison than he expected. If they ignored his demands the first time through. If they assigned a different detective than the one he asked for. The movie was just death through a million plot holes.</br>  <br>He used infared to see heat signatures. The mud is cold and masks the heat signature.</br>  Famous one:<br><br>Nobody shoots Nice Guy Eddie.</br></br>  <br> can barely fight at the start of the movie <br> magical band aids <br> perfectly fine until broken back <br><br>Also, I hate how Bane died like a complete bitch.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yes, the damn thing even had a blinking light, like a light is necessary.</br>  <br>Valentine didn't have one<br><br>Gazelle did</br></br></br>  <br><br>My only guess is after seeing no heat signatures they just assumed it wasn't there. They didn't know it could do that. The park is massively incompetent. <br><br>I'll add my own because I don't want to be seen defending this tripe. Why do the ball things have the ability to go off track? Why is there no security cams on them or anyway for control to shut them down?</br></br></br></br>  <br> I hate how Bane died like a complete bitch. <br><br>yep, that sucked so fucking bad<br><br>don't know WHAT Nolan was thinking</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>its been a bit since ive seen the movie, ik there was some reason she didnt blow up like the fucking fireworks everyone else did. whole movie was shit tier.</br>  <br>And why would they?

You can't stop your erection, you constantly get erections, even when looking at all those black men fucking your girlfriend. you cant help it that you get an erection. you wish you could cuz its embarassing how often you get an erection while looking at your little brother, and it doesnt e ven go away when your parents yell at you afterward.<br><br>but when your girlfriend is finally done being fucked by her sixth nigger of the night, and she decides to let you have a turn since she'd barely feel it anyway, you can INSTANTLY give yourself a boner just by thinking of things that get you horny.

It was lacking Harry Dean Stanton but i still liked it. At least it wasn't trying to come off as a genuine representation of what the future could be. Blade Runner takes itself WAAAAAAAAAY to fucking seriously and that always got my goat to the point of not being able to suspend disbelief.</br></br>  <br>I call you out on this one Cunt. Took the kids to see the avengers movie a few weeks ago and can confidently say there are zero plot holes in this movie. It had no fucking plot to put holes in. Popcorn was good but.</br>  <br><br>I never understood that as well, It seemed so fucking stupid. The guy was an animal, Batman starts to hold up against him. Cat women kills him with a gun.....WTF. Could have at least not killed him off or something. I'm pretty sure Bane wears a bullet proof vest all the way through it.</br></br>  <br><br>How many times did she kiss you with another man's cum in her mouth before you figured that one out?</br></br>  <br>the whole idea of the film was to highlight the international crisis that was becoming evident at the time.<br><br>that the western world was being overrun by nigger anti-culture, and that all that was decent in the world was being wiped out.<br><br>not a coincidence that it was released less than a year after hurricane katrina - following the riots and mass lootings of that.<br><br>people in the film were wilfully allowing themselves to be removed from a pleasant, civilised world - in order to enter a stinking shithole of a detroit-like apocalypse, where the only social event is a giant drug fueled hip hop rave saturated with aids and dreadlocks.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Eagles are, apparently, dicks.</br></br>  <br>This "good world" is a false reality, basically like they were forced to play Second Life from birth. Sure, it's "better," but it isn't real. The longer the humans are slaves to the machines, the shittier the state of earth will be. And it wasn't a "few people," this was the sixth instance of an emerging hero in the Matrix universe.</br>  <br>Because he actually was supposed to be shot, the gun just didn't work or whatever. <br><br>The movie was meant to be like a low budget thing</br></br></br>  <br>Is this the plot to "The Incredible Cuck"?</br>  <br>the matrix was a system created by the machines so people wouldn't find out they where being farmed and harvested for machine food. Being in the matrix was nice yea but it wasn't real. You never had true freedom in the matrix.

And next time try not to be so ambiguous in your retort.</br></br>  <br>Yeah but why not have him die another way unlike a bitch, Also having him show him winning against the Batman and him being saved by the Cat women made it look even more weak.</br>  <br><br>Even pawns need to be at least halfway combat effective, or the logistical cost of recruiting, training and constantly shipping new ones places outweighs the cost of decent armor many times over.<br><br>Why would the Emperor have poorly equipped meatshield troops defending the vital shield generator?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Different characters, same actors.

That's another woman</br>  <br>He's always angry - when he needs Hulk, he just stops trying to control it. <br>He can't "turn it off", which is why he attacks people like Thor and the rest of the Avengers from time to time. <br><br>Later iterations of Hulk have Banner completely separate. He lives as Hulk at all times (except one day a year). Hulk remains Hulk even if he's not angry at the moment, it's only when Banner tries to force the change back to human (or gets tranq'd) that it occurs.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yea it pisses me off. I always liked Marvel over DC because Marvel got more into the chatacters and other struggles than a big scary bad guy. taking Stark's alcoholism from the movies and replacing it with a tumblr chick "illness" like anxiety</br>  <br><br>I think the camp was deliberate, why else would they cast James Spader?</br></br>  <br>i always thought gandalf had to find a special moth to summon them.</br>  <br>You say this like the Wachowski brothers predicted Hurricane Katrina 6 years in advance. The "past" the the matrix represents is indeed 1999, because the real time in the movie is 200 years in the future.</br>  <br>You could say it was............black magic</br>  <br>So angry that you had to change your writing style to something more pseudo-intellectual.<br><br>If you can't follow blade runner or alien - you shouldn't be watching films. They are designed for mass consumption.</br></br></br>  <br>I really liked his character.<br><br>I just felt like if it wasn't for the fact that the good guys have to win, he would have succeeded with his plans.<br><br>They were full proof. Him getting locked out of the nuke codes was a little far fetched, too.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>he wasn't high enough level to cast that spell yet</br>  <br>mr pink shoots him from under the ramp</br>  <br>I should add that I'm speaking of the first movie. Reloaded and Revolutions are loaded with plot holes, as they step away from the premise of the the first Matrix and focus on the "hero's journey."</br>  <br>Eventually, sure. Dirt and mud is a pretty good thermal insulator though.</br>  <br>The Matrix was set in 1999, which is why it all looks out of date - the computers in the office etc, the phones, the cars - it's very clever.<br><br>Read their interview - they were halfway through writing a script when katrina happened and they rewrote the whole thing more or less.<br><br>Why do you think they all have 'rapper names' when they leave the matrix (civilised world).</br></br></br></br></br>    <br> She was the only one who warned him <br> She tried to save Santa Claus for him <br> He saved her  <br>You're a fucking idiot.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think that might be one of the points of the movie. <br>They also kill the humans who are still plugged into the Matrix. <br>Who is good? It might be the machines, who created a virtual world for humabity to live in. <br>We see in the Animatrix that the machines didn't ask for the war, but they sure as hell finished it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I know but it's inevitable someone would have spouted that bs at some point</br>  <br><br>Oh i followed it, and at the end of Blade Runner I was so bored and disappointed that I wanted to punch a baby. The replicants coming to earth was, as I said, something that could have been easily resolved with a metal detector. They have inexplicably mastered space travel but can't find fucking metal in a robot? how does that add up?<br><br>I'm not here to feign intellectual. I just can't fathom why that film is held in such high regard when it looks like crap, has massive plot holes and tries so hard to incorporate the film noir aesthetic and plot line into a sci-fi for no reason. It was shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It didn't look out of date when the movie premiered in 1999. When Katrina happened, I had already seen this god damn movie. Troll harder.</br>  <br>it was supposed to be mr white, but nice guy eddie's blood pack went off, quentin tarantino left it and decided that mr pink shot him, he even made a new post script for personal records saying mr pik shot him from under the loading ramp</br>  <br><br>Are you high? Katrina happened in 2005 you dumbass.</br></br>  <br><br>Eagles may have stolen the ring.</br></br>  <br>who said anything about space travel? the robots escaped from the factory<br><br>then will smith 'retirement homed' them.</br></br></br>  <br><br>the film was SET in 1999 like this guy said <br><br>Do you also think that Dances with Wolves was filmed in the future and they really travelled to that tree planet to film it?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That's iRobot, you faggot.<br><br> made me kekkle a bit tho </br></br></br></br>  <br>Dude, if you don't use 100% of your brain all the time you better go see a doctor.</br>  <br> amazing power to always be angry, like a gingernut with an absent father. </br>  <br>They screwed up filming. Apparwntly in the script the butler was there.</br>  <br>it was probably released as a different title in your shithole middle eastern country to make it easier to understand than "blade runner".</br>  <br>no, no it wasnt.</br>  kickass 1, cops and feds can't find kickass even though he updates using myspace, daddy finds him using IP address. Are cops and feds fucking dumb?  <br> Implying the thing he's thinking about to make him angry is the necessarily the aliens </br>  <br>Dude. It's nice that he talks in shitty fake Auld Stage Anglische instead of Nordland Doomheim 666, Ja?</br>  <br>Could you imagine angry sex with Banner?</br>  <br>us soldiers in the middle east have to buy their own armor</br>  <br><br>Words cannot describe the extent of your retardation.<br> MFW </br></br></br>  Police weren't looking for him at first.

The real year is 2199, but the Matrix remains as a 1999 simulation so that they could accurately depict the world the audience (at the time of theatrical release) actually knows and lives in.</br>  <br>This and when he doesn't make the jump and falls, to what I thought was his death, but turns out that his spine is made of dark-matter titanium.

If I had caught his girlfriend cheating on him I probably would have blackmailed her into doing me too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Exactly. Finally someone who understands the plot.<br>It's a 1999 SIMULATION of how the director thinks things were back then - but taking place in modern day, as when it was filmed.<br>It is an accurate depiction of 1999, as you said - they did a lot of work on the details to make it really look like it was at that time.<br><br>I am surprised more people aren't offended by the racial tension that was the underlying message of the film.<br>Morpheus, the black guide - with the white woman already on his side, taking the effeminate looking Neon as the 'powerless in the new world of the black man' and only powerful in his old society which doesn't exist anymore due to civilisation breaking down.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Right, that is the explanation in the movie. Really, they knew it would be stupid as hell if they tried to create a future-esque Manhattan with hover cars and other unrealistic bullshit.</br>  <br>Not even the same guy you're having this autistic fit over, kid. I know it's weird to think there's more than just you and one other person on this vast wasteland we all affectionately refer to as "the internet", but trust me.<br><br>You're just plain retarded, kiddo. No ifs, ands, or buts about it.<br><br><br>Except the Replicants in the movie were grown, biological beings that for one reason or another weren't "programmed" with emotion. A metal detector isn't going to find metal where none exists, and even if there were, there are metal detectors now that don't pick up small traces of it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, they would be human if they were born.<br><br>But they were instead bioengineered and have different qualities from humans - superior strength, agility, and variable intelligence.<br>Their emotional responses are also different, and that's why the test is used.</br></br></br></br>  No trap thread?

Feels bad, man.      <br> as he drives he looks over at me just oogling me  <br> he asks again who I am because of the day before at his place <br> I think telling him who I was at that moment might have been too much so I lie <br> I tell him we went to school together and I always had a crush on him <br> he says he doesn't recognize me <br> I lie and say we never had the same classes together  <br> we drive on  <br> he asks what I want to do now since I got his attention  <br> im kinda baffled myself so I say lets get some booze and go to the lake  <br> its like 11pm and we are at the local gas station at the edge of town  <br> here I am in a red dress with a guy buying me snacks and booze inside <br> the feeling was strange, I felt like I was on a date, but he was my best friend and didn't even know  <br> so he hops in a throws me the bottle of Smirnoff and some candy bars and takes off <br> its midnight now on the dirt road to the lake and I am starting to feel different then I ever had, the moon was out and there was a breeze and the trees were lit by the moonlight  <br> it was so fucking pretty out there  <br> I was so comfy it was like I was in a dream  <br> so we get to the lake, its a rural place so u can park right next to it  <br> I get out of the car and so does he <br> he passes me a camel crush cig and lights it for me  <br> I shiver a bit and he throws a jacket over my shoulder  <br> at that point I let out a giggle because it basically confirmed how much I am a girl now  <br> I put the smoke out and he did with his  <br> we didn't talk at all  <br> I just leaned against him and we hugged  <br> my eyes met his and I was feeling a bit hesitant and then it happened, he kissed me <br> I never kissed a man yet, never dated a man yet since my transition  <br>continue?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> gets lured in by girlcock  <br> gets excited

used to when I needed to fap <br> I bite his bottom lip a bit <br> we move to the hood of his car <br> I turn around and he lays me on the hood <br> 3rd gen firebirds/comaros are pretty low to the ground and the hood is flat as fuck btw  <br> so I am all the way layed back with him on top of me still kissing  <br> he supports his weight with one hand and the other is feeling around my new pussy  <br> I start to panic a bit because I am a tranny and my pussy is not like the rest  <br> he doesn't suspect anything, starts rubbing his fingers over my clit  <br> I was about to leap up and tell him no or tell him who I was  <br> I didn't and just let him <br> it felt so good to have someone else touch me there  <br> I was moaning, never moaned before either  <br> eventually he grabbed my legs and yanked me down a bit dragging my ass against the hood decal  <br>continue?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  MOAR  <br>Holy

panties to the side and I pulled my boobs out of my bra <br> I never did any of this before but it felt natural, so strangely natural  <br> he undid his pants and let them fall to his ankles  <br> he never wore undies btw <br> so there I see it for the first time, my friends dick <br> I mean I felt a little gay for a second and had to remember to look down at myself and the fact I am a hottie now more or less  <br> I never seen a dick irl besides mine  <br> he leans over and rubs it against my clit for a bit  <br> fuck it feels hotter then a my xbox after playing new vegas for a few hours  <br> like almost steaming hot  <br> after a few seconds he sicks it in slowly  <br> OMFG.webm  <br> I feel like I am already about to have an orgasm but the feeling comes in waves  <br> he keeps sticking it in and out and I keep feeling like I am going to die the orgasm is so strong and lasting, like i was having an orgasm over and over  <br> I started almost to hurt and that's when he blew his load in me  <br> I screamed when this happened  <br> best orgasm of my fucking life ever  <br> he pulled out and my vag made a *slurp sound  <br> he layed on the hood and handed me a smoke and we both looked at the moon  <br>continue?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Inb4 walk the dinosaur. </br>  <br> fuck it feels

Lots of these shoots include her wearing very revealing clothing and the worst part is that she posts them on her public facebook profile. What is worse is that my friends know about this and like to lurk her pics. How can I at least get her to make her profile private without her getting mad and lecturing about how she is 20 and doesn't need to be treated like a kid and how she needs to do it for her portfolio? As her brother I'd also like her to stop wearing revealing clothing in public. Ideas?<br> Pic related, she is gonna be this chick for an upcoming Halloween photoshoot. </br>  <br>clearly bait</br>  We'll Need photos to reverse search so we can be sure nothing is leaked on the internet.  new draw thread  I'm new, what do we usually draw?  <br>butts</br>  <br>and vagoos</br>  <br>Oh.</br>    <br>either you do request and you draw things anons ask, or you roleplay with other drawfags</br>  <br>tubavore, from what I've seen</br>  <br>you're gay</br>  <br>Serious question, OP, how many dicks do you work in a week?
