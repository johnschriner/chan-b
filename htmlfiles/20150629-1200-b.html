I'm fighting for the Second South, without a doubt.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm fighting with the whites.</br>  <br><br>That's the Second South then. Basically it's just gonna be Republicunts against libtards. Slightly different lines, but still similar.</br></br>  <br>First of all, this scenerario is laughable<br><br>Secondly, I would try to mind my own buisness, try not to die, because a flag isn't worth dying for.<br><br> this is what every single one of you should do </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> this scenerario is laughable <br><br>lel<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=o3U<wbr>US1kx5oE</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>It's happening. Just wait for it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> because a flag isn't worth dying for. <br><br>Who says anything about dying for it? I'm hoping to do some killing for it first.</br></br></br>  <br>Everything you said is so stupid and removed from reality that you have to be like 17.<br><br>You must have missed the intense, extreme pussification of america these past few decades. It's to the point that music isn't allowed to be rebellious now, it's literally all people holding hands in a circle singing oohs and ahhs with bells chiming in the background. That's how you know there is no hope.<br><br>You think any of these faggot kids are going to mess up their bieber hair to fight for someone else? Nooooooope. Then you have the military and coast guard, whose oath is to protect all americans, so they're automatically out. You don't join the military to kill your own. That leaves no one to fight a civil war. <br><br>What you'd really get is niggers rioting and police blasting away from inside tanks, business as usual.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Worked so well the first time....<br><br>What could possibly go wrong?</br></br>  <br>Flags were used for identification at sea, and for battle formations in war. <br><br>It serves no purpose at all. Get rid of all flags, we can read now. Identify countries by name. Easy.</br></br></br>  Not a 'murilard but i'd hope for a southern victory.<br><br>The north seems full of whiny liberal fags.<br><br>Plus i like guns so go south i guess.</br></br></br></br>  <br> land of the free <br> entire south feels opressed <br>I don't understand America</br></br></br>  <br> southern victory. <br><br>That's an oxymoron. <br><br>South will lose, in glorious fashion. But we'll curbstomp our fair share of whiny, SJW faglords, niggers and Jews before we do, friend.</br></br></br></br></br>  We can't let blood shed like it did 150 years ago. Diplomatic and political negatiations and agreements must be the only way to fix problems. Otherwise north/south , white/other won't matter we will all be dead or invaded by another sou try taking advantage of our problems and power vacuums. But another civil war could never happen, so its really more of a thought  Conservative here, idk though. Depends on if they get an idiot in the new south. Also, we would need a new name and reputation otherwise we get blasted by other countries because 'we're racist'. I wanna call it New Columbia personally.  <br> war could never happen <br><br>You know those four words have followed pretty much every major conflict in history, lol.<br><br><br>Not every, but so many.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Another country, not sou lol. My bad</br>  <br>Go back to farming, peasant. You never won anything and never will.</br>  <br> those four words have preceded pretty much every major conflict in histor </br>  <br>Yeah but this instance, it is truely impractical</br>  <br> But we'll curbstomp our fair share of whiny, SJW faglords, niggers and Jews before we do, friend. <br><br>You won't mess with Jews because you will need them. <br><br>Google Judah Benjamin.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>We're gonna get blasted by them anyway because they're all America's bitches.<br><br>We're just gonna have to scrape by and trade with rogue states, cartels and shit, fuck it we'll make it work.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Looks fake. <br><br>Where's all the blood?</br></br></br></br>  <br>i hope so Dimitry, I hope so.</br>  The only thing I'm fighting for is pussy.<br> wake up go to work <br> make money <br> buy things that are nice <br> want to talk to girls with my nice stuff <br> mfw I spend all day working for pussy </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>i'll be fighting for the oklahoma-texas alliance of the new southern republic</br></br>  <br>Lol....that is one of the most famous photos taken of the war. A few years ago Nat geo colorized hundreds of civil war pics. So blood most likely was colored over. Plus those bodies had been out in the July heat for 3 days, so that's why they are bloated and stiff</br>  <br><br>you're assuming the military will fire on their own people this time. the only government forces with mindless federal allegiance are the executive branch offices, like dea and fbi, marshals.</br></br>  Why are atheists so angry?  DONT REPLY TO THIS THREAD SERIOUSLY  <br>Did op just come out of the closet?</br>            hmm i am hungry        <br><br>I AM NOT ANGRY YOU MOTHERFUCKING PIECE OF SHIT!</br></br>    <br><br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br>      <br><br><br/></br></br>          <br/>          <br/>                <br><br><br><br/></br></br></br>      Who makes all these?    <br> little </br>  <br>The man in the sky</br>          <br><br><br/></br></br>          <br>This....this made me laugh</br>    <br><br/></br>        <br/>    <br/>        <br><br/></br>    <br>Thats a very good question<br>You know it reminds of this one time when my friend Dan and I were hanging out at this new bar we hadn't been to before. Believe it or not, it was called The Velvet Cheeks. Anywho, we sat down right at the bar, and ordered a few good drinks, but let me tell you, this bartender.. Wasn't a bartender at all! Turns out this guy was actually filling in for the bartender that quit recently, and was having a difficult time doing this job that was foreign to him. So I told him, "hey buddy, you need a little help?" And he turned to me with this hollow look in his eyes, and viciously said no, needless to say I just sat back down without a word. I asked my pal Dan what his problem was, and Dan brought up the fact that he might be atheist, given that all atheists are angry. I told Dan that he was a pure genius! Never in a million years would I have thought he was an atheist. I had to get an answer, so I asked the fill in bartender, "are you atheist?, if so, why are you so mad?" And while I didn't expect a response he said "well wouldn't you like to know, aye bub?"</br></br>          <br><br><br/></br></br>      <br/>      <br/>        <br/>  <br><br/></br>    <br>I told him " well yeah I'd really love to know actually".<br>And he stood for a good while explaining in intricate and precise detail of his dilemma, and I was in awe of his reasons. It actually made for a honest reason to be angry! Any ways, after he explained everything to me, he handed us our drinks. Suddenly me and Dan realized that these drinks tasted a little fruity, and to our suprise we were in a Gay bar! "Well that sure explains a whole lot more!" Dan said as we chuckled our way to the car. Fun experience and I learned a few things too</br></br>      Isn't it crazy how this guy had all these shpoopies of Travis specifically for this thread. He saw this and thought... my time has come.                        <br>Ignorance is bliss, and atheists are anything but.</br>        <br>BECAUSE MY GOD DAMN TOASTER KEEPS BURNING MY TOAST AND IT POSSES ME OFF!!!</br>              <br>woah nice dubs man!<br>checked lol</br></br>        <br><br/></br>        Because faggots who don't accept the truth get irritating  Who is this kid yall keep shopping into everything?  <br/>    <br>yo what movie is this girl from</br>    <br>the dark crystal</br>                  <br>Nigga yes they are. You're ignorant if you say you know anything about spirituality as fact. Atheism included</br>      <br>Isn't it obvious?</br>  <br>Because we're too new of a generation not to have come from obnoxious Christian families who piss us off with their religious nonsense at every get-together.</br>  <br>Don't listen to this asshole.

I mean I try to change their minds and that but it's like banging your head against a brick wall. It's annoying because we don't even need independence to do it, but we'll still have to wait for it so that we actually get a left-wing party that would consider legalising it</br>  reporting in fae turra  Not too long ago, Scottish chip shops used to sell single cigarettes to smoke while you wait for your fish supper to cook.

I know Nicola Sturgeon admitted to smoking it at uni but it's actually her that's anti-drugs. The majority of Scots are according to opinion polls too, but they also support the death penalty, and continue to oppose independence, so it's an uphill struggle for folk like you and me</br>  Fuck I'm late to the party, Stirling here what's happening boys?!  <br> I'm actually in the SNP as a member and that but they're really anti-drugs <br><br>A member in what respect?<br>You've went on the website and joined up like the other half a million people?<br>Fuck up bawbag<br><br> but we'll still have to wait for it so that we actually get a left-wing party that would consider legalising it <br><br>The fuck you on about?<br>The only reason we haven't already legalised green is because drug laws are strictly controlled by westminister.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I like England and want to stay in the United Kingdom but I'd say that people in the West of Scotland prefer the Irish more and people in the East of Scotland prefer the English more.</br>  <br>And which Jervi burd does that arse belong too?</br>  <br>Stirling?

That album is GOAT.</br>  <br>woo go anon</br>    <br>Kennichnich</br>    <br><br>Logic is one of the most humble people in the music industry.

I like Rise Against but their newer stuff is so hard for me to listen to. :\</br>      <br>Literally the worst album they made</br>  I think we have a winner.      <br>One of my favorites. Path of Totality is great too. I also really like Untitled.</br>  <br><br>Oh god why</br></br>  <br>fucking loved these guys in college</br>    <br>Yes.<br>If you're 12, and it's 1981.</br></br>  <br><br>rar's</br></br>    Beyond perfect  <br>a tip of the hat to you.</br>  Anyone able to find me the name of a band or album I've been looking for, for years. The album cover has the three teen band members giant and reflected on glass skyscrapers. They had a song with something to do with going under.  <br>Soooo, would you say... you only listen to Korn?</br>  <br>This</br>  <br>My man</br>  &lt;---  <br><br>literally the worst. so overrated. always put in the "elton john" category, and tht fuckwad doesn't even hold a candle to SIR elton.</br></br>    <br>Jar of Flies was an EP, rotten apple is a masterpiece though as was nutshell, I stay away and no excuses. Nice choice though.<br><br>Pic related is mine</br></br></br>  <br>This definitely</br>  this  <br>Joe's Garage- Frank Zappa</br>  <br>I don't care if this is b8 because its slipknot but this album has so many underrated songs</br>  <br>Bump. Help an anon relive his childhood</br>  <br>Actually if we're posting EPs I'm picking this one instead.</br>      You're all fucking plebeians.<br>This is the greatest album ever and none of you ignorant children will ever understand why.</br>  <br>UNDER PRESSURE!!! <br> MY NIGGER!!! </br></br>  <br><br>My nigga</br></br>    <br>You. I like you.</br>  <br>Bump again</br>  <br>just because i have old taste doesnt mean its bad. its a really solid album from start to finish. Listen to this album as well. Most people are newfags when it comea to Pink Floyd and know nothing, but once you really listen to their obscure albums you grow to like them, The Wall is not one of them.<br> <br>Great choices  <br><br><br>and this  if you actually like King Crimson. If you do check out Emerson, Lake, &amp; Palmer which is the trio Greg Lake went into after King Crimson. Awesome prog band if you ask me.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Indeed</br>  <br><br><br>You must be fucking old because I was about 13 when that album came out. It's when I had my first girlfriend. I remember listening to it on this school trip when this fucking cocksucking piece of shit stole my girl... cunt. It was my fault though because I hadn't made the move. Anyway, she eventually broke up with him and went to me. I was still a fucking pussy though. She is the one who asked me out.<br><br>Jesus Christ, it's over ten years later and I still don't have any balls. Isn't it fucking terrifying how your entire life just skips you by and you neglect the most important fucking goals - namely, growing fucking balls and getting a fucking girlfriend.</br></br></br></br></br>  nice band <br>great album<br>always loved the album cover art</br></br>  <br>Listen to more of his material and you'll get tired of it faster than you'd think.<br><br>Great album, wouldn't spend money on it though</br></br></br>  <br>damn this is crazy</br>  <br>Great album.<br><br>But this one is their masterpiece.</br></br></br>    <br>I listen to nu metal and EDM mostly.

Some beats really sound familiar (for example the intro sounds like Kanye West's - Bound 2, The beat on the Song now is just a slowed down version of Nguzunguzu's Sicko cell which is left uncredited, etc.) <br><br>A Lot of his flows are really similar to rappers like Kendrick, Childish Gambino and even Drake. <br><br>The first time I listened to the album I did think it was great but the more I listened to it, the more the lack of his own style started to annoy me.<br><br>I don't have an all time favorite album, my current favorite album is Donnie Trumpet &amp; The Social Experiment - Surf (big fan of Chance the Rapper) All the songs are so fresh on this album.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>b&amp;</br>  <br>autism</br>  <br>yeeee buddy, thoughts on latest album? <br><br><br>yeeeeee buddy wasn't overwhelmed by his new song though but good things to come i'm sure</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off nigger</br>  25525530<br>3025530</br>  <br>My nigga.<br>Madeon is fucking awesome</br></br>  <br>Really?

The shape of his dick (curved, straight, etc) can affect whether or not you get off, just because of the natural way your vag sits. A lot of girls cant even get off with vaginal penetration; the clit is pretty much the most important part of sex for us and it's usually ignored completely. That, or men rub that shit raw like they're beating their own meat. Da clit is a delicate thing. For uncircumcised men, imagine if I grabbed your dick, peeled back your foreskin vigorously, and started rubbing the head of your dick like I was getting a pool cue ready to play. You need to make sure that whatever is touching the clitty is moist to avoid too much friction. You need to start gently, and slowly progress into rubbing that shit, don't just give us the whole bag of candy all at once man, make us earn that shit. Moral of the story is, play with a woman's clit and everyone wins.</br></br>  <br>Oh yes you can. Wanna come over?</br>  <br>Thank God I can't feel your bonner.</br>  <br>I'm not the princess but your dick is the pea.</br>  <br> I have a bonner </br>  <br>Thanks</br>  <br>Nice , now i can compensate for my small dick</br>  <br>Feels like salty pennies.</br>  <br> a dick in a hole is a dick in a hole <br>Sounds like someone has been playing throw the hotdog down the hallway</br></br>  <br>its fake.<br>That thing was filmed for a documentary.</br></br>  <br>GoPro Pink</br>  <br> forgetting the bulb of vestibule </br>  <br>pic related</br>  <br>No no silly, read context. I'm referring to what I assume men feel when they have sex; either way it feels ok for the most part. <br><br> forgetting azuras star </br></br></br>  <br>Man here, I can dry orgasm and full orgasm. Most men can't cum without ejaculating, but I do it occasionally. That said, cumming without ejaculating is very slightly less enjoyable. Therefore, I assume being a woman means that they're orgasms are about only about 90% as good as men's.</br>  <br>So big dicks are bad, small dicks are bad. <br><br>Totally believe this. Everything has top be perfect when it comes to women and sex. Guys can get off with bowl of warm jello</br></br></br>  <br>You can't disable a rule.

If it hurts either of you during sex she needs to go to her gyno and get it fixed, because it's probably out of place.</br>  <br> forgetting staff of chaos </br>  <br>lol</br>  <br> bonner </br>  <br>except tits or gtfo is for attention whoring, newfag</br>  <br>Top right is from some shitty movie about online abduction ''Megan is Missing'' or some shit.

In my experience, they do bleed a lot as well.</br>  Clitoral stimulation feels like a gradual build up. We get off from super consistent motion. And unlike most dudes faster and harder isn't going to get us off clitorally.<br>Penetration feels like (for me) a light amount of pressure that feels pleasurable and sudden stabs of reallyreally nice pleasure when he thrusts in. <br> <br><br>I actually kind of enjoy it so probably.<br>It can hurt after a bit and I'll get irritated but at first it feels so fucking good<br><br><br>Don't feel the cum but I personally have high empathy levels so when my partner is cumming I tend to feel a lot of pleasure mentally.

So it can be short lived.<br><br>Whereas when a woman orgasms, everything clenches together, probably to prevent the sperm from flowing out again. And maybe that just needs to last a bit longer.<br><br>I guess, maybe, possibly. No expert.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well it kinda makes you want to have sex so there is that.</br>  <br>Yeah. Sure would be terrible for a woman to seek out sex, right? Not like pleasure for both parties would be beneficial at all. Nope. No way.</br>  <br>One would expect that it would lead to better bonding and the increased time spent in pleasure and with muscles contracting leads to a better chance at fertilization.</br>  <br>lel</br>  <br>if you fuck a woman hard enough she wont want anyone else and will always want your seed<br><br>thats evolutionary. some men are manlier than others and she'll prefer the manlier men that can fuck her better you stupid cuck.</br></br></br>    ask your girlfriends you fucking virgin faggots<br><br> oh wait, you're destined to get cucked by black men for the rest of your lives </br></br>  <br><br>haha "a man will fuck mud" - Lenny Bruce</br></br>  <br> oh no, no one believes me, better show this random guy my jiggly parts so I can find peace and closure <br><br>Hmmm, it depends. Kind of like you understand the universe for a split second. It feels like I get why love was the point of Interstellar. It feels like if you were on fire inside your body, but then your whole body is covered in Vicks vaporub and someone turned on an air conditioner and a water mister and told you that you are beautiful and that they bought you a puppy. You feel it not just in your taint, but in your whole body, in every cell and nerve ending, and even in every emotion and thought and feeling. Better than a male orgasm, if you do it right.<br><br> Forgetting baldurs gate </br></br></br></br></br>  I wonder if women ever wonder what it feels like for men to have sex. And just having a dick in general  The feeling is a bit similar to the one you have in your lips. <br><br>It feels nothing like sticking things in the ass.</br></br>  <br><br>I work in adult film and I agree completely.<br>It's even worse when you have a contract star who hears those complains and then gets the cords (which are apparently made of copper wire) trimmed, which just makes them sharper.</br></br></br>  <br>All the time.<br>Havign such a gigantic sensitive organ that thrusts into things must be awesome.<br><br>Sometimes I have dreams of having a penis and fucking dudes and chicks.</br></br></br></br>  <br>All the time man, all the time</br>  <br> It feels like I get why love was the point of Interstellar <br>Holy shit, I'm glad I wasn't born a stupid woman.</br></br>  <br><br>one theory holds that it is adaptation to gang banging, historically large number of fertilizations resulted from multiple males banging one female most likely involuntarily, so males had to come quick to allow for next male in line. there is a book about this called 'sperm wars'</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>lol that's awesome<br>Well yeah, it's pretty cool having a penis I guess.

Humor. Relax.<br><br>Boobs aren't great. They give serious back problems.</br></br></br>  Get your finger and press into the muscle posterior to your scrotum. Same sort of location, and I guess it feels like when your penis's shaft is pleasured.<br>For me it's nice, but I need more than that feeling to cum from it.</br>  <br><br>i've often wondered what it would feel like being a pubescent girl whose tits are just starting to grow then get really big, it must be a mind fucker</br></br>  <br>They do. Its one of those things girls like to ask about when youre both laying down, naked, and she is playing with your dick</br>  <br> as a sociobilogy fag, i have always wondered why evolution resulted in woman's orgasms taking longer and lasting longer and apparently more intense, whereas men's are much shorter and less intense. there must be some survival value to the asymmetry, but what is it? <br><br>There are different kinds of orgasms. The clitoris is basically the penis (just look at the genitals of a fetus in the stages of self-differentiation if you don't believe me [lol cp]), so stimulus produces an orgasm that feels similar in both: intense, short-duration, tiring and sensitizing. The vaginal skin is more or less the same nerve clusters as the skin of the testicles and the prostate, so for a male to feel something closer (not exactly, of course) to this sensation, they should have their testicle skin and prostate stimulated.<br><br>From personal experience, it is totally possible to have female-style penetrative orgasms, limb shaking and uncontrollable moaning/shouting, long and repeated in duration. If you can get past any squeamishness about the process and "into the mood", being well fucked in the ass can provide the right kind of stimulus. Get a suction cup dildo if you don't have a partner.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 10-20% of women can't reach orgasm at all <br>I highly doubt that.</br></br>  <br>That just sounds uncomfortable and painful.</br>  <br>Right, I've heard that. I guess now that I think about it they must get a little uncomfortable because of bras. That would definitely suck</br>  <br>Enormous mind fuck m8</br>  <br><br>good points, but just deepens the mystery</br></br>  What feels good is the clenching so like when you get turned on enough during sex you'll start clenching (contractions) and the penetration adds to that because it makes the clenching feel tighter. When you come is when the contractions build up and and for 5 ish seconds they come a lot all really close to each other and then they slow down and eventually stop after like 15 seconds. The contractions feel kinda like an intense rushing/tight feeling in the opening and a few inches below the belly button  <br>hell yeah</br>  <br>It's true. But it's generally psychological/neurological. Their bodies are capable of producing the sensations that create orgasm in others. In a lot of cases, therapy can help with this.</br>  <br>bet no other 72 year old woman has a pussy that tight.</br>  <br>you are disabled</br>  <br>5% <br>of males are gay<br>so make sense of that, fagget</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>do women ever exclusively play with their boobs? i've heard of women orgasming from breast stimulation, but it doesn't seem to have caught on</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah. Costs a lot of money for a good bra, look up the Victoria secret website. Only girls with A cups can buy a bra from target or something. Plus the straps leave huge indentations on your shoulders, depending on how big they are and how small you are. Also fuck up your posture which causes other problems.</br>  <br>See now, I've often heard this but it seems like bullshit. How long do you typically fuck yourself in the ass for to achieve a female style orgasm?</br>  <br>I do when I masturbate.<br>Also during sex I feel so strongly that I wish my boobs were touched.</br></br>  <br>truly a good bra and comfortable shoes are the most valuable clothing items a girl can own</br>  <br><br>that is one amazing story, 'the first year was pretty painful' good god almighty</br></br>  ITT: virgins who watched 1/2 episode of Dr Phil and now think they are sexperts with quadruple Ph Ds  <br>It's *possible* to have orgasms just from visual stimulation. There are even cases of people who have spontaneous orgasms throughout the day, which can be something of a curse. For most people orgasm will require genital stimulation, though.</br>  <br>this is where we've been going wrong the whole time. fuck, anon, you're a genious.</br>  <br>Those and a good vibrator. When I'm on my period and my man is working the night; I just want to get off fast and repeatedly. Only gets used once a month but makes the mood swings bearable for both of us.</br>  <br>Some girls yes. Not all, sadly. Even so, we just say that shit to make you feel good though. Not in a bad way either, it's just hard to explain the female orgasm. Girls like to do things and fake things to show they enjoy you and the experience. If a girl was really a bitch, she'd make you think that her inability to come to a full climax is your fault. But I digress. Nipple play is always appreciated but not always enough.<br><br>Fucking truth<br><br>Fucking double truth</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>indeed m8</br>  <br>Fuck , how come was this so funny.</br>  <br>So help 'em out, don't make fun of 'em. We were all ignorant about sex at one time, and accurate information is kept hard to come by.</br>  <br> a good bra and comfortable shoes are the most valuable... <br>Then why do they all wear shoes that give them blisters, pinch their feet and toes and shorten their achilles?</br></br>  <br>Wow.<br><br>Well, alright, one more thing. Is it true that girls sort of, well "fight", or no not fight. Like, how guys are more confident when their penis is larger than another's, is it the same with girls but with their breasts? I always thought it was something that women did but if what you're saying is true than that wouldn't make much sense. If I were a girl with smaller or normal sized boobs and saw a girl with really big ones I'd probably feel slightly bad for her I guess. So anyways, do girls do that with their boobs?</br></br></br>   thread with mostly men <br> full of pics <br> thread with mostly women <br> WORDS WORDS WORDS <br><br>Good lord, you fucking whores can't even STFU on the god damn net.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It is very fucking hard to find a shoe that actualy fits a foot.</br>  <br>You are literally the only one here that has any problem with that</br>  <br>because you just learned about the sun at your elementary school and you can relate to it</br>  <br>Nigga how do you explain how something feels with pictures</br>  <br>Well, we men seem to manage.</br>  <br>here is a picture you babbling illiterate faggot is it better now?</br>  <br>Because men's clothing is actualy functional<br>women's clothing is fucking retarded with<br> pockets that cant fit shit <br> material that dissolves after 3 washing <br> shoes that make your feet hurt after 10 minutes of walking but look "cute" </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>tits or gtfo</br>  <br> the god damn net <br> net </br></br>  <br>faggot clearly doesnt understand evolution</br>  <br>porch monkey isn't a racist word anymore<br>Didn't you hear?

When your partner can feel it, it usually means there is an issue with the IUD itself. She should go to the doctors to have it repositioned because sometimes they slip and can even come all the way out. It could be because I use the softer Merina IUD as opposed to the copper.</br>  <br>wat</br>  <br>Best analogy:<br><br> if you wanna know what having a dick inside your vagina is like then think of what a dick would feel like inside YOUR ass (regardless of sexual orientation) <br><br>-you want to be lubed up (wet) before inserting<br>-you dont want to just shove something in there super fast without giving your muscles some time to relax and allow the dick inside you<br>-once its in, you're really just massaging the "sweet spot"<br>-It feels good while it's in there, you arent cumming but it is definitely pleasurable <br>-eventually you get that "oh god oh god im cumming" and you explode into orgasm<br><br><br>Also, women get energized from orgasms... so give her a few before finishing yourself.<br><br><br>Oh and find the clitoris.. that is sensitive as fuck.. you know that place on your dick that you stroke while youre cumming because that specific spot is causing tons of pleasure? yeah she has that spot too, so hit that hard when shes cumming</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You can't let one dumb bitch speak for all women idiot. But heels can be comfortable if you're willing to spend money. The shape of the heel helps to perk out your chest and ass, forcing you to have better posture than you might naturally have with huge tits.<br><br>Breast size has nothing to do with personality. You call men beta for caring about their dick size too much instead of just having the confidence to be a normal person. You can find something to be insecure about no matter what you do, that isn't something attributed to just one gender. People suck in general. But your last comment is true. Girls think boobs are feminine and pretty yeah, but we feel bad for women who have enormous chests yes.<br><br>Did you seriously just walk into a hospital and angrily ask why there are so many sick people?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I know what you mean, man. I'm completely straight but I love taking dick up the ass, sucking cock, fucking guys' assholes, and also the sight of a woman naked repulses me.</br>  <br>the peen in vag is fake<br>I've seen the whole vid, it's actually the guy's foreskin</br></br>  <br>Dick in vagina feels NOTHING like dick in ass.</br>  <br>Honestly, OP, sex for a woman is a pretty different experience for a woman. To keep it short though you could safely compare it to a bag of sand.</br>  <br>if it aided reproduction in any significant way the ones who could would spread their orgasm genes more than the ones that couldn't and therefore over the hundreds of thousands of years that hominids have existed the percentage of women that couldn't would have waned and the genes responsible for female orgasms would be the only ones left.<br><br>What don't I understand nigger?</br></br></br>  <br>Set up the ship.

Feel bad now.</br>  <br>Oh, alright. And well, I guess I didn't really mean it like that although I do know that caring about dick size way too much is retarded and I know a lot of guys do it but I think I meant more like, do girls ever compare or get jelous of other girls' breast sizes? At least when they're younger and developing? <br><br>I feel like a bit of a creep but I'm honestly just curious.</br></br></br>    <br> thats the analogy they give at Ivy League schools. <br>I dont know why, but made me giggle</br></br>    <br>How fucking complicated is it to pull a piece of metal from an U shaped clasp.<br><br>You have to be retarded.</br></br></br>  <br>durr</br>  Hey /b/, trying to remember the name of this old video from a few years ago.
