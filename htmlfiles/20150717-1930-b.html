[ Gender, Sex, and Sexuality: How It Actually Works<br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<wbr><br><br>Aight, let's start with sexuality. None of this pansexual, homosexual, metrosexual, furrysexual bullshit - it's two-dimensional, like political compasses. On one axis you have male/female - which typical phenotypical traits you're attracted to. So if you're turned on by super buff women, you'd get 'points' in each direction; same for traps and so on. The other axis is submissive/dominant - so if you're a dude and get turned on by traps, but only want to fuck them in their butt, then you'd be somewhere around the middle on the x-axis and towards the dominant end of the y-axis. Anything else is a mental issue - somewhere along the line, something got fucked up, so now you like kids or dogs. That's just not how it works.<br><br>The division between "sex" and "gender" is also bullshit. There are four possible biological genders: male, female, hermaphroditic, and asexual, with the last two being exceptionally rare. This gender is your sex; distinguishing between those two synonyms is just being pedantic with language. Anyone who says they're queer or agendered or whatever other bullshit nonsense are only perpetuating gender stereotypes - the only reason to distinguish what gender you are is to say "these are the stereotypes I adhere to". The only reason to "identify" as a "transwoman" is to give you an excuse to look like a woman when you have male genitalia - oh wait, that's perpetuating gender stereotypes, as in those things people complain about! Good job, dickweed!<br><br>Or, alternatively, these people could just be unable to cope with the fact they're not special snowflakes. Who knows.<br><br>  tl;dr - sexuality is a 2d compass, there are 4 sexes, gender is a self-perpetuating problem </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br>  Celeb thread cont.  <br>Heyyyyyyyy, all the photos I got have already been posted in other threads so yeah</br>      <br> celeb cunt <br>Fixed that for you</br></br>            <br>Rekt</br>    <br><br>webms are hotter anyway.</br></br>  <br>holy shit she's got skills</br>  <br>that is so fucking hot holy shit</br>  Metal thread.

So yea, imo they are. I really love their music.</br></br></br>  <br>Neurosis is cool until vocals. Are you local to the bay area?</br>  <br><br>Fucking roots and chaos ad is my fav but hey as long as we all like max Calvera I'm cool<br><br>Also I hate the black guy</br></br></br></br>  <br>The vocals are like the best part dude. And no I'm not, I'm from SoCal</br>  <br>I cant understand he sings, hes just a plain bad singer, but ill try those two again maybe</br>  <br>Not talkin shit about your music taste. Just wondering why RoS is in your god tier. I mean they're pretty gnarly but... Straight wankery all it is</br>  <br>That's a pretty random bunch you got there. You've got Sodom which is tuetonic German thrash, listing bands like vio-lence which is bay area thrash metal and violator is neo thrash. You're a guy that clicks the YouTube suggested videos. But that's cool I guess.</br>  Am a djentfag<br>Periphery<br>Veil of Maya<br>Animals as Leaders</br></br></br>  <br>What's this?</br>  They have cds?  <br>I like their lyrics and the polyrythmic lead. The whole spacey thing is great</br>  <br>Jeah i kinda do, i just click around till i find something i like, but i also listen so some big names like slayer Dio and black sabbath</br>  <br>Gris- Il était une forêt <br>Depressive black metal from Quebec, Canada. Deeply disturbing and beautiful shit.</br></br>  <br>Don't understand how people actually enjoy Periphery</br>  <br>Anyone here wanna recommend some angry edgy depressing shit like dystopia? Or maybe acid bath but I hate the fuck out of the bands that people tend to associate them with</br>  <br>This this this this this</br>  So someone into Gojira? And also hating the latest album, l'enfant sauvage is shit  <br>Djent with (mostly) clean vocals.<br>I'm not too big on only harsh vocals, but that's me.</br></br>  <br> Trivium. Rings of Saturn. Nile(judge me idgaf). ..umm.. trying to only list MY god tier metal. Uhh.. Steel Panther (hair metal, still metal). Metallica. Aaaaand.. hm..

I'm honestly only in this thread to possibly expand to other subgenres of metal. But if there's anything particular you're looking for in thrash I can recommend you some.</br>  <br> Meshuggah  <br> Emperor  <br> Opeth  <br>I like you</br></br></br></br>  <br>Interloper?<br> inb4 heavily judged </br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=LVN<wbr>ifKDW6t8</wbr>  [ ]  How about Darkspace?<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=2YC<wbr>aXw3buvA</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Nice bit of thrash in there, forgot havok in my post</br>  <br>Hammerfall - At the end of the rainbow<br>Manowar - Carry on<br>Sabaton - Lifetime of War</br></br></br>  <br>TesseracT is my shit, bruh. Periphery is my favorite band.</br>  <br>Municipal Waste? Nothing gets me more pumped other than Andrew wk</br>  <br>shit man, BFMV ain't bad.<br>the only band anyone should be ashamed of for enjoying, is niggerback</br></br>  <br>Loser</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Cwe<wbr>ruxPv1Vc</wbr>  [ ]  <br>I looove BFMV, niggerback is my guilty pleasure</br>  <br>Name me some bands then, id appreciate that, i however do not so much like more extreme vocals like in death, of bio cancer</br>  <br>Periphery</br>  Some Fallujah. The Faceless, Necrophagist, and The Contortionist are really good as well. Also, the new Between the Buried and Me album is fucking amazing.  real metal coming through.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=nDq<wbr>aTXqCN-Q</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>I listen to mostly big name thrash, can you recommend some smaller groups?</br>  reposting from other thread-<br><br>Amorphis (Eclipse - Skyforger are high point, they changed style at Eclipse)<br>Kamelot<br>Sonata Arctica (mostly the album Silence)<br>Eluveitie (album Slania, haven't listened to much else)<br>Haggard (album Eppur si Muove, same as above)<br>Blaze Bailey has some great songs, Stare at the Sun is Angry Metal Guy's favorite ever and Born as a Stranger, God of Speed, and Watching the Night Sky all come to mind as awesome.<br><br>I can't believe I almost forgot Blind Guardian! Nightfall on Middle-earth is supposed to be their best.<br><br>Amorphis is amazing, they used to be death metal, but then they largely dropped the death growls in most of their songs. But they kept the whole instruments-before-the-vocalist aesthetic, so there's absolutely nothing like them.<br><br>- c'mon, you black people, there gotta be somebody who likes power metal out there.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Used to listen to metal for years, not I really can't stand it apart from some black metal.  <br>Rather watch stevie T make fun of metalcore than listen to Periphery. Gonna see them in sept since they decided they wanted to be one of the headlines at my cities festival... Not looking forward to it</br>  <br>S-sorry.</br>  <br>Thats fucking djent you shit, im asking for thrash</br>  I do enjoy Darchon's ambient tracks:<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=64j<wbr>LXqCer04</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=NBP<wbr>S_B2f_P4</wbr>  [ ]  <br>Sabaton?<br>I haven't listened to too much Power Metal.</br></br>  wow wheres all the fucking slammers?  <br>I must spread my Djent Cancer wherever I can.</br>  <br>I'm very picky about my power metal. Kamelot is one of my favorites and I really like Symphony X. Sonata Arctica is great too.</br>  <br><br>Check out some of these you dont know</br></br>  <br>This hurts. Hurts right in the heart. But to each their own, I'm not one to judge.</br>  Look guys it might sound guy that it matters, but I can't get into a band if the band looks like faggots. I can't handle it if it's way over produced and it's click pad breakdown bullshit but at the same time I want a lot of depth and a good variety of tempos and I like it fairly technical so shit like neoblack metal and deathmetal get repetitive with too much blast beats. But I'm looking for something new guys so if anyone has recommendations feel free  <br>You're not even the first person I've heard say pretty much exactly this. Why is it always black metal?</br>    <br><br>You forgot to mention Keldian<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=nUr<wbr>eKfeBGWk</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>    Anyone have embarrassing concert experiences? <br>I do.<br> Saw Chelsea Grin, Suicide Silence and The Black Dahlia Murder in one concert. <br>That itself is embarrassing.</br></br></br>  <br>Sabaton counts most definitely.<br><br><br>Yeah, I think me too, honestly? Symphony X's Paradise Lost is in-fucking-sane, but you couldn't just hand me random Helloween and expect me to like it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>O silly OP.<br>You forgot your apron on the way to work</br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=P3C<wbr>FLnYBXPU</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Hey, might end up liking em afterwards... Gotta keep an open mind when it comes t9 music</br>    <br>I dont understand how people endure these vocals, i absolutely love the instrumentals, bu<br>t them pig growls ugh</br></br>  <br>Absolutely true, /b/ro.</br>  <br>good choice/10</br>  <br><br>Ulver is the shit!<br><br>I'm personally more fond of Nattens Madrigal, but what's your favorite track?</br></br></br></br>      Been listening to Epica for almost a year. can't stop listening to them. over a 15 year span they have:<br><br>The Phantom Agony<br>Consign to oblivion<br>The Divine Conspiracy<br>Requiem for the Indifferent<br>and<br>The Quantum Engima<br><br>Any deviant bros out there listen to these guys? they made me have to start learning some Latin. way cool to learn about the origins of our languages - off point, sry</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Trips checked.</br></br>  <br><br>I dunno really, I still like hc punk too and the line between black metal and hc punk is pretty thin.<br>Some things just stick I guess.<br><br>But don't get me wrong, black metal like dimmu borgir, dark funeral, immortal and even marduk and dissection just makes me cringe.<br><br>Stuff like Svartsyn, funeral mist, watain and arckanum is still great imo.<br>Can't explain why.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Sepultura<br>Opeth<br>Pantera<br>Machine Head <br><br>I don't give a fuck about the rest <br><br>Oh wait lamb of God is good shit <br><br>Get that killidelphia live album<br><br>Also get the last tour on earth album by Manson that shit is my #1 live album</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you're looking for obscure thrash bands give me a location. You got rigor mortis and devastation from texas, you got bands like blind illusion from the bay area, d.a.m. from the uk. This is gonna be old school thrash. If you're looking for neothrash I got that too.</br>  <br>i dont actually listen to any of their later stuff, as for that album the whole thing is perfect from beginning to end, if i had to pick though id say the second track</br>    Finaly a thread that isnt filled with corefags  Anyone?  <br>Huh, I didn't realize they had a third album out. Never considered these guys *precisely* power metal, but you *did* predict my tastes exactly. Reaper was my favorite thing I had heard from them.</br>    <br>Mah nigga. Good shit bro. <br><br> inb4 you're luis or you heard it from luis </br></br></br>  <br>Metallica<br>Megadeth<br>Sodom<br>Slayer</br></br></br></br>    <br>All thrash is welcome <br>Exept death thrash, that not so much</br></br>    <br>Dont care anymore until they make a new album.</br>    So good    <br>dubs</br>   metal thread <br> no After The Burial </br>  <br> not choosing m16 <br>shame anon</br></br>  <br>Jeah i didnt live under a rock dude</br>    <br>idk i prefer the less polished sound</br>  <br><br>How far with the later stuff? Like the point where they started to get more into electronic ambient? Or just nothing beyond Bergtatt (Bergtatt is a damn good album either way). Every Ulver fan has a different place where they stop and pick up it seems</br></br>    Going to bed, metal bros.  Is atmospheric black metal bro here from yesterday?  <br><br>It's power metal enough. Still fun to listen to. Their third album might take a little bit to warm up to, but it's solid in my book.</br></br>  <br>Man, masquerade in blood is best album, or till death do us unite</br>  <br>The Faceless....
