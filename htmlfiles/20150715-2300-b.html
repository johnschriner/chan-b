It was around 30K USD, which may seem nuts for a Chinese watch, but western dual-axis tourbillon watches start at couple hundred grand and up, which is out of my range.<br><br>Inner axis orbit is 1 min and outer is hours.<br><br>The parts are properly polished, unlike typical Chinese mechanical watches. My trusted repair guy was actually impressed.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kek rekt</br>  <br>Also, it has minute repeater.</br>  <br>reverse rekt m8, it was b8</br>  Whats is the best watch I can get for $1,000?

If you have girly sized wrists the Tissot is fine and dandy. If, on the other hand, you have proper man sized wrists that Tissot will look quite small. Quite small indeed.</br>    <br>Diamond watch. Sorry, no pics.</br>  <br>Well, I'm actually a big watch collector, besides the Speedy I have several others, like pic related.<br><br><br> outer axis is hours <br>then that's not a real tourby. still, nice catch<br><br><br>my nigga</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>gr8 b8 r8 8/8</br>  Poor fag can only dream  <br> a real tourby <br>a real DOUBLE AXIS tourbillon<br> my bad </br></br></br>  <br> Poor fag can only dream <br>how much does that shit costs?</br></br>  <br>anyone who isnt morbidly obese would fit the tissot. The worst mistake you can make in wearing a watch is it being too big for your wrist. 40mm isnt too big for any size wrist, it is bordering too big for a normal mans wrist.

My gf's watch has exactly the same body, though the face is different and she has a metal band. The inside part of the body slides out and you can flip it around.<br>Her ex bought it for her, around 20k. I feel quite inadequate I can't afford a gift anywhere near that...</br></br>  <br><br>Thanks anon.

It's the only type of jewelry suitable for a straight man (in even formal occasions).</br>  <br>That "body", wich is properly name case, belong toa watch line called Reverso, made by Jaeger LeCoultre. Mine was around 20k, it has a worldtimer in the other face.</br>  <br>You'll understand when you group kiddo</br>  <br>I see then. I'll look for the vids</br>  <br>Do you honestly think anyone gives a fuck about your watch? The only people who care about watches are other "watch enthusiasts". The only people you can impress with a watch are other losers who care about watches. Pathetic</br>  <br>I give a fuck, as do a sizeable fraction of the rich executives I work with (how do you think I can afford a watch that costs several tens of thousands?). That's more than enough.</br>  <br> losers <br>several of this losers are rich powerful motherfuckers that dictate the very ways you live, and some ofthem are my friends because our mutual interest in horology. <br>You really need to grow up</br></br></br>  op here. The mvmt watch shown I wear everywhere work ect.....<br>I would like to purchase a nice watch for around 1k to wear while going off and such. Any suggestions?</br>  <br><br>Hold on there. The purpose of a random thread its precisely to speak about things you actually wouldn't care or nobody would care in your day-to-day life. <br><br>So yes? I find nothing wrong on talking about watches, even if l don't wear one.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I can honestly say I don't like any of these watches.<br><br>I'm not even just saying that -- your taste in watches fucking sucks.</br></br></br>   ended two wars <br> killed Osama Bin Laden <br> legalized gay marriage <br> affordable health care <br> cut unemployment in half </br></br></br></br>  <br>Did not legalize gay marriage, the supreme court did<br><br>Did not create affordable healthcare, just created forced healthcare<br><br>Did not kill Osama bin laden, the FBI did.<br><br>I'm a supporter of Obama, bUT don't try to glorify things he did not do.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> the FBI killed Osama <br><br>There's no way that anyone is this retarded</br></br></br>  <br>Doubled unemployment</br>  <br> FBI killed Bid Laden </br>  <br><br> forced healthcare <br> NO NO NO PLEASE DON'T TREAT ME FOR FREE WHEN I'M ILL NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OO</wbr> <br><br> the FBI killed Bin Laden <br> I'M A RETARD LOOK EVERYONE <br><br> inb4 trolled u so hard you fell for my ruse im not really a retard i just trollin </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> single healthy white male <br> $800 a month <br> affordable <br><br>Yeah, he did a great fucking job.</br></br></br></br></br>  his health care act is putting the country into more debt then every other president combined  <br>lol</br>  <br>Literally everthing you wrote was wrong</br>  <br> &gt; 8% in 01/09 <br> &gt; 5.3% in 06/15 <br> &gt;doubled <br><br>http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS1<wbr>4000000</wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>small dicked inbred teabilly located!</br>  <br> stole lots of money from Ee urope through banks. <br> gave Iran permission to nuke Israel </br></br>  <br>  ignoring how that's calculated </br>  <br>why? <br>are people more sick than before? <br>or did they, in the past, simply die when being a bit sick?</br></br></br>  <br><br> troops still in afghanistan and back in Iraq cuz isis <br> seal team 6 killed Bin Laden.

Trolled successfully. <br>I actually work in healthcare and yeah.. the affordable care act made quite a few people pay higher premiums. But it also required the insurance you bought be actually fucking good for something. So now (some) people pay (slightly) more and in exchange most peoples insurance isn't a complete fucking ripoff. <br>The industry response was to create a whole new set of plans, then send out big scare tactic letters telling people their old plan had been cancelled because OBAMACARE! If you were happy with your shit insurance that wouldn't actually cover you in an emergency, I can see why you're upset. I just don't care.</br></br></br>  <br> I can see why you're upset. I just don't care. <br>Contradiction: The Post<br><br> So now (most) people pay (alot) more and in exchange most people are completely fucked <br>ftfy</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;ended two wars <br> &gt;killed Osama Bin Laden <br> &gt;legalized gay marriage <br> &gt;affordable health care <br> &gt;cut unemployment in half <br><br>Still a negroid.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  I'm mad because the government isn't letting me pay for a scam anymore! <br><br>Most people don't pay more at all, they pay less. The few people that do pay more do so either because they had scam insurance before and now don't, or because they're still actively being scammed and haven't told any of the regulatory boards about it. <br>NAIC.org if you think you're actually getting ripped off.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Actually, it's more like I'm mad that my president is concerned with but "muh legacy" to the point where he ignores national security completely. I don't even give a flying fuck about the health care, it's a disaster, yeah. But that's a drop in the barrel</br>  You white folks don't want black people to rule because you know they'd do better.  <br> Literally allowed the rise of ISIS by pulling troops out of the Middle East. <br><br>The middle east will always be controlled by savages with ak47s if we're there or not. You cannot delivery democracy through the barrel of a gun.</br></br></br>  <br>See: Africa</br>  <br> No, highly trained Navy Seals did that <br>What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.</br></br>  <br>Ruled by white people. You are just proving my point.</br>   cut unemployment in half <br><br>Is this true?, I'm not amerifat so I don't really pay that much attention.</br></br>  <br>This might be one of the most ignorant, batshit retarded things I've ever read on this site. Before, they weren't all banding together and marching across the middle east, on a mission to kill all christians and infadels in the most brutal ways possible.</br>  <br>was Mid 5% before obama, spiked to mid to high 8%, slowly "getting lower" even though less people now have full time jobs.</br>  <br>Are you fucking 12 or do you have the memory of a goldfish? Where were you when Al-Qaeda was doing exactly what you just described?</br>  <br> We haven't left yet, and shit's worse than when we got there <br> Authorized an operation to capture him. Literally anyone would have done the exact same thing. <br> Supreme Court did, Obama had literally nothing to do with it <br> fake unemployment numbers. Even Dems are calling that shit out. </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>They're not doing that now either. ISIS are a tiny organisation, even Al Qaeda want fuck all to do with them.</br></br>  <br>It never happened to this extent. Not even close.<br><br><br>how are you so delusional? are you in france being cucked by muslims or something?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm sorry, but I didn't read south next to Africa in his post. Fuck off white guilt nigger wannabe.</br>  <br> It never happened to this extent. Not even close. <br><br>Yea so I'm pretty sure you've successfully killed one of my brain cells. Thanks a lot, asshole.</br></br></br>  <br>I wouldn't expect you to know what goes on in Africa... your soul lies in section 8 housing collecting welfare because you don't know how to lead a productive life.</br>  <br>Well, you can, you just have to be willing to inflict civilian casualties.</br>  <br>I'll take "Angry Liberals that can't come up with a Counter Argument" for 500, Alex.</br>  <br>Because replying with "it never happened to this extent" without anything to back such an asinine statement that is easily seen as bullshit by anyone older than 15 up , totally acts as perfectly fine Counter Argument.</br>  <br><br> People actually think the iran deal gives them nukes </br></br>  <br>The president is also known as the commander in chief. As in the head of the military, It's like giving a coach no props for having his team win a championship in sports</br>  <br><br> FBI <br><br>lol</br></br></br></br>  <br>More like the owner and yeah owners don't do shit other than pay everyone</br>  He just bombs civillians in other countries without warning instead and with next to zero oversight instead of invading them anon, that's at the very least no better than anything his predecessor did, and arguably way worse.<br><br>But nah, since yanks don't die, its not important right? Brown people don't count as casualties, so americans just don't care. Bush was a monster cos he got some americans killed in ground wars.
