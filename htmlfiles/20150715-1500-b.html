Natural selection is a myth.<br>Idiot.</br></br>  <br> in a area with widespread poverty, that may not be true. affording food and setting money aside for a child is very tasking <br>I suppose that makes sense.<br><br>Are arabs truly poor, though? I know it's hot and sandy over there, but I'm also thinking they must have a fuckload of oil money.</br></br></br></br>  <br> arab booty is proof of Allah </br>  <br>a few are rich the rest are slaves or living in sand huts</br>  <br>some middle eastern countries are riddled with poverty, but some are very well off like israel. <br>However an economy can be good but the wellness of life can still be shit</br></br>  <br>Have you ever actually been near Arab girls? The ones that actually wear hijabs? I have and let me tell you they fucking stink. No hygiene in the Middle East buddy with some rare urban exceptions. So underneath that hijab you have some rank unwashed unshaved disgusting girl thats probably never had a proper washing in her life.</br>  <br>Sandnigger hips will doom us all.</br>  <br>Cuz dey from da fertile crescent</br>  <br>sandnigger ? what are you 14?</br>  <br>Surprisingly appropriate comparison.</br>  <br><br>would camel jockey be better?</br></br>  <br>Why is her toe so much bigger than her big toe &gt;.&gt;</br>  <br>She got dat ultra morton's toe.</br>  <br>They have no clue buddy. They think all these latina or any other dark skinned girl that they use as arabs/muslims in porn are real arab women.</br>  <br>Because those shoes are uncomfy as fuck.</br>  <br>many, but not the best</br>  <br>Jew detected</br>  <br>I've heard about this. <br>Apparently perfume isn't a thing over there.</br></br>  african genetics - even some dudes have big asses    <br>I hear ya man. I only met one hot Arab girl in all my deployments. Cute little translator about 20 that worked for us. She was saving up to try to go to college back in the states. Wore western clothes and hated it there.</br>  <br>i prefer carpet pilot</br>  <br>Inbreeding</br>  <br>Some of the girls do use perfume but you always get a hint of them underneath. The guys wear extra heavy cologne but it only masks the scent that oozes out of their mandresses.</br>  <br><br> perfume isn't a thing over there <br><br>kek you fucking americans. i live in jordan and the standard of hygeine for most people is good. everyone uses perfume. fucking brainwashed little shits lool</br></br></br></br>  <br>So once upon a time arabs bred with niggers?</br>  <br>Think about that kid at school or some guy at work that doesn't wash and comes back in the next day wearing the same clothes that drowns themselves in axe. It doesn't smell good does it? It just smells like B.O and shit with axe</br>  <br>Lots of inbreeding. A lot of marriages in the middle east are cousin marriages. <br><br>http://www.independent.co.uk/news/w<wbr>orld/middle-east/firstcousin-marria<wbr>ges-come-under-scrutiny-7626995.htm<wbr>l</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Perfume isn't hygiene, retard.</br>  <br>sure thing, sandnigger</br>  those are childbearing hips  <br>HHNNNNGGGG dem Ankles!</br>  <br><br>So they can have more than 7 or 8 kids.</br></br>    <br>Its good by your standards. Now I've never been to Jordan so I cant say but I've been to Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, Turkey and Afghanistan. Perfume and Cologne were usually used as a cover up mostly. Most people in Western countries bathe at least once a day. In the Middle East in my experience if it was once a week outside the cities that was considered a lot. Just not a good water supply out in the boonies.</br>  <br><br><br>Sounds like arabs tend to have a fuckload of kids.</br></br></br>  <br>They do. Its also why they dont care as much about sending little muhammad out to blow himself up. Theres 8 more where he came from and thats just from your first wife.</br>  Sand nigger is racist!!! The proper term is dune coon  Dune Poon isn't bad.  <br>We alway just called them hajis. Yes I know what it really means.</br>  <br>Huh. So that's how they keep it up.</br>  I kinda have a Vietnam thing going on, after having been to Afghanistan, I've developed a huge want for dat arab puci.  <br>nice trips</br>  <br>show me more of this bitch! good god that ass is fucking awesome.</br>  <br> Dune Poon <br>Nice.</br></br>  <br>Aww sounds so kawai</br>  <br>Hohoho, this pleases me.

This nigga looks like a fucking muppet.  Youre a fucking jew dude. Tip the guy 10%. Why would you ask for a dollar back you fucking kike  If you cannot afford to tip you cannot afford to go out to eat, or receive any service that suggests a tip.  <br><br>They're workers, not beggars. If they're not happy with how much they make they should ask for a raise or find a better job.</br></br>  <br>They wouldnt have to if your cheap ass just tipped the certain amount needed to</br>  <br>Their job is to deliver pizza, the tip is earned with their behavior and demeanor while doing so.</br>  <br>How fat are you to order 48 bucks of pizza? If that's all toppings on one pizza then its going to be shitty as fuck</br>  Want a cheap meal, go to fucking McDonalds. <br><br>You're a fucking nigger, OP. Die in a fire. <br><br>Also, have some sage.</br></br></br></br>  No one should beg for a tip, but why the fuck did you have to call his manager, you fucking faggot? It was only a dollar.  Don't know about US but here in Holland there's no such thing as a tipping rule, it shouldn't be mandatory and it's rude to ask for it. A tip should be a reflection of the sum, the service and its appreciation. Also, if people really rely on their tips to get by, there is obviously a larger issue than people who don't tip..  <br> tip the certain amount needed <br>If I hand you a tip, no matter if it's 1 cent or 10 dollars. You say thanks sir, not "can I have more because i deserve it hurrdurr"</br></br>  <br>Where I come from people dont tip. It's weird to do so.</br>  <br>Because people who are waiters/delivery people in Holland, don't work for 1/3 minimum wage. They do here in the States. I lived in Europe, it's totally different for servers there.</br>  <br>Yes in my country it's not a rule either. We, employees, expect it and want it, but it's not mandatory and we don't ever mention it to the customers. They leave it because they want to, and that's how it should be everywhere</br>  <br>are you jewish</br>  <br>Go pick up your own god damn pizzas next time, you broke ass nigger.</br>  <br>i wondered that also. answer the question op you fat fuck</br>  <br>I dont know about that anon but you are certainly acting like an entitled jew to his money</br>  <br> being entitled to other peoples hard earned money </br>  <br>who the fuck orders 48 in pizza you fat slob</br>  <br><br>If all people thought like this then who would deliver your fucking pizza entitled neckbearded jew</br></br>  <br>Mediterranean fag here, works the same round here and most of mainland Europe too, I've been around a bit. <br><br>Generally the Mediterranean culture is to tip when good service has been delivered, it's very common in cafes. Not as much in the better restaurants since its assumed they make enough enough money to pay all employees well. Even so, occasionally people tip, particularly if its a group.<br><br>If someone asks for a tip I'd backhand them then speak to their manager. Its extremely poor conduct to ask for tip. If you didn't get its is because your service ranged from substandard to very average, don't push your luck. <br><br>I know in other countries it is impolite to tip. Japan for example is the total opposite, where tipping a waiter will be a direct insult but tipping a delivery boy is good. I'd tip a waiter any day if service is good, but never a delivery guy. Culture things.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm in cali and no matter what job the minimum is always 9.00$<br><br>I tip because it's whatever it makes them happy but at the same time I know I shouldn't have to. I kinda laugh inside when I look at them like a more entitled version of a man with a change cup. Either way it's no big deal, I feel like the same people that go full kike on the tipping argument are the same people that pull a Nigger fillibuster with the police instead of just dealing with it calmly and being on your way</br></br></br>   Order pizza <br> Guy comes to the door <br> Hands me pizza <br> I hand him the money <br> He holds his hand out and clears his through <br> Slap his hand <br> Close the door <br><br>Pizza dude is so cool. He gives me pizza and high fives.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> CA <br> Minimum wage is 9 dollars <br><br>It's 7.25 you liar.</br></br></br></br>  <br>How do you get paid even less than minimum wage if there is minimum wage? Or were you comparing this to another field of work, or country? In any case, they shouldn't blame costumers for not tipping, they should blame their employers for being greedy freedom americans (conscious lack of capitol, you gotta earn it)</br>  <br> lives in Cali <br> thinks that he lives in the normal US <br><br>Good call, wannabeeurofag/10000</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>$7.25 is the national, Cali has a higher state minimum.</br></br>   This whole thread <br>Good job OP 8/10</br>  <br>dont be a fat lazy piece of shit.<br><br>if you are that fucking cheap over a $1.29 get your ass in your car and drive to pick it up. Thats what I do, not because i'm not a piece of shit, but because i'm not lazy.</br></br></br>  I tip my pizza place only because they know my address and they know that I tip well when I get my shit fast. I never wait more than 25 minutes for my food. Every other place that I have no intention of returning to? Fuck them, no tip.  You faggots always argue the whole minimum wage shit everytime this type of thread pops up and demand the customers to pay you yet you lads don't mention the fact your own government are the real jews of the modern world lol I'll never understand you Americans  <br>It's $1.39, retard</br>  <br>Not when I applied recently. I moved to Nevada for 9.00.</br>  48$ on a pizza for yourself fucking landwhale  <br><br>Yeah, Ameriwill here. You should always tip if you're stateside, our wage system allows tipped workers to be paid less than minimum wage, which is already poppers pay. Businesses are supposed to make up the difference if the employee didn't make enough in tips for his or her wages to add up to min. wage, but most don't.</br></br>  <br><br> I moved to another state for $9.00 an hour </br></br>  <br>https://www.dir.ca.gov/iwc/MinimumW<wbr>ageHistory.htm<br><br>goes up to $10 next year</br></br></wbr></br>  <br><br>Chekdd</br></br>  Fear not, I have come to clear the vibrations of bait and faggotry.  <br>Do you even know what argument we're having?</br>  <br><br>White people should not try black humor.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, I used to make 15 at my old job. Job market got fucked in NorCal. Couldn't find work, don't have connections, so I had to move to Nevada with my aunt for a minimum wage job because Im desperate for work.</br>  <br><br>*tips fedora*</br></br>  <br>Not a jew, just someone who doesnt give money to pizza delivering fags with s shithead attitude who say they deserve a tip. Those are the greedy jews</br>  <br>OP It would have been more impressive if you made the price $18.71. No one fucking believes you, because you can't even bait a thread properly. You are a fag of the highest proportions.</br>  yo man i deliver pizzas i just show up at door with food, confirm address, get cash if needed (dominos have online shit u know), maybe a little chat, if they tip say thanks for the tip and enjoy, if not just enjoy and im on my merry way  <br>"Hey, it's an American!"<br> Makes fun of him for the affluence his country wields. <br><br>Jealous much?</br></br></br></br>  <br>really its gone up that much? when I started working at 17/18 it wasonly about $6 PA fag here</br>  <br>No one should do black humor. Black humor is fucking shit tier comedy and relies solely on poor grammar. Only niggers and teenage white bitches find it funny.</br>  Pizza delivery guys make 4.25 an hour while on the delivery. They put shitloads of miles on their cars and thus buy multiple cars every year. Not tipping a delivery driver is unacceptable. This, btw, coming from a manager at Papa Johns.  <br>Not a jew. just a guy who doesn't give money to a pizza delivering fag with a shitty attitude saying he deserves a tip.</br>  <br><br>Maybe your company should pay them a fair wage.</br></br>  this thread is my trigger  <br>Jesus what the fuck did you order? I can get a bill up to 30 at my local place and that is 2 big ass pizzas with like 8 toppings, wings, and a 2 liter.</br>  <br>Dont samefag, also, who the fuck made the thread about a guy complaining about his tip? You asshole. What did you fucking think? Another thing also, im not acting self entitled to your damn money, i couldnt give a shit about what you do with your goddamn money. I was only pointing out the fact, that maybe, just maybe you couldve tipped the guy a little more than a dollar and a couple of cents, because hey, he delivered your 50 fucking dollar pizza you cheap ass</br>  <br><br>Goddamnit I thought my first comment wasn't posted</br></br>  <br>Who gives a shit</br>  <br>Same here. It's kinda disrespect to tip someone here</br>  <br>Because it is inconceivable that multiple people would be eating that.</br>  <br><br>If they don't like it, they can quit. Or not take the job in the first place. Obviously.<br><br>A "fair" wage is whatever the market supports.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If delivery persons didn't bring your fat fucking lazy ass that shitty, unhealthy filth you consider food, your precious little pizzas would cost twice as much. Kill yourself you stingy, noncontributing faggot</br>  <br><br>Agreed. Tipped jobs are not a career, they are supposed to be temporary to get you some experience and then you get a real job while some other 16 year old takes your place.<br><br>If you're in a delivery job for more than a year you are doing something wrong.</br></br></br></br>  What faggots like OP don't realize is that the only reason people deliver food / serve in restaurants is the expected tips. <br><br>The same faggots that say "hurr durr your job should pay you more" are the same fags who would complain if their bill was 20% higher so the store could offset higher labor costs.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;628000000   <br>Entitled? All he did was ask you to reconsider you prick.</br>  <br>god if only your mother would have aborted you.<br><br>20 + 70 = 90<br>1 + 9 = 10<br>100 cents is $1<br>$1 + $1 he asked to give back + $48 = $50<br><br>Great bait. i replied. kek.<br><br><br>nice trips. here waiters and such may make $2.50 an hour. thats what i made. Our REAL income was tips. the 2.50 an hour basically covers taxes on your tips. I worked in a high end restaurant and a 100 a night was pretty common. cash.(i was a busser/backwaiter though, the real waiters make more in tips)<br><br>The concept is, the price of the food is subsidized. You tip on your service which pays for the people who provide it. its kinda like independent contracting. Your paying for your food to be cooked. and your tip is paying for your experience, service, and attention(they love when you bullshit with em). <br><br>I'd love to make $9 an hour on top of 100$+ in tips a night but thats just how it is. if they made a rule about minimum then the food prices for the customer would go up</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What kind of fat asshole eats $50 of pizza?<br><br>Jesus</br></br>  <br><br>You've never heard a black comedian in your life. And of course you don't appreciate humor. You're not funny.</br></br>  <br>The wage is based upon the assumption that most people are polite enough to tip their server who just drove miles to bring you a pizza. This, of course, is incorrect logic being that you are greedy bastards who can't spare 5$ after you just spent 50$ to stuff your fat ass full of pizza.</br>  <br>48 bucks? Sounds like 2 pizzas, shits expensive these days. Especially Papa Johns.</br>  <br><br>Plot twist: After he gave you the $1 back, you were going to give him a $20 bill for not complaining about his tip.</br></br>  <br>no its not</br>  <br>It's the tip structure here. Just deal with it. We don't have to justify ourselves to you, fucknuts.</br>  <br>i am retart, but not because of that.<br><br>not 1 + 1<br>op was basically tipping change. my simple retart math is right besides that last jewel of derpness</br></br></br></br>   'murica <br> tips are obligatory <br> mfw </br></br>  <br>Fucking moron<br>48.71 + 1.39<br>7 + 3 = 10<br>9 + 1 = 10<br>10 * 10 = 100 cents = 1 dollar<br><br>You must be a delivery boy with an education like that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  It's retarded not to tip. Those dudes will spit in your food. Fucking losers doing delivery have nothing to lose, trust me. Same with servers at restaurants.<br><br> treating the people who handle your food like shit <br> shiggy </br></br></br>  <br>Disregard any of the poorfags in this thread OP.<br><br>You're doing god's work.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Where I come from people dont tip. It's weird to do so. <br> Where I come from <br><br> Israel </br></br></br></br></br>  Also, like has been pointed out, if the servers or delivery drivers said "pay us more these assholes don't tip" your price would go up dramatically because of the offset.  <br>2 pizzas? <br><br>i got 2 medium from dominologist for 16 bucks. thats 6 fucking pizzas. I sure hope OP was having a party or somthing cuzzzz thats not healthy. 600lbs is apparently his mastarace weight.</br></br></br>  <br> your precious little pizzas would cost twice as much <br>It wouldn't be that much, but that is the way things should be. A guaranteed flat price and wage is easier for both customer and employee. Tips are stupid, at least for delivery.</br></br>  <br><br>How are they going to spit in my food if I pay for it AFTER they have given me the food?<br><br>CHECKMATE TIPFAGS</br></br></br></br>  <br>This, folks that don't tip are shit people b/c they always clamor on about "get a better job" and the minimum wage bullshit yet have no understanding of how the delivery industry works</br>  You fat fuck.  <br>they have to pay for their own gas and are repairs. (which are frequent if you're driving 8 hours a day)</br>  <br>You're not a repeat customer?</br>  <br>m8 if a dude cant fuken tip more than a dollar and a couple o cents who b de poorfeg, also op is a fatass who spent 50$ on shitty fast food</br>    <br> "some" pizza <br> total comes half of OPs weekly wages <br> American detected </br></br></br>  <br>i kekd. <br><br>thanks for the math lesson.</br></br></br>  is a bj an acceptable tip?  <br>Then no one will buy their overpriced shit and the executives will have give up their million-dollar raises every month.</br>  <br><br>Not at places I don't tip at.</br></br>  <br>I work at a pizza place as said and if a driver complains of a certain customer never tipping I fuck with their food every time they order.</br>  <br> if their bill was 20% higher so the store could offset higher labor costs. <br>Sounds much better than what we have nowadays. Why tip for a driver whose personality/attentiveness does not matter in the least? Just pay them a more accurate wage and add the extra to my bill.</br></br>  <br><br><br>And if I order only one every couples months? Like you're seriously going to remember every single fucking person who didn't tip? If you're so rain main smart with remembering shit how come you don't have a better job?</br></br></br>  I delivered pizzas for 3 years to make extra cash.<br>Not once did I ever ask for a tip. That's low class.<br>But I did remember who didn't. I would set those people at a lower priority than other customers.<br>Italians were the best tippers.<br>Niggers the worst.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You cheap son of a bitch</br>  <br>The thing is.. in a high end restaurant with rich dicks, if you have a good personality the tipping structure brings in more money than a minimum. <br><br>i guess, if thats the case you would still get tipped.. so fuck yea.</br></br></br>  <br>GO BACK TO 9GAG RETARD</br>  <br>I'm actually 19 and attending college which is why I don't have a "better job". Being paid 12$ an hour for doing basically one of the simplest jobs every is pretty damn good.</br>  <br> You tip on your service which pays for the people who provide it. <br>Doesn't sound bad for where service matters, but what the delivery driver does is irrelevant, unless they're intentionally trying to avoid getting to their destination or are breaking traffic laws in an attempt to get there as fast as possible.<br><br>Waiters etc - tips make at least some sense. Delivery drivers - tips do not make sense.</br></br></br></br>  FOR THOSE WHO DIDn't READ, GOOD JOB OP ON BAITING THESE MORONS<br><br>FOR NEWFAGS THAT Don't KNOW WHAT BAITING MEANS.<br><br>IT MEANS TO INTENTIONALLY SAY SOMETHING THAT CAUSES A NEGATIVE REACTION.<br><br>PLS STOP RESPONDING TO FAKE B8 THREAD <br><br>SINCERELY OLDFAG GENERAL</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>There you go. If you make so much without me tipping then no need to complain.</br></br>  <br><br>Mr. Pink I presume.</br></br>  <br><br>Nah. Not this guy.</br></br>  <br>Then they would hire the next unskilled labor applicant.</br>  <br>It doesn't affect me in the slightest, I'm simply stating that it's rude and ignorant of you to do so.</br>  <br>In a *restaurant*, sure.<br><br>For someone whose job is driving a car rather than servicing people for part of an hour? It's irrelevant.</br></br></br>  <br>CAN YOU TYPE EVEN MORE LIKE A FAGGOT? PRETTY PLEASE</br>  <br><br>It's not ignorant for me to save money on each order.</br></br>  <br>think about it. youre a highschool drop out that drives pizzas for a living.<br><br>your best part of the day is wasting every minute youre working, because the shit sucks.<br><br>atleast driving around you are not in a hot pizza smelling(shit gets old when around it everyday) kitchen. <br><br>I will take my marry fucking time. but with incentive.....</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I worked at jimmy john's for a bit and one day while bullshitting with two of the owners, we did the math on how much we would have to raise prices to pay everyone $8.00/hr. It came out to about $9 a sub, up from $4.79 -- a nearly 90% increase -- and that's for cold subs with no cook time at one of the busiest JJs in the US. Pizza prices would likely more than double.</br>  <br>If you wanted to save money you'd make it yourself ideally which would be better for you and less expensive but that would require skills and time spent somewhere other than your cp porn sites</br>  <br>This. I always pick up. It's like 2 blocks away. I used to tip the guy like 6 or 7$, one day i said fuck that I'll just go get it. Pizza is too fucking expensive anyway. The dough is like cents to make, they get a pillow case of cheese and garbage can full of sauce. They can make hundreds of pizzas for less than a dollar. Sell it for like 20$. 15 cents worth of meat for toppings - 2$ each. <br>  open pizza place <br>  make pizza for neckbeards <br>  profit. Not even any ?????s </br></br></br></br>  <br>Pizza niggers get paid minimum, so yea. they don't deserve 20% but..<br><br>still doesnt mean you can't throw em your low single digit change.</br></br></br>  <br>mfw dumb fuck children in this thread don't know shit about tipping.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=q_v<wbr>ivC7c_1k</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br><br>Everything is a balance. Some things I do myself, some I don't. The simple fact is paying more than I am required to is ignorant, plain and simple.</br></br>  <br>reported</br>  <br>You're using ignorant in the wrong context. To be ignorant is to be uninformed about something. When I said it is ignorant I assumed you didn't realize how rude it is not to tip but I see that is not the case you are simply a stupid faggot.</br>  <br>NO NEWFAGS KEEP RESPONDING TO BAIT<br>KILL YOURSELF FAGGOT</br></br>  Youre either a niggers or a jew.... either way fuck off you cheap piece of shit  These cheap jew bastards defending a dollar tip. Fucker used more gas than that. Die you cheap niggers.  <br>why should you pay the same amount to sit on your couch jerking off and having your food brought to you door as another guy who gets in his car, uses his own gas and time to go pick up his food? the food is one price. getting it hand delivered to you should cost more money. if you left your basement once in a while you'd know that pizza places aren't delivery only. a lot of people come and pick it up, or dine in the restaurant.</br>  <br>Hahaha this, we did this at pizza hut but for 7.25/hour, they said they would have to charge another 6 dollars per pizza</br>  <br> why should you pay the same amount to sit on your couch jerking off and having your food brought to you door as another guy who gets in his car, uses his own gas and time to go pick up his food? <br><br>Because I'm not required to. Simple as that. Also store charges a delivery fee.</br></br></br>  <br>If delivery time were directly correlated to the amount of effort made by the driver, that would make some sense, but I think there are too many other factors involved. Kitchen prep time (sometimes cooks are overloaded, sometimes not), traffic, unfamiliar roads, etc.<br><br>If a driver decides to slack off like that, it should be pretty easy for the employer to figure it out if it happens on at least a semi-regular basis. If someone consistently takes 25 minutes to deliver to a place other employees take only 15 minutes to get to, that's the red flag - and would be much better than the tip system.</br></br></br>  <br>You fell for the double bait. Everyone here knew it was bait and responded in a group effort to bait the "oldfag general". Older and wiser maybe, but not the wisest. And definitely not un-catchable.</br>  If you tip people, you are part of the problem.<br>Its a fucking retarded system, only found in shit tier countries.</br>  <br> 2 blocks away <br> deliver <br>???? ?????</br></br></br>    <br> Because I'm not required to <br>Yeah if you're okay with being the despicable faggot who doesn't tip. And the store charges a delivery fee - which goes straight into the register, not to the driver - because when the driver is on the road that's one less body in the store getting shit done. Jesus you're autistic as fuck, you should join us in the real world some time</br></br>  Because we waste our gas, put mile on our car, without being compensated by the restaurants we work for and its all for you to feed you lazy fat fucking face.    <br>However just like waiters their wages are terrible because tips actually make their salary over minimum wage</br>  <br> Yeah if you're okay with being the despicable faggot who doesn't tip. <br><br>I sleep soundly at night. I'm not responsible for their well being.</br></br></br>  <br>that's not me, but no, they don't notice. I've been doing it for a few summers now (college summer job). And when I get multiple orders, I take the worst tip last.</br>  <br><br>only two people itt who actually understand the problem</br></br>  <br> confirmed for only eating dominos pizza <br>a lot of places dont have delivery fees. and just because it isnt required doesn't mean you shouldn't do it. No one is forcing you to tip, but the fact that you dont speaks a lot about you as a person, hence why everyone thinks you're a cheap jew who should kill themselves. <br><br>if you can't afford to tip you shouldn't be buying out food anyways, its not economical. and if you can afford it, but just choose not to give the poor college kid a few extra bucks, which would probably mean a lot more to him than you, you are a stingy nigger.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah 2 blocks. Well i exaggerated, it's like almost 3.. but i still tipped. The chinese place too. I tipped that guy better. He'd stop at the store and pick up cigs or beer if we asked. That's how you earn big tips. Not asking for tips.</br>  I never tip anyone, I'm always a stiff. Why you ask? Because the degenerate in question signed a contract to work for less than minimum wage, if they don't cross it then the company has to make up the difference. <br><br> fuck them trying to pawn off labor costs on to me </br></br>  <br>Its not fucking being entitled to someones money any more than you're entitled to sit on your carless faggot ass and have someone bring food to you in their car. They're not sticking you for your shekels, theyre doing uou a favor so you SHOULD<br><br>Im a chinese food delivery boy and FUCK You. People who dont tip i keep on a list and I piss in their food next time they order. Fucking ahh</br></br></br>  <br> 48.71 <br>How much did you order?</br></br>  <br> Because I'm not required to <br>Yeah, that's the problem... what's so hard about just adding cost to cover fair wages instead of encouraging buyers to take advantage of the underpaid via optional tips?</br></br>  <br> theyre doing uou a favor <br><br>No, they are doing a paid job and expecting money in return. That is not a favor.</br></br></br>  <br>since stuffed crust.<br><br>People will go to war over stuffed crust pizza.</br></br></br>  <br>That labor cost is pawned off to you because YOU REQUIRED THAT LABOUR you fucko</br>  OP here. You fags got baited hard.  <br>Most delivery boys get paid min. wage, but they will take tips away from the check for tax reasons.</br>    <br>edgy as fuck m8 <br><br>i bet you listen to metal music and have long hair and a long beard too</br></br></br>  lol ITT: people who have no education trying to justify their shitty jobs  <br>The method of how you get the food isnt lumped in with the price of the fukin food, you also get a service of it being delivered. And you have the pleasure of deciding the amount, even $2 is good enough for &gt;5miles. Kike</br>  <br>I was thinking 2 large pizzas from Papa Johns<br><br>Thats what my family usually gets and it's around 50 bucks</br></br></br>  <br>It was great when i was underage. My mom would always wonder why we had a shit ton of boneless ribs in the fridge.</br>  <br>Their job is doing you that favor fucking fool</br>  <br>Oh i see, I thought you were a fatass shut in who couldnt walk 2 blocks to get a pizza. Its cool m8</br>  <br><br>I don't think you know what the word favor means.</br></br>  <br> you dont tip them <br> they barely make any money <br> they stop working there <br> places stop delivering <br> everyone on /b/ dies </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> needed to </br>  <br>OP...you are an asshole.</br>  <br>I actually am a delivery driver, and at my shop its 28 bucks for a large pizza and an order of wings. So 48 bucks is like a ton of food. Hell a sheet pizza and three orders of wings is only 35 here. Fuckin fatty</br>  why the fuck would I tip someone who's probably making more than me, minimum wage is 11 bucks here  <br>where the fuck do you live?<br><br>new orleans here. 2 large pizzas and a 2l of coke is like $20</br></br></br>  <br>48.71 + 1.39 = 50.10<br>You can't be this stupid.</br></br>  <br>lol</br>  Lots of drivers on here. Delivery seems to be the premiere incel job.  <br> want a cheap meal <br> cheap meal <br> pizza </br></br></br>  <br>Obviously you don't. <br>You order 20$ pie. <br>I get in my car, go from my job tht entails other things, bring you that food in my car with MY gas. <br>That's a favor</br></br></br></br>  <br>B8 doesn't work if it inspires a real conversation. You just fed the fish. Like an old man at the park throwing crumbs in the lake.</br>  <br> you don't tip them <br> they remember to spit in your food next time <br> you eat their spit </br></br></br>  <br><br>You are PAID to do that.</br></br>  <br>Mfw I'm paying for my education with said job</br>  <br> mfw girlfriend is a pizza delivery driver, sweet girl, and came over the other day just for a quickie on a delivery </br>   literally giving someone $50 to eat a box of greasy, sodium-soaked, high cholesterol garbage <br>I don't blame the kid for keeping the change he owed you. You 're the one who should be let go.</br>  <br>No, im paid to be at the restaurant hourly.</br>  <br>North Carolina<br><br>not joking</br></br></br>  <br>server here. only negroes leave absolutely no tip.</br>  4Chan too normal now<br>Fuck you and your tips faggot ass bitches</br>  <br> no, they don't notice <br>Employers timing delivery drivers sounds like it should be an easy and obvious thing to do, at least in 2015. I suppose the (less than efficient) drivers wouldn't like it, but it's a good way to figure out who's doing their job and who isn't.<br><br>Employer doesn't care...? Huh, their profits, their loss. Either way, it's not really an issue which is helped through tips.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Lol.. well that's understandable<br>  often judged by the company keep <br>  i'm on /b/ </br></br></br>  <br>nah but he does look like a muppet tho</br>    <br>/fit/</br>  <br><br> A delivery driver is paid to be at the restaurant <br><br>8/10. You got me.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well where we come from it is normal. What's your point?</br>  <br>almost 50 bucks in pizza. thank god the world will be rid of you soon diabetes having faggot</br>  <br>Theres three people that work at and own said restaurant. Me being one of them. We all deliver</br>  <br><br>An actually paid employee?<br><br>If every one of these kids and stoners actually developed integrity and refused to work for below min wage then this wouldn't be a problem</br></br></br></br>  <br>great m8 faggot <br> <br>God Hates fags<br> <br>if 1% this is the real deal. then GOd Hates niggers and you</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I get hourly fucking pay for working at my restaurant and I have to sometimes go on deliveries in my car. There's no extra for that. Its just a favor. Hence why I should be tipped.</br>  <br>*niggers</br>  <br>mmmmmmm... Zooey Baeschanel</br>  <br><br>I'm sure you're business is doing great<br><br> Hi I'd like to place an order for delivery <br> Sorry, that would be a favor so we aren't going to deliver now </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying kids and stoners qualify for jobs that aren't minimum wage </br>  <br><br>There's already a service charge for delivery. Not my fault they decided to pick a job that depends basically on welfare. What kind of dumbass does it take to apply for a position where half or more of your pay comes from little more than panhandling?</br></br>  If I'm not legally required to pay more than the bill for something I've bought, I'm not going to feel much shame in not paying extra.<br><br>Too bad for the delivery people, nothing against them personally. The tipping system just isn't good.</br></br>  <br>Youre literally fucking retarded. Have to be trolling me. We Fucking deliver it nobody makes mention but because we do you SHOULD</br>  <br>Bait aside, it's kinda true. I know being a delivery faggot is a shitty ass job, like really shitty. But they have a delivery fee they are paid. Tip them if you want/ have the extra cash and don't care, but there's no fucking obligation. It only gives them extra money which isn't a bad thing. I sometimes tip my delivery people, sometimes if I don't have enough money I just don't. They still get paid so who gives a shit.</br>  <br>Heres a tip, get a better job you fucking whiny cunt</br>  <br>THERE'S NO FUCKING SERVICE CHARGE</br>    <br> Hence why I should be tipped. <br><br>Yeah, by your manager. The person ordering the food didn't command you to bring them their food- that's an agreement between you and your manager.</br></br></br>  1st off, seen this pasta yesterday. 2nd off just wanna give my 2 cents.<br> work at pizza hut as a delivery driver in not the best part of town. <br> get paid $9/hr plus ~$1 per delivery. <br> hustle my ass off and get 20 deliveries done in a shift, get $20 in tips <br> roughly $15/hr for 6hrs. <br>Its the big picture. Guys who bitch about not gettin an individual tip are just whiny.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>AT MOST PLACES THERE IS.</br></br>  <br>timing is tracked, but I guess they don't care. My manager despises no-tippers himself because he often makes delivery runs when it gets too busy. It's probably similar everywhere else.</br>  <br> being this much of a jew <br> 2015 </br></br>  <br>I used to be a driver and to be honest man like we dont make anything most places dont pay per mile you drive and they pay you like 4 or 5 an hour while your driving. Tips honestly do make it or break it when it comes to bill day</br>  I tip the chinese food delivery guy good. I usually fig he deserves it after making it to my house without causing any accidents. An extra $1 for not hitting my mailbox, too  <br> What kind of dumbass does it take to apply for a position where half or more of your pay comes from little more than panhandling? <br>Well, at least, those who are better at panhandling than others have the potential to get paid significantly more than their less attractive / less interesting coworkers - a notable amount more than the minimum wage.<br><br>Not that tips are a good way of doing things, but there are some who benefit more than they lose from it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>no where in my city of 100K ppl.</br>  <br><br> 100k people <br><br>Ok well we are talking about real cities not BumHickVille in Nowheresville USA.</br></br></br></br>  <br>redneck</br>  <br>you do know that the federal government lets you write off 52 cents a mile for work on your taxes..</br>  <br><br>Of course he doesn't, he never finished high school.</br></br>  <br>Lol kekd hard at this under rated post</br>  <br>If they buy multiple cars a year it sounds like they're doing just fine to me or maybe they should stop buying shit cars? or maybe they should stop spending all of their money on cars. PROBLEM SOLVED.</br>  <br>sorry i didnt know you were talking about simcity.</br>  <br> &gt;being this much of a jew <br>For those who work hard for their money, why should they feel obligated to give away more of it when they've already paid for food and delivery charge? If they're not legally required to, there's no reason to care, or to personally give up more time / money just to satisfy an odd social custom.<br><br>The driver's welfare has nothing to do with them.</br></br></br></br>  ITT:<br>what is /b/'s favorite strain of weed?<br><br>Blue Dream, hands down<br>Blueberry Yum Yum second favorite<br><br>neither of these strains produce anxiety at all (in my experience), and i usually can't smoke cause of that</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Haven't smoked enough to have a favorite strain. On the other hand, when I smoke I can't hold it in because it feels like someone is forcing the fire of a million suns into my lungs...is this normal? My buddy said it's a mixture of "virgin lungs" and possibly some really dank weed... But I'm talking it literally feels like my lungs are starting to burn.  <br> blue dream <br><br>pleb</br></br></br>  Northern Lights #5 all the way  <br>You must shitty taste in weed.</br>  <br>If you are a rare smoker and using either a joint or a short pipe, the air will definitely feel hot and harsh. I guess that's what your friend means by "virgin lungs"</br>  My favorite is that one that gets you high.    <br>Weed is fucking weed. Strain names are all horseshit. All that matters is whether it's indica, sativa or a hybrid, and the THC content.<br><br>It's not like "lemon super OG haze" is gonna make you more couch locked and "sour diesel kush berries" is gonna make you laugh more.<br><br>Just fucking look at the THC content and shut the fuck up about strain names.</br></br></br></br></br>  My favorite strain is "weed" because it makes me high. Seriously, who gives a fuck what strain it is unless you're using it for medicinal purposes. You sound like a vapefag  <br>Correction, THC and CBD content. Because I know someone's bound to bring that up.</br>  <br>I'm using a 3.5in one-hitter</br>  <br> Strain names usually indicate the level of THC and indica or sativa <br>You sound like a fucking idiot</br></br>  <br>That's probably why... I'm not 100% sure how much of a difference it makes, but the weed smoke basically drives straight into your lungs without cooling down a lot. I remember using a one-hitter for a while and vaguely remember it being a lot more harsh than a pipe or bong.</br>  <br>If it indicates the THC content and blend right on the fucking packaging, who the fuck cares about the name</br>  <br>I agree. You stoner faggots need to get a life. Whatever you smoke is gonna get you baked, and stop caring so much about fucking weed go outside, workout get out of the negative cycle that weed gets you in.</br>  <br><br>Possible bad weed or bad lungs. Try other weed and a better filter. You can use one of a normal cigarette (might want to cut a bit off though).</br></br>  <br>I've only smoked twice, first real time being just yesterday honestly. My sister's one-hitter is 100x smoother than mine for some reason, but based on how incredibly hot mine gets after a couple hits I'm assuming that's the reason. I was suggested to just inhale and take a quick gulp of air afterwards to cool off the smoke in my lungs, so I guess I'll try that.<br><br>Also, I don't know how good my weed even is honestly. It looks like schwag, but it smells enough to stink up the entire floor of my apartment just by opening the bag, and my entire car in an unopened bag. It's also pretty sticky, but I know fuck-all about what makes weed good quality. As long as it gets me high I guess...</br></br></br>  <br>The one-hitter doesn't have a filter</br>  Grand daddy purp for days  <br>No, because the effects you get are somewhat dependent on the strain. For example, I could easily tell the difference between gods gift and some purp because god's gift gives me a certain type of sensation that I could never get with some purple kush. Not to mention the taste is entirely different.</br>  <br><br>Weed is like a wine. Like wine there are a lot of pretentious 'experts' making all kinds of idiotic claims about the taste, smell, that do not make any fucking sense. However, if you take the other extreme, like you do, you sound like an idiot who only knows white and red wine..</br></br>  <br>upload a pic you dumb motherfucker.</br>  <br>Well I like getting high as much as the next guy, but if "lemon kush" and "sour diesel" are both indicas with a THC content of 25%, it's literally the same shit. I just don't get it.</br>  <br>same thing for me. Not exactly sure what it was but I just know that it was good enough to get me high in one big hit and stoned in two.</br>  <br>If it's sticky and stinky it's safe to way it's probably good weed!</br>  I<br>I'd have to say lemon G</br>  <br>That's a good point. But if all I knew about wine is that it comes in red and white, chances are the only reason I'm drinking it is to relax and get mildly drunk, not appreciate the fucking taste and allure of the substance.</br>  Yea,i been growing almost 30 years now and the strain names are all shit and don't mean a thing..just a marketing scheme to the new kids on the block and nothing more.  <br>Sour diesel or purple.</br>  <br> sour d <br> indica <br><br>lmao no</br></br></br></br>  cheap ass commercial weed seeds can be some killer if you grow it right.  <br>This guy gets it<br><br>I belong to the 95% of the world that buys their weed illegally on the street. The one time I ever bought weed with a distinct strain, I bought an ounce of sour diesel from a buddy of mine. Literally the only thing the strain name reflected on was its smell. It smelled different than any other weed I've smoked.<br><br>But it got me just as high as any other nigger weed.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's not the fucking point, sperglord.</br>  <br>Cheese man</br>  <br> what's your favorite weed <br><br> cheese, dude </br></br></br>  More amber trichs you get couchlock effect,more on the cloudy clear side you get the heady high and this applies to any weed grown,some just show it more or less at different stages..the strain name has nothing to do with it.  Lemon kush is def my fav.<br>Made me giggle like a schoolgirl. And the taste is great. Most times <br><br>I wanna try white widow, never had it always heard good things.<br><br>Not a fan of diesel. Ny or sour.<br>too couchlock for me. Im too busy to couchlock for hours. I like the head highs, the body highs are only good if I need to pass out.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>well different weed kinda feels different man. I might feel more creative (like that feeling like your mind is racing randomly and your imagination goes on overdrive) on a specific type of strain if you get what I mean. Or the sensations you get are just different.</br>  <br>Like I said, looks like shit (in my opinion) but I'll be damned if this isn't the dankest smelling weed if ever smelled. Super sticky too.</br>  <br>sour diesel</br>  <br>My favorite strain/strains, hands down, would have to be<br> Blackberry Kush <br> Strawberry Cough <br> GSC <br><br>My dealer just got in some Bubba Kush that I'm gonna be trying tonight, with a free sack.<br><br>Also, 'sup, /b/ros? Stoner Bear, here. How you guys doing tonight?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think white widow is my favorite one j gets me ripped and usually it takes a couple bong rips</br>  <br>G13 and jack crossbreeds are pretty good too.</br>  <br>It all boils down to different THC/CBD ratios. Nothing more than that.</br>  <br>looks like someone hasn't tried medical grade weed</br>  <br>Has nothing to do with the strain though,the effect has to do with when it was harvested,the same plant can give you couchlock or made you speedy,just depends on the harvest window the grower uses.</br>  Kali Mist! It makes you want to build shit, like an Eiffel Tower out of popsicle sticks.  My favorites are the ones that work specifically for me. Everyones got one that works for them, key is to find it. My two that help me out are Blue Dream and Jack Herer.  <br>If by medical grade weed you mean high-thc weed, then yes, dumbass, I have.<br><br> no no no I mean weed that was grown by people wearing latex gloves </br></br></br>  <br>Obviously, he hasn't.<br><br>Off topic though, how you doin', /b/ro? You smokin' any green tonight?</br></br></br>  <br><br>No, growers who know the fucking origins of their plant. You moron.</br></br>  <br>I need to try this. Artistic kind of high, you mean? Or just a building type high?</br>  <br><br>don't listen to this dickhead.. only use roaches with spliffs not a fucking filter for fucks sake</br></br>  Kali Mist is a very artistic, creative high.  <br>I have grown random bagseed from weed that was garbage that has surpassed medical grade..it boils down to how it is grown..just about every strain has the potential to be medical grade and anyone that thinks different is only fooling themselves..i have grown way to much and learned a lot over the years..people get played for fools pretty dang hard.</br>  <br>but, you're wrong and I have over 40 cancer and neurological disorder patients that say different.<br>Strains do mean something. The name characterizes the contents...you're making a good point then slapping yourself by saying names don't matter....</br></br>  OG Kush is the only right answer. Not that pussy ass OG #18 indica bullshit  <br>A filter for weed? Nigga wat.<br><br><br>I'll be sure to ask my dealer about it, and if he can get some in. <br><br><br>It's like the faggots who say that labels are bad.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think if you're living outside of states like California, Washington, Colorado, you usually don't know what strain the weed you get is unless you grew it yourself.<br><br>Out on the East Coast and I've never had someone go "Oh I've got some Purple Bluegum Fucking Bubble OG Kush".</br></br></br>  I'm a big fan of Jack Herer and Durban Poison. I like them earthy and potent. But I can always go back to classic Purple Haze and Blue Dream. Hard to find decent shit in NW Indiana though. Hoosier government has their priorities fucked up.  <br>The thing is though the medical aspect is way overplayed,there is nothing special about the breeds they use over anything else..it is the growers that make it what it is..</br>  <br>They mostly aren't in medical states.</br>  <br> this strain I grew has ancestry in the original white widow strain. It gets you just as high as any weed on the street! maybe even more stoned! I call it lemon sour OG diesel granddaddy purple blueberry dream yum yum pineapple express haze </br>  <br>Please elaborate....</br>  <br><br>Who the fuck doesn't use a filter? Poor niggers who can't find paper/ want weed in their mouf. Pic related</br></br>  <br>Use that argument towards botanists...does it hold? No...there are different variations of the same plant.<br>Your lack of knowledge is showing.</br></br>  <br>faggot</br>  <br>So then why is it two indica strains can log in at the same THC/CBD ratio, yet provide different highs?<br><br>I'm waiting.</br></br></br>  <br>well at least it'd be easy to buy bud for you then since you wouldn't know shake from dro.</br>  <br><br>I live in a medical state and I've smoked several different strains of medical weed. I only ever noticed a slight difference in the high, and that difference was how high I got. I got more high on weed #1 than weed #2. Coincidentally, weed #1 had a significantly different THC-CBD ratio than weed #2.<br><br>I stand by my point, strain names are horseshit. The only way strains differ are by cannabinoid contents.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Im smoking some super sour diesel right now. Makes me really fucking horny.</br>  <br>Most of the commercial weed that goes around is actually very good shit,it was just grown in terrible conditions and if grown correctly will have the levels needed for medical use,not all but there is many that do as i have grown many plants over the years that would surprise the hell out of ya all just because it was done correctly...of course medical has to have some names to id what you are getting in percentages but it is way overplayed in the pricing game as one plant will grow just the same as the other..my main point,medical grade is just regular marijuana that is grown to it's maximum potential with light and nutes..it comes down to the grower,that is why medical outlets have their growers they stick with..</br>  <br>Different experiences alter your high.<br><br>It's the same reason an acid trip is different for everyone. You can't tell me it's because of different strains of ergot that the LSD was synthesized from.</br></br></br>  <br>Can Confirm.<br><br>Blue Dream is my shit, but Blue anything is usually a safe bet.</br></br></br>  <br> I only ever noticed a slight difference in the high, and that difference was how high I got. I got more high on weed #1 than weed #2. Coincidentally, weed #1 had a significantly different THC-CBD ratio than weed #2. <br>I didn't notice shit either until I started smoking more and paying attention.<br><br>Okay, you can keep your wrong views. I'm telling you as someone who is in the industry that you're wrong.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Some kind of Haze that floated around the greater NYC area from approx. 2003-2009; it had this musky, earthy taste that we knew as "grandma's basement". Haven't seen it in years.</br>  <br>You have only listed 2 chemicals in the plant makeup,there is much more that determines,length,type,effect etc..</br>  <br>lol its blueberry not blue</br>   there are named strains of weed   I've been a medical patient in Seattle, home of the best weed, for two years. Strains do matter, and different strains get you a different kind of high. Anyone who says otherwise just hasn't been exposed to tremendous amounts of different quality bud. <br>My favorites vary. Different harvests are different. In general, I love northern lights, black widow, and sour diesel. Girlscout cookies are up there too, along with OG Kush and sour kush. <br>Nowadays, all the medical and professional scenes really care about are Kush and Cookies.</br></br>  <br>To be honest I am probably full of shit, I don't know shit all about weed beyond street bud</br>  <br>your thinking of something different or the same thing by an altered name</br>  <br> there are so many strains that faggots will argue about them </br>  Orange Bud my cous is goodi<br><br> how do you hook up? </br></br>  <br>Obviously, but why would i spout out shit people don't understand.<br><br>most people on here probably don't even understand how cannabis works. You think they'd understand that?<br><br>no it's not.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>no whenever anything has blue in the name i.e blue cheese, blue dream, etc. all of those strains have blueberry in them not fucking blue wtf</br>  Some of my favs : <br><br>WiFi OG<br>Blackberry Kush<br>Mr. Nice Guy<br>91 Chemdawg<br>Snowcap<br>Planetary OGs<br>Skywalker OG<br>Grape Romulan</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>nice timestamp on your post m8</br>  <br>"blue" isn't a fucking strain. Blue dream and blueberry are</br>  Anyone mail weed or sell in PA? <br>danb2243@gmail.com I just moved here and I'm dying for bud</br>  <br>I aim to please</br>  <br>go up to any homeless person</br>  <br>like actual blueberry or the strain blueberry, like blueberry haze?</br>  <br>And every strain of Blueberry has a lineage of THai in it...everything these days is of a mixed lineage.</br>  cannabis  <br>blueberry the cannabis strain https://www.leafly.com/indica/blueb<wbr>erry</wbr></br>  <br>Correction : all that matters is the amount of active substances (mainly cannabinoids)</br>  <br>I was just saying that there's nothing called just "blue"</br>  <br>No there isn't....why would you neeed to make that point??</br>  <br>I hate people... idk</br>  so unless you buy from a dispensary, how do you know you're getting the weed your dealer is telling you you're getting?<br><br>I mean any nigger can just say "yeh brah, i got that super silver skunk haze glass slipper 78 special hyper-chronic" just to get you excited. <br><br>There are differences between the different strains, but I think it's fucking retarded that there are 1000 names for potentially the same strain. <br><br>can anyone tell me the REAL difference between smoking purple haze vs purple nurple? <br><br>what about skunk og vs super skunk? <br><br>they all get you stoned, they all make you laugh, they're all nice. <br><br>again, unless you work in a dispensary, you're a retard for making up some elaborate name for your weed</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ok, I gotcha. I've only ever heard it called Blue Dream.</br>  <br>Best weed is the stuff that comes from mexico.</br>  <br>bought a qrt oz of white widow and another qrt of liberty haze offline today for $120.<br>heres pic there is some good ass deals if you just look around . Dont get fucked though always check vendors ratings and feedback</br></br>  Blue Cheese. Blue dream is good,but nothing has given me as enjoyable of a high as blue cheese, and the taste makes my mouth water. Second would be a nice pure kush, mostly for looks and taste.  <br>Most favorite: White Rhino<br>Least favorite: Skunk or any kind of 'Laboratory weed'</br></br>  <br> There are differences between the different strains, but I think it's fucking retarded that there are 1000 names for potentially the same strain. <br>There aren't. That's the thing....<br> again, unless you work in a dispensary, you're a retard for making up some elaborate name for your weed <br><br>Lucky for you I co owned one for 4 years</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah but he meant the name having "blue" in it was a good indicator which means you're bringing up a moot point like an autist</br>  <br>looks guys i dont get it. Different weeds dont give me a different high like you guys talk about maybe subtle differences like getting higher off less . to me getting high is that. The taste and smell is what i like though .</br>  <br>what part of pa</br>  <br> There aren't. That's the thing.... <br><br><br>uhm, yes there are? I personally know several dealers that have gotten a seed in their weed, and then when they grow it, they give it a completely different name. <br><br>dispensaries aren't the only ones growin weed you know</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Some people are convinced different strains give you different highs. Which I think is a load of horseshit. I've been smoking weed for roughly 10 years now, all street level bud, all illegal, but from plenty of different sources in several different cities. The only difference I've ever noticed was a) the different high properties of indica and sativa blends, and b) how high I actually got relative to how much I smoked.<br><br>You can't tell me that every single bud I've ever smoked during those 10 years was the same strain.<br><br>This is no different in the medical marijuana industry. Obviously dispensaries are gonna promote their various strains, that's just business. But none of it ACTUALLY matters.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> . Different weeds dont give me a different high like you guys talk about maybe subtle differences like getting higher off less <br>How fucking hard is it to comprehend?<br>Sativa gives a head high, indica gives body, hybrids are both with a dominant side.</br></br></br>  <br>probably just badly cured weed. But yeah, if you have a lot of weed then it's obviously gunna stink up regardless of whether or not it's good shit.</br>  <br>See, when someone tells a budtender or anyone in the industry "oh well, I know this guy who is a dealer, etc and he says this/that." we laugh...<br><br>It doesn't mean shit. he probably got his info from some idiot too.</br></br></br>  <br>skywalker og kush <br>beautiful shit and white rhino</br></br>  <br>pink kush</br>  <br> 30 years </br>  <br>Hey fuck you dont know my body. All of that is bullshit.</br>  <br>Exactly. That's because slapping a name on your weed is just branding it. The only reason dispensaries associate a strain with a name is for marketing purposes.</br>  <br>so<br>fucking<br>much<br>this</br></br></br></br>  <br>Agreed. The perfect solution rather than stuffing a rank as fuck roach in your pocket. <br><br>WTF even smokes roaches anymore? We all know a 3rd gen joint smells like swass, tastes similar in flavor &amp; isn't going to get my 15 years of daily smoking any more ripped.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br> blue dream <br> not good </br></br></br></br>  Alaskan thunderfuck is the dankest shit out there  <br>Taste and memory</br>  <br><br>None of the names mean shit, that's my point. <br><br>Can you 100% genetically trace back the "blue dream" that's sold in a dispensary to the original "blue dream" plant? <br><br>If at any point in the dispensaries "blue dream" evolutionary time-line its ancestor bred with another strain, then guess what, it's not a true "blue dream", but something else. <br><br>Bud gets cross-bred all the time, the original "blue dream" could be on the verge of extinction, and nobody would know it because any retard can pick up a good looking bud and say "uh yeah, this is blue dream" and very few, if anyone, could tell the difference between the two</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fucking agreed<br><br>My favorite strain, nothing compares to the high ATF gave me</br></br></br>  Honestly names arent anything special if they arent grown or cured good.<br>but my favorite are Skywalker og and gods gift. <br>right now im smoking on some LSD og</br></br>  <br>I'm with you on the Blue Dream.

Medicinal marijuana is a scam to sell weed to stupid stoners. Its like the wine industry. If you drink a bottle of wine every day you're not an alcoholic, you're a sophisticated wine connoisseur. If you smoke weed for medical benefits, you're not a stupid stoner, you're "medical patient" and also a connoisseur of marijuana. How about you just smoke weed because you enjoy it and stop worrying about what strain supposedly does what, because none of them do anything special, and shut your stoner drug ass up  <br>You're right, but it's not like the indica/sativa balance of a specific strain gives you an entirely different range of effects than another strain does. Yes an indica dominant strain will have you couch-locked and a sativa dominant strain will have make you giddier and more active, but a specific strain isn't gonna make you more social, or more paranoid, or more in touch with God than any other strain. That's just not how it works.<br><br>You don't see people going around saying they got this new batch of cocaine that was significantly different in its effects than regular coke.</br></br></br>  <br>I just roll the jointl and then use an eyeglasses screwdriver or something similarly small and roll the mouth piece of the joint inward.
