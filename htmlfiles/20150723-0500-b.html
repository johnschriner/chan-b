It's a folder of very vanilla b <br>you're one off pents<br><br>dont listen to this guy.<br>It's not fucking hard to find otu accurate info. Just follow what I said, go google BMI calculators and go from there.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  http://iifym.com/tdee-calculator/<br><br> type in relevant information. <br><br> get result <br><br> eat 800 Cal less than TDEE <br><br> Profit. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I'm 5"8' and 130, I used to be 120.  OP here. BMI Calculator is saying my daily calorie goal to lose 2lbs a week should be:<br><br>1240 calories</br></br>  <br><br><br>According to that website and your "eat 800 Cal less than TDEE", I should be eating 1155 calories a day.</br></br></br>  <br>back to school mini maggot</br>  <br>You do understand that BMI is a statistical method meant to be used on a large sample and not individually?</br>  <br>you'er a shit cunt. stop providing people with false info. An hero asap please</br>  <br>i agree</br>  <br>just exercise more and eat 2000 kcal then.</br>  80% of what I eat, I make from scratch. How in the fuck am I supposed to count calories like that?  <br>Nigger BMI stands for body mass index. The healthy range is something like 18-24. You're thinking about BMR, which is Basal Metabolic Rate. Even still, that is not maintenance levels of caloric intake. That's how many calories your body expends by just existing. If you move at all during the day, you burn more calories than BMR. Educate yourself.</br>  5'8" 153 lbs. here. I lost over 30 lbs. in 2 months just by eating less than 1500 cal and exercising 4 times a week.  <br><br>Get a kitchen scale and a calculator m8.<br><br> "but muh time" <br><br>Losing weight takes time and dedication. It gets a lot easier after a while.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  40 year old soccer mums on weight watchers count calories. portion sizing like its so complicated, eat less potatos  <br>Alright its fucking early morning here cunt, ease up. BMR is what I meant. Plus, you don't need to take it so damn seriously, I dislike how everyone on the net takes everything to literally when it comes to every single damn number. I have managed to cut down very lean just by consciously eating healthy and doing quality cardio. And to counter your argument, you're meant to factor in the level of exercise you do into the BMR you receive. OP seems he cant do his research, and im not doing it for him either. I did state at the start to go from there. Fuck yourself</br>  <br><br>I have a scale. I usually buy meat in bulk, so I use it to portion it and freeze it to avoid waste.</br></br>  just remember: burning fat is burning fat. There's no cheating. You cant just burn your hips or your belly, so don't waste your time "targetting" those areas for any reason other than building a layer of muscle. <br><br>get into cooking and learn how to respect food.</br></br>  Stop caring about appearance and read a book. You're a male for fuck sakes.  <br>BMI is bullshit though. Body builders are considered obese by BMI standards. People have different body types.<br>Also<br> Nice satan trips </br></br></br>  <br>Download MyFitnessPal app on your phone.<br><br>You can literally scan the barcode on the package and you can set the number of servings of the food you're about to eat.<br><br>You can also manually enter in the food in the app and record calories that way</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>don't listen to this guy. If you want to lose weight, you should be counting calories. <br><br>and exercising 3+ times a week.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice of you to ignore my comment <br>BMI doesn't differentite between blubber and muscle.</br></br>  <br>But then it's not BMR, you moron. BMR is stable across activity levels. It's supposed to show what your body needs to burn in order to survive. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to realize if you exercise more and eat less, you'll weigh less. But you're the one asspained. It's okay son, I know those acronyms can be real tricky!</br>  Skip dinner. I'm serious. It's difficult at first (eat a banana or something, if you can't sleep). Get used to the feeling of being hungry, it's not as bad as it sounds. Eat well in the morning (I eat two eggs).<br><br>Also, get enough sleep, and move around (walk, bike, whatever).<br><br>Moderately starving your body is the way to go. Just don't do it all the time. :)</br></br></br></br>  <br> you should be counting calories. <br>Not really. Just stop browsing 4chan and take a walk or two.<br><br><br>*differentiate</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>again, fuck the specifics. Sometimes its better to not go all scientific, and use what generally works for the majority of the population. This is one of those times. <br><br>lol retard at it again, i stated that its the number that is required to keep at same body weight. I forgot to mention that you need to factor in the exercise level. I will not be reading any more of your responses, as I have now concluded you are a degenerate, and i dont feel like repeatingmyself 3x+ for degenrates.
