Nothing to be upset over except your own failings</br></br></br>  hey  <br>Exactly. And even then, I don't see why you could get mad at other people for it anyways.</br>  <br>Fluffing rekt</br>  <br>people usually get angry about the things that the other people do. which impacts the game for everyone</br>  y u heff 2 b med? is only gayme  <br>It was always his team's fault and never his own<br><br><br>Yeah, that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>check em<br><br>Yeah, I personally love playing competitive games like CS:GO, SC:2 and LoL, but man, when you realize how shit you really are, you're failings piss you off. But hey, you can only get better.</br></br></br>  <br>because you are trying to succeed at something, and then someone messes it all up</br>  <br>So he says. He's probably just making shitty plays.</br>  <br>you switched them</br>  <br>same<br><br>regardless, I just tell them better luck next time and try to keep team morale, if we lose then we lose. It's not that big of a deal imo.</br></br></br>  <br>I can only assume. But he hasn't been playing any video games in the past month or so and probably won't be for a long time</br>  <br>League of Lel</br>  <br>I'mma start on that hitler request fur you,but furst I have to tell this one guy I can't do his fetish request</br>  <br>Heh. Reminds me of my friend. He bitches about EVERYTHING that happens, and will even twist the truth when he starts to argue with you.<br><br>It is the best when I catch him on it. God, I love that.</br></br></br>  <br>Nice.<br><br>It's funny how a lot of people can make funny plays that work.<br><br>W-what? What Hitler request? I didn't request anything.<br><br> feelsgoodman.jpg </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>league/dota is just a waste of time tbh this coming from someone with 3,5k hours in dota.</br>    <br>That' schizo though</br>    <br>Thats more or less every game tbh, unless you are trying to go pro</br>  <br>I have no idea what you're talking about man.</br>  I think its time I go rustle up some dinner before I go to bed, even if it's only 7  <br>It's ok. I have 3K hours in CSGO.<br> Spent a few hundred hours in ESEA -.-<br><br>Only to give up videogames, and focus on my photography/graphic design oriented life.<br><br><br><br>It is, I used to play a lot. I would really fuck with people and main draven mid.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>true but i recently started playing figthing games and i feel like those are a bit less wasty of timey</br>  <br>it's not a waste if you enjoy the time</br>  <br>What rank did you get to on CS?</br>  <br>Nice.</br>  <br>Global Elite, even during the hackfest. Before they introduced the CZ that is. My esea RWS was kicked around in the 9-12 range. Not quite global but almost.</br>    <br>I used to main draven jng back before the jungle changes. Was pretty legit, too. Anything is possible in Bronze/Silver, though.</br>  <br>wow</br>  <br>Damn man. Props to you, I am currently floating round GNM and MG1.</br>    <br>wanna play some time<br>im GNM</br></br>      <br>Meh. I really don't play CS too often anymore, I mostly play LoL now. Would have to go through a hour or two of aim training before I got back in to the swing.</br>  <br>no worries</br>  <br>That was this chick said when she was like "wut r u rank"<br> I saed <br>"globl elit"<br>??? SHE'D WET ???<br><br><br>Danks mate. I quit CS after losing 2.5K USD on a gambling site.<br><br>I lost ;<br><br>Karambit Doppler P1<br>M9 Fade (Two of them)<br>AWP Dragon Lore<br>AK Fire Serpent MW<br>M4A1s Knight<br><br>To some bullshit. The site owner said it wasn't rigged. Although I did the checksum and ticket check for the round. I was supposed to win an extra 4.3K USD, but lost it to what I now believe was some rigged bullshit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>        <br>Damn dude, thats fucking harsh. all that combined is like 5x my inv lol</br>    <br>Yea, So I just kinda quit.

I'd wake up, and play aim maps for 2 hours. Go eat and shower.<br><br>Crack open an energy drink, aim maps for 25 more minutes.

The closest toilet was unisex. <br> I took the first stall and was utterly amazed when i saw that the door was a mirror from the bottom to the top. <br> I sit down and take out my phone to film my reflection which i consider to be funny. <br> Shit is pressing against my butthole but i keep it in a bit as it will be messy.  <br> Suddenly, the handle moves down and the door opens inwards. I'm startled and my butthole releases. <br> Behind the door appears a girl. She yells "Wow" and quickly closes the door. <br> I was so amazed by the mirror that i forgot to lock.  <br> Now i am rewatching that video i made on my phone. The first part is me making faces on toilet. The second part ist her, looking over me as she steps inside. As she sees me, her mouth opens slightly. She stares at me for four seconds as i spew muddy shit into the toilet. Overwhelmed by the sounds and smells, she steps out backwards. <br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/627167844#p627167844">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>post the video or you're a shitposter</br>   mentioning a video <br> not posting the video <br>kill yourself, my man</br></br>  <br>I get it...it's funny...</br>  roll you greek niggers  <br>How does it feel</br>  Roll  <br><br>White master race reporting in</br></br>  From another thread.
