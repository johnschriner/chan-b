She's incredibly beautiful and has the most alluring smile. Unless pushed she never has a bad word to say about anyone.<br><br>She's always looking to help and has a shoulder available for anyone who needs it. Little and less of the people who use it actually reciprocate that favor for her though. I always have time for her and for that she is grateful to me and I am her closest friend. We talk often and she tells me I mean a lot to her and she means a lot to me.<br><br>I met her while I was on vacation so we live far away. I will be visiting her for 9 days at the end of the month. The last few months have been a bit rough for her so on the last night I will be taking her to a $350 dinner and dancing afterwards, it will be a special surprise. Officially we are not going as a couple but we both have feeling for eachother although neither of us will admit to it. At the moment we live too far away for it to work out so we are friends....for now.<br><br>She's one of the most intelligent women I have ever met, perhaps the most so. I hope to have a future with her one day but those hopes are years away. Until then I will be biding my time building my rapport as her "friend" (though we see though eachothers disguises.)<br><br>Anything else you'd like to know?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>dooood, same here</br>  <br>she is a cruel mistress to be sure.</br>  Bethany.  pic is wrong i was thinking on drawing a monkey<br><br>girls are not that hard to forget faggots</br></br>  Trips, my one true love  hort is love, hort is lyfe  <br>Kek.

With the field I work and study in, of the two largest cities in the world for my profession one of them is hers. So in the next ~2 years I'm going to be looking to relocate to her city. Sorry if that sounds a bit vague, I'm trying not to give out too many personal details on the very off chance she, or someone she know, will read this.</br></br></br></br>  <br> that's sweet and given the context of this thread - heartbreaking too.

A woman's studies degree give you absolutely no right to argue about a field she knows nothing about. If she as really concerned with the men to woman ratio then she should have gone STEM and made a difference. My guess is she was just too retarded to pull it off.</br>  <br>because she's complaining about lack of women in STEM as though there's some societal problem when she's an example of why woman aren't in STEM; because they choose not to be. <br><br>Of course, that's obvious and if you couldn't get that you're either retarded or a troll.</br></br></br>  <br> Patriarchy hernandes </br>  <br><br>my point was she was baited and took it like a moron...</br></br>  <br>ohmysides</br>  <br> your </br>  <br>that was cool</br>  <br>She plays online with the nickname "Based Mom".</br>  <br>Tumblerina/Reddit/feminazi detected.</br>    <br>So basicly we got a man with real hard data vs. bitch who says how she feels things happen...</br>  <br>He should never have had to apologise, especially when he was just after achieving what will probably be the defining moment of his life</br>  <br> and you sound exactly like the partiarchy to me <br><br>HUE HUE HUE blew it<br><br>There's dumb feminists and there's even dumber feminists.<br>That's the whole spectrum.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's a really sad response when someone points out your grammar faults. <br>Enjoy summer, kid.

I‚Äôll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I‚Äôve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I‚Äôm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You‚Äôre fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that‚Äôs just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little ‚Äúclever‚Äù comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn‚Äôt, you didn‚Äôt, and now you‚Äôre paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it.
