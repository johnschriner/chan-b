I'd definitely like to read more. I've only got two pieces of advice. <br><br>First, always write a story in the past tense ("I felt the space", rather than "I feel the space"). You are telling something that happened, not narrating as it is happening now. <br><br>Second, that little bit about why you chose the pseudonym at the beginning is a pretty bad run-on sentence. Either change it or dump it. It's unnecessary and is kind of a turn-off right at the beginning. <br><br>Keep up the good work though and be sure to post it to /b/</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;&gt;ATTENTIONWHORING FAGGOTRY&lt;&lt;&lt; <br><br> &gt;&gt;ATTENTIONWHORING FAGGOTRY&lt;&lt;&lt; <br><br> &gt;&gt;ATTENTIONWHORING FAGGOTRY&lt;&lt;&lt; <br><br> &gt;&gt;ATTENTIONWHORING FAGGOTRY&lt;&lt;&lt; <br><br> &gt;&gt;ATTENTIONWHORING FAGGOTRY&lt;&lt;&lt; </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ill change it for sure.

Not my fault you've been clinging to the attentionwhoring threads for 2 years because all you'll ever be known for is a poorly written story only a 4channer could enjoy.</br>  <br>Poorly written or not. It was extremely entertaining</br>  <br>I wonder where he is now</br>  <br>If you're a faggot or a woman (the only groups that read erotic stories).</br>  <br>I'm not Pete, Pete died in May, you heartless cunt</br>  <br>He made this thread. He makes them occasionally so he can get praised by the circlejerkers who used to beat /b/ over the head with threads only a handful of people cared about.</br>  <br>Yes that might be true.

Contributing to cult of personality threads on an anonymous board simply because you're so lonely and pathetic you'll latch onto anything you can to circlejerk over so you can pretend you have friends and aren't the completely broken human being everyone, including yourself, knows you are. I'm just trying to educate you and you're predictably getting defensive so you won't have acknowledge your problem.</br>  <br>anyone remember when OP wasn't a faggot</br>  <br> so lonely and pathetic you'll latch onto anything you can to circlejerk over so you can pretend you have friends <br><br><br>Married with 2 kids, thanks, and please never change, you're HILARIOUS</br></br></br></br>  Does anyone have aan update on Ben?<br><br>Ben is love, Ben is life!</br></br>  <br>And I'm sure those kids are going to be winners with a dad who surfs 4chan and circlejerks over poorly written incest stories.

The other choices are retard choices, reserved for fucking level ten retards. <br><br>Good for you if you can fly into a female toilet and jack off at 300 mph, but that isn't thinking about your future is it?<br><br>also check em</br></br></br></br></br>    Easy choice,go green because imitating animals means flying or humans for identity theft monies and shape shifting to younger forms when old means immortality,sorted!  <br>Red button: End Islam<br>BONUS: there are a lot of muslim nigger too, so it helps reduce the nigger population as well!</br></br>            What's hotter: girls in bikinis or one piece bathing suits?    <br>i strongly agree<br><br>bikinis = degenerate</br></br></br>  <br>I always thought bikinis were the best. Then I came to the realisation, that women with bikinis tend to look 'sluttish'. A one-piece has a sense of classiness that a bikini just can't accomplish.</br>  <br><br>You guys into landwhales or what? Figured the one-piece covering her flabby belly was the reason</br></br>  <br>flabby belly?</br>  <br>Shes got a bit too around her ribs. Could use to lose a few pounds.</br>  <br>Fat women wear bikinis as well...</br>  <br>covering it up with the shorts now</br>  <br><br>riiight</br></br>  <br>exactly nig</br>  <br><br>But don't you see? The one-piece she only tried on in the changing room, but knew that only fat landwhales wear them.<br>The bikini on the other hand, she wore outside. So she prefers the bikinin. (because she is thin)</br></br></br>  Even better. Girls in racist bikinis  <br>That style of bikini = confirmed anal on the first date</br>  <br>ya give 'em an inch....</br>  <br>and they'll beg for the other 5 inches</br>  <br>... and they'll take a mile.</br>  Micro bikinis            <br>wtf does this girl have like a twin sister or something that pretty fucking sweet</br>  <br>u wot m8</br>  <br> bikinis <br>for teens<br><br> one piece <br>for lolis</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah bro that's totally not a mirror</br>  <br>That bait tho</br>  <br> does this girl have like a twin sister or something <br> have a twin sister <br> twin sister <br>no way. my sides.</br></br></br></br>  Depends on the girl.<br>Some rock a bikini<br>Some are MILFs with stretchmarks that a 1 pc covers but they are still fucking hot as hell<br>js</br></br></br>  <br>And then there are some legendary Milfs who can still rock the bikini</br>  <br>you dense idiot</br>  <br>I was literally just at the beach an hour ago and I thoroughly agree.<br><br>I'm not sure if me jerking off to the memory is too pathetic even for me</br></br></br>  Monokinis are the hottest<br>They get my cock so hard</br>  <br> other 5 inches <br> total 6 inch <br>topkek my friend</br></br></br>  Depends on the girl. Depends on the swimsuit. One pieces leave more to the imagination though, which is sometimes nice.    <br>Why not both?</br>    <br>Now I'm sad...</br>  <br>Did not think I was going to see my pizza again so soon.</br>  <br>Sweet Jesus fuck me silly</br>    <br>it must be terrible to not have a penis</br>  You can only fuck one girl for the rest of your life, who is it?  <br>your mom<br><br>also check em</br></br></br>  I am proud of this man, what about /b/? what are your thoughts  <br>Goes to show at the end of the day, every nigger is terrible.</br>  <br>nigs gonna nig</br>  631 Islip ny  <br>Is that all??</br>    <br>Thanks anon</br></blockquote>]
