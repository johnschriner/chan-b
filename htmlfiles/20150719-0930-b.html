A dog will bite you if you kick it in the head<br>- See picture<br>- False<br>- Depends on if it's an indoor/outdoor cat. At least you dont have to let it outside every few hours once it starts whining.<br>- Kittens are playful. Both cats AND dogs become less playful the older they get.<br>- You don't need to.<br>- I don't get how barking = fun when all dog owners I know yell at their dogs to shut up once they start barking.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>get a persian mate, mine slept altost all day, but when she wasnt sleeping kept me nice company</br>  <br>10/10 would snuggle</br>  <br>yeah, i heard that before, thanks man, will think about</br>  <br>d'aww</br>  <br>Then you'll have 6, 7, 8, 20, and you'll be a crazy cat person that smells like piss</br>  Another one of these since it 404'd before I finished?    <br>mfw op is me, exept gta 5 should be jc3 and tf2 should be the sims 2</br>  This game.
