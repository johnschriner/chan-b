I just gets direct deposited every month.<br><br>Right now I just play video games all day.<br><br>Wife makes $800/Month also.<br><br>What would you do or recommend?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  play more games  <br>how?</br>  <br>how'd you manage to do that OP?<br><br>I recommend writing a book or making some music, both are chill things to do. Also get a gym membership</br></br></br>  <br>this</br>  1500 a month? That's only 18k a year that's fucking shit. Even illegals can make more than that. If that was all I got you bet your ass I'd get a job I am not going to survive on barely minimum wage alone  <br>I would enjoy staying retarded just as you OP, and your pic.</br>  <br> my rent alone is $1600 </br>  <br>Where do you live that 1500$ is enough?<br><br>My rent alone is 1000</br></br></br>  <br>That's like welfare-tier income. I pay more than that on a mortgage. I am 25.</br>  26 and I get $4500 every month for doing literally nothing other than continuing to exist.<br><br>Life is nice.</br></br>  I would get off welfare and get a job  <br>Still well above minimum wage + full time employment.</br>  OP is whats wrong with this country.. Thread Dead. Bye  <br>I smoke weed and play video games. <br>Eat expensive meals and drink liqour you people can't drink everyday.</br></br>  OP, I would take that $1500/mnth and invest in a roth IRA for a real retirement, then go get a real fucking job.<br><br>Btw, with how our money has inflated in the past 30 yrs $1500 won't buy a loaf of bread in 2045. <br><br>You'll end up dying in a cat infested trailer, like any other piece of shit that thinks $1500/mnth is a lot of money. And my taxes will go towards the government cheese to compliment your bread.<br><br>Get a real fucking job.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  travel to foreign lands and creampie tons of women  <br>You're not retired, you're on some benefits that are paid for by tax payers.<br><br>Secondly, $1500 a month is poverty level income. I'd still have to work.</br></br></br>  The income isn't from any type of welfare. :P<br><br>I get the need to flame but it really doesn't add to the conversation because my income honestly has nothing to do with welfare..<br><br>My rent is around $500 and I live in a nice rural area.</br></br></br></br>  <br>So explain, because you don't magically get $1500 a month for the rest of your life.<br><br>Just think, if you worked and actually invested that money you could live very comfortably, but instead you'd rather be lazy and play video games all day.</br></br></br>  <br> 500 a month <br> nice <br><br><br>Kiddo. My fucking rent is 1550, you're homeless</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>if you owned a house, or lived in Mexico.<br>probably invest in some apartments I have real good investment ideas, but they are in Mexico you can make it to the big leagues also nothing illegal.</br></br>  <br>Right? Who has $500 a month for rent, especially when you count utilities. He's living with someone.</br>  <br>Move to another country where the currency is at least 3 to 1. 1500 a mo ain't shit.</br>  <br>yeah spliting rent with some stranger, probably.<br>over here rent alone is 1500 - 2000</br></br>  <br>My rent here in NYC is $7k a month. So I'm gonna keep working. lmao</br>  Where do you guys live where rent is so high?  <br>I would get a job that I would really enjoy so that I can wake up excited every morning and do stuff.<br>I would read a lot of books, learn new things, progress my career, learn to invest, have a family, do shit together.<br>Forget the games. They'll depress you and make you really unhappy in he long run.</br></br></br>  I built my self a nice PC, have a nice car, and a nice apartment. I don't understand why some of you say homeless &gt;.&lt;<br><br>The area I live in average rent is $700. I live near a college. I just got lucky with the move in deal. <br><br>My wife and I live on our own.</br></br></br></br>  <br>How the fuck do u live? Food, real food to buy and cook at home, bills rent/mortgage, car, etc costs money, not being a welfare piece of shit and actually working /living, you can't do shit on 1500$ if u want a life. If ur a welfare piece of shit with no aspirations, then that's plenty of money i assume.</br>  <br><br>Yeah my rent here in LA is 10k but I hardly work. LOL RICH PARENTS</br></br>  <br>NYC bruh</br>  <br>You don't have anything nice, because $1500 a month is nothing. Maybe at 20 years old you think that's a lot of money, but it's not. I couldn't live on $1500.<br><br>And you still haven't explained HOW you're getting this free money every month.</br></br></br>  $1500 is less than half what my country would give to the unemployed.<br><br>I think I'd get a career, and a life.</br></br>  1500 is not very much money. I'd still do some sorta work for supplemental income, something I really loved doing.  <br>I never had parents. good for you fam</br>  <br>  apartment <br>  rural area </br></br>  I would have to move to some third world shit-hole where $1500 a month wasn't below the poverty line  <br>OP must be native American</br>  <br> calling bullshit <br><br>My work put me up in eighth &amp; grand as I'm on site for a job for the next few months. This is literally one of the most expensive locations in downtown to rent.<br><br>It's still only $4500. Nice try though kid.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>lol my mortgage is 535 a month, includes taxes and homeowner's insurance.<br><br>2 bed 1.5 bath, 2 story with a loft, open floor plan, largest back yard in the neighborhood.</br></br></br>  <br>That alright Bruce, good luck with the Bat Cave. <br><br>Rich parents are the worst.<br>  TFW no family bonds <br> TFW I feel like i'll never accomplish what they did <br> TFW entitled piece of shit <br><br>Its not all that great.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> $7k a month <br>trips can't lie</br></br>  <br>Basically nothing I guess, I'm only on like £7.80 an hour, which at the end of the month comes to more than $1500. So I wouldn't even bother retiring, life would be fucking terrible.</br>  <br>Why?</br>  Not OP, but I get $1650 a month from being medically separated from the Marine Corps after 5 years. I could easily live off of it if not for the huge amount of debt I have. Also I'm 25  <br>Doesn't matter what you think honestly</br>  <br>My rent is $200 a month. Utilities minimal, maybe $15 per month. Three-bedroom condo, two bathrooms, right on the beach in Baja. NYC is a fool's dream.</br>  <br>welfare</br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br> got called on bullshit <br><br>There's only three more expensive places to rent in LA. Name it and you might be credible but we both know you're not.</br></br></br>  Retire kek. Sounds more like disability you autistic faggot.  <br>$1500 a month? id get a job</br>  I make 1600 monthly and only use about 750 a month rest go's into savings and that's with rent utility's and a 2014 dodge dart  <br>Because OP hasn't answered how he's "retired" at 20 and collecting $1500 a month and just sits on his ass playing video games all day, it's clearly some aid that he's receiving.<br><br>What really sad is he thinks somehow that's enough to live on for the rest of his life.</br></br></br>  <br>60 % Disability for military m8? Or are you just a crazy person on disability?</br>  I get 1300 a month and its a nice relief of I lose a job or get in a tight spot financially I know I won't be homeless but I'm still pretty miserable without the income from a job. It is kinda nice to be able to take a summer off with only a few months worth of savings and spend all summer going to the beech and all be comfortable financially    <br>Military doesn't do that shit OP is a bull shitter, just wanting to start a thread. Op most likely basement dweller. <br><br>Am i mad at OP? Nope. Its nice to have threads that are not stale pasta for once.</br></br></br>  <br> What is Jersey Shore <br> What is Coney Island <br> What is New England <br>with $2.75 I can take a train to go to the nearest beach. I need my seasons too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>$200 a month?<br>education there must be shit.</br></br>  <br>finish university<br>pay back my parents<br>then enroll again at university and study all the other stuff i'd like to learn, but without stress</br></br></br>  <br> throwing 7k out the window every month to live in an overcrowded shithole <br><br>the peak of retardation</br></br></br>  <br>On 1500? Like they say money on the first broke on the third.<br><br><br>I would keep working. Probaly work part time till my kids are in school. Full time when they go to school. Put all that money back, save for the future. Always advance your life when you can.</br></br></br></br>  I buy what I want and we end up with a decent amount in savings at the end of the month.<br><br>I'm not going to divulge the source.<br><br>The responses are odd because everywhere I've ever lived it hasn't costed a lot to live there.<br><br>Those of you with the high rent amounts must live in big cities or something?<br><br><br>I've got a nice gaming pc with a 1440p monitor, seeing as that's what I enjoy doing I spent a little extra there. <br><br>I don't have a ton of hobbies so a lot of my income gets saved in bank. I'm just not sure what I can do with the extra to maybe turn it into more.<br><br>I was thinking about traveling country to country or something seeing Europe.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wouldn't live somewhere that costs that much.</br>  <br>I have some student loans to pay back but this is what I was looking at also for the most part.</br>  <br>Then travel while u can. Dont waste it in front of a tv. Go experience life/other places AVOID places that are in states of civil unrest. <br><br>Good luck cheers may the Buddha smile down upon you</br></br></br>  <br>I'm not spending 20% or more of my income in my rent (10.5% percent). I live near my work. It's literally a 5 minute walk.</br>  <br><br>It's just scary making the jump to do that. <br>I think about<br><br>1. How do I use my money there?<br>2.If I have to convert currency multiple times through different countries; will I take a lose at times.<br>3.What if it ends up costing too much at one point and we end up getting stuck somewhere.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>If it's more than 30% of your monthly income (I don't even spend more than 20% for my rent) then don't.</br>  <br>Autism</br>  <br>Enough with this faggot retarded forced "meme".</br>  <br>I must admit I don't quite understand that.<br>I've seen in on /x/ otherwise I'm lost with that one.</br></br>  <br>Lmao I hope you are fucking b8 kid. VA disability is for real.</br>  <br>you can move to india and retire in that country for like $400. You'll live like a king for the rest of your life for as little as $1500</br>  <br>Thats why you do research. Keep a burner wallet with minimum cash like 5 bucks, keep money/id strapped to body, they sell them at stores and walmart. Its like a flat travel wallet that you can clip around your body. <br>Dont obviously wear tight shirts /oull out the secret wallet in public. <br><br>Just a precaution. <br><br>Research into where u go/currency exchange. In Europe most parts are great exchange in our benefit. For example a big bag of ruffles chips is normally like 4-5$? In store... There its 0.25¢... Like thats dirty cheap. 80$ a night at a Gucci gucci hotel, penthouse suite in the city capital.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Use a fraction to gift me on steam!!!<br>id/skilledbarrett<br><br>[W]<br>cs go knife (never had -.-)<br>ark<br>gta5</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>My mortgage is $1900 per month. So I'd be getting another job.</br></br>  I'm 23 and make 1700 a month and it's still not enough.<br><br>I'd probably find a roommate and chill</br></br>  <br>What expensive meals and exclusive liquor could you buy with 1500 a fucking month? Thats 50 dollars a day before clothing, housing, water, electricity etc.</br>  <br> Still well above minimum wage <br><br>Um no? $10hour * 40hrs per week * 52 weeks in a year / 12 months is $1733 ... that's less than minimum wage.</br></br></br>  beat meat sleep repeat  <br> forgot pic. it will be $10 in cali this jan ... it's 9 now.</br>  <br>So what you're saying is you have no friends, no ambition, no skills and never go outside?</br>  <br>recommend getting a job? you<br> weeaboo who the fuck is satisfied with 1500 a month? <br>what was your previous job? being a fucking hobo? jeusus crhist this isnt the 1800 go earn some real money and live life</br></br></br>  <br>7.25 USD is federal minimum wage.<br>and still even at 10 USD you forgot to take out taxes champ.</br></br>  <br>you're hilarious</br>  <br>I almost make that in a week bub get a degree and get a job</br>  $1,500 a month is enough to live comfortably on in most areas given you don't go out and buy a new car and end up with a car that costs you $600 a month to legally keep on the road (car note + insurance).<br><br>With that being said, I'd start writing books and I'd invest a small portion of my money in stocks and try to turn that into profits.<br><br>People who claim $1,500 a month isn't enough to live off of you need to lower your standards. Move out of that two story house with that den and basement and rent yourself a small 1-2 bedroom house or apartment.<br><br>I rent a very nice 1 bedroom apartment for $510 a month. My electric bill runs $70 a month, water and gas is $45 a month, cell phone is $55 a month, internet/cable bill is $162 a month and insurance is $64 a month.<br><br>Cook at home. Don't run out to Longhorn or some other fancy restaurant every time you want to eat. Cook meals that you can eat off of for 2 days and your money goes a lot further.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>go kill yourself because your a failure. I earn 1500 in 2days</br>  <br>ty</br>  <br>I have to work ~350h to make $1,5k where I live. And my job is supposed to be considerably well paid...</br>  <br>get lost, hobo.<br>i earn twice that in under 5 seconds.</br></br>  <br><br><br>that depends on op's income, is the $1500 his takehome or before tax?</br></br></br>  <br>shit nigger i was being modest, i acually earn that in -5 seconds</br>  <br> makes under 20k a year <br> posts pictures of cash on 4chan thinking he's wealthy <br><br>Sage</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hey chief,<br><br>Just had to move out of my ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT that cost $1,028 per month and it wasn't even in a big city. It was the cheapest option at the time I was looking and I moved, by the way.<br><br>Between gas for the car to get to work, food for the month, and insurance and utility bills I paid at MINIMUM $1700 per month.<br><br>I'm 120lbs skinny as fuck, don't overeat, and conserve on utilities.<br><br>I've searched far and wide, and the CHEAPEST apartment I could find in the middle of fucking nowhere (like literally a 3 hour commute to work ONE WAY) was $800 without utilities. I would waste more on gas to get to work.<br><br>So yeah, this shit isn't right.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Also I wanted to add:<br><br>I only eat bulk rice, cheap chicken, and occasionally vegetables. Partially due to food allergies, partially due to money constraint. That shit is cheap as fuck. Most people couldn't get by on that.</br></br></br>  <br>And I have zero student debt. Car is paid off. Literally no debt.</br>  <br>Where I live (just outside of lexington ky), you can buy your own 2 br house for 80k or so and have about a $400 house payment. The people renting out the places do so to make money.

The only people who think he's worth voting for are idiots who think "Speaks his mind" means "intelligent". They don't realize that every time he speaks his mind, all that comes out is diarrhea and curdled horse cum</br>  <br>If you're looking for a candidate that isn't influenced by the Jews, you're in the wrong country.</br>  <br>Yes it fucking does?<br>Its clear that Hillary Clinton is gonna win the Election. Even if none of us want to. So what better way to distract and come up with an excellent story, than by using some shit tier rich dude spouting off bullshit and insulting people. 10 years ago that shit wouldn't fly.<br><br>He's a distraction, he's not gonna win the election just make it seem like Hillary might NOT win the war.<br><br>Or i'm smoking too much weed, either way Fuck trump and Hillary<br><br>Sanders ftw</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>TRUMP IS OUR ONLY HOPE</br>  <br><br>This, even his own party hates him.</br></br>  <br> Bernie <br> not influenced by the jews <br>choose one</br></br></br>  <br> can't read: The post </br>  <br>He was saying that all the candidates are influenced by Jews.</br>  <br>Alright, Ill play with the idea that Trump is in it for the money, however, Its very unllikely hes looking to make some sort of substantial gain through the way you are suggesting. Odds are hes looking to manipulate import an export tariffs and prices for it to become more favorable for any and all of his business investments as possible, increasing his profits. but doing that alone is just going to increase revenue so marginally that it becomes negligible. So maybe he is in it for the money, the point is the way hes gonna do it is going to be so inconspicuous that it wont make any sort of news outlet, making it harder to find evidence that was his plan all along. <br>TL:DR Youre a faggot for thinking that youre gonna find any proof that your theory holds any grounds</br></br>  <br>So, Obama was a great president overall. Who was the other choice?<br><br>I dont date men at all. I occasioally suck a dick and a little declawed gerbil action, but thats not gay because i always say no homo</br></br></br>  <br>A socialist from Kenya trying to destroy the United States from within was a great president overall? OK i guess.</br>  <br>The ironically bleak reality is that any presidential candidate who isn't smart enough to be able to vastly increase his own wealth with presidential powers probably isn't smart enough to handle a national budget.</br>  <br>Declawed gerbal action</br>  <br> voting for Trump because hes 6'5... not a manlet <br><br>Femanon detected<br> dat lookism </br></br></br></br>  <br> not realizing that obama was handed a sinking ship regardless. <br> Brainwashed fag is scared of anything besides Capitalism </br></br>  <br>should be.</br>  <br> being this brainwashed and not knowing obama's upbringing <br> thinking there is any other system currently that works better than capitalism </br></br>  <br> 2015 <br> still not aware that communism = socialism  <br> still not aware that these movements were created and funded through international banking  <br><br> who are international bankers? </br></br></br></br></br>  Trump should be the republican candidate to protect against Jeb.<br>Bernie should be the democratic candidate to protect against Hilary.</br>  <br>I posted this. I'm not biased at all, I just know what I'm talking about. Capitalism really isn't all that great either, just better than communism. But no one is smart enough to come up with anything better. I'm still searching libraries trying to find some hidden new economic system that someone probably already thought up with no luck.
