Or anyone else for that matter.  disgonnabegood.jpg  <br>Whoa</br>  <br>Tor<br>thats why</br></br>  <br>What they don't have anything better to do, like tracking non-existent terrorist plots?</br>  That's not a raid<br><br><br><br>They need to hit quotas so they can keep getting funding.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Even if he is innocent his reputation is smeared now, it's a character assassination.</br>  <br>Kek, he got fat again.</br>    <br> it's a character assassination. <br><br>That's literally 99% of the FBI's business</br></br></br>  <br>no way!</br>  <br>I've never heard of anyone being arrested after being deanonimised on Tor.<br><br>It's always retards who buy things with their credit cards, host hidden services themselves or get caught by revealing too much personal information.</br></br></br>    <br> Zionsville </br>  Why would you even risk it? Why would you download CP... Ever? If you get caught its like 15 years isn't it? Fuck nigger.    Its not a fucking raid... they show jared casually letting the agents in. Its in connection with the former director of jareds charity, and theyre simply gathering any potential evidence. Clickbait.  <br>  chyron of skepticism </br>  <br>You dont think hes part of it? Of course you would cooperate, would make you look pretty bad if you didnt.</br>  Someone linked to his charity organization was charged with child porn possession, and In guess that's why he's being raided.<br><br>Even if he turns out to be clean, his PR will be forever ruined because of this.</br></br>  <br><br>Why would anyone keep illegal porn? That's what I don't understand. They do these raids and sometines they find huge stashes of child porn. Why the need to horde it?<br><br>They presumably get it off the internet somehow, right? They aren't making it themselves. So why not watch it, fap, close the browser, and turn off the computer? Why does saving it even enter into the picture?<br><br>If weed could be smoked over the internet, no one would ever get caught carrying, and yet these pedos amass huge stockpiles of child porn like the internet is going to shut down any day now, and so of course they get raided and their stash is used to send them to prison.<br><br>Just so dumb.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> would make you look pretty bad if you didnt. <br><br>this is what they want you to think<br><br>You know what never helps?

Quiznos? Jersey Mikes? Blimpie?</br>  <br>I lold</br>    <br>Really? I bet 99.9% of people had no idea that the charity director was even popped for CP. Unless Jared's got a big stash himself... im guessing its probably related to the numbers/finance/etc in connection with his charity and if there are any dirty trails.</br>  <br>Look into what Jared was 'doing' recently.<br><br>I can't say anymore.

Your fate rests in your right hand.</br>  <br><br>picking a bike based on engine capacity is a huge mistake. A CBR600RR would outrun my ER6-N (650cc) any day of the week, and then some.

Merkel is planing to forgive half of the Greece depth and kick them out of EU. And we all know that all the other countries can do nothing about it but obey her commands.  someone post that picture of her boobs<br><br>'Select all images with juice."</br></br>  <br>Iron Mädchen Merkel</br>  <br>Yeah, I don't mind her going trough with that. There seems to be no other solution, the Greek referendum was clear.</br>  <br><br>I'm telling you, Germans are alien race. From WW2 to this day they've become the most powerful country in Europe again. Shit's crazy.</br></br>  fuck the eu, greece can host russian nukes for $$$  From what I know, Greeks are bitching about how 700 € was their average salary and that it was hard for them to survive with that. In my country average salary is 300 € and we're managing to survive. And also, our BDP is on 1% and raising. We just came out of a big recession and this is our firs positive BDP after more than 8 years. Btw, we are also a part of EU.  <br>That is because they are smart and hard working. I was surprised they joined the EU. The only other country pulling their weight is NL.</br>  <br><br>I'm from neither of those countries but I agree. I hve a huge respect toward Germans and Nordic countries.</br></br>  <br><br>  that's because they have a limitless storage of slaves east.  <br><br>FTFY</br></br></br></br>  <br>what about the UK? just because we get sick of the limitless stream of immigrants - on account of our EU agreements - doesn't mean we aren't meeting said agreements.<br><br>all we want are better terms.</br></br></br>  <br>they're bullshitting, big time.<br><br>on average, a bus driver in greece was earning the same as a mid-level executive in the UK. party's over now, and it's time to face the hangover.</br></br></br>  <br>Ahahahahhaha, the ignorance is amazing.</br>  <br>elaborate.</br>  <br>What you said, is literally 100% false. Source: My fucking uncle is a Greek busdriver. Reading posts these past few days it's really shocking to me how misinformed people are and how quick they are to judge and spout ignorance about a country they've never even set foot into.</br>  <br>you're telling me that they didn't receive a percentage-wise bonus on their salary, just for checking tickets?<br><br>also: you telling me that greeks pay tax like the germans? as in, actually pay it and not evade their taxation like it's a national sport?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Jesus Christ. Kick them out of EU already!</br></br>  <br>Can the little Eurofaggot who was on here yesterday calling everyone else 'stupid' for telling him the obvious fact that Germany runs the EU please return to see this and apologise to everyone else in that thread?</br>  <br>I'm telling you these things do not make up for the debt. Yes there is a massive tax evasion problem but it is largely a response to a corrupt system. Would you give taxes if you knew for a fact they were just going to get mismanaged and eventually end up in a politician's or foreign bankers pocket? But this is irrelevant, like I said the problems lie elsewhere and the tax evasion is being used as a scapegoat so the people actually responsible get away scot free. But please, keep eating up that propaganda the media is feeding you and regurgitating it online.</br>  <br>nah. i'd rather move to greece and diddle my salary, then evade tax.</br>  <br>Problem is Greece is a democracy, and those in power are there because you retards elected them. It's called living with your choices. Enjoy those choices, it amuses the rest of us.<br><br>Move out of Greece, it'll never recover. Live somewhere else and buy a summer home in Greece, before it turns into an annexed Russian playground.</br></br></br>  <br>i wonder if other sheltered twelve year olds see this and thinks its as clever as you think</br>  <br>Read history. They are like that because is convenient to real powers.</br>  <br>Hopefully Spain and Italy leave EU before they get em too...</br>  Im surprised portugal and spain survived. I guess they are great countries after all.  <br>I hope that my country leave the EU.

The last days before the referendum the propaganda and manipulation was really bad. In example, the newspapers of my country opened their news with images of greek people without food in the markets. Everything was a fucking bullshit because in the pics you see people wearing winter clothes in Greece... with 30°C in summer. And with this, everything. They do the same with Portugal, Spain, Italy... the EU is slavery.</br>  <br>They got what they deserve, let them starve</br>    <br>It amuses us until it happens to us, that is. When it does happen to us we'll do the same. Move. Abandon the sinking ship. Live in a tent for all it's worth.<br><br>Greece won't recover. Come join the rest of us.</br></br></br>  <br>Greece is a very young democracy that hasn't fully recovered from decades of Cold War proxy wars and a brutal dictatorship.<br><br>Voter participation is high and technically cumpolsory, but the near-50% tax avoidance rate is an indicator that their government is not as representative as we might think.</br></br></br>  <br>First we want 10 years of luxury, 200 years of not paying debt and overall bullshitting the entire EU.<br><br>Quit defending these people, they deserve to be killed.</br></br></br>  <br>15.20<br>What was in the presentation?<br>Nothing new to report from Euclid's presentation to finance ministers it seems. Reports now suggest the Greeks repeated a previous plan for an ESM loan for two years worth around €30bn. That's already been dismissed out of hand by creditor powers, who want the Greeks to come up with a new more "credible" plan.<br><br>They are retarded</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> reposts some random editorializing article <br> adds his own gripping commentary <br><br>The only thing uncredible here are the troika's plans to keep the eurozone together long-term without making sacrifices of their own. Greece is solvent before foreign debt service. A long-maturity source of liquidity is literally all they need, and problem solved.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This is all some American media bullshit. There is nothing wrong in Europe or EU countries<br><br>Here in Europe everything is perfect and wonderfull. The news about bad economy in Europe is just lies spread by jealous evil Americans.</br></br></br>  So recently a politcal party voted yes for returning ISIS members to get healthcare, education, therapy and housing on the tax payer expense.<br><br>I understand now why the world is laughing at us. We're becoming a sanctuary for muslims and people from other cultures. Sweden could have been a paradise, a fairy tale, but our corrupted, weak and liberal government is destroying this country deliberately because of vote fishing. <br><br>Media is never publishing anything about immigration based violence, because Aftonbladet (biggest newspaper in Sweden) is a bunch of extreme leftist, antifa followers.<br><br>Where I live they are tearing down a church in order to build a mosque for the crying muslims, a church I hear every wednesday and sunday, and the day I stop hearing it I know what has happened.<br><br>Sweden is a dying nation, a nation who fears the revolution it so desperately needs, a nation of people being scared of the label "Racist" because they want their country back.<br><br>Sweden can now only serve as a warning to others about what happens when governments become afflicted with the mental disorder of extreme liberalism.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  All you Europoops are dying nations  <br>I can't argue with you on that one.</br>    <br>What are you going to do about it?<br>Nothing.......</br></br>  ya'll need more heroes  <br>What can we do about it?</br>  <br>Hungary is taking steps to prevent dying, but the EU is not happy about it</br>  well, come to finland. <br>oh nvm. in here these niggers are typing door codes to buildings in arabic so they can come in and rape the fatties.</br>  <br>Ask him.</br>  <br>Because the EU is a bunch of cockgobbling faggots who loves taking black dick up their rectum</br>  <br>The one true hero.</br>    <br>Pretty much.

American football is superior. That's why it's an olympic game and rugby isn't.</br>  <br>Thats why NFL teams have coaches at every position located all over the stadium and constantly relay information in via headsets. <br><br>Rugby has too many weak ass cuck white boys for me to take it seriously as an athletic competition.</br></br></br>  <br>and fat</br>  <br>Not the best picture of Chabal the man who is a literal fucking viking.</br>  <br> not wearing protection for your brain  <br><br>I guess it's not like you have anything worth protecting</br></br></br>  <br>The rest of the world cant afford football pads.</br>  <br><br><br>Pretty hilarious the sport is so shitty one guy who is 6'4 250 which is extremely common and not big in the NFL looks like a giant in rugby.<br><br>Get some actual athletes.

Same reason we dominate the summer Olympics every 4 years too.</br>  <br> Implying the world is full of Greek people </br>  both are retarded  how would JJ Watt do in a rugby match?  <br>Just another long repercussion of slavery.

Sorry.</br>  <br>after many months some decent drawing, too bad it's not porn</br>  <br>Nono don't apologize. Just was kinda confusing.</br>  <br>Are you busy with adventures now or could request something lewd?</br>  <br>always open for requests, just depends on what it is.<br><br>shoot.</br></br></br>    <br>You covered in dicks</br>  <br>HUAHAHA<br>this is great</br></br>  <br>fabulous, sounds positively exquisite =P <br><br>anyone have any requests?</br></br></br>  Ask a closet Cd sissy anything  Hormones?  No. I'm married  <br>Why haven't you caged your clit and flushed the key down the toilet yet?</br>  It is caged most of the time  more photos?  more photos !  <br>I'm married to its hard cding and hiding it</br>    <br><br>Why did you marry stuck up bitches who you can't talk about your sexuality with?</br></br>  Bump  <br>Cause they get defensive cause they think they will lose what they have... I told my wife that I wanted to transition and I've wanted to for years and that she's the first person I told, she started hitting me and said that she'd leave me if I did and since I love her so much I instead tried therapy I pretend that it worked and that in happy but inside I'm dead... I just want to be pretty....</br>  <br>I am like you, not married tho, but still hiding my things to visitors, of course.<br>How do you deal with shaving your body without others (specially your wife) asking about it?</br></br>  <br> inside I'm dead <br>you'd still be dead inside if you transitioned...<br>trust me, /b/ro. trannies are broken human beings. take your antidepressant and plow your wife.</br></br></br>  <br>Wow.<br>Well that's a stuck up bitch if i've ever seen one.<br>Honestly you should leave her. If she can't accept who you are. What do you mean with "they think they will lose what they have"<br>A stable marriage with a normal husband?<br>A status she can show off to be more accepted?<br>Load of bullshit. That's not what a marriage should be about anymore.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hard to plow anything with antidepressants...</br>  <br>So, you tell her your biggest secret, and she hits you and makes threats... And you love her. What the fuck is wrong with you? Except for the low self esteem and feeling like a woman stuck in a mans body??</br>  <br>  trannies are broken human beings <br><br>And how do you know?</br></br></br>  <br>I'd feel to guilty to leave her I don't know why though</br>  <br>The fear of being alone...</br>  <br>Even harder to plow someone with HRT.<br><br>I looked at the rate of suicides post transition.</br></br></br>  <br>face pls embrace it</br>  <br>Because they feel like the opposite gender of their sex... If that isn't "broken", I don't know what is. It's mental disease. Nothing to be ashamed about or good reason to be mean, but transgender/race people are broken.</br>  <br>I know how you feel, not on a marriage scale but I put off breaking up with most recent gf because I knew I'd feel guilty and hurt her, but after I did everyone said I did the right thing for myself</br>  <br>Moar</br>  <br>So, he/she should let fear guide her. Nice... Better to spend the rest of your life with someone that hits you for not lying.</br>  <br>I obviously dont know all the details.<br>But i think it's because you think it'd be selfish on your part to transition and change your lifestyle to a less socially acceptable, "Dragging" your wife into it.<br>In reality, she's the selfish one because she's more obsessed with what others think of her than you. The one she's supposed to love and support. You have absolutely no reason to care about her if she doesn't reciprocate those feelings.<br><br><br> I looked at the rate of suicides post transition. <br>Maybe it's because stupid fucks like you who make life hell for transgender people in our society.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Maybe it's because stupid fucks like you who make life hell for transgender people in our society. <br>Sure, blame me because transitioning is not the cure-all for dysphoria. I'm not trying to disillusion you but you will be disillusioned before the end.</br></br>  <br>Partly, yes. But I find the idea of transgender having a higher suicide rate by default likely. <br><br>It's difficult to describe mental illness in all it's aspects, but that is what transgender people are. Any sort of physical/mental illness IS going to increase the likelihood of ending your own life.. the intolerant people doesn't help though.</br></br></br>  <br>There's no reason to call it a mental disease.<br>By definition of ICD-10, the psychological definition of mental diseases, you can call a mental state a "disease" only when you are severely damaging yourself or damaging others among a few other points.<br>If we'd still go by the definition of everything going against normative lifestyle, every "strange" haircut would be considered a mental disease.<br>Hell, all of /b/ would be clinically mentally sick.</br></br></br></br>  <br> the intolerant people doesn't help though <br>I just want you to remember how I was called intolerant for saying that transitioning might make you miserable. Watch out for these internet fuckers trying to give you psychiatric advice and if you need to go to an actual doctor.</br></br>  <br>Why would you neglect the 40% rate of attempted suicide? Did the big bad culture make you hurt yourself or can you accept it does cause severe damage to yourself and others?</br>  <br>Take it this way lads : IMO trannies,cross dressers are straight people that get off to being humiliated. They live off the reaction they have on other people something like exhibitionists or you know the folk that wank in public. So when that goes and they find some new stimulus all they are left is shame. This is you OP. You're not a woman your just someone who doesn't think he'd be able to be in control of anything ie your marriage. Get more help and replace sucking cock for something that would make you feel more like a man ( carpentry, logging or lifting.. Have a nice life</br>  <br>That's why you actually go to a psychiatrist who evaluates wether or not you actually need transitioning or if the problem is elsewhere.<br>You dont go to "therapy" and just take antidepressants because your wife tells you to and others tell you to be normal or they will leave you.<br>In OP's case it's a problem with her<br>environment and not with her.</br></br></br></br>    <br>See, Gender dysphoria isn't what hurts you or makes you hurt yourself.<br>It's the depression that comes along with it in some cases.<br>And depression is a completely different story.<br>There's a lot wrong with blindly quoting statistics, by the way. You don't get to the root of the problem.<br>Those 60% that are happy with their transitioning mostly have an accepting environment.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How was or is your relationship with your father?</br>  ITT: FAGGOTS<br>SAGE</br>  <br>Well, I mean, he hasn't said any of that. He just said his wife's a bitch and he went to therapy but he didn't help. All I said was that therapy doesn't always help but that's the same with transitioning. You gotta try and find something that works, I agree. Also accept that some people just like their lives broken inside.<br><br> blindly quoting statistics <br>Those 60% might be just as happy through other treatments.</br></br></br></br>    <br>I came here to masturbate before work and thats so sad it killed my boner. I'm sorry for you baby &lt;\3</br>  <br>show us your face, slut</br>  <br> Those 60% might be just as happy through other treatments. <br><br>And why would they have any treatment other than transitioning if it obviously worked for them.</br></br></br>  <br> You have absolutely no reason to care about her if she doesn't reciprocate those feelings. <br>That's very selfish in and of itself. But i get what your saying, non-reciprocated love can cause alot of suffering.<br>Not op btw.<br>Oh and all this bullshit bout suicide rates post transition is just speculation. As with any type of statistic, you'll find that it's easily manipulated and no-one has yet posted a link to an organization that did these studies with no relation to parties that benefit from certain results.</br></br></br></br>  <br>she sorta looks like aubrey plaza<br><br>Because one is very drastic and you can't just stop once you've started.</br></br></br>  <br>GET THE FUCK OUT OF /b/ FUCKING FAGGOT GET THE FUCK OUT OF /b/ FUCKING FAGGOT GET THE FUCK OUT OF /b/ FUCKING FAGGOT GET THE FUCK OUT OF /b/ FUCKING FAGGOT GET THE FUCK OUT OF /b/ FUCKING FAGGOT GET THE FUCK OUT OF /b/ FUCKING FAGGOT GET THE FUCK OUT OF /b/ FUCKING FAGGOT GET THE FUCK OUT OF /b/ FUCKING FAGGOT GET THE FUCK OUT OF /b/ FUCKING FAGGOT GET THE FUCK OUT OF /b/ FUCKING FAGGOT GET THE FUCK OUT OF /b/ FUCKING FAGGOT GET THE FUCK OUT OF /b/ FUCKING FAGGOT GET THE FUCK OUT OF /b/ FUCKING FAGGOT GET THE FUCK OUT OF /b/ FUCKING FAGGOT GET THE FUCK OUT OF /b/ FUCKING FAGGOT GET THE FUCK OUT OF /b/ FUCKING FAGGOT GET THE FUCK OUT OF /b/ FUCKING FAGGOT GET THE FUCK OUT OF /b/ FUCKING FAGGOT GET THE FUCK OUT OF /b/ FUCKING FAGGOT GET THE FUCK OUT OF /b/ FUCKING FAGGOT GET THE FUCK OUT OF /b/ FUCKING FAGGOT GET THE FUCK OUT OF /b/ FUCKING FAGGOT GET THE FUCK OUT OF /b/ FUCKING FAGGOT GET THE FUCK OUT OF /b/ FUCKING FAGGOT GET THE FUCK OUT OF /b/ FUCKING FAGGOT GET THE FUCK OUT OF /b/ FUCKING FAGGOT GET THE FUCK OUT OF /b/ FUCKING FAGGOT GET THE FUCK OUT OF /b/ FUCKING FAGGOT GET THE FUCK OUT OF /b/ FUCKING FAGGOT GET THE FUCK OUT OF /b/ FUCKING FAGGOT GET THE FUCK OUT OF /b/ FUCKING FAGGOT GET THE FUCK OUT OF /b/ FUCKING FAGGOT GET THE FUCK OUT OF /b/ FUCKING FAGGOT GET THE FUCK OUT OF /b/ FUCKING FAGGOT GET THE FUCK OUT OF /b/ FUCKING FAGGOT GET THE FUCK OUT OF /b/ FUCKING FAGGOT GET THE FUCK OUT OF /b/ FUCKING FAGGOT GET THE FUCK OUT OF /b/ FUCKING FAGGOT GET THE FUCK OUT OF /b/ FUCKING FAGGOT GET THE FUCK OUT OF /b/ FUCKING FAGGOT GET THE FUCK OUT OF /b/ FUCKING FAGGOT GET THE FUCK OUT OF /b/ FUCKING FAGGOT GET THE FUCK OUT OF /b/ FUCKING FAGGOT GET THE FUCK OUT OF /b/ FUCKING FAGGOT GET THE FUCK OUT OF /b/ FUCKING FAGGOT GET THE FUCK OUT OF /b/ FUCKING FAGGOT GET THE FUCK OUT OF /b/ FUCKING FAGGOT</br>  <br>Most types of human behaviour is considered a mental illness.<br>Hell, eating healthy is now considered a mental illness.<br>Says alot about the trustworthiness of these experts.<br>We all know psychology practitioners require a dogmatic philosophy as the foundation of all their research?
