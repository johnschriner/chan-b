She was some kind of social Darwinist?</br>  <br>Well, if you weren't literally the lowest of the low of the economic chain, you might change your tune and start focusing on your own ambitions before anyone else.</br>  <br>I'm a socialist, I care about everyone.</br>  <br>I have no idea what this woman believed?</br>  <br>That's the problem. Most people don't appreciate your help anyway. Might as well try to make your life better instead.</br>  weeeeelll cowboy dan's a major player in the cowboy scene he goes to the reservation drinks and gets mean he goes to the desert fires his rifle in the sky says god if I have to die you will have to die  <br>If you want to read something short by her, I'd recommend Anthem. She believed one ought to follow reason, not dogma. One should work hard productively for one's own fulfillment. Self determination and individualism were important to her.</br>  <br>Wow OP your thread sucks.</br>  <br><br><br/></br></br>  OP is a confirmed cuck faggot with no ability to provide for himself. Kill yourself and save some other poor soul the trouble.  Friendly reminder that Ayn Rand enrolled in social security and medicare, after spending her whole life writing about how people who used similar programs were worthless. She then continued to write about how evil these programs were, while taking advantage of them.  <br>Hey, if the opportunity is there, abuse it.</br>  <br>You mean systems she paid into? Go be stupid somewhere else.</br>  <br>If you're going to write about how people using these programs are human leeches who deserve to kill themselves, and then turn around and use the programs, maybe you should just take your own advice.</br>  <br>This</br>  <br><br>Any rationalization to gloss over your god's hypocrisy.</br></br>  <br>Opportunity to be a hypocrite</br>  <br>She committed so many fallacies that it's difficult to address them all. And her fanboys engage in true scottsmans while defending her shit philosophy.</br>    She was lucid a couple of times. <br><br>"For the record, I shall repeat what I have said many times before: I do not join or endorse any political group or movement. More specifically, I disapprove of, disagree with and have no connection with, the latest aberration of some conservatives, the so-called “hippies of the right,” who attempt to snare the younger or more careless ones of my readers by claiming simultaneously to be followers of my philosophy and advocates of anarchism. Anyone offering such a combination confesses his inability to understand either. Anarchism is the most irrational, anti-intellectual notion ever spun by the concrete-bound, context-dropping, whim-worshiping fringe of the collectivist movement, where it properly belongs."</br></br>  <br>White collar, 80k per year @ 28years old and I still think she's a huge faggot.<br><br>Voting Bernie next year by the way.</br></br></br>  <br>bernie sanders my nigga</br>  Poor nietzsche ripoff, butthurt by commits and made piss poor philosophy to counter their bullshit  Donald the Trump 2016  <br>he literally seems to be the republifuck frontrunner right now.<br>like christ.</br></br>  <br>Commies- fuck you autocorrect</br>  The worst thing to happen to modern philosophy was Ayn Rand getting a typewriter.  <br>this guy gets it</br>  EIGHTEEN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES JULIAN  <br>His political strategy is inadvertently genius.

There's nothing about celebrating selfishness and egotism to the point of making a philosophy out of it. That's not what freedom is about.</br>    <br><br>Nope.

Rand actually died bitter and disappointed that her shitty philosophy wasn't taken up by more people.<br><br>I'm glad she did. She's like a precursor to every stupid special-snowflake that inhabits the Internet today.</br></br></br>  <br><br>You mean there isn't another nigger to run against her for the primary. That's really the only reason why she lost it.</br></br>  <br><br> Well, little man, why don't you roll out that extensive list of uneducated experts in philosophy and economics for us? <br><br>Leonardo da Vinci <br><br>Joseph Campbell<br><br>Marx, Hitler, Lincoln <br><br>you know, random people who you can dismiss out of hand</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>no Obama kicked her ass up and down the campaign trail<br><br>the main reason she lost it is she voted to authorize the war in Iraq and Obama voted no....</br></br></br></br>    <br><br>None of whom are noted as being experts in either discipline.

Everybody already knows this shit. and has known it since like 1959.<br><br>The only part about it that is sad is that assholes like Rand Paul are trying to run for President so they can put Ayn Rand's bullshit philosophy to work politically. I think Atlas Shrugged was on the Young Republicans to-read list too. Disgusting.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I play a mean guitar . . . .</br></br>  ITT: No one has actually read any Ayn Rand  Ayn Rand was a woman.

I can tell just by that post. The hydro without tylenol are usually known as Roxies. And they are not hard to find at all. That's pretty much what everyone wants until they get on heroin. You really need to try some more out if you think those 100mg morphine pills are the shit. They are completely useless. I know since it says "morphine" that everyone loses their shit. Opana, 30mg IR hydro, Fentanyl, and heroin are the god-tier opiates. This coming from a high functioning 10 year addict.</br>  <br>Oh man.

You always get the 30mg blue ones and people love em because they never tried to make them abuse-proof like Oxycontin<br><br>Hydrocodone always came along with Tylenol until Zohydro was approved a couple years back. Lortab, Vicodin, Norco, etc are all hydrocodone and tylenol. Hard to abuse because you will wreck yourself with the tylenol before you get high if you have a high tolerance. That's why Zohydro is sweet, but I never really see them because they are newer and docs just perscribe oxycodone or hydromorphone for bad pain if 10mg Norcos or Percocets aren't enough.<br><br>Street pharmacist here.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Alcohol 8/10 <br> Weed 9/10 <br> Shrooms 7/10 <br> Cocaine 10/10 <br> Tobacco 10/10 <br> Laughing gas 4/10 </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>As someone who is worked in retail, longterm care, and hospital settings, you would never get oxycodone as a substitute for hydrocodone by anyone who wants to keep their license. <br><br>tl;dr you're full of shit.</br></br></br>  <br> alcohol 5/10 <br> weed 8/10 <br> acid 9/10 <br> shrooms 9/10 <br> coke 4/10 <br> DXM 5/10 <br> diphenhydramine ?/10 <br>I did dph a couple times as a teen one summer.
