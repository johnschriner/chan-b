[ What does b think of my current cunt  /s/Fur Mk.CCLXXXVIII<br>-<br>Seven Days Without Sleep Edition</br></br>      fav artist and why?  Gorsha.<br><br>Because she's quite pretty and actually makes art I would actually commission, if I ever do decide to.</br></br>  Filenames, I'm to write you into my will; Upon my death I will bequeath unto you the guest room I keep on standby in my attic, and my patent for a light cargo SSTO/medium cargo suborbital spaceplane.<br>-<br>Sound good?</br></br>      Someone help me post the rest.  <br>James Hardiman<br>Love the way he drew skunks especially.</br></br>  <br>I guess.<br><br>I mean, it is free after all.<br><br>You should throw in some pop tarts and I'll be happy!</br></br></br></br></br>  Fucking Furfags  <br>Powfooo<br><br>because his characters are super cute</br></br></br>  <br>Don't you have the rest?</br>  <br>Neurodyne<br><br>Because he hovers on that boundary between porn and art. His stuff looks like a graffiti or tattoo artist decided to make furry porn. It's got that trashy art vibe.</br></br></br>  https://<span>youtu.be/VmqDtriTUEI?t=5m55<wbr>s</wbr>  [ ]  <br>Kikurage<br><br>Because he's great at drawing different bodytypes, facial expressions, situations, perspective, and fluffiness. Probably one of the more accomplished artists in the genre. Most of his stuff looks happy and inviting.</br></br></br>  <br>face is a bit too feral for me tbh</br>    <br>/Revised/<br>If I am to write you into my will, upon my death I will bequeath unto you the guest room I keep on standby in my attic, several boxes of Pop-Tarts in the blueberry, brown sugar cinnamon, and apple currant varieties, and my patent for a light cargo SSTO/medium cargo suborbital spaceplane. <br>-<br>Sound good?</br></br></br></br>  Falvie<br><br>Because I really like the way she draws characters, especially when it's in a non-sexual context, like most of her pics</br></br>  <br>I am very pleased now, and am now conflicted as fuck as to whether to hope you survive or hope you die.</br>  <br>THEFUCKINGDEVIL<br><br>I like it how he draws his anatomy for the love of giant tits and ass</br></br></br>  <br>face of the female looks like a man tbh</br>  <br>Sadly you're right, and now I am sad.</br>  <br>i agree but its pretty cartoony although i suppose you like that kinda stuff<br>you and your 0/10 gumball shit</br></br>  <br>cringe/10</br>    I need more of this comic    <br>Fuck you,you Nigger Faggit</br>    <br>Seems like you got it already.</br>  <br>no watterson</br>  <br>cringing at what? That female also looks like a man<br><br><br>its not a comic its a vignette</br></br></br></br>          <br>I'll fix it later :P</br>  <br>nice art</br>  Danke Shane<br>Here's some avian for ya</br>  <br>Wasn't me,I think it was lem</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=HJE<wbr>ahE-4juQ&amp;list=PLS9LdyPVmq8G71pkZ7jm<wbr>tRNMhlj8y8Wvv</wbr></wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Reminds me of that album's artwork.</br></br></br>  <br> domestic dog <br> feral <br><br>nigga what<br><br>Also:<br><br>The Tied Tigress<br><br>Because she (he?) is into BDSM, and so am I.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  http://g.e-hentai.org/g/612455/5e40<wbr>1e1656/<br><br>I'll try to source the origins of my filenames whenever I feel like posting.</br></br></wbr>  <br>i think its the facial expression.<br><br>That facial expression to me makes me think the character has the brains of the dog instead of a human but it might just be my autism</br></br></br>  <br>Now that's a good album.</br>    I can't post a few Gorsha images because they're over 4 MB. <br><br>Sadness.</br></br>  <br>resize you fuckboy<br>or just convert to jpg<br>god you are such a mexican</br></br></br>  <br> open in paint <br> save as jpg <br> cry about loss in quality <br> post <br> ? <br> profit! </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How the fuck can you tell, you look at dogs and determine their gender by their face?</br>  <br>Crying, laughing, and fapping at the same time is tough to do.<br><br>Resizing makes me sad, but I guess I could do that. But I'm busy in /gif/ right now.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=OR0<wbr>7r0ZMFb8</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br>  Someone turn my shitart into a meme with the speech bubble  <br> it might just be my autism <br>I think it is, because the expression I'm seeing is intelligent. It shows intent and interest in the POV character. There definitely *is* some dog in there, but that's the crux of furfaggotry to begin with.<br><br>Like I said, I think facial expressions are one of the strengths of Kikurage. He also does regular hentai (at least, he does a lot of loli), so he definitely knows how to do human facial expressions.</br></br></br></br>  <br>maybe</br>  <br>faces have feminine/masculine features thats how you tell men from women. That drawing is like a man with a vagina<br><br><br>yea i figured so but it still doesnt do much for me</br></br></br></br>    That's how bored I am.  <br>I chuckled</br>  <br>You seem to focus on faces extensively. One of the ways I tell intent in the original Kikurage image I posted, is by also looking at body language.</br>  I just went for a jog. My face is numb, and I think I might have suffered a transient ischemic attack.  <br>Running tends to cure that.</br>  <br>different strokes for different people i guess</br>  <br> transient ischemic attack <br>nah you definitely just had an actual stroke<br>rip</br></br></br>  <br>You certainly might have if you're asking for medical advice in a furry porn thread.<br><br>Pic related. The only medical assistence I can provide.</br></br></br>    <br>Love the Rammstein panties</br>  <br><br>The left side of my body is tingling, and the periphery of the vision of my left eye is beginning to darken. The manifestation of these symptoms is consistent with a TIA diagnosis, so RIP right cerebral hemisphere and/or occipital lobe, I guess.</br></br>  <br>nah, it's totally a full blown stroke<br>rip</br></br>  <br>I wasn't really asking for advice, so much as I was reporting the symptoms I was experiencing and what caused them to manifest.</br>  <br>I'm gonna need your room too. If you die, that is.</br>    <br>That edit though</br>  <br>why am i this bored</br>  <br>It's not an edit. At that part of the game, in order for him to team up with you, you have to give him a phrase that uses up all 9 character spaces. "Nigger" was too short, so I had to use "Niggers!!" and viola, he shouted it.<br><br>Right as my sister walked in, and she started laughing.</br></br></br>  My sister/roomate came in and violently shook my head. Something tells me that my symptoms are nothing more than hypochondriacal delusions that arose as a result of my inability or unwillingness to deal with regular physical exercise. Oh well.  <br>I like that one and link me on that proof</br>  <br>At least you get free nachos.</br>  <br>Link you on what proof? It's a Wii game that I don't emulate. It's Super Paper Mario, and it's the Land or Valley of the Cragons or some shit. He's one of the pixis that help you.</br>  she needs a hat too  It just occurred to me that my sister cares more about my physical health than I do.  I got no more ideas. Back to random images.      <br>Good thing the Hueys already make a fapping sound when idling on the ground, so you won't hear what happens next as much.</br>  <br>Suggest that one o the mods :^)</br>  <br>Imperialist Vixen!</br>  <br>a furry chick in vietnam would have been getting srs action</br>  <br>Now why would I do that?</br>    <br>Dubs<br><br><br>:^)</br></br></br></br>    <br>Then you'll be rich and famous.<br><br>Though it'd be pretty funny, and I always wondered how they got their banners. I wanted to make a few of them.</br></br></br>    <br>She would've been ripped apart, limb from limb. Think about it; You're leaving her with several thousand morbidly undersexed adolescent teens under wartime conditions in a geographically isolated country thousands of miles from their homeland.</br>  Sexiest picture you guys got?  anybody got any furry pictures for me to do this to?  <br>Here y'go.</br>  <br>That's a pretty impressive shitter there...</br>  <br>Not the best, but the first one off of the top of my collection.</br>  <br>they would all turn furry without questioning it</br>  <br>'Murica.</br>          <br><br>This pretty much illustrates the victory of capitalism. North Korea makes a propaganda cartoon, and it's more popular with the people it's casting as the bad guys than with their own.<br><br>The character is British, BTW. Artist got it wrong.</br></br></br></br>  I am fucking knackered. Only woke up recently after dreaming about having to carry a dwarf around an amusement park for a TV show I didn't understand.. <br><br>Good morning all.</br></br>    Dubs and I cut my hair using the electric razor I keep in a box under my bathroom sink.
