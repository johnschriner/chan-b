That leaves two remaining choices, but they have disproportionate values... I don't know how to account for that. It almost seems like 33% should be correct, but that can't be right either...</br>  In a standard 4-choice question, picking at random is a 25% chance of being right, But because 2 of the answers are 25%, this makes the chance of them being the right answer 50%, thus changing the answer.<br>And the chance of picking the 1 50% answer is 25%.<br>the 0% answer cancels itself out, because if it was correct, it would have been a 25% chance. But now, saying that there is no correct answer to the question means that 0% is correct.<br>basically, none of the answers give the actual % chance of being correct, meaning it’s a trick question with no right answer.<br>Good Trolling.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, you just don't get it. No matter which of those we pick, it's a 75% chance that it is correct. The answer is 75%, even though that answer isn't listed.</br>  Post pictures of your girl/other anons girls.
