YOU CLODS  Does anyone care to talk about Cluster?<br>Someone was mentioning it last thread.</br>  <br>God no.....</br>  <br>Saved</br>   Pearl likes to watch Steven sleep <br>I know I should consider it creepy, but I still found it endearing.</br>  <br>the creator wouldn't allow it, she is pretty good at stopping tumblr bait bullshit at AMA and cons.</br>  <br>Nope. We don't need a containment board. You should've been here for the brony wars of 4chan. They desecrated all over our glorious /b</br>  <br>It's already made the same mistake as MLP, so yeah.</br>  <br>What mistake is that</br>    <br> mfw <br><br><br>I saved that last one myself, but those first two, man, that made my night</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice quads</br>  <br> yfw </br>  <br>i'm assuming you mean its less than reputable fandom, the show itself is pretty neato.<br><br>also the whole "alien women" thing i would probably explain as reliability, because kids can look to a mom-type character. <br><br>just saying, use your brains with this shit, don't assume its all just tumblr bs</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Having themes that people can relate too.<br>As hard as it is to say, trying to be a relate able show incurs attention from unwanted types of people.<br>I brought this up last thread.</br></br></br>  <br>theory: the cluster isn't done. it's a single piece of a larger whole, that will be even worse.</br>   you faggots think you aren't the next mlp <br>Look at you morons, when you aren't shitting up /co/ you are shitting up /b/.<br><br>Do us a favor and stay on this board</br></br></br>  <br>Cluster was deliciously creepy.<br><br>Not really sure what Peridot was trying to make with it, though, since fusions are already a natural thing.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br> neato, got trips in the last thread, tonight is a good night.</br></br></br>  <br> this anon think we can post on /co/ <br>I didn't realize it was August already</br></br>    <br>relatability*</br>  <br>how are you this passionate about hating something<br><br><br>she said she was checking on it, so while she's complicit in the cluster's existence, it's been there for a long, long time</br></br></br></br>  <br>This.</br>    subtle lesbianism for kids....  <br><br><br><br> fandom =/= show quality <br><br>although i agree the autists who watch the show are intolerable, the show is actually pretty good.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  OP here, smut is cool too, niggers.  <br>fucking this</br>    <br>Good, 'cause I just saved a whole bunch of Peridot smut.</br>    <br>kek<br>i caught it too, i kinda just rolled my eyes and sighed, but in this day and age, can you honestly blame them for trying?</br></br>  <br>Dump it.<br>Not for me, but for the good of mankind.</br></br>  <br>i watched an episode where the entire conflict was two characters having borderline sociopathic emotional breakdowns and they needed to make up to make someone else not be fucking sad.<br>10 out of fucking 10<br>i'm convinced this show is actually pretty good</br></br></br>  <br> subtle <br>Sapphire and Ruby are pretty damn explicit if you ask me.<br><br>At least after the motel episode.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>dump that shit nigga so i can't polish my 7 inch knob and go to bed.</br></br>  <br>That was a good description, I was able to instantly know which episode that was</br>  <br><br>Dump it. For me. Because I like Peridot. And vaginas. And anal.</br></br>  <br>Ruby and Sapphire are the main reason this show spiked in popularity last year.</br>  <br>i also thought this, i was like "ehhhh whut, thats a little graphic for a kids show but i can fap to this"<br><br>they were basically necking, which is all nice and good in my book. if people wanna draw two alien psuedo-girls fucking then by all means, draw away.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah its a trend nowadays, soon pedos will find aceptation as homosexuals do. That said im not against the queer love, just flowing with it...</br>  <br><br><br>Alright, alright.<br><br>I guess I can sympathize with your lust for gem cyborgs.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>don't need trips, already got quads mein neggar</br></br></br>  <br>great<br><br>do you at least agree that that's not the plot to an episode of something worth investing 30 minutes in?</br></br></br>      <br>As a guy who grew up in a christian family, this is pretty all you can do.</br>    <br>to each their own anon,<br>some people get off on watching girls shit themselves, some people like cartoons that don't really make alot of sense.<br><br>why question it?</br></br></br></br>    <br>Like I said last thread, Lesbianism is a very risky step for a children's show, but inevitably, it makes the show more popular in both good and bad senses.</br>    is being forced to fuse considered rape in SU ?    <br>Genocide anyone. Its the only respectable thing to do at this point.</br>  <br>No point in questioning something that won't change, you know?</br>  <br>I believe that 11 minutes isn't enough time to be able to fully explore some deeper concepts and character developments<br>As for emotionally unstable space rocks being lie-raped to, 11 minutes is a good amount of time to kiss and make up</br></br>    <br>because cartoons that don't make sense have fans that i know and it aggravates me when those fans pester me to watch a stupid fucking cartoon about cartoon women teaching a small cartoon boy how to be a lesbian<br><br>I would just like some insight. What do you guys see in this?</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>this and last thread started in theory discussion and is slowing drifting into a rule 34,<br><br>thats why i always come back to /b/.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Except it is all tumblr bullshit.</br>  <br>Considering the material given behind fusing in the form of dialogue and dances.<br>I'd speculate it being similar to both rape and body snatching.</br></br>  <br>That's actually a pretty interesting question, Satan.<br><br>On the other can, is it even possible to force someone to fuse? Since an elaborate dance and teamwork is necessary.</br></br></br>    <br>ah, no, we promote casual conversation and discussion WHILST posting porn</br>  <br>It drifts back and forth.<br>Just trying to "liven" the place up.</br></br>    <br>The beauty of /b/.</br>    <br> being forced to fuse <br>I'd consider "forced fusion" parallel to rape<br>so far there's been no "forced fusion", however some heroes have reluctantly fused and other less important characters have been lied to in order to fuse</br></br></br>  <br>Pretty sure Jasper forced Lapis into fusion. . .</br>  <br><br>You guys don't post in many of the other threads on /b/, do you.</br></br>    <br>hahaha, "woman teaching a small cartoon boy how to be a lesbian" shit made me laugh,<br><br>the main character is very relatable, he struggles trying to figure out what he is and shows a good amount of emotion. <br><br> trying to find yourself out <br> lesbianism <br><br>you won, you figured it out. +1 internet<br>as for understanding it, that episode you explained isn't a very good one to start on, but you would have to keep an open mind.<br><br>some people like to just dive into a story without questioning it, some people like to be challenged. its all a matter of perspective.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>poe's law is strong whitin this post</br>  <br>i've seen the creator actively fight off tumblr bait at cons and AMAs on reddit, i don't assosciate fandom with the work/creator.</br>  <br> What do you guys see in this <br> mfw randomly watching an episode before knowing what SU really was </br></br>    Lapis r34 please  <br>I post in a lot, actually. Near exclusively posted on /b/ before visiting /co/ during the last stevenbomb</br>  <br>Lapis went along with it fully aware of what she'd do.<br>This also proves that you can fake emotions for the purpose of fusing, as Pearl stated you need a "positive" bond.</br></br>  <br>Well if you rape someone he/she doesn't agree with that. If you force someone to fuse, they agree to fuse although they don't want to.</br>        <br>for the record, the first episode I watched was about making waffles. good hook</br>  <br> some people like to just dive into a story without questioning it <br>That means autism.</br></br>  <br> Cluster </br>  <br><br>yeah the hook was shit. sorry, like i said, perspective and personal taste.</br></br>  Last one.<br><br>That's all the Peridot smut I have.</br></br>  <br>Paz Ortega, vibes.</br>  <br>MLP isn't a bad show too.<br>BUT IS FOR FUCKING CHIKLDREN.<br>Just like this show there is nothing that can make you think or learn somethink important out of it.or at least make you laugh for christ's sake.</br></br></br>  <br>and i've been saying all night, the fanbase is full of auts baby boi.<br><br>and if i'm labeled as an autist for liking a cartoon at 21, then so be it. some fucking losers on 4chan think im shit.<br><br>oopsy doospy don't really care.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yes, please understand, I was being completely sarcastic. I truly meant 2/10 made me post. I can't stand this fucking show</br>  <br>you make a good point and this anon<br><br>makes a good point<br><br>I'll concede that Malachite was forced, but only because Lapis had the plan to trap Jasper and save the CG<br>The Cluster, however, is more akin to rape. Fusing the gem shards without their consent.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Good work.</br>  <br>i recall laughing or at least chuckling at some parts, and some people would take the "subtle lesbianism" as a learning experience, introducing to people as "normal"</br>  <br>You're an autist,we all agree on that.<br>BUT DON'T FUCKING MAKE THREADS TO SPREAD THE CANCER</br></br>  <br>With gay marriage being legal?<br>I give the normalization process 20 years.</br></br>  <br>again, OOPSY DOOPSY dont fucking care. enjoy your rest of your life fag.</br>  <br>while I do want to stay on a nice discussion of Steven Universe, Lapis r34...<br>1/7</br></br>  <br>But being a faggot or a lesbian isn't normal you mongoloid.</br>  <br>It's people like you that ruin /b/.<br>Go back to tumblr you fucking rape victim.</br></br>  <br>matter of perspective baby boy,<br>also mongoloid? hahahahahahahahahahahah cute.</br></br>  <br>lol someone sounds mad baby boi, i've never been on tumblr and don't start on planning.<br><br>does the idea of someone liking a cartoon you don't like make you shit the bed baby boi?</br></br></br>  <br>Not that guy, but he's technically right.<br><br>Homosexuality is pretty rare and therefore outside the norm.</br></br></br>   all these flavors, and you choose to be salty   <br>Yeah, like I said, the public view is gonna change because of nonsensical reasons one way or the other.<br>Nothing I can do to change it.</br></br>  <br>meh, i'm not gay so i don't care, but like i said and this is how i see it,<br>its a matter of perspective. do whatever the fuck you want, just dn't fuck with me.... and don't fuck me....</br></br>  2/7  <br><br>Stfu or take this somewhere else.</br></br>  <br> newfags trying to be edgy <br> summer </br></br>  <br>Sorry I don't watch this show. I don't know how to be sweet to faggots</br>  <br> shitting up /b/ </br>  <br> or <br> implying i have to do shit <br> implying i care what anyone on here thinks about shit </br></br></br>  My friend got me into the show, and I really like it. First thing that's got me to tears in quite some time. He mentioned that if it ever turns into something like MLP, (something I also enjoy watching but he doesn't), he'd pretend he had never watched the show and cut all ties with it<br><br>A real shame with how much he enjoys it</br></br>  Damn, Peridot gets a lot of love in these threads.<br><br>What would you say would be best for her in the future?<br>Conversion?<br>Death?<br>Recurring villainy?</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>and yet your tone is very... sour</br>  <br>That's like a Fuck, Marry, Kill question, anon.</br>  <br>wrote my ideas on it in the last thread, still have it open.</br>  <br>Recurring villainy flowing into Death followed by Redemption/Conversion</br>  <br> this shitstorm if they kill this bitch off <br>That's practically suicide for every person working on this show</br></br>  <br><br> baby boi <br>You even talk like a faggot.</br></br></br>  <br>If Peridot's gem is shattered but then somehow reassembled, I could see this kind of scenario happening.</br>  <br>Loss and capture, bubbled, steven smuggles her into his room, makes his room into a rehabilitation area and reforms her through conversation after multiple episodes with Connie joining him for one conversation session</br>  <br>sounds like he gives too many fucks about what kind of shows he watches<br>there's no shame in saying you liked a show up until a certain point</br></br>  <br>It could be fixed, so who knows.</br>  <br>like i also previously said but didn't clarify very well,<br>the character would essentially be the same buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut minor tweaks to show her conversion to the good side, such as minor attitude ajdustments, physical appearances, etc.<br><br>think of it this way: peridot essentially committed war crimes by fusing gems, and garnet wouldn't easily allow her to become good, soooo how else would they make her good?....</br></br></br></br>  <br> liking a cartoon you don't like <br>No,it's more like liking a cartoon that 99 percent of the world's population hates...pretty much like mlp.</br></br>  <br>Nicci?</br>  <br>What is Scene Kids like?</br>  <br>uh oh i don't fucking care, you are insulting someone who thinks of everyone on here as a fat ugly neck beard, and i'd kill myself first before i ever took anything you or any other anon said.<br><br>TD:DR go be a fag around someone who cares.</br></br></br>  <br>This sounds both funny and endearing as hell.</br>  <br>okay, guess thats the end of it.<br>go be a fag somewhere people will actually listen to you be a fag.</br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=eTm<wbr>4m1zGshk</wbr>  [ ]  <br> 99 percent of the world's population hates <br> mfw <br>this post is bait, and has been bait from the beginning<br><br><br>Minaje?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  This far without any /ss/<br>And we're even on /b/ wtf guys</br>    <br>Repetitive, but I chuckled.</br>  <br>Has Steven even hit puberty yet?</br>  <br>liked.</br>    <br>Shit no.</br>  <br>there was that one episode where he went through a bunch of different age groups</br>  <br>He's like 11 so there's a chance</br>  So what's the deal with Yellow Diamond?<br>What does /b/ think her weapon is?</br>  <br><br> &gt;all these meme's and you choose the one sexually frustrated middle schoolers repeat fifteen-fucking-hundred thousand times a day on moba's. <br><br>"Salty" is like the current version of "don't go there".
