Dated a kiwi a long time ago, went back and forth between NZ and home, and I found kiwis attitude towards NZ mind blowing. You have a beautiful country, some of the most breathtaking scenery I've ever seen. Comfortable temperate climates (depends on location I guess). Low crime rate. Quite a liberal/progressive government. Loved the people (I know I know, there are cunts in all walks of life but just in general, great attitude and outlook on life. Hard working and easy going)<br><br>But I often found this attitude you have, especially in the younger generation, that your country sucks. It's obvious that it's because you don't know any better. Take it from an old cunt who's been around the world a bit; I'd rather live in NZ than most other countries, especially my own.</br></br></br>  I've been lurking these nz threads for a while now and this is what I've picked up<br><br> Why are IDs even gone?<br> whr2buy weed in Xtown<br> I'm coming 2 nz what 2 expect<br> NZ thread, posts Australian flag<br> Bong and Milo<br> any1 got nz nudes?<br> IDbro RIP<br> Maori NZ flag design<br> Chink pics<br> n8<br> Joshie<br> Ravi here<br> Anyone else read NZ as Nazi?<br> These threads suck now<br> Newfags made the thread wrong<br><br> This is the script for every NZ thread</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Is that Christchurch guy who wanted to get in on the meetup here? You still haven't added me on Kik, man.  <br>Everyone's here<br>http://tinychat<br>.com/nzcam</br></br></br>  <br>I know, but he was in the thread instead last night.</br>  <br>Fuck you</br>  <br>fuck off you foreigner. In case you didn't read the memo, NZ is shit. You are talking bullshit. We have the second highest prison population per capita in the OECD after the united states. We do more drugs than Jamica, we drink more than the Irish. Our obesity is second only to Mexico. An hours wage will not even buy you a big mac combo. And we have fucking cunts like you who come along spouting how awesome this place is and is all you do is drive up the prices of property so that it makes it impossible for anyone here to have an even remote chance of a future. So all in all, you can fuck off. Go shove a giant cucumber up your ass because your view on the world is such that shoving cucumbers up your ass is the only thing that will make you whole as a person. Eat shit and die you fucking wanker</br>  <br>How would you know what the wages are like when you've clearly never worked a day in your life? Close the laptop for a change, you cave-dwelling permavirgin.</br>  <br> We have the second highest prison population per capita in the OECD after the united states. <br><br>That's mainly Maoris though</br></br></br>  <br>yeah, you're right, I wouldn't have a clue what wages are like. When you work 60-70 hour weeks you run out of time to look that closely at your paychecks.</br>  <br>There are plenty of whitey's on meth.</br>  <br>What's New Zealands biggest marae?<br><br> Mt Eden prison </br></br></br>  <br>Got time for 4chan though. Shouldn't you be starting your night shift?</br>  <br>Paremoremo I think is a bigger prison. And biggest marae, like the 150kms around Gisborne.</br>  <br>#rekt</br>  <br>All of this is untrue.</br>  <br>Casual work, I'm not lucky enough for a zero hours contract. Just finished a six month stint, two weeks off, then I go farming in one of the remotest places you will find on the planet, it's not Haast, but it is almost Haast</br>  <br>I just moved to NZ and I currently make 83000 a year. You're full of shit.</br>  When non-Aboriginals want to 'reclaim Australia'  <br>Nothing to reclaim. Useless black cunts had it for 60 000 years, and managed to invent a flying stick. They can reclaim that if they want.</br>  <br>Fuck Australia. Hot racist boring backwards-ass place.</br>  <br>How can they reclaim anything when they're so lazy?</br>  <br>Do you have stone-age niggers where you live?</br>  <br>That is true though. They hate everything, they even hate themselves</br>  I mean pretty fucken insane expression of human diversity of thought and culture, hangin out on your continent for 10s of thousands of years. Enough time to significantly change the biosphere there. First Nation Australian people could be a total aspect of pride for Oz, but instead you're mostly racist cunts who've barely done anything collective to acknowledge how much civalisation fucking has recently been done, much less look to repair it. <br><br>The world jokes that Oz is a nation of bigoted convict cunts. Weird to me that people find pride in being shit.</br></br>  <br>Your 'First Nation Australia people' are the laziest, stupidest backward autistic race of animals on this planet. Check out the photo in OP's post. That's as far as they have evolved ...</br>  <br> been here for thousands of years <br> invented pointy stick <br> the white man comes <br> builds cities and shit <br> turns the place into a prosperous nation <br> "we want our lands and cities back" </br></br></br></br></br></br>  Its rather simple, the Abos didnt make Australia, Australia, it was a shit hole til white man came along. They should be thankful Europeans came along, they would of been an extinct culture if another country settled in Australia.  <br>Pride in racism.</br>  Fucking Austrailans are ruining /b/.  If someone can tell me what exactly those petrol sniffers have contributed to society besides flying sticks and blowing into a hollow piece of wood, then maybe...  <br> don't go to school <br> don't like to work <br> never contribute to society <br> want recognition in the Constitution </br></br></br></br>  <br> they would of been <br><br>they would HAVE been<br><br> lern2fuckingenglish retard! </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Implying anyone who didn't actually build those cities is shit.<br>So: which building did YOU put together?</br></br>  Not baging all Australians as just like anywhere else there are lots of people worth knowing, but there's tons of really arrogant and racist people as well (Aus is the best blabla, everyone envies us etc)  <br>Lol, Aus vs Ameri, uh ha...</br>  <br>Where you from m8?</br>  Went to Uni for four years to get a law degree. End up as a crim defence solicitor. Spend EVERY day explaining to the court why these black pricks committed the worst crimes, My firm assigns me an 'Indigenous Liaison Officer' so that I am culturally sensitive when I see abo clients. She can't read, is always late to court and all she tells me is not to make eye contact with female clients cos' they don't like it. Waste of space.  <br>Yeah they're pretty much useless. I hate how the whole education system (both school and university) has to be all culturally sensitive to them "oh you cant say the English settled in Australia, they "invaded" Aboriginal land"</br>  <br>whats the point in being so racist tho, this is a question to you. What does it achieve? We're all humans.</br>  <br><br>Haha cunt</br></br>  <br> racist <br> used as an insult <br><br>well it's official then: /b/ is dead</br></br></br></br>  <br>Topkek, spoken like a true SJW</br>  <br>Have you ever had to deal with a indiginie?</br>  <br>/b/ has always been dead.</br>  <br> uluru not eyres rock <br>I got told off for that once</br></br>  I went to Australia Day celebrations in Hobart. Watched the parade. At the very end a group of abos were marching with 'Invasion Day' placards, right behind the parade. Nobody said anything, and the cops escorted them. Racist fucking coons.  <br>Hahaha. Have you heard of America? No racists or egomaniacs there hey..</br>  <br>No, Aus vs the world and how Aus is paradise and they have it all and everyone wants/should want to live there...<br>Thing is "the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence" and many people i"ve met here or even i can tell that's oh so true.</br></br>  <br>Try living in the Top End. If you don't lock it the local coons will steal it. All they do is drink all day and beat the shit out of each other at night, In the morning the local hospital fixes them up so they can start again. There is nothing left in the gene pool ...</br>  <br> When non-Aboriginals want to 'reclaim Australia' <br>Oh I was here first and even though my culture says no one owns the land, the land is actually mine, and also all of your tax money that comes out of your salary every week, that goes to me so I can drink a goon bag each day and you white doctors can revive me after each stroke/heart attack or whatever you shit white cunts call the dreamtime. <br>Anyway, you white cunts are really racist this is our black country and yous took it from us man.</br></br></br>  <br>More inclined to shoot you with guns only their country's army should possess, and a shit ton of problem yeah. <br>For the record my country is going downhill and faster that you can hi too.<br>And just like in my country, USA has the opposite problem: excessive laws against racism, eg: catch a blackcor arabic dude who commited a crime? Racist. Muslim in middle age clothes everywhere, you don't like it ? You're racist etc</br></br></br>  <br>You spelt murica wrong</br>  <br>*say hi</br>  <br><br> he thinks australian aboriginals are humans </br></br>  <br> my country is going downhill <br>Australia<br>Aboriginal get caught stealing a car and breaking into 5 shops..... here's your free lawyer<br>White person gets caught stealing a car and breaking into 5 shops...... go directly to jail, do not pass go, any money you have shall be given to Aboriginals because 250 years the English did bad things. What? I don't care if you're not English you have to pay because you're a 'white cunt'</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> replies to the wrong comment <br><br> lrn2grammarnazi faggot </br></br></br></br>  <br>I just learned about this shit in my culture, race and ethics class. They're like america's native americans. Fuck it feels good not to be the only country to really fuck someone over like that.</br>  There was a point when australia was numero uno, then the libs sold off a whole heap of our public utilities for a gold star and our "progressive" laws became out dated.<br><br><br> only a countries military should poses  <br><br>Get off of /b/, you're too young.<br><br> mfw some fag thinks the shit civilians can buy would be of any use to the military. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There have been always those in whom history will have trusted and filtered with but will not have enough specialized art</br>  <br>Hobartfag here, agreed that they are useless.<br><br>Not a week goes by without some sort of coon protest on parliament lawns</br></br></br>  <br>Abos are nothing like the American Indians. Native Americans invented the bow and arrow, domesticated horses, planted crops. Aussie coons sat in the dirt for a millennium waiting for a dole office to open near them.</br>  <br>All the cool countries did it; even innocent buttfaggotry Canada displaced a lot of its indigenous tribes</br>  Creating definition of what a "Plebsantry" is, get in here and give me some shit to write down.  <br>Apple, iPhones, OSX, MacBooks, black men, Bill Gates, money, UK, Miami.</br>  <br><br>Got them both down</br></br>  <br>You're baiting aren't you?</br>  Get rekt  Bump, fast or 404  Bump  <br>Hory shit bump</br>  bump  <br><br>Bump</br></br>  <br>Bampitty bamp bamp bump</br>    One more  Im alone with op in this thread  <br>explain</br>  <br>  <br>fuck yes</br></br>  <br><br>Goddamn I love this.</br></br>  Meeehh  <br>Is she kill?</br>  "GET" rekt  <br>I would've done the same thing.</br>  <br><br>ye she is die</br></br>  <br>Collapse</br>  <br>Love this, wish it didn't cut out.</br>  <br>This is how they should deal with riots.</br>  <br>its a trick to make you pass out.

Thats what happens when the people dont pay taxes  <br>What are you talking about, anon? I'm sure every lawyer in Greece earned 12k Euros/year</br>  <br>The situation is a mess of gigantic proportions.<br> Greeks living beyond their means <br> Everyone and their cat were put in the public sector for the sake of corrupt government re-election <br> Meritocracy goes bye bye <br> Pensions at 57 <br> Loans in the 90s by Germany to Greek banks, to loan investors who then bought German products, essentially reinforcing the German economy and plunging Greece into debt. <br> Germany took advantage of Greek government corruption, making billions. <br> Golman sachs helped Greece cook the books, economy is fine... Except its not, debt is not sustainable, oh shit we've defaulted. <br> Creditors refuse to proceed to debt haircuts that would mean German and French banks would lose money. Instead they protect the banks, give us new loans to pay the old loans, and bring harsh austerity measures.  <br> 5 years in, suicides up by 30%, clientele-based system still standing. Poor working class Greeks take it full up the ass. Rich Greeks not paying taxes, protected by corrupt government. Middle class completely destroyed - forced to migrate. <br> Syriza government brings hope to new generation of Greeks <br> Dr Varoufakis explains that we need restructuring and haircuts, not more loans. <br> Eurozone ministers have shit for brains, decide to side with Reich (Schauble) and his vision for Germany to be fiscal overlord. <br> Compromise happens, we hand over sovereignty (public assets) as well as even harsher measures. <br> Kicked can down the road. Will be in exact same place in three years unless there is debt relief. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Lel faggot, you can't even defeat a bunch of kurd rebels, and you think that you can defeat one of the best nato airforces? Go make me a kebab sandnigger.</br>  <br>Avoiding taxes is the national sport in Greece. As is avoiding paying for anything at all. <br>Getting a payout, pension or anything free is the desired outcome.</br></br>  <br>doesnt that make them dindus?</br>  This is a really good summary of the clusterfuck that is Greece. We should have never lent them money, they barely collect taxes and they retire so much earlier than the rest of Europe<br>www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=C8xAXJx9WJ8<wbr>.</wbr>  [ ]</br>  Are Greek women hot?

How the fuck do you expect an economy to run when there is no money to run it  <br>This isn't even possible. Most people in the world (an i huess in greece) are just employees, which means that they automatically pay taxes, whether they want or not, when they get paid. It's not possible that 85% are self employed.</br>  <br>Yes, because everything that happens in this world must be in some way related to America. Try again.</br>  <br>Kurds killing turkish niggers, I dont really care, let them destroy each other. <br><br>Plus greeks lost ALL of the dogfights on Aegean sea.

Only poor people payed like 5€ for their taxes and the rich just went to their personal island.<br><br>It's incredible dumb</br></br></br>  <br>Yiss</br>  <br>U from Greece nigga? Im curious about the riot yesterday, how is the Greece population doing?

Minimum Wage is 580 Euros/month. These are amongst the lowest in Europe.<br><br>Citation can be provided, but a quick google search can confirm this.<br><br>Don't beleive everything you read on your stupid press. Yes they have made mistakes, but I seriously doubt that Greeks "deserve" (sic) to be in the shitty position they are.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wrong. They hid debts to get into the eurozone. Once in eurozone they could borrow at very cheap rates. Then there was a GLOBAL crash, the cost of borrowing want up. Debts from decades could not be paid back. This is the 3rd bailout. Greece should have never been allowed to join the eurozone.</br>  <br>Yes, I believe that you freaking Greektard.<br><br>Greeks are Gypsy-tier.<br><br>It shows, they don't know how to run a country, no morals, corruption everywhere, they have no economy running.<br><br>Tourism is only thanks to the location, climate and the remnants of the Ancient time.<br><br>Greeks are really the worst.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>HAHAHAHAH TURKS<br><br><br>HAHAHAHAHAA<br><br>really,turks are funny manlets<br><br>everyone knows why noone wants them in the EU<br><br>cuz they suk dik and eurolords dont want gay faggits</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  kek, This is what really happening  <br>Ur a fucking dipshit u know that</br>  We are all responsible for whats happening in our country,greece.<br>However,it is a beautiful place to visit.<br><br> pic kinda related </br></br></br>  <br>Still only employers can evade, not employees.

Europe needed interests on these money but different for each country (becouse of economical stuff that i really don't wanna explain).<br>So for example if Germany (most facilitated country) takes 1'000'000 she gives back 1'000'010<br>but greece if takes 1'000'000 has to give 2M.<br><br>SO Greece had to pay back these debts and they put a LOOOOOOOT of taxes and reduced the population to a third world country level and after 25 years of paying debts Germany still wants these debts back and Greece just can't take it no more</br></br></br></br></br>  Dieses ganze Halbwissen auf 4chan immer. Schlimm, wirklich schlimm.  <br>Is that a lot?</br>  <br> The walking debt <br>kek'd</br></br>  <br> Greek pilots have achieved in total 18 "kills" against USAF Aggressors while suffering only 3 losses in air-to-air combats-the last during a mission of protecting a HVAA target with 4 aircraft against 12 USAF Aggressors fighters. <br>The first day of the drill scoring was 11-0 to Greek pilots and to the last mission,mentioned above,they have managed 7 "kills" against Aggresors fighters while loosing only 3 in exchange.</br></br>  <br> what the fuck is going on in greece? <br><br><br>Pic related.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Creditors refuse to proceed to debt haircuts that would mean German and French banks would lose money. Instead they protect the banks, give us new loans to pay the old loans, and bring harsh austerity measures.  <br>Nope that's not true. The debt is owned not by the banks, but by the governments. The debt was bought with taxpayer money. If there is a "haircut", it means that it's the money of the taxpayers, of the people, that is lost. Why should every citizen in French and Germany pay like 600€ out of their pocket so that Greece can keep being corrupt and dysfunctional? A haircut basically means that the Greek government is directly funded with taxes of other European countries, and that's not acceptable.</br></br>  <br>then go ahead and enlighten us faggot. oh thats right. u know nothing</br>  <br><br> 2010 </br></br>  <br>probably the most helpful post on /b/ for weeks</br>  <br>I'm sorry you feel that way.<br>Yes, a disproportionately large part of our society is exactly as you describe.

Europeans are playing hardball with Greece because for the past seven years the Greeks have dragged their feet and implemented as few reforms as they could get away with, and have generally given no sign that they are genuinely willing to fix, or even acknowledge, the fundamental problems with their economy and culture.<br><br>The rest of Europe is tired of being jerked around by Greece. That's why they're getting zero leeway in negotiations - because they have proven time and time again that if left to make decisions for themselves they will just fuck it up over and over and over again.<br><br>I kind of hope that the debacle with Varoufakis - he dragged out negotiations for months in the belief that he could bluff the European into giving in, which wasted precious time and let Greece's economy spiral further downwards - will be a wake up call for Greeks. All the people who voted for Syriza so enthusiastically will hopefully realise that their party, and by extension themselves, have been talking shit all this time. <br><br>I mean, obviously they won't actually realise that, they're Greeks.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can only speak for the people I know but a lot of them work part time and shit like this.<br><br>This pretty much lower the overall working hours</br></br></br>  <br>Of course we fucked up before that.

By pouring mmore money into Greece without forcing reforms, all you're going to invest in is corruption<br>- Not doing it for Germany after WWI is what lead to WWII. Not doing it to Greece is not going to cause WWIII, so the major incentive is not there.<br>- It was crucial to get West Germany to stand back up because there was USSR and the sovietic bloc on the other side. There's not much on the other side of Greece.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The Greek actually did a lot of concessions for the Troika. The Troika always believed it would help the economy, all it did was ruin it even more. Greece got tired of that, they want some space to breathe you know</br>  <br><br>They have a culture of not really paying tax.<br>They have a culture of retiring early, and of being paid well retiring.<br><br>Combine the two, and you have no fucking money.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>...and there's my answer to my next question; "Why the whole 'boycott Germany' thing?"<br><br>Thanks anon, you rock :)</br></br></br></br>  <br>a good majority of them still believe in greek mythology.
