[ ITT: Girls who most guys think are ugly but you want to marry  <br>i thought she was hot when i first saw her, but then i saw her in a bikini not long after. yuck</br>  Cringe Thread <br><br>Plz contribute</br></br>  <br>That's not cringe. My father in law has PTSD. Fuck you, you bastard</br>  'buting  <br>Sorry but your father is a pussy. Fucking fireworks.<br><br> kek </br></br></br>    Honestly, OP is probably ex military. I'm ex military with two tours to Iraq as an 11B(Infantry) and with PTSD. OP probably didn't do shit or hes just a faggot with no respect    <br><br>I´m not even american and your comment made me rage. <br><br>You´re a little faggot.</br></br></br></br>      <br><br>I imagine I'd like to beat your ass if I met you in public<br><br>see you cringing all the way back to your mom's minivan crying after that ass-whooping, believe that</br></br></br></br>    <br>b&amp;. too bad they made /mlp/ a fucking blue board</br>  <br>Someone put a lot of hard time and effort to make these...</br>  <br>And yet it only makes it that much more cringe worthy.<br>How does that make you feel anon?</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>severe case of butthurt detected</br></br></br></br>  <br>maybe some day <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;630636818 </br>  <br> Fighting somebody over pussies being scared of pretty lights  <br><br> mfw </br></br></br>  <br>was worth it<br><br><br>like your gay</br></br></br></br>  <br>why should the entire town have to tip-toe around your father's mental condition? either get it sorted or fuck off to a place that don't set off fireworks, cunt.</br>      <br>reminds me of the tails comic.</br>  <br>where does your dad in law live? I would like to honor him in the way he deserves; with fireworks.</br>  <br> That's not cringe. My father in law has PTSD. Fuck you, you bastard <br><br>Your father in law is a pussy and so is every other faggot with PTSD. All those bitches should kill themself instead of being attention whores.<br><br>Bet all those pussies thought they'd be bad asses when they got to war hahhaha</br></br></br></br></br>    PTSD is a made up "disease" for attention whores.   PTSD <br>You are fucking pussies, thats all there is to it, you have a weak will, a weak constitution and are easily persuaded.<br>I know people who had to run over fucking children and hear the bones crunch, watch their friends take shrapnel and bleed out over the course of days and they come back and live life normally because they can differentiate civilian life from war.<br><br>once again, you are a fucking pansy.</br></br></br></br>      <br>all fap memories are linked</br>  <br>I highly doubt that....good story tho</br>  <br>is that what these are called? and how are they linked</br>  <br>I wish my cum was pink</br>  <br><br>Agree with this guy. 11B airborne infantry, to vacations to iraq, blown up 3 times, never once flinched at a firework. I love things that go boom. Fags that put up those signs never did shit. Also, if you ever hear some faggot say some shit like I'd tell you what I did but I'd have to kill you' that is instant proof that they never did anything relevant in the military.</br></br>  <br> believe that <br><br>That's a wrestling catch phrase lol. Guy named Roman Reigns says it. You mad cus you had to pack up your shitty confederate flag?</br></br></br>  <br>PTSD for war vets is real. Tumblr PTSD on the other hand, is not.</br>  <br>have you tried cumming in a pink room?</br>  <br>Says this fat beta faggot who sits inside all day. Maybe he was just courageous enough to fight for the civil liberties which you enjoy with no effort or value yo society at all</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>BRONIES GET OUT</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> to vactions to iraq <br><br>Did they extract your brain as well?</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>I dunno man. People handle those kinds of things differently. Loud noises like engines back firing or fireworks still set me off pretty hard. It's hard to get rid of the 'oh shit gotta return fire oh shit take cover' response your body automatically adopts after a few combat tours. I want people to enjoy fireworks, but it sucks feeling like i'm back in desert when they do</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Prove you have fought for any actual civil liberties lol<br><br>Pro tip: you can't</br></br></br>  Worst cringe thread I've ever seen. Just pony porn and a bunch of 3edgy5me underage faggots thinking they're tough because they can call combat veterans pussies from their computer chairs. Kill yourselves faggots.  <br>A fucking men to this.<br><br>I'm a defense contractor who works with a ton of vets and active military. All the PTSD faggots are people who NEVER saw combat but have all these "stories"</br></br></br>  <br>Huuuuurr I played army man with some sand niggers now loud noises scares me<br>Fuck off with your ptsd faggot and man up</br></br>  <br><br/></br>    <br>Dub dubs dont lie /bro/</br>  <br>No your right. Like i said i did two tours to Iraq as an 11B, but I don't put up the signs. fireworks don't really bother me. still with that being said, you still kinda have some what of respect...you don't know what he did...just saying. the only problem i had was adjusting back as a civilian. but after so many months, you lose the habits.</br>  <br><br>looks like that nigger needs to go camping in the middle of oklahoma with sound-canceling headgear for one night of the year</br></br>  <br>Bronies ruin everything</br>    <br>TIL typos = no brain</br>  <br>Its lack of self control.<br>You literally just admitted you cannot control this.<br>You have 100% control over your emotion and response, even if your body automatically responds to something, its up to you to reinforce this behavior or change it by CONCIOUSLY deciding that this is the wrong decision. Its kind of the thing that makes humans human, the fact that we can break way from our natural urges and instincts with just willpower.</br></br></br>  <br>you havn't seen many</br>  <br> faggots thinking they're tough because they can call combat veterans pussies from their computer chairs. <br><br><br>over 90% of PTSD military people NEVER SAW COMBAT.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why would you go to Amsterdam for coffee</br>    <br>Go back to reddit faggot</br>    <br> I sat in a base watching videos of drone strikes and playing PS3 for a year <br> I have PTSD now </br></br>  <br>I call them pussies to their faces too faggot.<br>I just so happen to be on 4chan.<br><br>Every single military friend calls them pussies and liars too, because they have the willpower and the logic to realize they are now living as a CIVILIAN</br></br></br></br>    <br>even though the PTSD is not his fault and he is a swell guy, it is his responsibility to put ear plugs and wear muffs</br>  <br> You have 100% control over your emotion. <br><br>lol you're so full of shit, you sound like a sociopath.</br></br></br>    <br><br>HAHA Classic Comeback. I reward you +5</br></br>  <br>PLOT TWIST: This thread IS the cringe.</br>  I always remember my granddad who was in WW2 going on about how anyone with "PTSD" is a total pussy.      Still haven't cringed... Furries are just faggoting up the thread...    <br>sauce</br>    <br>Sociopath?<br>Yes, because I have complete domain over my feelings and responses.<br>Its not hard, you reinforce the feelings that are appropriate and blot out the feelings that are not.<br>If this is being a sociopath I don't want to be normal.<br>I don't know when it became trendy to be an emotional wreck that disregards all logic and refuses to believe they have power over their own brain.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I know, it's not something that happened quickly for me though. Get huge adrenaline everytime something loud happens, pretty much feels like shit. I suppose its pretty much like an irrational phobia, like some people are scared of peaches or whatever. I don't want to be all amped up, but I can't help it from happening every single time</br>    Idk but this was funny  this is not a thread about things that make you cringe, OP and the shitposters in this thread are meant to make you cringe    <br>yeesh<br><br>also noice trips</br></br></br>  <br>You faggots "cringing" at veterans politely asking to not fucking remind them of the shit they had to endure. Obvious not army people pretending they know that vets just dicked around.<br><br>It just goes to show how disconnected from society you guys really are. And you will probably be proud of that. disgusting</br></br></br>  <br>why such a hater satan?</br>  mexithread<br>vamos a conocernos mejor negros<br>digan su carrera<br>casa de estudios<br>edad<br>de donde son</br></br></br></br></br>  Derailed!<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=5WW<wbr>oR61fJiA</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>negocios<br>itesm<br>22<br>san luis potosi</br></br></br></br>  <br>bumpeo</br>  <br>Ingeniero Petrolero<br>UNAM<br>28<br>Veracruz</br></br></br></br>  <br>de Oaxaca</br>    <br>psicologia<br>iteso<br>20<br>torreon</br></br></br></br>  <br>what in the fuck did you say boy?<br>we speak english here</br></br>  CEO del grupo exclusivo de OC<br>Mexicali<br>33</br></br>  penetrador de tu madre<br>el coño de tu madre<br>de aqui</br></br>  <br>¬¬ cmon annon, theres no femon here, theres a myth</br>  <br>Querétaro<br>Comercio Internacional (Univa)<br>21</br></br></br>  <br>Sistemas<br>Tec de Laredo<br>20<br>T-tamaulipas</br></br></br></br>    <br>cual es el grup?</br>  <br>nasty</br>  <br><br>Meh si la cogia</br></br>  Prepa<br>Neza<br>16</br></br>    gracias OP por el thread tan chingon  o lo rescato?<br>creo ire por pizza</br>      <br>bump</br>  <br>monterrey raza maestra<br>derecho<br>tec<br>21</br></br></br></br>  Gastronomo<br>UVA<br>21<br>Mexicali</br></br></br>    <br>bumpo</br>  Regio Maistro Race<br>Musico / Metalero \m/<br>26</br></br>  <br>que puto asco</br>  <br>Mecánica Naval<br>CetMar<br>19<br>Alguna carrera de Universidad que me recomienden que tenga que ver con motores??<br>Hagan paro Anons</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>bumpo</br>  puro anon joto dando sus datos  <br>ingeniero electricista</br>  <br>cajero del oxxo <br>puedes ser el que dice<br>  en la otra caja le cobran :v </br></br></br>  Pornografo<br>28 <br>Te vale verga</br></br>  <br>Ingeniero en diésel</br>  alguien tiene el link del grupo de mexicali oc? que se role putos  <br>Ingenieria en Oxxo's</br>  Que onda !<br>Pues empiezo.<br>Paramédico (Técnico en Urgencias Médicas, como le quieran llamar)<br>20 años<br>Aguascalientes</br></br></br></br>    <br>Si <br>Concuerdo con .</br></br>  <br>inbox</br>  <br>Ne me digas</br>  <br> checked</br>  <br>dale</br>  <br>Si<br>Concuerdo con <br>Pero no con <br>Talvez con <br>Vomitas con </br></br></br></br></br>  Enfermero Obstetra<br>ENEO-UNAM<br>25 <br>Chilango</br></br></br>  Bronce uno ,todas las lineas  <br>Que tal te va en la carrera ?

Is rocket league worth buying? I've heard really good things.</br>  I have a headache bad and a huge paper due on monday at midnight, yet here I am on 4chan procrastinating  <br>Oh yeah! Pretty fun when you don't go try hard mode</br>  I'm not sure how I feel.<br>I think I'm going to have to settle for sadly inclined.</br>  <br>Hey OP, thanks for the post. How are you?<br><br>As for me, I'm kinda doing better. Business is improving, getting closer to that grill. Failing my math class though... So it's so-so.</br></br></br>  <br>also to add to that I've been pretty depressed lately. I feel like I am wasting my time in college studying for a degree I literally hate. I have no idea what Im going to do with my life and Im probably going to end up in the military. fuck ;(</br>  Gym was closed early since it was Sunday so I didn't get to go, that sucked. <br><br>But hey, got an interview tomorrow and employment would be nice so that's good</br></br>  <br>I'm wondering why you chose this specific image to start each and every thread with.</br>  <br>sunday is as good a rest day as any bruh. You shouldnt be going to the gym 7 days a week anyways</br>  <br>I am glad to hear that you are doing better.<br><br><br>I'll have to try it out then.</br></br></br></br>  <br>i hate him so much</br>  <br>Why?</br>   tfw OP doesnt even respond to your posts   had a few drinks, in bed right now. thinking about what has recently happened, being an emotional faggot.  Shitty as fuck. I would be rich if I didn't spend all my money on heroin. It's so hard to stop. I literally need it now to even go to work or do anything productive.  <br>Maybe so, I just feel real lazy and guilty when I miss a day ya know?</br>  <br>If you truly hate college, you should consider dropping out. Your happiness should come first.</br>  <br>ignores me so he can hang out with this girl he "loves" so he can listen to her bitch about her bf while she treats him like shit</br>  <br>feels. Same here bro</br>  <br>same here. Today was my rest day though. Its good to take a solid day to rest and chill out. I kill it in the gym 6 days a week I think I deserve at least one day off. So do you lol</br>  <br>Sounds like a shitty situation. Sorry :(</br>  <br>I cant drop out because then I'll end up enlisting in the military. At least if I finish school I'll be able to become an officer in the Military.<br><br>I know I need to be happy but the unfortunate reality of life is that sometimes you gotta suffer through some shit to make it to where you want to be :/<br><br>having a real hard time taking my own advice though</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah that's fair, I've more than earned a rest for this week lmao. I just love that feeling of getting a sweat on and getting a pump going and I miss it when I'm just sitting around the house</br>  <br>Dad is cheating. My mom found out. Im not sure if they are getting a divorce. If that happens, i will no longer be able to go to med school.<br><br>Still can't get my license as a pharmacist since in only 20. (Also career as a pharmacist in my country really suck. Thry do not really acknowledge pharmacist here unlike other countries. Low salary grade. So i really want to go to med school)</br></br></br>  I'm feeling shitty, i dont know who am i. I feel i'm not true to myself but how to do it i dont know.  <br>I mean you don't HAVE to join the military. Is your family pushing you to enlist or something?</br>  Just graduated from college without getting a pussy<br><br>Fucking shit what is wrong with me</br></br>  <br>Little bit of both<br><br> got shitfaced last night at bar <br> thought i made ass of myself <br> i did <br> friends are cool with it and got my back <br> dog shit all over the basement again <br> that sucked </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Go to rehab fucker</br>  <br>nothing faggot you're perfectly fine grow out of your human nature, become superior, abandon your need for social interaction, live a life of erudition, learn multiple languages, instruments, engineering, medicine, learn a bit of everything, stop being a sheep that only cares about sticking your penis into a warm hole. Unless you enjoy being the animal we are raised to be</br>  <br>What course are you taking?</br>  <br>great. I just griefed my gf's minecraft world and now she's not talking to me</br>  <br>Yay! Jinx-chan is back!! :) just made my night better seeing this thread</br>  <br>have you done any of those things?</br>  <br>But i want pussy!!!<br><br>Btw im going to med school next month.</br></br></br>  Pretty good<br> have a job <br> passed my college exams <br> got a gf <br> got weed </br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm currently engaged in doing so. It'll take my entire life but I don't even care.</br>  <br>Haha cool, been in med school for a year and a half now. Enjoy it to its fullest, it's a pretty fascinating area</br>  Is OP even here?<br><br>Wtf</br></br>  <br>You can't just abandon your need for social interaction.<br><br><br>Hello friend</br></br></br></br>  feeling kind of shitty because i don't know what to do with my life and even if i did its all pointless in the end and even complaining about it is pointless because its not like i'm going to remember it when i'm dead so why do i fucking do anything  <br>Did you get a lot of pussy?</br>  <br>Not too shabby. Today's my B-day and got about $100 cash. Had nothing really planned so went to a casino and left with $300. Would of left with $400 but my friend wasn't ready to go so my money kind of trinkled down. <br><br>So far so good.</br></br></br>  Dealing with deep gender dysphoria, not wanting to change who I am because I friends/family who love me and say they support me.. But I fear, especially that I might hurt my girlfriend. ~MtF  <br>oh, the child porno trafficking going through league of legends servers?<br>that shit's going to get them all killed, rest assured</br></br>  <br>Of course not. However, I must admit it .. hmm, opens doors that make it much easier to be achieved kek, have fun</br>  <br>Tell them asap, man. The sooner they know the better</br>  <br>What are your plans to use the money on?</br>  <br>Indeed, it can't simply be done over a night. But it is possible, I'm quite sure of it</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  My girlfriend broke up with me 3 years ago. Still not over it. We didnt have contact in 2 years. <br>She texted me yesterday 'by accident'. She still has her boyfriend and I know I won't ever get her back. We had a pretty good talk yesterday though. Pretty depressed right now</br>  <br>That's what I heard too. Anyway, any tips on the first year</br>  <br>Some toward credit card debt, some to savings, rest for a small get together. Nothing special.</br>  Hi everybody! I'm Doctor Nick!<br>No but seriously, just woke up and showered. Think it'll be a day of sherbet bombs and reading.</br>  <br>Sounds like some serious existential crisis shit you got going on my man</br>  last year, my girlfriend of 2 years killed herself, i decided to move on with my life<br>things got worse, so i moved, i have 0 friends, and i barely like the area i live in<br>ive been depressed for a year now, and i have gotten really poor, i dont know the language enough to actually get a job, and i look really bad, in the worst conditition.<br>i started to sell weed, which payed for food and rent, it worked for a while until now. i havent eaten in 3 days, im going to be kicked out tomorrow, i owe a decent sum of money, i have no money and cant get a job, i called my family a little while ago, they dont wanna even talk to me, they really dont like me. <br>give me one reason i shouldnt an hero<br>none of that "your worth it" shit, i am really not, i am not worth it, i have not done ONE thing in my life to make someone change for the better, so why does it matter?, it wont make a difference in anyone's lives, my family could go about a 6-7 months without knowing im alive.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Been experimenting with Tinder for the past few weeks <br> Trying out different combinations of pictures and bios <br> Expand radius to 20 miles <br> No matches for 3 weeks <br> Get my first match <br> She messages first <br> She's cute. Really cute. Freckles with pixie-cut hair and a tiny nose. <br> Is_this_what_being_desired_feels_l<wbr>ike.png</wbr> <br> We chat, she talks about meeting up <br> "Can I tell you about what I'm going to do after we go for coffee?" <br> THISISIT.bmp <br> She sends several kinky messages about some sexual scenario (which I have already deleted out of shame) <br> My dick is diamonds at this point <br> Nudes here I come <br> One of the lines is "but something doesn't feel right..." <br> canyoufeelitmr.krabs.webm <br> I could feel it all fall apart <br> Sends me some shit about biting my dick off and pickling my eyes <br> I try and play it off and attempt to politely end the convo as quickly as possible <br> "Lol sorry for that. I saw another convo my friend showed me with that and I just had to try it out. You seem like a nice guy and I wish you the best of luck with Tinder We can still talk if you like, but I have a boyfriend though." <br> Decline poletely and bid her a good night <br> Reported for inappropriate messages <br> Blocked <br> Conversation deleted <br> Tinder deleted <br> Phone off and in a drawer <br><br>So yes, you could say I'm feeling shitty.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty sure I'm going to die of renal failure in the next few weeks. Also I smoke and vape too much and I'm beginning to feel numbness and pins and needles in my right hand for no reason all the time.</br>  <br>Bummer dude.<br> Dat filename tho </br></br>  <br>Why not move to area where you speak the fluent language? <br><br>Why did you have to move in the first place anyway?</br></br></br>  <br>That depends on where you live, I guess. There's though one thing that you should be aware of, regardless of your location. Med school isn't something that you should join for the ''status'' it will give you and by that I mean you shouldn't be joining it to get a lot of pussy. Sure, there's no problem in getting them, but you must not forget what's your real purpose there. As for the first year... well, that really depends so I'm afraid I can't be of much help. Simply study as much as you can (no need to push yourself too much as you need time to adapt so take your time) so that you don't regret anything later</br>  And if you save yourself You will make him happy He'll keep you in a jar And you'll think you're happy He'll give you breathing holes And you'll think you're happy He'll cover you with grass And you'll think you're happy now  I've decided I'm taking a break from everyone for a week or so because I was feeling like shit. But I just watched blades of glory for the first time and it was great. I hope this'll help me get back to feeling good again.  <br>i speak it fluently but i have an accent, most places literally wont hire me because of that</br>  <br>*the language fluently<br><br>My bad</br></br></br>  <br>Where do you live currently?</br>  <br>Freaking the fuck out.

Go out with friends 3 days before the exam</br></br></br>  <br> what is clinical depression </br>  <br>Ehhh masturbation thing I'm not sure about. I doubt I'd get a decent night's sleep otherwise.

Written it?</br></br></br>  <br>Go to psychiatrist</br>  <br>I love you so much, anon</br>  <br>Alright anon. Let me tell you:<br><br>I feel like my dick has sunk into hellfire. It's taking extreme focus to not feel a raging pleasure in my penis so intense it burns me in an unnatural way. If I don't put all my being into my focus, I slip into a maddening state where I feel doped up as fuck and like my dick is about to birth the Leviathan.<br><br>I've fapped over 6 times today already. I'm not shooting blanks yet and my overall load today could probably suffice as a drink. Fapping only relieves the pain for about 10 minutes.<br><br>Please help me. This has never happened before. Please tell me I'm not the only one.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>please tell me you're gay and live in vegas</br>  <br>you didnt take viagra did you</br>  <br>I'm struggling to... I don't even</br>  <br>Had depression for 13 years. The only way its going to get better is medication. Therapy just doesn't work without it. I mean it can work, but usually it doesn't work for something as serious as long term depression. And you're right you'll never be as happy as you once were, but that's just part of growing up.</br>  <br>Well, it was based on personal experience hahaha<br>Masturbating the night before, makes me sleepy and lazy the next day (makes me feel like not answering the exam at all)<br><br>Bring candy an acetaminophen</br></br></br></br>  <br>I want whatever you're on</br>  <br><br><br>Been there, done that<br><br><br>Thanks, I posted in one of these last weekend or the weekend before, can't remember, pretty much the same story tho</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>no. no I don't. but I might crack and start thinking I am.<br><br><br>No drugs. No drugs at all.<br><br><br>Don't say that anon that is not making me less stressed. Did I blow a dopamine receptor or something? All I can find online is people worries about STDs and itchy penises or creams for making you less sensitive so you can fuck longer. There is an alien in my dick.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>same here<br>feel with me bros</br></br></br>  <br>For sure.</br>  <br>Kidney stone?</br>  <br>tell him what you feel for him<br>hating him it's worse</br></br>  <br>Uhhh what?<br><br>Go seek professional help, man.</br></br></br>  <br>Hallo, neger<br>Welches Bundesland?</br></br>  <br>hessen</br>  <br>Watch one piece</br>  <br>Well, if it's an erectile dysfunction it can't possibly be related to a dopamine receptor malfunction. Not sure but try and look up on priapism</br>  <br>Been over 2 months now and I'm still obsessing about that girl everyday. She broke my fucking heart and she knew what she was doing when she did it. She was so vindictive and malicious. I hate her and I miss her at the same time. It's gotten a little better recently but everyday I still wake up and wish I wasn't in this bed. I'm disappointed that I'm not 600 miles away waking up next to her I'm going to work. She was my whole life for 3 years and she threw it away because she's a fucking whore.</br>  <br>Its frustration I don't actually hate him. I have, we've fucked and done other things but he doesn't love me.</br>  <br>Lol why?</br>  <br>I have a few of these days. Where you just cannot get rid of a raging boner. No idea how to fix it. If it's been 5-6 hours, go see a doctor.</br>  <br>maybe because One Piece is the greatest Manga ever made...</br>  FEELING SHITTY BECAUSE I'M GODDAMNED TIRED OF LIFE AND MY PSYCHIATRIST AND THERAPIST DO NOTHING TO HELP. PROBABLY GOING TO STAB MYSELF TO DEATH IN A FEW HOURS. GO AHEAD AND SAY SOMETHING TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.  <br> One Piece is the greatest Manga ever made... </br>  <br>Watching TV shows doesn't really do anything for my situation. It'd be a huge time commitment anyway.</br>  <br>go away spooky bony dog man.</br>  Laying in bed faking illness so I don't have to go out with my family tomorrow. It's not that I wouldn't enjoy going, but I'm a depressed fuck that would just drag their mood down.  <br>You should just keep living</br>  <br>Lol one piece makes me happy.</br>  <br>YOU SEE, NO EVEN GIVES A FUCK.</br>  <br>Willst du umziehen? Biete Maisonettewohnung, Freundeskreis und Gras damit du nicht mehr so ein faggot bist</br>    <br>Oh thank God. I'll just try and sleep it off.</br>  <br>ANON! ONLY YOU CAN PREVENT</br>  <br>I'm your therapist. That's why.</br>  <br>Feeling pretty damn shitty. Everything in my life is going great, I just got a new guitar, got back from vacation, and I got a new project for my landscaping business today.<br><br>But the girl I like heard a rumor about me last night and won't talk to me now, so the possibility that I won't go on another date with her is *really* fucking with my mood.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, try looking at pictures of boobs. Doing this relaxes and makes me happy</br>  <br>so kill yourself. If you're actually going to stop bitching about others and do it you pussy. Or grow the fuck up and move on.</br>  <br>Ich würde gerne, aber ich kann nicht. nicht sehr gut mit sozialen sprechen. Ich habe soziale Angst und einfach haben Panikattacken.

Macht aber nichts. Überlegs dir</br>  <br>I have some questions.<br><br>I really dont get it.<br><br>When the penis is removed, will you still receive any amount of pleasure at all when you get fucked? If so, where will you be stimulated in order for you to reach orgasm? <br><br>Sorry for being ignorant</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No you wont anon.</br>  Used to have dreams that I was beneath San Francisco, In an underground labyrinth type place. There I would see lizard like humanoids performing rituals that I could not fathom. I would always float back to bed. This all stopped with puberty.  <br>Dont lose hope man. Im 20 and still a virgin. I never had a gf. There's a big chance that i never will but i dont give up.</br>  <br>that's sweet but i'm not special</br>  <br>Haha don't worry mate, I can't speak it that well myself, still struggling to learn. It's just that it seemed like a literal translation from some english text</br>  <br>That is fucking insane</br>  <br>/b/ made me like dicks and assholes though</br>  broke up with my gf of 3 years yesterday, all i want to do is text her and get back together but i know that that wouldn't be good for me, all that combined with the fact that i have no real friends to talk to and indifferent family is driving me insane, i have noone else to talk to about this bullshit  <br>Frustrating, man. Have you tried visiting the actual place?</br>  <br>feeling shitty because of a girl</br>  <br>I'm feeling good, I'm freeballing, listening to BB King for the first time, smoking an ecig, starting a night job tomorrow that ays well, and starting college in a month<br>I have the whole world ahead of me and I can't wait to get my first taste of freedom <br>Fuck, life is real good right now</br></br></br>  <br>Are you faggot? Do u stimulate your anus?</br>  <br>I remember being 16.</br>  <br>when relearning it basically was kinda that<br>i know i have to get in the mindset of a totally different way to speak. i still struggle</br></br>  <br>Nice going, man. What course are you taking?</br>  <br>well, you're on /b/ faggot, plenty of people you can talk to, specially on this thread. I once had a girlfriend who cheated on me. At least she was enough of a woman to tell me face to face. I was somewhat forced to break up after that but I wasn't even mad at her, deep inside I knew that it was partly my fault that she even considered (and did so, after all) cheating on me, so I took my share of the burden. What I'm trying to say is that there are things you can learn from such moments, just look at it from another perspective</br>  <br>is this girl from akuma no riddle or who is she???</br>  <br>Drunk, feel good, eating grilled cheese with smoked cheddar cheese. Its all good man.</br>  <br>Only when my roommate buys phallic food products.</br>  <br>Feeling not too bad, but not too good either. I'm starting to slump back into that lonely state of mind.</br>  Been talking to this chick for about 4 months. Been on numerous dates and then she got back with her ex and couldn't see me because she didn't want to end up cheating on him. Got told I was basically second best, but if she wasn't with him she'd be with me. They broke up so we've been talking again, but she's on a trip to Australia right now and she told me she "fell asleep" in some guys bed.. But that she "didn't fuck him or anything". She's acting kinda distant with me when she texts me too.<br><br>Losing hope.</br></br>  <br>What happened?</br>  <br>Why not try and text her? Do it man. It's better to try and fail than regret not doing anything at all.<br><br>I've been there. It sucks</br></br></br>  <br>Don't worry too much, sex isn't as good as it seems honestly... Until you loose your virginity it may feel like it's really important, but after that things will change. This goes to all virgin bros out there.</br>  <br>I love seeing this thread here and I'm glad to see it again tonight.</br>  <br> i'm not special <br>r me<br>that's why i don't need someone special <br>i need someone fucked up enough to like me<br>geez let me stop this shit<br>well, hope you realise that he's a faggot and doesn't deserve you<br>you will get over with it, it's not hard to stop loving someone</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Exactly! Shit, reading it isn't that much difficult, but speaking it in real conversations seems almost impossible, seriously</br>  <br>I'm feeling great, because Britanny Venti's Stream went down by too much<br>▓▓▓▓▓░▓▓▓░░▓░░▓░▓▓░░░▓<br>░░▓░░▓░░░▓░▓░░▓░▓░▓░░▓<br>░░▓░░▓░░░▓░▓▓▓▓░▓░▓░░▓<br>▓░▓░░▓░░░▓░▓░░▓░▓░░▓░▓<br>░▓▓░░░▓▓▓░░▓░░▓░▓░░░▓▓<br>░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░<br>░▓▓▓▓░░▓▓▓▓░▓▓░░░▓░▓░<br>▓░░░░▓░▓░░░░▓░▓░░▓░▓░▓<br>▓░░░░░░▓▓░░░▓░▓░░▓░▓░▓<br>▓░░░░▓░▓░░░░▓░░▓░▓░▓▓▓<br>░▓▓▓▓░░▓▓▓▓░▓░░▓▓░ ▓░▓</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shit man, that sucks. Is she worth putting your life on hold for?</br>  <br>&lt;3</br>  <br>I feel greatish. I smoked a bowl outside, and will probably have another in a couple minutes. But I realize in the back of my mind im just getting stoned because im trying to forget everything that happened to me in the past year. It went something life:<br> Fall into depression <br> Become alcoholic <br> Attempt suicide twice. <br>Been off of booze for awhile, I guess im just waiting for this stuff to compartmentalize so I can go on, while also getting pretty stoned.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>she had a tinder account and was talking to other men, and she is also incredibly self centered and a drain on all my resources. Without her i can go to school, rejoin the gym, quit my second job and just have a healthier life. But going to bed alone and not hearing her voice is like torture man.</br>  <br> See this thread a few days ago <br> Post how I'm feeling <br> Thread 404's <br><br> 30 minutes later see a "why don't you have friends" thread <br> Try to post <br> Thread 404'd <br><br> Make a thread saying I'm depressed <br> No responses <br> Thread 404's <br><br> Spend days browsing /b/ randomly and wondering why I haven't killed myself <br> See ERP thread with some BS first post like "want to relieve some stress?" <br> Post that I'm stressed but cybering won't help <br> Completely ignored <br> Thread 404's <br><br> See this thread <br> Take two </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Potentially a whore.<br><br>Try looking for another woman<br> b-but she is the one for me <br> she's the only one i like <br><br>Seriously. It's obvious that she's just toying with you. I'm sure she is not attracted to you sexually. Maybe she just enjoys talking to you/having your company. But that's that. You wont get pussy<br><br>You are shit-zoned</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Act distant yourself m8. She'll either completely cut any relations she had with you (which isn't that bad at this point) or try to compensate somehow</br>  <br>Yea It's my ex, yesterday night we were going well ( sorry for my english ) talking good, had good fun, but since this afternoon she went like she doesn't want to talk, small answers etc<br><br>and she went to sleep fast like "yea sorry gotta read, see ya tomorrow" Idk men</br></br></br>    <br>Woah man. Should probably get that checked out.</br>  I'm excellent. I got out of the hospital on saturday and spent the weekend getting baked and sitting by a campfire with my parents and girlfriend. Sad i couldn't swim or drink though. Thats the price of casts and pain meds.<br><br>Kinda pissed my home internet is down now. Just decided to turn my phone into a hot spot but i'm probably going to keep reading the divine comedy till i fall asleep.</br></br>  <br>To be honest, yes. She's everything I'm looking for plus some. She's just been acting weird the last few days. I just wish I knew what to do, you know?</br>  Tomorrow I start my new job as a full time call center faggot. It pays better than minimum wage, but im working from noon till night everyday, with no weekends or holidays. <br><br>Is this what life has in store for me? Not even 20 yet and i feel like my life is never going to get better...</br></br>  <br>It's not so much removed as its inverted and yes you can achieve orgasm, though on estrogen orgasms change from being like a firecracker or gunshot, to coming more in waves. For me, unless they can give me a real vagina, I'm not getting surgery.</br>  <br>i care about you anon<br>come here <br>lemme hug you</br></br></br>  <br><br>Anon giving that God-tier advice. <br>Thinking of not responding to her texts for a few days see if she still talks to me. She usually texts me the same time everyday</br></br></br>  <br>I probably will if he doesn't get over this girl. <br>defiantly need more people in my life</br></br>  <br>I'm sorry everyone has been ignoring you. I am here for you. What has you depressed? Or is it just life in general?</br>  <br>The sympathy is appreciated, but ineffective<br><br>Pretending to get a virtual hug is neither appreciated nor effective</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I hear you. It sucks ass to be in that position. It sucks even more that its over text, so you cant really know whats going on.</br>  <br>I think it's obvious that you no longer satisfy her. I also think that if getting away from her makes you a better person, and it is for the best. You are young and you will find many other girls. It will hurt because you love(?) her but it shall pass and you'll become better</br>  <br>Kek<br>The whole stream was people donating with videos of John Cena</br></br>  <br>Has this sort of thing happened before?</br>  feeling lazy thinking about ways to try to get out of jury duty  Wish I was a girl.<br><br> feels bad man </br></br>  I'm feeling beyond shitty <br> thursday be on date with a very nice looking lady <br> things going gr8, <br> I come at her place for drink <br> sex ? <br> constat with dread that I'm not hard  <br> no sex <br> no girl anymore  <br> just me and my floppy dick </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's not so much removed as its inverted and yes you can achieve orgasm, though on estrogen orgasms change from being like a firecracker or gunshot, to coming more in waves.

Gf of 10 months and I have hit our lowest point and I don't know what to do but lay in my bed and just think... She won't talk to me either.  <br>no wonder why you are depressed</br>  <br>Wtf... Did I see an anema girl in the end?</br>  <br>Nyet, some weeks ago I said to her "yea let's talk again but without me having a jealous crisis because I didn't move on since the breakup so<br><br>I don't know is she knows that I still love her y'know <br><br>It's like we were talking fine, and I have no idea why she seems bored</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah man. I know it's for the best, just looking back at all the plans we had, we were going to get a house, have 4 children, settle down, we had a college fund setup for our first child (not born yet) and i was picking out wedding rings to buy to propose. How the fuck does someone throw something like that away? i know i didnt have sex with her as often as i could've but that was from 12 hours working a day i was exhausted. thank you for caring, someone knowing my struggle and actually responding does make me feel like my life is worth something more than a passing glance.</br>  <br>Hey man, I'm sorry you're in that position. Has there been anything to cause a divide between you?</br>  This is the first night I've been sober in six months. I feel shitty.  <br>Why did you two break up? Have you tried telling her how you feel?</br>  <br>I'm proud of you for going sober.</br>  <br>but one can make you feel special<br>and isn't that enough?</br></br>  <br>Thanks for the sympathy man. I guess it's a bit internal. All my friends think I treat her like shit, but she always acts so happy around us. Like she won't admit if I'm doing something wrong. So I'm just thinking about these 10 months and what I should do. I've heard people saying I should change and be more accepting, I just don't know. She's super sensitive and maybe I can't deal. But I love her to death.</br>  <br>Baby, I love you &lt;3<br>You stay strong for me ok? <br>Life gets better don't worry. <br>Here's something that might brighten your day up a bit!</br></br></br></br>  I'm feeling really shitty<br>and I'd love to write about all my problem here on 4chan and get some sympathy<br><br>and then I remember. <br><br>No one gives a fuck about my problems, anonymous or otherwise. <br><br>So I think I'll just go cuddle with my dog and try not to cry myself to sleep like a bitch.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sleepy</br>  <br>What's it that bothers you, anon?</br>  <br>Some people just don't appreciate the efforts that you make. You'll be fine. <br><br>Go to school</br></br></br>  Does anyone know whatever happened to this thread / guy / guys mom? oh and general incest thread    Bump for interest.  <br>whats the context?</br>  Bumping  This guy somehow got past the incest barrier,and the thread ended with him going upstairs to his mom, we waited for ages for him to comeback and tell us what happened. and after a while I left, anyone got the continuation?  bump  BUMPING FOR THE GLORY OF NORTH KOREA  Someone post the rest  bump  <br>oh and this is his friend, he is typing to.. *friend took ss*<br>and btw not his cock on the pic. he wanted /b/ to find him a cock to send to his mom</br></br>  last one I got..
