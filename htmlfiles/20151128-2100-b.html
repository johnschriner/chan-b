B, my gay friend says he'll set me up with a hot girl (who's like his best friend) if I can let him suck me off or have me fuck him. I'm straight, should I do it?  <br>OP is a fag</br>  Well.... the act of gayness will completely cancel out any straight sexual act you perform, so it'll be like nothing happened at all. Your move OP  you get to fuck two people do it  Do it you fucking pussy  <br>No. Gay sex shit is for sure. youll regret that. The hot girl is not for sure. She might not even put out. She might just go on a pity date for the gay friend so he gets some action from you. dont. do. it</br>  <br>if you are gay.. sure<br><br>oh.. and you are gay<br><br>Straight guys dont consider this.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's obviously lying about the girl but you get a free blowjob so it sounds like a pretty good deal.</br>  <br>do it fgt</br>  that fag will give way better head than the girl he will set you up with. pretty winrar if you ask me.  <br>The girl is hot.<br>Like rlly hot.</br></br>  <br>fuck fuckfuckfuckity fuck fuck NO!! well unless your gay but if your not then NO!</br>  Yes.

She was fucked up. She wasn't herself that night. She's usually very sweet. She's not a villain. She's a good person who made a mistake. Good people make mistakes too. They just learn from them and use them to become better people. She didn't need to respond when I contacted her two years later. But she did.

Everytime I see that comically anthropomorphized banana holding his peel in a suggestive manner, likening the peel to clothes and his peel-less nature to human nudity, I bust up laughing. This happens every time, no matter where I am, be it the house or the bus or in class. Sometimes I laugh just thinking about it. This is a dark memory but a few months back I had just gotten done with a fit of laughter caused by one of these hilarious threads. Suddenly my mom walks in and she's crying. I attempted to suppress the growing urge to laugh but it was getting more difficult. Face red, tears running down her aging face, mom grabs my shoulders and says "Your father's dead."<br><br>It was at that moment that I couldn't hold back anymore. I burst into a banana-induced fit of laughter, but the horrible news drew tears to my eyes.
