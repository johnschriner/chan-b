There wasn't any notice that they were talking about this, and there wasn't really any time for anyone to object to it. It all happened very quickly and it would be very difficult to go back on that decision.<br><br>Sure, I agree with what they did this time, but what's to say I'll agree with what they do next. Would I get a chance to speak out against it?</br></br></br></br>  :^)  Majority of 5 decides laws for over 300 million  <br>bump</br>  <br>Same thing with the legalization of weed in Washington and Colorado.</br>  <br>You don't really understand how the westminster system of democratic government works do you.</br>  <br><br>What are you talking about? People have been objecting for the past 50 years. Since the last 5-6 years a majority is for same sex marriage, so they changed it. That's how it's supposed to be, majority decides, instead of the hardest shouter decides, what happened in many other regulations.</br></br>  There are three arms of government:<br>Executive (President &amp; his cabinet)<br>legislative (Congress/Senate)<br>Judiciary (Judges)<br><br>All three are supposed to be a balance for the other. As part of this, it is crucial that the judiciary be appointed &amp; unelected. Judges will often be tasked with making potentially extremely unpopular decisions in the interests of justice. If they are elected they are unlikely to do the fair thing, and will more likely do the thing that gets them re-elected.<br><br>A good example is the Scottsboro trials of the 1930's (Alabama I believe)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Majority? Of what? Social media? The majority opposes it. The internet cried louder and won. Fags only account for about 3-4% of the population.</br>  <br> There wasn't any notice that they were talking about this <br>Yeah if you ignore the last 40 years.<br> and there wasn't really any time for anyone to object to it <br>Its the supreme fucking court</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's a state decision. If you don't like it you can move. But federal laws are across the entire country</br>  <br> The majority opposes it. <br>With the baby boomers dying out and the hicks in the south killing themselves no, the majority of people either are casually for, or really for same-sex marriage.<br><br>You don't have to be gay to think people shouldn't be denied rights because of some shit in a dumb book written by people who hate shrimp and mixed fabrics.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Wrong.

This wasn't some arbitrary announcement made by the supreme court. It was a trial, it was several trials consolidated<br>14-556, Obergefell v. Hodges <br>Consolidation <br>14-562, Tanco v. Haslam<br>14-571, DeBoer v. Snyder<br>14-574, Bourke v. Beshear<br><br>The court didn't just decide over night, hey, gay marriage is legal. These people have been in court for years trying to get their 14th amendment rights affirmed. Get your shit together Op, just because you didn't have time between browsing /b/ and masturbating to trap porn to read about what the fuck is happening in this world doesn't mean it just happened over night.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh shut up. Just let them have marriage so they can be as miserable as everyone else.</br>  <br><br> And this is how the fags won. No proof of the contrary just screaming and shouting that people are wrong. <br><br>umad m8? If the government recognizes marriage between a man and woman, it must recognize marriage between same sexes since the government does not operate on religious principles, which is pretty much the only valid reason people object to it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Comon man, everybody does that, same goes for climate acts and shouting from the gas industry. It maybe a two edged blade covered in oil and money, but it is YOUR two edged blade.<br><br>lrn2live with it amerifat</br></br></br>  <br>+1<br><br>why do we even have states and state constitutions if the supreme court can just throw out any little thing they don't like?<br><br>Quick! recite the 10th amendment! Should be a prerequisite test for any potential justice.<br><br>Fuck the supreme court and fuck all you faggot lovers.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Everything that happens is conducted for the betterment of the rich and powerful, not for the people of the U.S. <br><br>Making gay marriage legal came at a convenient time huh?</br></br></br>  <br> implying the government can define marriage, being a religious principle.  <br>That was what this was all about. Forcing fag marriage on the churches.</br></br>  <br>Didn't I tell you to stay off the internet?!<br><br>Here is your source:<br><br>http://www.pewforum.org/2015/06/08/<wbr>graphics-slideshow-changing-attitud<wbr>es-on-gay-marriage/<br><br>This breaks it down by age, political, religious, and race.</br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> why do we even have states and state constitutions if the supreme court can just throw out any little thing they don't like? <br><br>Because this has to do with human rights and conservatards in the states using their religion to make laws telling people can/cannot do. Which flies in the face of "shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion".<br><br> Fuck the supreme court and fuck all you faggot lovers. <br><br>umad. Other people getting married doesn't affect your life in any way. Disgusted by it? Your grandparents shag all the time, doesn't mean you have the right to go in there and prevent them from shagging.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The bible sees women as property, with little rights. How does your wife view this?</br>  <br><br> That was what this was all about. Forcing fag marriage on the churches. <br><br>This seriously has to be some bait. No it isn't about forcing "fag marriages on the churches", it's about getting equal rights/benefits from marriage as straight couples dumbass.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You stupid bro? Gay marriage can't be a state issue, it's a contract between two parties, which needs protection from state to state.<br><br>The 15 redneck states which oppose it would take another 30 years to come around.</br></br></br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br>No it doesnt</br>  <br>Two words.<br><br>Distractionary Tactic.</br></br></br>  <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=OFk<wbr>eKKszXTw</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Kek Obamas rally wrecking the joint before he moves out hey amerifags</br>  <br> fucking retard detected that thinks it's okay for the judical branch to make legislation </br>  <br><br> No notice <br><br>Were you literally born yesterday? Gay marriage is an issue that's been in the public domain for decades. Anyone who paid any attention at all to politics/the news knew this was coming.<br><br> Happened very quickly <br>Unless you didn't notice the majority of states changing their gay marriage laws over the past decade.<br><br> What if I don't agree with what they do next? <br>Like what? Also, each side in a SC decision has 25 days to file for an appeal, so there's that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hurr durr YouTube Link. Fuck me, when did it become the norm to put a bunch of bullshit in a PowerPoint presentation, add some shityy bacckbround music and post it on YouTube and have ppl actually believe it over real peer reviewed esearch</br>  <br><br>No law was newly written. You morons keep shouting this and also shouting how's it unconstitutional while conveniently forgetting the 14thamendment states that no state shall have laws that apply unequally to two different parties. I.e. If a man and woman can be married, then so can a man and man/woman and woman.</br></br>  <br><br> fucking retard detected that thinks it's okay for the judical branch to make legislation <br><br>Judicial branch can decide what laws are constitutional. Here's an elementary school chart of our government so you actually can learn how our government operates.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Eh. True, there's a lot of that in there, but most is in the old Testament, which doesn't really get followed anymore. There's plenty of evidence of near equal rights in the new testament.</br></br>  <br>It was also written in a time when all of society treated women worse than a greasy kebab shit and a lot of what is written in the Old Testament regarding women when viewed in historical context is protective and supportive of women.</br>  <br><br> have ppl actually believe it over real peer reviewed esearch <br><br>It's technically research since she cites the bible passages at the bottom in her talk. Anyways, you bitching about all this is nonsense. Listen to what she's saying.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm fine with gay marriage but now that everyone can marry anyone can I marry myself and get tax benefits?<br><br>Why does the government discriminate against single people? It is much harder for me to own a home and get loans from banks because I am the sole earner of income. The banks won't recognize any "roommates" who have income in the decision for me to get a home.<br><br>Some people choose to be single and now are discriminated against. Others do not choose to be single and society punishes them for it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you that autistic? <br>You're correct, that's exactly what the Supreme Court does. What the Supreme Court is not supposed to do is create laws.<br><br>Here's a diagram for you since you clearly don't understand the basic responsibilities of the separate branches in the U.S. government. I suggest you go back to middle school and beat the shit out of your civics teacher because you obviously didn't learn a fucking thing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They didn't create a new law here you fucking idiot. This law pre existed in the form of the 14th amendment.</br>  <br><br> now that everyone can marry anyone can I marry myself and get tax benefits? <br><br>Are you a schizophrenic? Because marriage is between two people. Hence the word "marriage". I'm with you that I don't agree with the government getting involved with marriage, but if they are going to get involved what they did was correct.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Something tells me you have no idea what the 14th amendment even says.</br>  <br><br> What the Supreme Court is not supposed to do is create laws <br><br>They did not create any laws, SCOTUS said the ban on gay marriage is unconstitutional, which is completely within their jurisdiction.<br><br> I suggest you go back to middle school and beat the shit out of your civics teacher because you obviously didn't learn a fucking thing. <br><br>Way to mirror my insult, umad I insulted yo intellectz?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Funny because I should be saying that to you. You, like most, probably o my know half of it.</br>  <br><br>Pretty much says that the government must recognize all people's rights as equals regardless of how they identify themselves and also have equal protection under the law. Which applies to gay marriage considering straight marriage had benefits over gay couples before this court ruling.</br></br>  <br>Bible passages take out of context I'm sure, can't be bothered listening to some bitch who needs to put her shit on YouTube, give me a peer reviewed journal anyday</br>  <br>They have 25 days? What's that got to do with my chance to say something</br>  <br><br> Bible passages take out of context I'm sure <br><br>lel, the fact you said "I'm sure" just goes to prove you didn't bother fact checking the passage or the surrounding chapter. Here's another vid for you: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=PK7<wbr>P7uZFf5o</wbr>  [ ]<br><br> give me a peer reviewed journal anyday <br><br>Yup, you've got to be a troll.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Then I can marry my daughter</br>  <br>Then I can marry my daughter</br>  im fine with guys and stuff but historically every culture that has embraced them has a terrible downfall  <br><br>That's a huge risk of fucking up family dynamics and having fucked up children. Two gay people are two consenting adults. You're comparing apples and oranges.</br></br>  <br><br> every culture that has embraced them has a terrible downfall <br><br>Their downfall is nothing related to gay marriage.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's incorrect. Who said my daughter was a minor? Also, gay parents fuck up family dynamics.</br>  <br>File a petition for reconsideration r a petition for a temporary restraining order? Okay now. Dont go all apeshit here okay? I now clearly know that you dont know shit about what you talk</br>  <br>It's proven that children respond to and mirror their environment. Messages either explicit or often times implicit in their parents behavior get passed along To children. Therefore gay fuck up family dynamics. They cannot reproduce, and their adopted children are at risk of not reproducing.</br>  I hate how faggots liken not being able to marry each other to black oppression in the 60's  <br>Not to mention he didn't say anything about reproducing with his daughter.</br>  <br><br> Also, gay parents fuck up family dynamics. <br><br>No it doesn't, having gay parents doesn't effect the child's mental health in any way:<br><br>http://www.medicaldaily.com/do-same<wbr>-sex-parents-impact-mental-health-t<wbr>heir-children-some-us-states-say-ye<wbr>s-and-prohibit-lgbt<br><br>"Research shows that children raised by gay or lesbian parents do as well as other children in terms of well-being, adjustment, functioning and peer relationships, and researchers have found no differences in terms of depression, anxiety and self-esteem"<br><br>Now do you have any direct reasonable objection to gay marriage right now or are you going to continue wasting my time with the overused slippery slope bullshit? Because if it's the latter, I see no reason in continuing a conversation with you.</br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br>Please provide a peer-reviewed citation to back up your claim.</br>  I though b would be all for the shirtlifters being able to marry, now you're only one step away from legalising pedo marriage and will be able to marry that 6year old waifu you've been jerking off to  <br>Your detracting from the actual argument, dipshit. I never said anything about reproducing with my daughter. She is a consenting adult, as am i. Congress shall have no laws treating to parties unequally. Tell me why u can't marry my daughter. <br><br>Protip: checkmate.</br></br></br>  <br>Who said gays have to account for other minority groups that want to get married? Oh, wait. They fucking don't? They fucking don't have to account for other people who want to get married? That's fucking awkward for you. That really makes your analogy look fucking stupid.</br>  <br><br>see:<br><br><br><br><br><br>https://www.psychologytoday.com/blo<wbr>g/animals-and-us/201210/the-problem<wbr>-incest</wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>if this is what you believe, you don't deserve to be an american</br>  <br>It's well known that luminati have covered up all research showing such outcomes to promote gay agenda and depopulate the earth. Get educated sheeple. Tips tinfoil hat.</br>  <br>What in the actual fuck are you even trying to say lulz? Gas don't have to give an account for anything, but we share the same congress. and Congress shall make no laws treating to parties unequally. <br><br>Again, so you can marry your daughter or be gay and incestuous and marry your son. Why not?</br></br></br>  <br>  no notice <br><br>they announced they would decide on the case a long time ago</br></br></br>  <br> wasn't any notice <br>Pay more attention.</br></br>  <br>You just discovered Google or something ? Quit spamming this thread with links when you can have this debate using basic logic and discussing basic concepts. This isn't college, it's /b/.<br><br>Fuck ass.</br></br></br>  <br>You can also emigrate...</br>  <br><br> Your detracting from the actual argument, dipshit. I never said anything about reproducing with my daughter. She is a consenting adult, as am i. <br><br>You're* And granting you marriage doesn't guaranteed that you wouldn't have sex/reproduce with her, so it would be silly for congress to agree to such a marriage.<br><br>Marriages are for the relationship, not the benefits (which is why I don't agree with government giving benefits to married couples). So marrying yoru daughter for government benefits is also silly.<br><br> . Congress shall have no laws treating to parties unequally <br><br>Two*. Again, I don't agree with government's regulation of marriage. It'll help you if you actually took time proofreading your shit btw</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>God only knows what benefits some idiots can get from fully reading the article.</br></br>  Can't we all just agree that murican pretty mch fucked and pin all our hopes on North korea  No one has articulated why two consenting adults, whether they be mother/son, father/daughter<br>or father/son , mother/daughter, cannot get married. It's unconstitutional.</br>  <br>I think it's closer than less than 1/2% they just want you to think it's more so stuff like this gets passed.</br>  Where were you when SCOTUS handed the presidency to Bush over Gore?  <br>Lobby for the right too after the child turns 18, get enough support and you'll be able to. The law is in place currently for the protection of the child from sick fucks attempting to groom their children into marriage from an early age.</br>  <br>I guess I'll just have to break this down for you since you're too fucking stupid to figure it out on your own. <br><br>The Supreme Court tries specific cases. The Justices don't sit on the fucking bench and go "hmm, I wonder what issues I want to tackle today." They read through petitions and have to choose which cases to see. <br><br>So it's pretty fucking stupid that your argument against gay marriage is about incest, which has absolutely nothing to do with whether states can constitutionally: 1) Not recognize *homosexual* unions from other states, or 2) Openly ban *homosexual* marriage. <br><br>You want to marry your daughter? You can take the same route gays did. Otherwise, your analogy isn't applicable. As I said before, it's irrelevant to the question of whether gays should be allowed to marry, and a huge fucking red herring. <br><br>Also, you're a fucking imbecile, and it's absolutely terrifying that braindead fucks like you are allowed to vote.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Obvious desperation is obvious. Becomes a grammar Nazi when all else begins to fail. So you don't believe that goverment should regulate marriage? Then fine, I can marry my child who is an adult. Love is love, right?</br>  <br>that's not the issue. the issue is how much power do you think the federal government should have over the states.</br>  <br>Should be no states and Obama bin Hussein should run Murica for ever with his invincible legions of homos kept healthy by universal Medicare and armed with all the guns he confiscated from texas</br>  <br><br>So single people have to suffer?<br><br>how about ending tax breaks and benefits for married people period?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I take your Butthurt as failure in this debate. It's perfectly valid for me to draw this analogy. It's a question of right and wrong, not strictly legality. It's unconstitutional to ban gay from getting married. But then by the same logic, wouldn't it be unconstitutional to ban family members who are consenting adults from being married? Yet, something is unsettling about the notion. Who are you or anyone else to draw the arbitrary line separating love and perversion? Homosexualit is found in nature, but so is incest. Why you hatin, nigga?? Kek</br>  <br><br> Becomes a grammar Nazi when all else begins to fail. <br><br>More of the fact that there's a blatant difference between the little things like two and to and shows how much time you actually put into your thought.<br><br> So you don't believe that goverment should regulate marriage? <br><br>And your reading proves to be as useless as your proof-reading. I said I don't agree with government giving out benefits, which is completely different from regulating the marriage age. And again, two consenting adults having a marriage isn't fucked up.<br><br>And no, I'm not being desperate. You're just a piss poor arguer. If you wanted to make the best absolute case, you should say something along the lines of "what if a son and a bisexual father fall in love and want to marry" that way it eliminates the possibility of having children. In this situation, I still think it's abuse on part of the parent since the child should have a life outside of his blood family.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>See<br><br><br><br>Under the 14th Amendment I should have the same benefits and rewards for being married if I am single. No?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Exactly. End tax breaks and benefits for married people, government shouldn't be doing this shit.</br></br>  <br>A country founded on inalienable rights of pursuit of happiness. Passes a law allowing people to be happy. If you are not gay it has no effect on your life whatsoever, and does nothing to impede on your freedoms. Why do you feel the need to start yet another thread on the same thing for the thousandth time?</br>  <br>Grammar descrepancy is no indication of a lack of intelligence. If you want to be a proof reading chimp, go get a job at your local newspaper. The grown ups are busy.</br>  If marriage causes this much butthurt then ban it completely, no one gets married or everything and anything can. Nice and simple.  <br><br> Under the 14th Amendment I should have the same benefits and rewards for being married if I am single. No? <br><br>Considering that the benefits is for marriage and marriage implies more than one person, and under the tax break laws, then no you shouldn't be allowed for tax break. However, I agree that it is still unfair part for single people.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think that adults should "have a life" outside of their own sex.</br>  <br>It's also unfair that people with children get additional money back on their taxes each year for each child they have. Why should someone who has 3 children pay less taxes than someone with 2, 1 or 0 children???</br>  <br><br>I never called you an idiot for your grammar mistakes, now did I? I'm telling you that your grammar mistakes and miss-spelling shows how much care you actually put into typing and thinking something out especially whenever your computer underlines incorrect spelt words, WITH an option to right click and correct the word.</br></br>  <br>Its called sources you uneducated pinko fuck, go back to your mardi gras or wherever it is you fuckwads suck each other's dicks</br>  <br>exactly. this will not end with faggot marriage. mark my fucking words.<br><br>The ONLY reason that incest (and pedophilia and a whole shitload of other degeneracy) is not legally condoned like gay marriage is now is the same fucking reason gay marriage used to be illegal, because most of the population is opposed to it. Get enough people on the side of incest and you'll have "love wins" parades for that. <br><br>I give it about 30 years tops.<br><br>Inb4 "buh but muh incest produces 6 headed babbehs that have heart conditions!" there have been studies already that incest isn't as bad as the wives tales would have you believe. And really, there used to be scientific reasoning against faggotry too, until some activist "scientists" cooked up some "studies" that showed it was a-ok.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe you'll understand once you've passed your high school government class.</br>  <br><br>And how long will it be before the government starts saying that a church can't be tax exempt unless it performs marriages for anyone regardless of the genders of the couple? how long before those who don't are labelled "hate groups?"<br><br>so much for freedom of religion.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This anon gets it. Luckily i plan to die of liver failure long before you lefty pinko pedo perverts get legalised</br>  <br>Sometimes shit like this needs to happen though. <br><br>I'm against the fact that they're chosen by the current president and appointed for life</br></br></br>  <br> incorrect spelt words <br><br>I see now why you're a grammar nazi.</br></br></br>  <br>You're conflating two separate issues here. My own moral opinion with the legal issues at hand, which is what the thread is about. The question of whether it's "right" for someone to marry their child isn't what's being debated. Let me restate that one more time. We aren't debating the morality of homosexuality or incest.<br><br>I truly don't give a shit whether people want incestuous marriage. I'm just explaining to you why nobody else is breaking down why the analogy isn't relevant: It was impossible for such an issue to be decided in this case. <br><br>Your analogy is a red herring. Red herrings are logical fallacies. Like I said before, if people really wanted to argue this, they could challenge it in a federal court just like gays did. There might actually be legal grounding for it in the same way there was for homosexual marriage (assuming two conseunsual adults). <br><br>But neither you, nor anyone else wants to argue this. It's just a bullshit red herring fallacy you honestly believe is your ace in the fucking hole. You should probably sterilize yourself so you don't reproduce. You're stupid to the point of being inarticulate.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Retarded statement, that means you'd never have friends of the same sex. My point being was that spending the rest of one's life in romantic relationship with his/her father/mother/son can completely impede the relationship. Yall start fighting like an old couple, then you end up resenting your dad because he did this? Congradulations, you've now got no father as a father figure because you've messed it up in a romantic relationship.</br></br>  <br>So let the imperial resident of the white house pick. You're fucking dumb.</br>  Op here:<br><br>Oh shit what have i done</br></br>  Filthy faggots will still fuck each other whether married or not. Let the aids sort em out and reduce their numbers.  <br><br> And how long will it be before the government starts saying that a church can't be tax exempt unless it performs marriages for anyone regardless of the genders of the couple? <br><br>Slipperly slope fallacy. This ruling stands constitutional while telling churches to marry gay people is violation of the first amendment. There is no argument here.</br></br></br></br>  <br> internet implosion </br>  <br>what? Lol. You have a crystal ball now? Amazing. Talk about slippery slope.</br>  <br>Because when it comes to typical progressives and civil, spiritual or deeply personal issues...damn the legal process.<br><br>They will find the shortest path to get their way, whatever it is, and get it done. They use word gymnastics to justify their actions and go scorched earth on anyone who gets in their way with personal attacks.</br></br></br>  <br><br>How embarrassing, my mistake. Still, you can type "two" instead of "to".</br></br>  <br><br>It's not a slippery slope, it's just a hypothetical on how it fucks up family dynamics.</br></br>  <br><br><br>a hypothetical that gives insight to why it fucks up family dynamics*</br></br></br>  <br>Those damned word gymnasts with their scorched earth ad hominem tactical nuke cannons. Whatever shall you do?<br><br>Buck up faggot.</br></br></br>  <br> muh slippery slope logical fallacy <br> i don't understand how logical fallacies work <br> i don't understand how consent between adults works  <br> i don't understand basic human rights </br></br></br></br>  <br>you knew exactly what you were doing<br>you bastard</br></br>  <br>If i had faggot parents id suicide</br>  <br>what if he is schizophrenic? What if he really believes he is two people and they want to marry each other. Why are you judging him you hatemonger!? Love is love no matter who it's between! including a person's love for his alternate personality! before you object, remember homosexuality used to be considered a mental illness too.<br><br>This will not end with gay marriage. you're</br></br></br>  <br>Yep, checkmate</br>  <br><br> getting married <br> a right </br></br></br>  <br><br> Marriage implies more than one person <br><br>Marriage also implied a man and a woman only. Now that that is out the window I should be able to marry myself.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I did :^)</br>  <br><br>And when all these supposed incest activists and advocates band together and create an effective enough lobby to persuade the US Supreme Court to allow it, where will you be?<br><br>My bet: Exactly where you are now (if you're alive then). At your fucking computer crying about your inability to bend the world to your personal will. Sucks to be you, doesn't it?</br></br></br></br>  approval of gay marriage by the US public is overwhelmingly huge. an easy majority. even if decided by popular vote you would still be bitching on 4chan.  <br><br>Although this seems more satirical then serious, schizophrenia is a mental illness and it was sarcasm and not an actual part of my argument. Two people are two individuals, not one individual with imaginary people in his head.<br><br><br><br>Probaby because you weren't raised by homosexual parents? I mean, do you really know how stupid this sounds? If you were adpoted and raised by homosexual parents, you'd most likely tolerate homosexuals. Silly</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>check:<br><br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Schizophrenic here, I don't think you know what schizophrenia is.</br>  <br>What's with all the chess-styled faggotry? Do you faggots actually debate/argue like this in person or is it something especially retarded you only let yourself do online?</br>  <br><br> Marriage also implied a man and a woman only. <br><br>Marriage also means "mixture of two elements". Two being a keyword, marriage can extend to homosexuals. You are not two people. Quit with the cognitive dissonance, it's completely reasonable to allow homosexuals to marry.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Interesting, how did you recognize you were schizophrenic?<br><br><br><br>I did not say "check" as in chess. I said "check" as in "check these comments". Although the "checkmate" shit is egotistical douchebagary</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>went to a doctor and did some shit</br>  <br><br>Also marriage in the definition of "man and woman" is not concrete. Marriage has meant many different styles of relationships in the past.</br></br>  <br><br>I'm fine with homosexuals marrying, but it now sets a new precedent on what the term "marriage" is.<br><br>I love myself. I believe that I should gain the same benefits that married people have since I am choosing not to marry. Why does my status as a single person affect my ability to get a loan for a home? Or adopt? Or anything like that?<br><br>See this is what happens, however, when you do not draw the line somewhere. Equality is a great idea, but it is a COSTLY idea.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Excuse me for not being clear, I meant what were your symptoms? And I'm not the guy you first commented to btw.</br></br>  <br>Sorry, I should have replied directly to the checkmate dipshit not you.</br>  <br><br>I can live with that for sure.</br></br>  <br><br>And is it not completely reasonable to have a relationship with oneself? Many cultures practice the belief that one must love oneself to be of any value to another person.</br></br>  <br><br>Have you not read the other part of my comment? Marriage is a metaphorical combining of two different people. You're one person. If you clone yourself and get married to yourself, that's perfectly fine.<br><br>And I don't agree with the government handing out benefits.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hearing shit. Started pretty simple, not really voices but like people coughing when no one was there</br>  <br><br>The courts didn't make a new law. They basically made it illegal to discriminate against gays via marriage licenses and therefore by the 10th amendment, it became de-facto legal. Use your brain retard.</br></br>  <br><br>It's all good.<br><br><br><br>The thing is, even if you have a "relationship with yourself", meaning you love yourself, you're still an individual and not two people. Marriage is, again, "mixture of TWO".</br></br></br></br></br></br>  ITT: mouth breathing pleb faggots who think they know how law/the courts work.  <br><br>And I'm trying to explain to you that because the Government stepped in and redefined marriage once more to include every relationship possible to getting married there are going to be single people out there, like me, very miffed that another group of people get tax benefits, but I do not.<br><br>Then you'll have a few lawsuits popping up here and there. Lawyers will fight to define what "marriage is" once again and this will debacle will continue on and on and on because the line was never drawn.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Was it scary?</br></br>  <br><br>Just because you have gay parents doesn't mean you'll grow up liking the same sex. What explains how gay people come out of straight families? Complete nonsense. <br><br>Also, your bit about reproduction. It's not like we really need any more people around. We could actually use about a 3/4 reduction in population if we want to keep living on this planet for much longer.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>And as to quote an SJW standard: "Who are YOU to define what marriage is, shitlord?"</br></br>  <br><br>If you can't grasp the concept of marriage being two individuals and not yourself then I don't know how else I can explain to you that "marrying yourself" is silly.</br></br>  <br>Nah, the scary stuff came a while later.</br>  <br><br>Yes trust big business jewish studies<br><br>Yup all science is always pure and never agenda driven</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The entire population of the world can fit into Texas if lined shoulder to shoulder.<br><br>Just sayin'.</br></br></br></br>  I would rather see the word "marriage" removed from all legal documents/procedures and a different word/phrase used instead. Leave the debate over the meaning of "marriage" entirely out of consideration for 14th Amendment protection for all citizens under the law.  <br><br> an <br><br> SFW <br><br>And I don't really need to respond to that. Marriage implies two.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>"If you can't grasp the concept of marriage being one man and one woman and not two men or two women then I don't know how else I can explain to you that "homosexual marriage" is silly."<br><br>You're sounding mighty Christian right now. See how this works?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>See<br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>Hence<br><br>This ^</br></br></br>  <br>No, he's sounding like a bigot. Plenty of christians support gay marriage.</br>  <br><br>What does that have to do with anything? With the rate that we're extracting oil, metals, nutrients (for food) and other things from the earth and burning it into the air, we only have about 50 years left at our current rate.</br></br>  <br> There wasn't any notice that they were talking about this <br>lol wut?<br>It's been the most discussed decision in recent memory. It could only come as a surprise if you were living under a rock.<br> and there wasn't really any time for anyone to object to it <br>Except for the months (multiple!) between when SCOTUS decided to hear the case, and when they handed down the decision.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Underrated and informed post.</br>  <br>In doing so, everyone can have their own fancy definition of marriage entirely separate from the legal intention and requirements of the 14th Amendment.</br>  <br><br>You are correct on that. SJWs just target Christians more than any other person when trying to prove a point.</br></br>  <br>Not that there wasn't anyone talking about it, but that no one knew SCOTUS was talking about it.</br>  <br><br>I'm sure when it comes right down to it we will figure out a way to prolong our rule. Always have.</br></br>  <br><br>You've either got to be a narrow-minded imbecile or a troll. I've addressed the fact that the word marriage means "mixture of TWO elements". Marriage, when it comes to relationships, MEANS TWO PEOPLE (or more, which is a separate issue.) You can't make a mixture of water with water, because it's the same fucking thing.</br></br>  <br> We could actually use about a 3/4 reduction in population if we want to keep living on this planet for much longer. <br>It took all of history for world population to reach 2 billion in the early 20th century. People then predicted disastrous starvation and turmoil. By 1970 it was about 4 billion and it hit 7 billion in the 90s.<br>The fraction of the world without food and clean water every day has always been about 25%. The number of hungry people now is much higher than the world population of 2000 years ago.<br>There's never been a shortage of anything, we create scarcity to control populations. Money is a form of rationing. 7 billion people cannot live like the USA does, using a quarter of the world's energy, but it's a bit rich for them to advocate a reduction in world population when they are that wasteful. The USA discards enough to feed the whole world twice a year. 10% of it's military budget would save every woman who dies in childbirth, every single one.<br>The problem is the way we distribute things, nothing else.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How could you possibly be so invested in this issue and not have known SCOTUS was considering it?</br>  <br><br>Alright then by all means I will marry my cat. I do not intend to have any sexual relationships with this cat, but we share a bond that cannot be broken. In the event of my sudden death I believe I have the right, instead of the state taking all my belongings, that I can leave it to my cat.<br><br>It's a mixture of two elements and clearly no one is getting harmed in this joining. So....your move.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yea, reduce our population by a metric fuck ton. Improve recycling rates, and start using renewable energy or find other planets to pillage and rape for resources.</br></br>  <br><br>It's not just about food.</br></br>  <br><br>I've already explained to him how "marrying oneself" is contradictory and stupid. See:<br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>You're more than welcome to begin lobbying for the ability to marry your cat. I wish you luck. Fucking dolt.</br>  <br><br>Cat can't consent. Have you ever been to a marriage before? They both have to say "I do". Dumbass</br></br>  <br>they're really having trouble with the term: red herring. and logical fallacy in general. this is why idiots lose arguments.</br>  <br>Who the fuck said I was invested in it? I don't even live in the US</br>  <br><br>Second this. <br>Please do start lobbying to marry your cat.</br></br></br>  <br>You're obviously invested because you're posting about it. Your citizenship is irrelevant. You're not only posting about it, but willfully uninformed. So you're both invested and ignorant, a truly sad state of affairs for you.</br>  Sadly, the fact is we have little to no say as to what happens in our country. People around the world judge us by our leaders and what they read, hear or see on television. It suckered, but that's life.<br><br>I have no hatred towards other countries. I won't judge a group of people based on their leaders decisions. I don't have any right to.</br></br>  <br>There wasn't any notice to the population for debate because it would have served no purpose. The Supreme Court merely looks at the law, interprets it, then decides what it means. There is no debate on the issue as it would open for the possibility for laypersons to misinterpret it, or incorporate their own biases and prejudices. <br><br>SCOTUS were interpreting the 14th amendment and determining whether same-sex marriage came under its umbrella, which the majority thought it did. They didn't create a new law, but merely recognised a law that had already been there. <br><br>Unfortunately for those opposed the gay marriage, the only way for reversing the decision is to amend the constitution itself. Something the USA is extremely reluctant to do and, in practice, is almost impossible to do anyway.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I agree</br>  <br>I'll sign the petition as soon as I see it. May we see a brighter future where Homo Sapiens and Felines may forge an eternal, marital bond.</br>  you had a chance to speak out. this issue has been bouncing back and forth, closing on the supreme court, for years now. but, you need standing in court to address it. in other words, what current situation has harmed you such that you can file a lawsuit to have your harm addressed? you DONT get to complain to a court simply because you dont like their decision. the anti ssm people have been trying for years to file complaints, some where they dont have standing. this person had standing, the case was accepted, we now have a new precedent in our court system, exactly as the framers of the constitution intended. if you bring a case saying your rights as a non ss married person are hurt by this decision, go ahead. protip: you cant. this doesnt hurt ANYONE from a legal standpoint. and no, there wont be a movement to force churches to perform ssm. thats a red herring.  <br><br>Well, we need to make a flag and start campaigning.</br></br>  <br> Would I get a chance to speak out against it? <br><br>Opponents of same sex marriage had ample time to speak out. Many did so. They lost the argument. <br><br>If something else you really care about makes it to SCOTUS without you noticing, I sincerely doubt you truly care enough to do anything whatsoever (before, during, and after).</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What colors do cats like? I've heard their color vision is slightly different than humans, so maybe a cat-version of the rainbow for starters?</br>  <br>Hey OP, check here for the current SCOTUS docket: http://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/<wbr>docket.aspx<br><br>Happy lobbying</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>You get tax breaks for having children. Even as a single parent. Just because you don't use them doesn't mean they aren't there</br>  <br>Continued:<br><br>However, it could also be reversed if the Supreme Court looked at a similar case in the future, then reversed its decision (different justices), however this is just as unlikely as senior courts are reluctant to completely reverse previous decisions.<br><br>Some more observations about this thread:<br><br>1. I doesn't open the door for people marrying inanimate objects. No-one except for legal and natural persons (humans, companies) can consent into contracts, so the theory this will lead to people marrying animals/chairs is false.<br>2. It may open the door to polygamy, however the enormous social implications (inevitable gender inequality, distribution of estates) mean that this is almost certainly to never get off the ground. The constitution won't protect those liberties which are detrimental to the fabric of society)<br>3. On the above point, there is no evidence that gay marriage is detrimental to society, or to children. People may think it is, and are of the opinion that it is, but empirically it is not. Courts will not take those opinions into account.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Something like this</br>  <br><br>I don't know. I was thinking of this picture, combining the male and female symbols to represent human kind both female and male, and then replacing one of the symbols with a tail.<br><br><br>Will be so happy!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No. You're trying to split hairs now. The tax benefits now encompass all people. The benefits themselves don't violate rights when they are available to anyone of any race, color or creed that's married</br>  <br><br>Yesss! this idea:<br><br>with the cat rainbowed background!</br></br></br></br>  <br>if you want states to be independent from the federal government, you need to secede from the nation. so why don't you?</br>  <br>And this is why idiots like you A.) fail at getting your way and B.) cry about it like little bitches when that happens. Who's the faggot now, faggot?</br>  <br>you're right anon. marriage does discriminate against single people. marriage laws exist to encourage people to reproduce.</br>  <br>Can anyone shop this shit quicklike? At least one productive thing should come of all this faggotry.</br>  <br>  gays cannot reproduce <br><br>what century are you from, and have they invented science yet?</br></br></br>  <br>Or to encourage them to form stable and hopefully prosperous economic partnerships regardless of children. They may get a tax break, but their net tax payments are generally higher as a result.</br>  <br><br><br>I have to update my photoshop editor. But you'll need to keep the thread alive.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I'll have to keep this insult for later.</br></br>  <br>you're right; a married couple is more likely to own property and therefore pay property taxes</br>  <br>It's kind of a wrecked system. I can appreciate not wanting guaranteed tenure, and depending on who's retiring/dying with different Presidents the court can get ideologically cyclical. The reason they are is because the shit you have to know to perform that job takes an entire lifetime to study. Most of the time the circuit courts get shit done, only a select few out of a fuckton get granted cert by the Supreme Court.</br>  <br>Probably doesn't believe IVF leads to "real" people, just other second class citizens.</br>  <br>While presidential political leanings may be of some minor concern, the very reason they're chosen for life is so that they do not need to bend to political will in making their decisions. Lifetime appointment affords insulation from the whims of the political process.</br>  <br>If it 404's start a new thread advocating Human-Cat marriage with your new design.</br>  Again. I should be able to marry my daughter. Congress shall have laws treating two parties unequally. The supreme court decisions have redefined the contract of marriage. The language describes marriage as between a man and woman. Now it's defined as between two consenting adults, regardless of sexuality orientation. The definition was in the context of traditional family. If gay wanted to marry, fine. But it should be treated as something entirely different than the marriage contract defined as between man and woman, because it's not the same. But if you say otherwise, you're argument also implicitly suggests that it's okay to redefine the marriage contract. Next up: Man Marries His Goldfish "Larry:  <br>Slippery slope much? Damn.</br>  <br>Can two gay men reproduce With one another? No. What dimension are you from?</br>  <br>Not a slope, it's a "hypothetical" lol</br>  <br><br>Something went wrong with the update. Sorry anon. Maybe sometime in the future I shall make it, it'll be perfect for trolling anti-gay bigots.</br></br>  <br> Slipperly slope fallacy <br>It's not a fallacy if it happens time and again, especially with respect to social issues like this.</br></br>  <br><br>What is informed consent?</br></br>  <br>Sure. Like the cat-human-marriage advocate above, you're more than welcome to begin lobbying for incestuous marriage. When are you going to have your first meeting? Once again, the red herring shit is out of control, but it sure is hilarious to read. Thank you, at the very least, for the comedy.</br>  <br><br>They won't force religious ceremonies for gay people, retard.</br></br>  <br>and unless you're a fucking pervert, (which I'm not sure I can assume safely that you are not), you will be right beside me crying about it and saying I was right and we shouldn't have started down this path.</br>  <br>Being educated on the relative risks/benefits of a given decision.</br>  <br>lifetime appointment sucks. It should be 10 years, tops. This court we have now is going to ruin this country. Thanks obama. Fucking nigger.</br>  <br>It amazes me that people don't realize this. I have been laughing all day on this. Also, I actually don't even have a daughter.</br>  <br> neither you, nor anyone else wants to argue this <br>not yet, but give it time padawan.</br></br>  <br><br>Right and that is a prerequisite that needs to be met before one can enter into the legal institution of a marriage. Fish can't do that, neither can children.</br></br>  <br> on 4-chan <br> mincing words about perversion <br><br>Anyhow, are you actually arguing that there is such a lobby or are you just refusing to accept that your argument is a red herring? Do you even know what that means?</br></br></br></br>  <br>no, but they'll remove tax exemption from churches that refuse to do it, labelling them "hate groups" like canada has already done.</br>  <br>ever heard of stem cells? welcome to the future</br>  <br>homosexuality was a mental illness at one time too.</br>  Riddle me this, Chrisfags - if God was so worried about teh homosex, the why isn't it one of the ten commandments? Apparently graven images and coveting thy neighbor's Porsche are much more pressing concerns for thy Lord and Savior, so where is the outcry over that?  <br>I can get behind this.</br>  <br><br>Still a slippery slope. USA is 80% christian, I doubt that will happen.</br></br>  <br><br>Schizophrenia is an actual mental illness. Homosexuality is not.</br></br>  <br> The constitution won't protect those liberties which are detrimental to the fabric of society <br>It just did last friday.</br></br>  <br>I sincerely wish we would. However, that didn't work out too well the first time someone tried it.</br>  <br>exactly. abolish marriage as a legal concept altogether.</br>  <br><br>How do you deal with international partnerships? Just recognise any claimed relationship regardless of legal status? I hope this doesn't sound bitchy, it's a legit question.</br></br>  <br>And why can't children? All it will take is a handful of "studies" to show that children can consent. <br><br>Slippery slope is real. It just fucking happened last friday. I remember a time when people said, "oh sure, this happened, but gays will never be allowed to get married because of this that or the other thing, that's just a SLIPPERY SLOPE FALLACY". and yet here it is, so fuck you with your fallacy fallacy.</br></br></br>  <br>if you abolish it as a legal concept, then it becomes a moot point, since being "married" doesn't afford any benefits</br>  <br> 80% christian <br> 66% in favor of gay marriage <br> christianity forbids homosexuality <br> you do the math if you can you fucking retard. </br></br></br></br>  <br> no state shall have laws that apply unequally to two different parties <br>I don't think the founding fathers, even in their wildest dreams would have thought something like this would be possible. Theirs a certain degree of perversion needed to say the words "gay" and "marriage" in a sentence. Disgusting.</br></br>  <br>says you and a bunch of ideologues on the APA. Just need a different bunch of activist psychiatrists (read quacks).</br>  <br><br> And why can't children? <br><br>I think we can all agree that there is a line where children can't give informed consent , it's a question of where that lies. We're not talking about an absolute here.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think they should make the system easier to understand so people like you don't get too confused</br>  <br><br>Right, so you are just for opening the borders?</br></br>  <br>I personally didn't say abolish. That's a misinterpretation of my original post. I said replace. Then the wingnuts can go on and on about its meaning without it having any legal consequences for the rest of us.</br>  <br>lol i don't see how you're drawing the connection with immigration? if you're talking about preferred immigrant status being given to people in relationships together, the INS already tests this (to a limited extent) to make sure it's not a marriage of convenience. obviously it's not foolproof but it's not "opening the borders" either.</br>  <br>i'm just taking it one step further. people can get married as a religious/spiritual/wtv thing; i just don't think the government should be involved at all</br>  <br>And it is my opinion that people like you are more likely to ruin this country. I am no fan of Obama--particularly on matters to do with spying on US citizens. Regardless, I respect your right to be in this country and speak your mind freely, regardless of what I think about your words. That's what makes this a great nation.</br>  <br><br>You are making it significantly easier though. Why not just keep the word, ignore the wingnuts and leave the system as it was?</br></br>  <br>It's been on the table for years. If you were at all surprised then at best you're completely unobservant of the society you live in. The thing is that it probably wouldn't have happened if the religious right hadn't sunk so much energy and resources into opposing it. This is what reactionary politics produces: counter-reaction. Since the 90s most people have gone from being completely apathetic to the issue of gay rights to supporting it, because it's been rubbed in their faces incessantly by the opposition. Had gay people just been left alone, we wouldn't be where we are now. <br><br>The religious right has gone from having complete control of the federal government in easy reach, to being an increasingly irrelevant joke, and it's their own obnoxious aggression, unwillingness to compromise at all, and their lack of concern over more immediate issues that is to blame. This is what happens when you cut your own nose off to spite your face.</br></br></br>  <br>people like me (or at least those who thought like me) were in charge of this country for 200 years. Now faggots like you are taking over and running it to shit.</br>  <br>eh i dunno. shits and giggles i guess. i'd rather things change than things stay as they are; more interesting that way.</br>  <br>Why does everyone here keep assuming that my hypothetical children are minors? It doesn't matter if my child is 18, 30, or 50. They're still ones children. All throughout I have said my daughter or son who is a consenting adult, ie not a minor.</br>  <br><br><br>Actually, correction, I didn't say replace, I said "a different word/phrase used instead." Just trying to be exact here.</br></br></br>    <br>So, when is your first incestuous marriage lobby meeting? I mean, after all this is a real argument not a red herring, right?</br>  <br>Well, that's certainly your opinion and you have mine. Doesn't make either of us more or less correct. Time will tell now won't it? Us going back and forth surely is not going to do much of anything.</br>  <br><br>Given that stipulation and also the stipulation that the child is going to do it of their own freewill without manipulation, I have no problem with it. There is of course more potential for abuse, so maybe there would be some other kind of requirement.</br></br>  <br><br>  psychiatrists <br><br>Psychiatry is medical application of psychology idiot.<br><br>Scientologist or troll detected</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>boo hoo hurr durr i dont get to be in control anymore wahhhhh<br><br>go fucking die in a fire loser</br></br></br>  <br>Thank you. And so the same logic that justifies gay marriage is the same logic that justifies incestuous marriage.</br>  <br>"One of the key arguments often heard in support of homosexual civil marriage revolves around all the government "benefits" that homosexuals claim they are denied. Many of these "benefits" involve one thing-taxpayer money that homosexuals are eager to get their hands on. For example, one of the goals of homosexual activists is to take part in the biggest government entitlement program of all-Social Security. Homosexuals want their partners to be eligible for Social Security survivors' benefits when one partner dies."</br>  <br><br>And what's the problem with incestuous marriage?</br></br>  /b/<br>Why do most of Yanks hate the South of the United States and the Southern people?<br><br>Everytime someone wants to talk about Civil War, confederate flag or something related to the South Yankees start shitposting "Sister fucker, lol" or "Go back to the trailer park inbreed"<br> Literally why? </br></br></br></br>  <br>And you were, right? 90yr olds postin on b</br>  We know you yanks hate us. The feeling is mutual. So come get you some faggots.

I guess lucky it didn't get worse. You could have fallen face down in the snow and lost your nose and a eye. Reminds me of a story they told us once in school about a kid that got wasted in a jacuzzi and passed out. They said he drowned with his nose barely under the water line. <br><br>I think it's always a good idea when playing with drugs to have someone in the group that is sober and not on anything in case some shit goes down. I ate way too many magic mushrooms in the woods one time with two other guys and 2 hours into it I started to regret that no one was in control of the situation. Rapidly turned into a living nightmare.</br></br></br>  <br>kek'd</br>  Dope got me in this situation, now ironically I take 18 morphine tablets a day which is a bottle of 126 pills per week  <br>so how bad it hurts if you don't take them?</br>    <br>why do you need it and so much?</br>  <br>Not a nig'.<br>Also got my answer: Complete retard got what he deserved.<br><br>Maybe this shit will be reposted for some time here, enjoy your infamous ephemeral achievement.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If this photo was taken today 'I know it wasn't', I'd send you 30$ through pay pal to fill a bowl with peroxide, dunk your hand in it and film it.

I know you gotta realize it yourself but if even one time me trying to reach out and help someone works then it's worth trying every time. I remember the misery of trying to get drugs every day to not withdrawal, to have to go to centers to detox so I didn't have seizures from xanax withdrawal. Get out and start the process all over again. It wasn't a life worth living.</br>  I have this disease thing or whatever where my nose is 100% clogged 100% of the time so I'm a major mouth breather and I get looks everywhere I go, work, market. you get the idea. I've lost jobs and lost girlfriends because of it, I try to blow my nose but nothing happens and no air can really get out, there are some times where I can blow my nose and get an hour of two of empty nose but it sucks  <br> You know you fucked up. You kow you did something stupid and now have to pay. <br><br>so why fucking remind the guy, eh?</br></br></br>  If dubs, you cut your other fingers.  <br>because you are stupid enough to go public with it.</br>  <br><br>I wasn't reminding him. I wasn't that guy telling him he fucked up.<br><br>I just wanted to know why he gets all offended?<br>He could just be like yea I know. Learn from me.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not OP you dipshit</br>  So how much of your shit is fucked up in total now?<br>Just missing a few fingers or do you have huge gaps everywhere?</br>  <br>yes, yes you are.</br>  OP here<br><br>If the pain goes away I will get off the morphine, It's been a year though so I might be on this shit for life...<br><br>And I'm tolerant of the pills so I don't get 'high' or anything.. But if someone with no tolerance took my meds they'd be dead for sure.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I have that problem too, man.<br>I got a little better when I started exercising almost constantly (I commute by bike now) so I can blow my nose after arriving at my destination and have a few glorious hours of being able to breathe through my nose.<br>I've been trained by a lifetime of mouthbreathing, though, so I have to consciously breathe through my nose or I switch back and it's distracting.<br><br>Fuck nosebreather privilege.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Well, I get $1,500 per month on disability, I have a smoking hot wife who works and best of all....handicap parking.<br><br>Life is OK,</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> give yourself a handjob <br><br>You make it sound gay when you say it like that.</br></br></br>  <br>lol you're become a nigger</br>  <br>is handicap parking an 1.5k/month worth losing fingers and be addicted to morphine?</br>  <br>I guy I worked with had a massive Xanax addiction. He started taking them after watching his father die. His dealer ran out and watching him fall apart was crazy.
