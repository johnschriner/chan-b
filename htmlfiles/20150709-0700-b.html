My name is Patrick Bateman™, and I have contacted you for important matters. I have taken notice to your post. It is of high quality™, but it's not the contents of the post that I'm interested by, it's the post-number. Your post-number is unlike any other that I've ever seen. It is unique, as no other will ever obtain your distinct strand of numbers, but that is not the only unique thing about it. Look at the numbers at the very end. Take a look at them, and you might even realize it, too. Your post-number has ended in repeating digits, which is why I am contacting you. I don't want to seem like a bother, as I understand that you're very busy crafting hundreds of quality™ posts such as the one I am replying to, but this is a matter more important than posts. It's a matter of life and death. Here on 4chan, it is the most important rule of all that repeating digits much be checked and kek'd, that is why I am contacting you. I am here to check and kek your repeating digits, for it is a matter of religious importance. So, after all this patience and discussion, I will now check your repeating digits. Here I go: #Checked Now that your repeating digits have been checked by me, it is now time for me to leave. I cannot spend all day checking your repeating digits, no matter how much I love them. The reason? More digits must be checked.</br>  <br>Nope, try again<br>Hint: [spoiler]It's an RTS[/spoiler]</br></br>  <br>Cheked</br>  <br>Nier</br>  <br>Whorehammer</br>  <br>wow am I a newfag...</br>  <br>Nope.</br>  <br>Dark souls try harder</br>  <br>Were talking about games, not tv shows</br>   worst game 2015 <br> fly around city dressed like a retard <br> dies </br></br>  <br>shadowrun dragonfall, but good job</br>  <br>Smash TV?</br>  <br>Bloodborne<br>Mein neger</br></br>  <br>Pitfall</br>  <br><br>The Killing Game Show?</br></br>   zombies <br> having to pay money to repair items at a workbench </br>  Hey guys, I need some help. I'm a hardcore gamer. I love videogames. They're important to me. If I'm not working, then I'm probably playing videogames. So, it's only natural that this would be a real selling point for any potential relationship interest.<br><br>My boyfriend is a horrible casual gamer. He owns no current gen consoles and refuses to play anything that isn't old-as-dirt, horribly gimmicky, or just retro/hipster/kiddy garbage. He has a Wii U, a PS2, a Nintendo 3DS, and a heaping mountain of old stuff he's collected from the 90's and 2000's....or, he DID have those things.<br><br>I finally followed my own advice. He's been off visiting his family because of some accident his sister had for the past few days and he's due home tonight. While he's been away, I've taken the liberty of selling a ton of the stuff he could never bring himself to part with and buying him something actually worth his time.<br><br>I was quick to find a buyer. A local pawn shop eats things like this up, so they were happy to have me as a seller. Here's what my transactions have been like.<br><br>I sold: An NES + all of his NES cartridges, SNES + cartridges, Genesis + Cartridges, Genesis + games, Dreamcast (Didn't sell the games though. They were all burned onto disc, so they wouldn't take them), Virtual Boy + single game (Wario), PS2 + a fucking MOUNTAIN of old PS2 and PS1 games, and his Wii U + all Wii and Wii U titles. I didn't sell the 3DS...but that's only because he took it on the trip with him. All in all, the consoles + over 100 combined games netted me about $1000.<br><br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/626642831#p626642831">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> stale pasta from '11 is stale </br>  What is your "catchphrase," /b/?<br> "I mean, I guess" <br><br>pic unrelated</br></br></br>   yeah, man    heil hitler   <br>nah</br>   how me a macaroni learn computer   <br><br>peace</br></br>   Man like (Insert name here) <br><br> I'll slap you bruv </br></br>  Sorry<br>Seems like it anyways.</br>   "Give ya meat a good old rub."

So are these things worth the money?  <br>Nah. Dead chicks are cheaper.</br>  <br>im using homemade vagine made with sock and it's awesome, so i bet fleshlight is georgous</br>  yes    <br>Once you take your cash back out of her purse...</br>  yes.  <br>Bad dragon are better</br>  Tenga Flip Hole is superior. Had both. Ended up ditching the Fleshlight, still have the Tenga. Makes for fun times with the wife too. I use her toys on her and she uses mine on me.  <br>Bumping for interest.</br>  No, the self loathing you will experience after using it will outweigh the feeling you get from it, I used to use one, hated myself after using it, threw it away because you can't sell them used.  <br>No.<br><br>You won't be bothered to clean it properly anyway. <br><br>Get an estim kit or something if you want to pay.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If $50 is a big deal to you, then no, that money is better spent elsewhere. If $50 doesn't mean anything, then it's nice to have. Women have all sort of toys, this is one of ours. It's at times messy and the cleanup is often more then I care for, but when I've the time and the desire, warmed up with water and a nice lube, this is a good time... all things considered.</br>  <br>google soloflesh<br>dont waste ur money on that overpriced garbage</br></br>  No. They are a hassle to warm up and clean.  I've got one and i can honestly say I don't use it very often at all. <br>However, in the rare occasions where you just wanna treat yourself properly, jam it in a sink full of warm water and lube the fucker up, it is hands down way better than going solo.<br><br>What lets it down really is having to take the sleeve out clean it then dry it afterwards, if it was self-cleaning somehow I'd go ham all the time. Plus maintenance every so often so it doesn't like die.<br><br>conclusion: doesn't beat real pussy but beats the shit out of having a wank if you can be arsed to clean up afterwards.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> jacking off with an onahole makes you hate yourself <br> being this much of a normie <br>I bet horsepussy grosses you out too you little faggot.</br></br></br>  <br>yes for a some time, to you realize all your bitches are gone</br>  i hate lube, i'm a dry guy<br>how are these things dry?</br>  <br>PAINFULL</br>  <br>Use a cucumber. <br><br>1. Cut in half, <br>2. microwave so it's a little warm, <br>3. use a knife to carve out opening, <br>4. cut air hole in it so the air can come out when you put your dick in<br>5. ???<br>6. Profit<br><br><br>10/10</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fleshlights:<br>Somewhat expensive, feels amazing. Don't buy the pink ones, they are of a lower quality material that is gummier and doesn't feel as good. Get the 'fleshlight girls' editions which have more interesting interiors and are higher quality. Impossible to sterilize due to their material, if you neglect to clean the toy it'll be ruined with bacteria or mold very quickly.<br><br>Bad Dragon:<br>Extremely expensive, but well worth the price. Made of silicone so it's dense and heavy. Cleaning these are incredibly easy, in fact you can boil them in water to sterilize. Overall an incredibly high quality product.<br><br>Other "cyberskin" sex toys:<br>Basically fleshlights expect worse in every way. The low prices are tempting but trust me, don't bother.<br><br>Autoblow 2:<br>LOL</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just say no.</br>  A friend just brought me a fleshlight from Japan, but unfortunately it's too tight. At least he didn't buy the "toddler" model...    <br>Not really. I bought one and a dildo and the dildo is better.</br>  <br>this kills the penis</br>  <br>too much effort wtf dude</br>  <br>Absolutely not. Look for something with a better interior design.</br>  <br>NO</br>  <br>Horrible</br>  <br>spit a lot and you are fine.</br>  <br> NO <br> Flashlights SUCK <br> Get a meiki 2 layer, XYZ or Sara </br></br></br>  <br>Male masturbators are great, but stay away from fleshlights. Overpriced crap and it's waaay too loose for masturbation. Look into Japanese versions instead, usually called onaholes.</br>  <br>kinda<br><br>I got the asshole one back in hs, and it was really good. I wrapped a heat blanket around it for a bit to get it warm. Would put the whole thing between my mattress and go doggy on it.<br><br>Gets nasty kinda quickly tho.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wow. That's weird. Do you hate yourself after masturbating with your hand as well?</br>  <br>Not really. I get more pleasure from my cheap doc johnson fuckholes than the one I bought.</br>  <br>yes, but they are really loud. going flapflapflap all the time. all your housemates will know.</br>  <br>You must have a micro penis</br>  <br><br>This.<br><br>broke a tenga on my first try, fleshlight is the only compatable thing out there for over 7in.</br></br></br></br>  <br>A cucumber...you have a small one doen't it ?!</br>  <br> Impossible to sterilize due to their material <br>That's not exactly true. You can use isopropyl alcohol.</br></br>  Not fleshlight specifically, but they are nice to have when you want to fap. Just a change in texture is great.  <br>This. Meiki sleeves are good.<br><br> Tenga Onahole Warmer <br> Meiki Maria Ozawa <br> Sylk lubricant </br></br></br></br></br>  No, unless you get excited by rubber. Bought one and after a while I'd just rather use my hand.  <br>Buy a Tenga Egg they cost 8$ and i've used mine 30times, clean it and don't deathgrip fury wank and you should be fine.<br><br>cheaper then fucking a banana or cucumber or w/e people in this thread suggests <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=TBV<wbr>_d1JbAL0</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>wat<br>I've seen these in a store and assumed theyre for woman. Might get myself one of em</br></br>  Yes but seducing women can be so easy with the right method (and alcohol)  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;13728884 <br>This will answer all of your questions</br>  <br>I thought that initially too.</br>  <br><br><br>Tho i have never tried fleshlight it might be amazing but. i would get a Tenga fliphole if i were going to spend some cash on a sex toy.<br><br>sofar i've gotten a Tenga egg and a rude boy prostate massager<br> pic related <br>very entry level when it come to putting stuff in my ass.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What if I just want to chill at home and get the job done by someone I know can do it well? (myself that is)</br>  <br>I've got a fleshlight vibro, but after a bit over a month it started to tear everywhere, I'll soon bring it back and hope for a refund.<br>The egg seem cheap and easy enough that I'll definitely get it, been thinking about something like the rude boy too.</br></br>  <br>Start with your finger if you are just curious.<br> in the shower <br>i only use my sex toys if i am going to shower after easy cleaning.<br><br>the rude boy or naught boy got many vibration settings.<br>i use mine on low - medium vibration when i masturbate and when its close i pop it up to ultra and shoot strings for 2meters.<br><br>it can feel a bit uncomfortable to put it a long way inside at first just so you know.<br> lube is your friend </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I got one awhile ago and at first I loved it but now I hardly ever use it because the clean up is too much (I like to jack off then roll over and pass out) so having to do a whole cleaning on it got boring. Check of pic related. I have something similar and I prefer it much more then the fleshlight  4Chin raid on Habbo. Make a black bald character.
