[ What's it like having a girlfriend, /b/?  Don't need to change hand when wank.  breddy cool<br><br>granted, she's not a cuntbag. qt3.14, great in bed, likes all of the same things i do, not clingy, smart as fuck, helps me deal with my shit, supports my dreams.. could not be happier</br></br>  Hands free wanking  <br>Shutup and post more of her op</br>  <br>it is great the first month , boring at best after.</br>  Wouldn't know.  <br>happy for you man</br>  No need to fuck ur little sister anymore  <br>I just got divorced. Believe me it sucks. Just get a friend that you can fuck.</br>  <br>i appreciate it, 3 ys strong and she's still cool, guess i hit the jackpot or something. fingers crossed it stays this good, but i've known her for 7 years or so and she's always been super chill. <br><br>it's not exciting or anything anymore, but it's just nice to come home after work to someone who is a total bro, easy to get along with, and super sweet to me.</br></br></br>  <br>Why bother with a friend and make things complicate, get some random slut, from craiglist</br>  <br> You have less money <br> Less time for yourself <br> You feel morose when it's over <br><br>Basically it's not worth it in the long run, unless you are a sentimental weak faggot. Sex is good tho</br></br></br></br></br>  Holy fuck I think I developed Aspergers just scrolling through this thread  <br><br>well, in my opinion a girlfriend can be annoying, but she gives you a lot. <br>  ofc she gives nice heads and sucks your dick like a pro if you picked the right one... whenever you like, you can basicly get a blowjob. <br><br>A relationship pretty much sucks at the beginning. But after a year you learned to trust the other person without hesitating and all the affort from the beginning starts to pay off. <br>  It's nice to have somebody around you :) </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Imagine having your favourite thing, but it completely sucks the joy and fun out of your 2nd-10th favorite thing.</br>  <br>Best post I have seen on 4chan</br>  <br>/b/ - Random<br>The stories and information posted here are artistic works of fiction and falsehood.<br>Only a fool would take anything posted here as fact.</br></br></br>  <br>7 years? jesus<br>everything sounds amazing<br>heres hoping it never stops</br></br></br>  <br> affort <br>You get an A for Affort</br></br>  <br>wow. this is the MOST accurate description, EVER. works for marriage too, for about a year or so, then the fun dies and so do you, a little bit each day...</br>  <br>Thats true<br>I know the excitement decreases over all the years but as you said, it's nice to have somebody around. You don't need to get to know any1 - you just got a nice buddy, who would give a lot for you :)</br></br>  <br>It's great. You feel like nothing else matters because no matter what, you still have this wonderful person who will love you and support you and make you feel like the most important person in the world, and you will legitimately want to take care of her and make her smile because of the way she makes you feel.<br><br>Then she leaves you and it all comes crashing down and you feel like complete and utter shit and it makes you question every facet of your existence. I haven't really been happy since she left, I'm honest. I've had moments of happiness, but not the overall feeling of contentment I had when I was with her. I don't know how to feel happy like that anymore.<br><br>Shit sucks man.</br></br></br></br></br>  Whole lot of obligations, you have to double check with someone before you do shit, everything that ever happens needs to be discussed. If you don't fuck her enough you find her ugly, if you want to fuck too often you just want her for her body. Your career, friends, music taste, drinking habbits, cleaning habbit, diet all come under intense scrutiny and it feels like you can't be your own person anymore no matter how hard you try or how much you stand your ground. You always lose alot of your friends and gain lesser couple mutual friends. And there's the underlying knowledge that there's a 99% chance it'll all end at some point, and when it ends you know it'll hurt more than anything you've experienced before, you literally lose the will to do anything, it's like driving to the dentist when you're a kid, you know what's coming and you dread it but this ride takes much longer.<br><br>Yet at the end of the day you don't care, when the girl you love nuzzles into your chest and looks at you like you're the center of the universe all the other shit doesn't matter. No one else on this planet can replicate the moment of two people in love just holding each other, even your own mother can't come close and even long after you two part it stays with you.<br><br>Overall a 6-7/10 experience, recommended but nothing to lose sleep over. If the opportunity arises take it for sure but don't go out of your way.</br></br></br></br>  It's like having a free prostitute  <br>checked</br>  <br> free <br>keke</br></br>  <br>Hookers. Hookers are your answer.<br><br>Trust me.</br></br></br>  It's like having a very demanding pet that will let you fuck it every now and then.  <br>What was it like between you in the years before you got together?</br>  <br>damn dude...</br>  <br><br>yeah, absolutely. If you find the right one, someone who's already great/best friends with you, it's awesome. i know i'll get boring and old with anybody i pick so might as well be someone who i still like even w/o the sex i guess<br><br>also, appreciating what you have is pretty important. any relationship will be miserable if you take your partner for granted, or pick bad people to start with</br></br></br></br>  <br>10/10 description</br>   dating same girl for 8 years <br> constant love and hate at the same time <br> not having to fall asleep alone every night <br> the joy of finally falling asleep alone every once and a while. </br></br></br>  <br>Mostly the same. Lots of inside jokes and fun, spent time playing games together, late nights doing stuff with mutual friends, but with that added unresolved sexual tension.<br><br> I was too much of a betafag at first to ever ask her out, so it took us years to hook up, but it's been great since. Having common interests helps keep it not stale. We both like going innawoods, playing the same vidya, music, etc. more important than the physical attraction, i think.</br></br></br>  <br>i'll tell you what its like when it's over<br>she appears in your dreams every now and then and you think you are still together until you wake up and feel sadness for the rest of that day <br>and it never stops</br></br></br>  <br>this man speaks the truth</br>  <br>this is accurate</br>  <br><br>This. Jesus fuck it's overrated, but you can't live without it. Fuck evolution, man. It'd be so much easier to be gay.</br></br>    Great for about a month then terrible forever. Gets even worse at the end  <br> after a year it gets better <br> only to completely suck after the second </br></br>  <br>God, that ass.</br>  <br> all these replies and no sauce on dat ass </br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>The fuck? There are no feelings on 4chan, or people for that matter.<br><br>This can't be real.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It ain't even that great. It's the angle of the outfit that makes it looks nice. But still, would bury dick.</br>  <br>very demanding and you can't fuck random bitches anymore. don't really like it.</br>  It's good. My girlfriend and I have been together 6 years. It's hard to describe what it's like other than I can't imagine what my life would be like without her. We have a really good relationship and enjoy each others company. Even after all this time sex hasn't gotten old, yet. We still fuck like rabbits.  <br>You mean leddit users who come to 4chan for le entertaining "keks"?</br>  <br>It is here, sometimes. You just have to look for it.</br>  <br>hard fucking work<br>and no, not always 'fucking work' usually just work.</br></br>  It's OK  <br>Its alright I guess. I miss being able to have flings. Having sex with different people every once in awhile was great. Being single is awesome OP don't EVER forget that.</br>  <br>Having a girlfriend never ends happily... It's the one you are with forever that is the happily ever after shit. If you can put up with her batshit crazy, and she yours then you are golden. Most women are hypergamous, so make sure you are always on your toes proving that you are the best thing she will ever get. Otherwise she'll end up fucking your best friend or something. Be wise enough to know when to call it quits to... It'll just lead to more heartbreak if you are trying to make something outta nothing... I know this from experience. Ex cheated on me early in the relationship, and it lasted a year and a half. I never trusted her again, and it put massive strain on our relationship. I tried to make her leave me early on, but she kept saying we can work it out... *Note to anyone this applies to... <br> You can never fucking work it out </br></br>  <br> Being single is awesome OP don't EVER forget that. <br>Only if you know how to girls.</br></br>  <br><br> I can't help but notice you are distracted and living a carefree life. Can't you see that your petty distractions are preventing you from living authentically?<br><br> OUR relationship to the world is that with moving towards the future. But all of our futures ultimately lead towards our deaths! You must acknowledge that humans are living finite lives moving towards our deaths!<br><br> YOU Must embrace the anxiety that comes with making real world choices! And you must embrace the guilt of having to live with what will never be due to the choices you made!<br><br> You attempt to blend into the herd to avoid the burden of becoming who you are!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>what?</br>  nice  <br> free </br>  <br>Talking to girls used to be very hard for me too. It is just one of those things that you have to work at. It helps to try to be more outgoing. I joined a fraternity in college and that helped alot. If you are young I would try to get involved in one.</br>  get rolling ye shits  234  <br>re roll,fucking phone is broken lmao</br>  roll  <br>Rolling so hard</br>  <br>ayydelalmao</br>  Roll  rawl  <br>  /b/ doesn't already knows all my secrets <br><br>Am bisexfag</br></br></br>  This looks...interesting.  <br>roooooollllin</br>  <br><br>Oh fuck you.</br></br>  roll  <br>not really demonic but whatever</br>  lets seee  Re-Rolling for shits and giggles.  <br>might as well<br>roll</br></br>  rolllllllin  Roll  <br>re roll</br>  roll  roll  <br>sdftgyhjik</br>  roll  grooll  le roll  <br>rawling</br>  <br>rolling it like a mofo</br>  roll    <br>Rollll</br>  roll    <br>67 get</br>  <br>ROLLING IN</br>  <br>rolllllllll</br>  Blegh  roll  re-roll  <br>rolling rocks</br>  ydaipdjAPDJODP peis    sdfghjkl;'  roll  ayy  <br>re roll</br>  Rollio  Rollin' Rollin' Rollin'  Rolling to see get  <br>roll around</br>  Rolling  <br>Roll</br>  <br>These kids these days. they don't know how good they got it.

Wrap about 3 layers of tin foil around a sharpie. Take sharpie out. Bend end you want to be the bowl at about a 60 degree angle. Make sure you can pull through the bend, then drop your weed in. Enjoy.  Soak it lightly with lighter fluid. Put a match or lighter to it. Ingest it and let the good times roll.

The mudslimes do it with violence, terror, and murder.<br><br>Seriously, only an idiot would compare these two.</br></br></br></br>  Christ and Allah take turns fucking each other in the ass.  <br>you're comparing moderate christians with extremists muslims.<br><br>you could make a similar logical fallacy by comparing moderate muslims with extremist christians.<br><br> seriously, only an idiot </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>well life is about severity and quantity, not saying that christian terrorism is good, saying that it is much less prevalent.<br><br>It's about picking the least evil you can. I'm also saying this as an atheist.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>allah is the word for god in arabic-speaking christian communities as well. not exclusive to islam.</br>  <br>wat<br><br>full retard mode on?</br></br></br>  <br>Th westborogh baptist church doesn't have an army. for one.</br>  <br>Well...the Christians aren't murdering people. So there's that.</br>  <br>Ah, so it is safe to say Allah fucks himself then?

HURDUR RELIGION OF PEACE.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  You see the funny thing is, in my family's home country, bosnia, we have a shitton of dirty mudslimes. guess where the first isis training camp in proximity to my current country (austria) appeared? yep, in bosnia.<br><br>so do you really equally want mudslimes to populate your country as christians?<br><br>sounds like a stupid decision, you aren't convincing us with that. do as you wish but i'm saying no to mudslimes.</br></br></br></br>    <br>One kills regularly and has continuously for their beliefs since the first months of the existence of their beliefs until now.<br><br>The other has done slightly less killing in the name of faith, and has been responsible for the development of secularism, societal standards of religious tolerance and pluralism, and the enlightenment</br></br></br>  Religion is fucking retarded, the only difference is that today muslims are a bit worst because they fell behind. <br><br>They're all still fucked up though. We'd be better off without them, no doubt we'd have another tool to control the masses and fuck ourselves over with. But hopefully it'd be something not as shitfucked as religion.</br></br>  With the violence in mind, we might make the mistake of assuming that the difference is how they're approaching it, but that would be wrong.<br><br>They both want their views to be LAW.<br><br>They both want their ways to be forced on EVERYBODY. <br><br>They both believe violence is justified, even if the given Christians are not themselves exercising it, they believe another (God) will.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  (Op) the original purpose of the meme was to draw attention to the fact that the County Clerk is using her religious beliefs as an excuse to discriminate, which can be compared to Isis or the wbc  <br>Because WBC (Christian Extremists) make up less than 1% of all Christians. Muslim extremists on the other hand are much close to 35%.<br><br>Also no WBC member has ever killed anyone, burned anyone alive, beheaded anyone. If you can't see the difference between this and holding up rude signs, then you need to seek help OP.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm not the slightest bit religious, but I really hate it when people use the Westboro Baptist Church as an example of Christianity. I mean ffs, the idiots have 40 members. 40. And I have yet to hear any credible, accountable religious person run to their defense. In contrast, the fucking excuses for psychotic, violent behavior is rampant in the Islamic world. Even Islam's highest leaders say shit that just make you wonder if they've lost their minds.</br>  <br>Are you French? <br>Because it's actually that kind of shit media told us.</br></br>  <br>(Op) Exactly my point</br>  <br>I'd like a source check on that 35% muslim extremist. Mostly because I kinda want it to be true :/</br>  <br>American media says the same shit. It's typical lib PC bullshit. IOW: They don't have the balls to call it how it is.</br>  <br>Violence is violence weather it be beheading somebody, or picketing a soldier's funeral with the intention of provoking a violent reaction</br>  <br>in total muslims are still more radikal than christians<br><br> inb4 leddit islamophile butthurt booh hoo </br></br></br>  i like how /b/ is so edgy and stuff but when it comes to islam they start saying things like:<br> rape is wrong  <br> women should have rights <br> you can't simply behead people </br></br></br>  <br>Just a guess. Ask yourself how many Muslims have stood up and condemned this type of behavior? None? Pretty close to it...<br><br>When WBC was acting like jackasses, many Christians came out and called them out on it.</br></br></br>  <br>Congratulations, that's the dumbest thing I've read today.</br>  <br>(Op) that's the reason why I specifically said extremists I actually hold quite a few Christian values near and dear to my heart but hating somebody else for who they are is not one of them</br>  <br> implying picketing is violence <br> stupid as fuck, or b8... can't tell which <br><br>1/10 for making me reply.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You obviously don't know any muslims</br>  <br>Fun fact: another statistic says clearly that 85% of my statistics are just made up.</br>  <br>/thread.<br><br><br>Facebook atheism on /b/? It's more likely than you think.<br><br>/b/ ain't shit anymore.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  We've seen Christian terrorists in Ireland.  <br>When its with the intention of provoking a violent reaction yes it is violence if its just sit there voice your opinion then its non violence the difference being a black person sitting in a cafe in the sixties and a woman walking up to a mother saying Thank God your child is dead</br>  <br> Fun fact: christians are just as bad as muslims </br>  "Only an idiot would compare the two" -- really? <br>Spoken like a true brainwashed Christian halfwit. All religion is evil... No I'm not a fucking atheist-- even that is a form of religion.<br>Why can't people just live their own fucking lives and believe whatever they want without some arsehole trying to force them into thinking the way they do?<br>What ever happened to " do unto others what you would have done unto yourself" ?</br></br></br>  <br><br>"Statistics" based on guesses are extremely biased and I don't care for them even if I want it to be true. I do believe there are more extremist muslisms than christians even though I think both are real shitfucks.<br><br>However I don't like citing numbers that have no actual base of truth.<br><br>You forget that a shitton of muslims can't condem the violence because a lot of them are not on social media.<br><br>Social media != the whole world.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> All Christians act this way, or more so than Muslims acting bad. </br>  <br>Yeah, because hurting people's feels is equivalent to burning them alive....do you listen to yourself talk?....are your parents brother and sister?</br>  <br>But, the extremists in Christianity are generally quite marginalized. The extremists (ideologically) in Islam are virtually mainstream. They've downright succeeded in implementing their bigoted, hateful, intolerant religious laws in numerous places. Try to build a mosque in the U.S. ... no go try to build a church in Saudi Arabia.</br>  <br><br>I think it's the ones with the most sawed off heads wins too... America need to step the fuck up!!!</br></br>  <br>They were outright asked by news reporters on TV.

Sure you may not succeed building a church in Saudi Arabia but go to Iran and there are plenty of Christian Churches some of which date a thousand years.<br>Understand that Muslims consist of many different demographics.</br></br>  <br> atheism is a form of religion <br><br>wat<br><br>Religion definition: (1) : the service and worship of God or the supernatural (2) : commitment or devotion to religious faith or observance<br><br>Atheism definition: a disbelief in the existence of deity<br><br>It's right there, it's NOT a religion. Some people have made "organizations" stating they're a unified atheism. But it's just retarded, not a religion though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>On Fox News??<br><br>Yeah, must have been. I wouldn't want to talk to those racist hateful plebs either.<br><br>There are other news sources other than fox.<br><br>Pro Tip: Fox isn't news.

You all suck each other's herpes infested cocks and at the same time are successfully dragging your twisted religion with its retarded values into the mud where it belongs</br></br></br>  <br> News reporters on TV <br><br>lol, you for real mate? <br><br> implying the media doesn't skew everything regarding anything to make more money <br><br>5/10 for making me pick up a discussion with you</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How long do you think America has been around...?</br>  <br><br> In the U.S., violence directed towards abortion providers has killed at least eight people <br>HOLY SHIT, AT LEAST EIGHT PEOPLE<br><br>SURELY CHRISTIANITY AND ISLAM ARE EXACTLY THE SAME</br></br></br></br></br>    Christ &gt; Muhammad. But:<br><br><br>Westerners are worse because they do it in direct contradiction of Christ and liberal Western tradition. It's easier to excuse Muslims.<br><br>Plus, /lgbt/ people are more sexually repressive than Muslims.<br><br><br> there's no difference, all religions are shit <br>Still not as shit as Marxism.<br><br><br> Christian extremists don't decapitate people on video. <br>They don't. Until they begin. Same as Muslims. Muslims didn't either. There was no video in the Middle Ages. Give it time.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Your implying Christian violence towards Muslims has only occurred in the short time frame that America has been around</br>  <br>They is a difference, but I think you and I would disagree on which one is worse. Most people with a brain would side with me, but ignorant fucks such as yourself want to keep spreading islam-o-phobia. The fact that you can't see that your handlers have an agenda, and you are their useful idiot is astounding to me.</br>  <br><br>HE CARES NOT FOR WHOSE BLOOD IS SPILLED. ONLY THAT IS SPILLED.</br></br>  <br> the point is both groups have extremists <br>just because you choose to ignore the fact that the number do matter does not mean that you've proven your argument<br>christian terrorism doesn't even come close to the thousands and thousands of suicide bombings, executions and massacres commited by islamic terrrorism<br><br>you can't just put both of them on the same level, that's a deliberate insult</br></br></br></br></br>  Oh... Running to a dictionary--the worldwide sign of a brainless cunt. Yes atheism has become just as much of a cult as the religions it's supposedly hates. Just like satanists are just rebel Christians... Atheists are religious fucks that became "atheists " to spite mummy and daddy. The funny part is you are just as vocal and obsessed with relgion as they are  <br>That contributed utterly nothing to the conversation about what a train wreck Islam has become and how pervasive the acts of violence its followers are perpetrating in today's world. Make all the excuses you want, but it's time the world starts pushing back hard against Islam. Enough of this medieval, backward, violent, narrow-minded, misogynistic, raping, pillaging, cruel, torturing, murdering, martyrdom-loving psychotic bullshit.</br>  <br> implying that a mostly christian nation didn't bomb their nations, killing their women and children. <br><br>And you wonder why they're pissed....<br><br>The autism is high in this one.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Obviously the point is they are the same in regards to wanting to impose their religion on other people</br>  <br>You are so god damned stupid it's unbelievable. Are you in control of your drool? When you went to school was your bus the short one? Only lefty ideologues are retarded enough to call extremist Christians worse. Give one reason why Christianity is worse.</br>  <br>seriously, in what way are present-day christian extremists worse than islamic extremists?</br>  <br><br>The size of the scroll bar on each of these says it all.<br>Also I'd just like to point out this comparison is always made like somehow one people of one religion doing awful things justifies another religion doing it less awful. <br>Isn't the whole idea of most religions to be a good person even if the people around you are doing/have done awful things.<br>Two wrongs don't make a right, and definitely don't justify your shitty beliefs.<br>You're all wrong and dumb.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>christianfags don't bomb and/or behead people in their efforts. they are just annoying about it</br></br>  <br><br> Christian extremists don't decapitate people on video. <br>Aren't satanists just Christian extremists?</br></br></br>  <br>justifies another religion doing it or makes it less awful*</br>  <br>See  </br>  ITT: butthurt followers of Abrahams blood "god" argue among themselves about who is more savage  FYI, the crusades were Christians fighting against Muslims. Islam is the only religion in the world that is spread by violence. Also, Vlad the impaler was killing Muslims to keep them from coming into his kingdom.  <br>Yes actually they do try googling it</br>  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chr<wbr>istian_terrorism</wbr>  <br>IRA, SLA, Abortion Clinics<br><br>There ya go, a few freebies.

You never hear christians killing others in the name of god  <br>Islamic Terrorism doesn't truly exist. So some lone wolf faggots (in the name of Islam, although falsely) say some shit about Allah while committing a crime and you are all like HURDUR ISLAMIC TERRIST!<br><br> inb4 9/11 Fuck You - because Bush was behind it. </br></br></br>  <br> The size of the scroll bar on each of these says it all. <br>Only because the word "terrorism" is a modern invention and Christians happen to be in power right now. So circular logic.</br></br>  <br> africa </br>  <br>All the time pleb! Read the fucking news online, and turn Fox off, it's making you autistic.</br>  <br>Fucking THIS right here!<br><br>/thread</br></br></br>  <br>He was, look up the "Project For the New American Century," and the FACT that the Admin was briefed about an impending attack. And now this toadstool is running to be the next POTUS. Think long and hard about that</br>  <br>I'm amused that only a couple have seen the point and that they both use religion to impose their views and that there is no difference doing that</br>  <br>It's a drop in the bucket compared to Islam (and honestly, they're noting shit on that page from the 1800s ffs). But more importantly ... no one defends the assholes. On the other hand, Islam gets this fucking constant pass by western politicians and media because they're such fucking pushovers and can't dare to offend anyone or my goodness, seem intolerant. They have literally become tolerant of a murdering religion that despises them and wants their way of life destroyed. It's insane.</br>  <br> burning people alive <br><br>So you belive ISIS is real? Moron, it's a disinformation campaign run by the CIA and the far right to keep plebs like you in fear.</br></br></br>  Id like to see some of you niggers go to a muslim country and yell "fuck allah" then go to a christian country and yell "fuck jesus". See what the reactions like  <br>Lame attempts at blaming "political correctness" do nothing to defer from the fact that you are a fucking idiot, they only highlight it</br>  <br>you have religious faith that there is no God. And you observe science meme pictures of stars.</br>  <br>Same could be said about isreal and the USA constantly pandering to those murdering fucks</br>  <br> being this dumb <br>Different countries = Different cultures.<br><br>why would you expect the same reaction?</br></br></br></br>  Holy shit, the fucking Islamic apologists in this thread. I pity you poor stupid bastards. Do you even read the fucking news? Do see what this religion has been doing the past 20 years? Just fucking wow.  <br> muh tinfoil hat.... DERP! </br>  <br> damage control as fuck </br>  <br>Different as if one being more savage?</br>  Will there a new fappening late august? I heard some of you saying that. What celebs will be part of?

MORE FOR Kaya Scodelario  ok let me tell you the story guys, cause you faggots dont remember, do ya?<br>so a few days before august 31 some anon posted a thread claiming he has pictures and wants to sell for btc, obviously noone believed, yet he left an email address. me, and probably some other anons contacted him. i wrote a pretty legit looking email saying im interested in buying, yet asked him to provide any proof. so he did send 2 pics, 1 of kate upton and 1 on jennifer (related). (i actually have the whole thread screencaped yet my fucking hdd crashed and is in the drawer waitning for better times, so i can pay for the repair cause currently broke, one day ill provide). so anyway he sends the pics, and obviously i dont pay and end conversation. i check the pics on google images and tineye to see if they were already posted, no sign, shit looks like oc, damn. im not a fag so i make a new thread and post the 2 pics, maybe someone remembers that thread. now my role ended here. then shit went downhill cause anon who had them (he was one of few who had all the pics cause it was a small hacking group from anonib). well he realized that shit is leaking so slowely, but surely, others started posting the pics, and finally someone probably said fuck it, and released all, realizing he wont be able to make any more cash cause shit is leaking. thats pretty much the end of the story, you know the rest. some of you might know me as based anon, but im only one of many. cheers m8s</br>  <br>aint ever enough JLaw</br>  I'll be waiting for August 31!
