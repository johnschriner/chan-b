No point in making yourself angry</br></br>  I cut myself for fun  <br>hey man, that's not cool. i know i'm boring as hell but you don't have to call attention to it...</br>  I am a Freemason in one of the worlds oldest Masonic lodges.  <br>Don't do that shit, you sissy bitch.<br>I seriously hope you kill yourself.<br><br>No I kinda like baiting them from time to time, but this one just annoys me oddly different<br><br>Post pics, it's my fetish</br></br></br></br></br></br>  My world is fire and blood...  When I was 13 my mother died and since I was a huge mama's boy my entire life her death fucked me up. Now I'm a masocist that finds motherly qualities the biggest turn ons  <br>probably annoys you because you can't bait him with your shit tier level "trolling"<br><br>i remember when people used to actually try on this site.<br><br>wait, no...no i don't.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You should probably talk to someone about that. Someone with actual qualifications<br><br><br><br>Is it the pain that makes it fun? I've never understood that, pain is so... Unfun to me.<br><br><br><br>Sorry, sorry!<br><br><br><br>How much of the government do you control? Who really killed Kennedy? Can jet fuel melt steel beams?<br><br><br><br>There is no need to be upset, friend.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>that's where you were supposed to say "you're not boring!" you...you...BAKA! ;_;</br>  I knew James Holmes  i have 11 toenails  <br>i only know one person who i can really call a friend.</br>  <br> I'm le oldfag, /b/ was always le edgy XD <br>No it wasn't. <br>Gbtr, summerfag<br><br>I'm not your friend<br>I'd appreciate it if you cut yourself and went back to r9k</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>It's called major depression + antidepressants = no emotion or massive anxiety and cutting is a release.</br></br></br>  <br>wow, it's like you didn't even read the post.<br><br>you can read, right anon? i mean, it's a pretty basic skill needed for lots of things in life, so i really hope you can...</br></br></br>  <br>Freemasonry isn't so much about controlling the government as outsiders like to believe. Not in it's core. It's about self improvement, about brotherhood and family above all, and about learning the importance of history, philosophy and psychology.<br><br>However, seeing as a very large part of the people holding the most important positions in society happen to be a part of the Freemasons, I guess the answer to your question is: We control nearly all of the governments in the modern and civilized countries we have taken root within.</br></br></br>  <br><br>And they say daddy issues are damaging... Ah well, having a thing for motherly women isn't too fringe, you should be fine<br><br><br><br>O-oh, umm... You're so interesting, tell me more!<br><br><br><br>Was he a wild and crazy guy?<br><br><br><br>Whaaaaat? How is that even possible?<br><br><br><br>Good. Having a bunch of friends is tiring, and they're usually not great friends anyway.<br><br><br><br>I've been to r9k maybe once and never posted there, try again bud<br><br><br><br>It's just hard to sympathize, ya know? I can sympathize with the depression bit but I've never experienced crippling anxiety that made me need a release like that</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hot<br>Would rub my dick on/10<br><br>Too bad they're cat scratches though, I've got a deeper scar on my eyelid ffs<br><br> anon cares about me  <br>Aww &lt;3<br><br>Of course I can read, deary.<br><br>But still, hop off my dick loverboy</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>nope. too late hot plate.<br>my feelings are hurt and there's no way to console me.</br></br>  <br> and cutting is a release. <br><br>you spelt "attention seeking" wrong anon</br></br></br>  <br>of course i care about you anon, if you weren't around how would i get my daily quota of laughing at morons on the internet?</br>  Interesting? Well I have no special qualities but, unlike the other emofags in this thread I don't crave sympathy.  Literally who are you  <br>good for you. someone get this anon a cookie.</br>  <br>Yea too bad my only razor blade is dull as shit<br><br>Uh no. I'm just a closeted faggot.</br></br></br>  I pulled an ice cream truck heist and my fridge is full of ice cream <br>but I'm lactose intolerant</br>  i wish i was born a masocist  I remember when I was new and called people summerfags and told them to go back to [insert current buzzword site here]. Good times...<br><br><br><br>I suppose I can understand that, but why is there emphasis on ritual and secrecy? Is it just tradition or does it serve a specific purpose?<br><br><br><br>Hot plate? That's a new one... You're so clever &lt;3<br><br><br><br>Good for you!<br><br><br><br>Literally no one important</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I spent most of the day shelling fava beans and the fuckers are all over my appartment, like....everywhere</br>  i'm starving to death  <br>I'll give him attention alright<br><br>With my dick<br><br>Let's cuddlefuck, I'm tired of waiting fgt<br><br>Buy a knife or something.<br>Post more you pathetic shit</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I was a field hockey ( yeah i know, fagsport ) talent, but i simply couldn't be arsed giving up social life and vidyas for 5+ days of training a week and going god knows where for matches and hopefully get scouted.<br><br><br>Worst mistake i ever made.</br></br></br>  <br> I have a small scar above my right eye from a gun accident. <br> I spent two months in a psych ward for anorexia despite not having it. <br> I had erectile dysfunction for three months and i miss it every day. </br></br></br>  <br><br>Something tells me you don't think your plans through as much as you should...<br><br><br><br>Why so many fava beans? Beans are gross<br><br><br><br>Well shit, that's no good. No soup kitchens or something similar nearby?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>When you join the Freemasons you must swear an oath never to talk about our secrets and rituals with outsiders, and to some extent also with people within the Freemasons that have not yet reached the require grade. However, if you look at it from a logical viewpoint, of course tradition plays a part in it - But Freemasons tend to be intelligent people so if it served no purpose at all, it wouldn't make any sense and would never 'stick'.</br>  Toenail number 11  <br>ha, he remembers things.<br><br>i got it from an episode of futurama, sheesh~ &lt;3<br><br>you're sending mixed messages here.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Jesus fucking christ, get a pedicure.</br>  <br>Oh okay I'll get straight to the point then<br><br>Bend over</br></br></br>  <br>hmmmmm<br><br>i am not sure how to feel<br><br>anything about nails will make me feel disgusted</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>im collecting them</br>  <br>only if you promise to hatefuck me and make it really degrading.</br>  <br><br>People would have paid you to play field hockey? WHY WOULD YOU GIVE THAT UP MAN?<br><br><br><br>How did you fake anorexia well enough to be hospitalized for it?<br><br><br><br>Ah, okay. That's interesting, how did you become a member in the first place?<br><br><br><br>What uh... What exactly am I looking at?<br><br><br><br>I remember lots! You should have just taken the compliment and not told me, jeez</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's not the point. If you're not getting a proper pedicure, one of those things is bound to grow inwards soon, leaving you with a very, vvery, very painfull toe that requires medical attention.</br>  <br>because we grow them on the family plot, was harvest time.<br>Plus, favas are beautiful when you get them fresh off the plant, they just suck after they get canned for storage</br></br>  <br>I've got anxiety problems. I overdosed on Xanax.</br>  <br>i like to keep things honest between us :3</br>  I once flipped over in my sleep so violently I elbowed my then GF in the mouth and she had to go get stitches.  <br><br>Kek, are you a Targaryen Max?</br></br>   Op asks what is interesting about yourself, not your life problems <br>I like to collect the things people don't usually collect. I've gathered what appears to be an entire box full of toenails I've clipped over 30 or so years now.</br>  <br>Christ you're pathetic.<br>No, if you enjoy it then I'm just going to coddle you. I don't want you happy</br></br>  <br>you are looking at toenail number 11.<br>in case anyone wonder i was born like that</br></br>    <br>Well, English is not my mother language, so let me clarify: I would get ''paid'' but not enough to sit on my arse all day, i would still be required to get a normal job next to it unless i was scouted for the top teams. I can't recall exactly all the shit back then, but there was also a possibility for me to represent my country in international games.<br><br>Decided to focus on school, social life and vidyas when i was 14. Dumbest thing i ever did.</br></br></br>  <br>I collect the virginities of young boys</br>  <br>I didn't FAKE it per se, i just had some digestion issues that resulted in some pretty significant weight loss, and was than hospitalized for heart failure. They took over from there because I talked about not wanting to gain a bunch of weight without good food choices\exercise and get fat. Dietary restraint=insanity I guess.</br>  <br>joke's on you, faggot. i love cuddling.</br>  I put my dick in my dogs mouth every now and then.  <br>I'm the next ruler of the world</br>  <br>What if I strap you to a radiator and put the heat on full blast?<br>What if I put glass in your foreskin and stomp on your cock?<br>Would you enjoy that?</br></br></br>  <br>why would anyone try to do that? is it an american thing?</br>  I have 4 swords, 2 re Japanese and the other are Indian  <br>*tips hat*</br>  <br>probably not, no. but then again, who would? you're kinda weird, anon.</br>  <br>i did had sex once</br>    <br>I'm actually very lonely</br>  <br>sorry wrong image</br>  <br>I met a Freemason when I visited St Andrews University in Scotland. He was a friend of a friend. I noticed he wore the signature ring and recognized the symbol, so I asked him some questions and we quickly became friends.<br><br>Later on when I returned to my own country, I kept in touch with him through Skype, and I did a lot of research into Freemasonry myself. Once I had established contacts, both in real life and online, and expressed my interest in joining - as well as gotten multiple people who were already members willing to vouch for me - it was simply a matter of waiting a few months. Then I got summoned. In my country there is only 15,000 members and only about 100 new people are considered each year (and less than 25% of those actually tend to make it in) so I was very honored to have been chosen.</br></br></br>  <br>Shut the fuck up a second, so you're saying that wouldn't be enjoyable for you?<br>Interesting<br><br>Too bad you're probably a cutfag, the glass stomping would be less of a mutilation honestly</br></br></br></br>  <br>You again? You're with the cops, aren't you? Just waiting for someone to reveal that certain something and then next thing you know: BAM! Party Van right outside your home.</br>  <br>the image i meant to upload</br>  <br>a cutfag? sheesh anon, i thought we were having a friendly conversation, no need to make wild assumptions.</br>  <br>Who is this fluid druid, OP?</br>  i like anime xD  <br>Prove it.<br>I don't believe you're fully intact. Prove me wrong</br></br>  <br>but i like toenail number 11.<br>not only does he make me feel special he is also one of my best friends</br></br>  <br><br>I am always watching the animey and reading the mango</br></br>  The one interesting thing about me is that there's nothing interesting about me. Isn't that interesting?  <br>oh oh oh, totally misread that, thought you were implying i cut myself. yeah, i'm cut. not like i had a say in the matter, whatcha gon' do?<br><br>also heh...you were just waiting for a chance to ask to see my dick, weren't you anon? cute~</br></br></br>  <br><br>Oooohhh, okay. I'm just biased against beans, I hate the things. Hating beans but loving Mexican food is the worst, man. Especially living in Southern California where good Mexican is everywhere<br><br><br><br>How badly?<br><br><br><br>White lies are okay tho!<br><br><br><br>That's some serious dedication, yo. You should post your collection here every year like the semen bottle dude<br><br><br><br>Does that count as another toenail tho?<br><br><br><br>Ah. I probably would have made that choice too, doesn't seem worth to me<br><br><br><br>Well if you're already too thin... I can see why they might think you had a problem<br><br><br><br>Oh wow, that's pretty neat actually. Any tangible benefits of membership?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I eat ritz crackers with mustard or jelly on them</br>  <br>i didn't know that! what lies have you been telling me colby?! ;-;</br>  I am an artist who has no friends.<br><br>I draw lewds to keep me company.</br></br>  <br>I'm gonna castrate your pathetic worm, you useless piece of trash.<br>You think anybody wants some dried out filth near them?<br>Maybe a chastity could hide the disgust..<br><br>And of course, who doesn't like to laugh at little peepees?<br>Now post it, I'm curious.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I am not exceptional or outstanding in any way, a fact which is exceptional and outstanding</br>  <br>yes it counts as two toenails</br>  Too many damn replies I can't keep up ;~;<br><br><br><br>Ichigo from Aikatsu<br><br><br><br>You caught me. Just don't tell anyone and ruin it for me!<br><br><br><br>Not both, hopefully. That sounds dreadful<br><br><br><br>Ummm... Noooone?<br><br><br><br>Friends are just distractions keeping you from your art!<br><br><br><br>I'm glad you FUCKING EMBRACE IT, as Shia would say</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  so no bans today either, huh colby...it would be cool if that stayed the case...i'll keep posting without pictures to be safe though. not some crazy live on the edge rebel like you.<br><br><br>aww, it's cute when people are all tuff over the internet. <br><br>nah, if i post it then everyone will start fapping and the thread will go all dead and i couldn't do that to poor colby.<br><br>LIAR</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I like playing bass, reading books and watching shit through my cheap ass telescope  <br>Actually, i regret not doing it. But fuck it, what's done is done. Atleast i got my vidyas and my lowtier job, it's all good.</br>  <br>You mean uncontrollably gag and nearly throw up all of their stomach contents?<br>If so then yes.<br>You bore me. Fuck off</br></br></br>  I am incredibly in love with life.<br><br>Even though I still do get in funks and stuff like that (they're very short when they do happen), I've found that I just cannot get over this life we lead. The amount of choices alone is... staggering. Even just from the choice of buying some candy, which pretty much anyone can do, except SCIA (starving children in Africa, abbreviated 'cause it's such a commonly used go-to by cynics). Literally, right now, if you've got just an okay car and some cash, you could just drop everything and just fucking drive. Right now, instead of reading this thread, I could drive to a whole different city in a matter of hours. In the different city would be a huge matter of readjusting, good and bad. New opportunities, new small food joints to check out, new people, new scenery, new smells. The amount of good media out there is also staggering, and a lot of it is rewatchable, so you can discover more subtleties about these pieces of art that have impacted your life. There's also terrible media that you get to make fun of. You're one book or one TV series or one song away from your entire life being changed, I mean it. They can impact you that much. Their impact can also be negative, so be careful. Make sure if you're reading someone's philosophy that it isn't going to fuck you up in the head and leave you unable to function.<br><br>Anyway. Yeah. I see so many people out there just kind of blase about life. Work sucks. That's about it for me. (And even then it really doesn't, I get hit on by girls a lot there, and have fun &amp; stupid conversations) Maybe it's because I'm a single dude with the only obligation being working, but I just really, really enjoy this life we've got and I see so many zombies just kind of lumbering around lifelessly and it makes me sad.</br></br></br></br>  <br>i'm sorry for being boring anon, but to be fair, i did admit to that earlier up the thread...</br>  <br>Do you expect me to care enough to read your posts?<br>You better be sorry, maggot.</br></br>  <br><br>None so far.. Not like they would do anything. I am not a liar!<br><br><br><br>Who's your favorite bass player?<br><br><br><br>Can't go wrong with the vidyas. It all worked out!<br><br><br><br>That's a pretty refreshing view, anon. I've wanted to do the "get up and just drive" thing before, but not having money kinda puts a damper on that... Oh well! I just hope I'm able to do it some day</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>well, no, but it's still up there so you have no one to blame but yourself for not realizing you were talking to someone boring.</br>  What makes you fucking think that I can read minds, bitch?<br>I don't know who the fuck you are.<br>I don't know your interests, your past, your hobbies.<br>I don't know what your friends have told you that you find interesting.<br>I don't know shit about you, how the fuck am I able to determine what the fuck you'll find interesting?<br>Deduce the information based on what you're wearing?<br>You're dressed plain and bland, which tells me little about your interests, and just tiny potential pieces of information that can be used to deduce further pieces of information; it's not substantial.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>wouldn't do anything to you, phonedrone, but to me it would because i'm too lazy to proxy just to shitpost on /v/ like i like to do.<br><br>another LIE</br></br></br>  <br>It's your fault for being an insufferable bore, not mine. I'm literally perfect.</br>  <br>Joining the Freemasons has more benefits than I could possibly list. Not only is it a great way to improve yourself and become a better person, but you also make friends for life that would come to your aid no matter what. The requirements for joining are pretty strict but it puts you at the top of the food chain. You become nearly untouchable. And you get to shape the future of the world to some extent, both through charity as well as being close friends with the people who holds the power to make actual changes happen in your nation.<br><br>Oh, and we created America. Nearly 50% of those who signed the constitution were Freemasons, as well as nearly 50% of the Generals and Officers in the Continental Army. Just look up pictures of George Washington or Benjamin Franklin for example, and you'll see the signs everywhere.</br></br></br>  <br>so far that has proven pretty true, yeah. can you insult me some more?</br>  <br>Give me something to work with<br><br>A pic of your cock/ass would work fine</br></br></br>  <br>always with the asking for nudes with you anon, sheesh. buy me dinner or something first, geez!</br>  Don't post it you'll break the thread!<br><br><br><br>I didn't ask for something I would find interesting, dummy.<br><br><br><br> phonedrone <br><br>All these zingers today, gosh you're so creative and funny~<br><br><br><br>I was aware of the political connection, that's always been fascinating. Could you give any specifics of people you know that are influential or is that asking too much?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe I can buy you a ball gag so you shut the fuck up and do what I say</br>  i have over 1300 pepes  <br>damn right i am :3<br><br>don't worry, i don't even have any of those pics saved anymore. wouldn't post them for some random anon, sheesh colby.<br><br>i have a ball gag actually, but i don't think it'll stop me from typing at you, which is what i'm doing.</br></br></br></br></br>  I have a scar shaped like a pirate hook  *grabs some popcorn for the internet toughguy fight that will inevitably devolve into hatesex*  <br><br>Don't burn your bridges and try your best to keep regularly upping your QOL and there is a high chance you can go vacation somewhere within a few years.<br><br>I went from nothing to having my own apartment and several thousand in the bank and I'm 22. My life was entirely different not even two years ago, with nothing to my name.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Can't say I have a favourite. For metal I guess Blacky from Voivod and Steve DiGiorgio. Classic rock id sayJohn Paul Jones. Michael Manring is my favourite solo bass performer though.</br>  <br>fuck i hope so. this guy better be good at it, he's really making me work for it.</br>  Sometimes I eat my own precum because it tastes sweet  <br>In my nation, I attend the Grand Lodge, which is held in a palace within the capital city. The brothers I share my evenings with include many political power figures, the grand chief of police, some very influential celebrities, great academic minds, and - Most surprising of all, I imagine - Two members of the royal family. I am from a democratic and well-known modern country so the royal family doesn't hold any REAL power I suppose, but they are certainly very influential. Myself, I am a writer and author.</br>  <br> I didn't ask for something I would find interesting, dummy. <br>I see.<br>I may be considered to be a bit of a polymath.<br>My skill and knowledge crosses a variety of subjects and practices.<br>My hobbies and interests include but aren't limited to martial arts, musical composition, sketching, painting, writing short stories, writing plays, lock picking, speed arithmetic, philosophy, and psychology.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You have a ball gag? That's disgusting <br><br>Either post it or don't waste my time, faggot. <br><br>You talkin to me?<br>You talkin to me?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>post what, the ball gag? like i'm gonna take the time to take a picture of the damn thing. either believe me or don't. i have lots of sex toys.</br>  <br><br>They're probably a bunch of those common Pepes, boooring<br><br><br><br>How much do I have to flatter you for new ones? I'm prepared to go all the way<br><br><br><br>Did you get it fighting a pirate?!<br><br><br><br>Oh? How'd you manage to make that change?<br><br><br><br>Ah okay, they're pretty good. I'm a fan of Les Claypool and John Myung myself<br><br><br><br>Don't we all? Oh, wait..<br><br><br><br>Oh wow, that's crazy. Kinda makes me want to join now<br><br><br><br>That certainly is a wide range of interests, but how good are you at them?

Due to the fact that her big sister, Claire, has a genetic condition called microcephaly, meaning a small brain and head, we monitored this pregnancy closely via ultrasound. We were told that we had a 25% chance for recurrence, but the risk was worth it to us to have another baby.<br><br>We never expected to hear that Lola was also affected, but at our 22-week sonogram, her head measurements showed considerable lag, and microcephaly was confirmed a month later. Obviously this was a huge shock to us, as we felt confident that it would not happen again (we knew we had a 75% or greater chance that all would be OK) and all measurements were on track until that point. We were devastated initially, but this soon passed as we realized that this was the same child that we waited nearly five years to conceive, the same child that we wanted desperately, and the same child that we loved with everything in us, regardless of the size of her head. We knew the immense joy that Claire brought to our family, and we had no doubt that Lola would enrich our lives beyond belief as well.</br></br>  <br>Dude wtf</br>  <br> but the risk was worth it to us to have another baby. </br>  <br>thank mr spooligan</br>  <br>Kek really well done</br>    <br> honey, we are going to make you look FABULOUS!!!! </br>  <br>thanks mr spooligan</br>  <br>im actually just fascinated that, if you place water near its input, it will intake the water. I water if it also can do that for food.</br>  <br> regardless of the size of her head <br>I don't know why but that line made me kek</br></br>  <br><br>I wonder how their son feels.<br> healthy <br> good looking <br> smart <br> going to college on a basketball scholarship. <br><br>And the parents are just like "nope, better keep trying"<br><br>He knows he will never be loved as much as mommy's little attention magnets.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    Lola does have microcephaly, dwarfism, reflux (her deadliest weapon ~ our girl can projectile vomit with the best of 'em, topping out at 12 ft. in distance! Based on size, that would be like an average sized adult vomiting approximately 35 ft. in distance?! Our girl's got skillz, yo.), Cortical Visual Impairment (CVI), epilepsy, spastic quadriplegia cerebral palsy, kyphosis, two of the cutest little strawberry birthmarks you've ever seen (on her chin &amp; chest), and extreme stubbornness. We thought CLAIRE was a diva... well, Lola is working hard to show her sister up! She is also a thrill seeker, unlike big sis, and she will give us the CUTEST, subtle grins if we toss her in the air, zoom her around, or swing her in circles. Our little daredevil knows NO FEAR!  <br><br>thank mr spooligan</br></br>  Can you just imagine what these things are gonna be like at the age of 10? 20? 30?

Will they still keep those 2 adult women shitting and pissing themselves daily in their home, or is off to a carehome with these 2 spartleys?

She does not have a feeding tube like Claire; she eats by mouth. We also use an NG tube with Lola as needed, due to the fact she is not able to be put under anesthesia. And though both girls have seizures, Claire's are longer yet less frequent while Lola's are shorter &amp; occur in clusters. (Confused yet?! HA!) I was blessed to have been able to breastfeed Lola for just over 2 years (compared to 8 months with Claire. Don't hate...HA!), which was such an amazing bonding experience. I will never forget those precious moments we shared. (Though I am not ashamed to admit that I was BEYOND GLAD to finally return my rented breast pump and never see it again for the rest of my friggin' LIFE! 2+ years of nursing with an SNS (Supplemental Nursing System) followed by pumping 3-5 times daily was enough to drive me batshit loco! But again, it was SO. WORTH. IT!)  <br><br>I guess you could fill her stomach with a syringe full of jizz too.</br></br>   mfw this thread   <br>pretty fuckin subtle.</br>    can someone pls post the pic where the one is wearing the wu tang shirt?  <br>/r/ing cum shoop</br>  <br>I wonder if this woman is for real or if she knows how to fuck with people real good. Either way it's pretty scary.</br>  <br>It's the PO-TAY-TO hooligans</br>  <br>I didn't know you could order cheese pizza babies?!</br>  <br>thank mr spooligan</br>  <br>sleep tight, pupper</br>  Can somebody post the gif of claire achieving spiritual enlightenment?  We know that our family is definitely not "the norm." We know that we are basically a walking freakshow when we go out in public (!), as we have not one tiny-headed, non-mobile, non-verbal dwarf, but TWO. We feel the pity and the judgment, we hear the comments, questions &amp; remarks, and we see the stares, elbow nudging, and sheer surprise -- and none of this matters to us, because WE LOVE OUR LIFE. We love our three children, feel blessed by each unique child, and wouldn't change one thing about our life or what we've been through. We only wish everyone could feel what *WE* feel on a daily basis.  <br>These photos are not flattering. Why are the parents releasing these photos? I must ask: Who is brain-damaged in this family, the daughters -- or the parents?</br>  <br>This!</br>  <br>Dat butter-face... literally...</br>  <br>Thanks mr spooigan</br>  <br> whynotboth.jpg </br>  <br>WE LOVE OUR LIFE. We love our three children, feel blessed by each unique child, and wouldn't change one thing about our life or what we've been through.</br>  <br>thank mr spooligan</br>  <br> pretty fuckin subtle. <br><br>That satisfying moment after you take a massive shit.</br></br></br>  <br>yeah I wonder what it feels like to get costantly attention and 'oh you're so brave!' comments and such (I'm not mentioning any kind of support because I'm not sure, but I wouldn't be surprised) and the only thing you have to endure is simply keeping two very ugly dolls with basic bodily functions around you and make retarded photos and videos to them. One hell of a tough life I tell you</br>  Today, Lola drinks a goat's milk formula by bottle (which is all Miss Sensitive can tolerate!). She also eats organic baby foods by spoon. We continue to search to find foods she is not allergic to, though it has been tough. Lola LOVES to eat, does so as often as a newborn &amp; let's just say, she can put it away! Her big sister, on the other hand, FAR prefers being fed via g-tube. So, you'd think that Lola would be growing faster than her sister, right? Alas, Lola is SIGNIFICANTLY smaller than Claire was at this same age -- to the tune of 5+ POUNDS smaller! Go figure. I need an instruction manual!  <br> but at our 22-week sonogram, her head measurements showed considerable lag, and microcephaly was confirmed a month later. <br><br>Shit like this is why there should be no time limit for abortions. Too many christfags want to ban abortion or ban it after 20 weeks, but if you can't know that your fetus is a potato until after 20 weeks you'd be stuck with the retard. There should be no bans on abortion, and these monsters are why.</br></br></br>    <br>dude she's 15 now.<br>pedofags will love her in three years</br></br>  <br>I Like to Sing-A....</br>    <br>both</br>  <br>topkek</br>  gwen@thehartleyhooligans.com  <br>Okay so what the fuck is the deal with these monstrosities?</br>  Is her dad ITT right now ?  <br>thank mr spooligan</br>  <br>their parents post all kind of hilariously stupid photos and videos about them, /b/ is somehow entertained and so these threads are born.<br><br>about their conditions, I assume the bigger one will be dead in a few years</br></br></br>  Our Claire-bug was born on July 25, 2001 after a normal pregnancy and delivery. <br><br>Aside from a hospitalization for Rotavirus and a subsequent visit for a g-tube placement when she was 3 years old, Claire has been very healthy all her life, and for this we are SO grateful! We fully believe that love plus her healthy lifestyle has contributed to her longevity. She is fed many fresh, organic, raw fruits and vegetables (thank you, Vitamix Blender!) as well as other natural supplements to optimize her life. We try to remember that her body has the same abilities as ours does to heal, repair, and "do its thing." Some view her life/body as "less than" or as "compromised," but we are 100% convinced that Claire is one of the healthiest, happiest people we know.</br></br>  <br> No fucking way, I thought they were like, 2 and 5! <br><br>I guess theres some kind of treatment called Size Attenuation that they can give to the profoundly retarded, that keeps them the size of babies forever. It makes things much easier for caretakers to carry them around.<br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growt<wbr>h_attenuation<br><br>Once claire hits puberty, they will probably also give her a hysterectomy and cut her tits off, if they haven't already.<br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashle<wbr>y_Treatment</wbr></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  I'd like to think that these things have actual, comprehensive souls, minds, and thoughts but are trapped in the bodies of these vegetables. I mean, I think that they just want to die, either to transcend to a better place if you believe in that or to just end the torture. The people who are suicidal and say their life is the worst ever, no. This is.  <br> gwen@thehartleyhooligans.com <br>think i should give her some shit</br></br>  <br>Pliers will fix that</br>  One day soon, the mother will post pictures on her blog of these kids in an oxygen tube, and I will laugh so hard.  I lose to this one every time<br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/VHEUX_3O0c8  [ ]</br></br>  <br> but we are 100% convinced that Claire <br>oh boy...<br><br> is one of the healthiest <br>that's just... That's just factually wrong<br><br> happiest people we know. <br>that thing... happy? Are they really THAT delusional?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's no such thing as a soul, faggot.</br>  <br> Some view her life/body as "less than" or as "compromised," <br>Because it is.</br></br>  <br> souls <br><br>literally hartley level retarded</br></br></br>  <br>Post results.</br>  <br>thank mr spooligan</br>  it's sad how hard the parents try to bring some fun in their lives while whatever the fuck they do, they always see the same reactions: potato, or noisy.<br>i wonder what their reaction would be if Big Brother used one off them as fleshlight...</br>  <br>thank mr spooligan</br>  <br>She'll just swear at you and block you.

Why the fuck is it illegal to give short guys shit to make them taller? That shit is way worse.
