Fucking sadists. Boils my fucking blood.</br></br></br></br>  Ok the parents are sick as fuck. They even gave this thing an Instagram account.  <br>Kill yourself</br>  <br>I dont blame them for trying to cash out with these breathing pieces of meat</br>  <br><br>I'd say you need bigger/better b8, but you've already caught some dumb faggots. So, congrats on your win.</br></br>  They are all over social media. Parents love the attention and $$$$  <br>REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE</br>  <br> When you re-establish connection with lord xen úrgrón </br>  <br><br>It's a shame really because with a normal fucking brain and shit the one of the right would probably be cute as fuck.</br></br>  <br> YOU MUST KILL THE RING CARRIER SMEAGOL </br>  <br>Now this is accurate<br>Imgur is the biggest cringefest on the internet</br></br>  <br><br> tfw you realize jet fuel cant melt steel beams </br></br>  <br>Just fucking LOOK at it</br>  Is this the sort of rage feminists feel when they're 'fighting' for equality and witnessing 'sexism'?<br><br>Because I am thoroughly rustled.</br></br>    <br>Google camp imgur</br>    <br>This could be a meme-version of that black chick with that 'huh?' look.

They are playing dressup with their self-proclaimed dolls.</br>  <br>Wtf<br>Ok I am convinced the parents are in on the joke</br></br>  <br><br> not knowing Confused Black Girl </br></br>  <br>That filename</br>  <br>She looks kinda normal in this picture, <br>Well, you know what they say glasses make look smarter.</br></br>  <br>Wouldn't surprise me.</br>  <br><br><br>Well duh</br></br></br>  <br>gb2 /r/adviceanimals m80</br>    When that Molly kicks in.  <br> implying advice animals aren't in the pantheon of memes </br>  give me the toto one.  Now is his chance, drown them!  <br><br>Rule34 anyone?</br></br>  <br> God Exists kids. </br>  <br>how are they making money off this shit? donations?</br>  <br>See, I was born in the wrong age,<br>I am totally down with buying a mini slut</br></br>  <br>The only photo where the grandma is the most alive person</br>  <br>the dad has most definitely fucked them or touched them inappropriately, not that they would know</br>   watch the webm of world's smallest ninja <br> reminds me of something <br> pic related </br></br>  I'm SO in love with Lola. Look at her blinking and moving her little leg.  <br><br> anger, but also... wait what i was thinking about a second ago </br></br>  <br>Did someone get one wet? They are multiplying like gremlins.</br>  <br>when that kush hits kek</br>  <br>They're just animated meat but the parents can't stop parading them for attention. I doubt the parents will even miss them after they die.</br>  <br/>  <br>i would be mad but fuck it, fuck-dolls for errybodeh</br>  <br>The parents are twisted as fuck! I love it.</br>  <br>Why the fuck would you even do at a meetup like that? I get going to a car show or something but what interest could these people share other than circlejerking about the same shitty meme and bursting into tears every time something is "reposted"</br>    <br> when the drugs kick in </br>  <br>They take no taxpayer money.<br>Their father Scott is an artist.<br>He makes glass sculptures.<br>He has a studio and they have a shop in their hometown.<br>He also travels all over the country selling his sculptures at art shows.<br><br>http://www.infinityartglass.com/</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They weren't even expensive. The top right and bottom left were sold for $2 so the mom could play bingo.</br>  <br><br>at least they enjoy swimming</br></br>  <br>kek thumbnail switch</br>  sick as fuck these parents are skeezy. The first one maybe I could see some poor parent keeping but after that first one and seeing how 'it' would live any sane person would've terminated the pregnancy as earliest as they could tell. Sick delusion fucks parading around these poor creatures and trying to make coin off them. <br> at least give them shrooms or something maybe their brains will grow </br>  <br>Fucking bizarre lol. I wish Kanye and KK would get a kid with microcephaly, so they could name it South (because they're retarded like Downs syndrome persons).</br>  I see you over there....  <br>Don't you just mean Scarlett Johansen?</br>  <br>nice trips but this meme has already been coined lad<br/></br>  <br>so they aren't making money off these potatoes then?</br>  sharing for niggers  <br>gotta give it too him, dudes talented as fuck</br>  <br> &gt;at least they enjoy swimming <br><br>They enjoy swimming about as much as the inflatable pool toys around their necks do.</br></br></br>  <br> tfw reddit produces content lightyears beyond anything 4chan has produced in the last several years </br>  Ok the parents are trolling everyone. Which came first G-Tube( feeding tube) or bra.....read that shit.  So what condition do these creatures have exactly? I am curious.  <br>Okay, that woman needs run over by a bus.</br>  <br>Imagine if they're actually just very well developed robots! #MindBlown #LedditGetOnThis #Wow<br><br><br>Microcephaly.</br></br></br></br>  <br>"If I Only Had A Brain"-syndrome</br>  <br>Why? They already have a son that can reproduce. If anything he should die that way this gene can die out.</br>  <br>They are, their YouTube is monitized, they have adds on their website and those little creatures are getting SSI checks. They don't cost their parents anything. They are on Medicaid so free healthcare.</br>  things can't even chew or swallow sad as fuck <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=EGM<wbr>JwxqR-Jc</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br> Implying these meat packets can't get impregnated </br>    <br>Does anyone have the pic of that greentext?</br>  <br>After having Thingy and Watsit for sisters, like the son will want to even attempt to have kids of his own?</br>    <br>dogs drink water better than it</br>  To the people saying they don't have a brain and only a brain stem - They very much have a brain and couldn't live with just a brain stem.<br><br>It's just the brain that they do have failed to develop past a certain point as a fetus. It will grow over time still, but at a stunted rate. Giving these children stimuli and as much education as possible helps to make them as functional as possible.<br><br>http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/<wbr>cfh/topic/diseasesconds/microcephal<wbr>us.cfm<br><br>Having said that - abortion is really the most humane thing possible.</br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>truth</br>  <br>I think Imgur is suppesed to be the plate</br>  <br> dat filename </br>  <br>KEKKINGTON</br>  <br>they could be drowned this way<br><br><br>yeah, but they will never ever contribute to society, nor will they experience anything positive, so yes, abortion pls</br></br></br></br>  <br>That is terrifying....I didn't think of that.
