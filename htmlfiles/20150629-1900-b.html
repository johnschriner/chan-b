[ I need a new steam profile picture, any suggestions? Preferably SFW and not retarded thanks.<br><br>Pic related, it's my current one</br></br>  Apparently, you're beyond help.              drawthread.<br>D-D-Damn edition.</br>  <br>Sorry. Didn't like that thread.</br>  draw a hunky male  <br>And than it was deleted. The end.</br>  <br>So do I upload my image set over the course of two weeks? Does the other person do the same before or after me?<br><br>Why is it spread over two weeks? Can't you just have them draw their set in one day and be done with it?</br></br></br>  <br>2027 Suanee Ave<br>Eustis, Florida</br></br>  d-d-damage control.....!  YOU'RE A KID NOW  <br>that's why i deleted it, yeah</br>  <br>....who?</br>  <br>One guess: The poser.</br>  <br>You upload a set, they upload a set, you two go back and forth for two weeks then the threads are locked so judges can look at them.<br><br>Because two weeks is good. and no one has ever finished a fight in one day in tourneys.<br><br><br>I'm in Canada.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>again<br>who</br></br>  Grabbing? To be honest I couldnt grasp most of what that golem told me, they were probably using Celtic dialects... but I digress. As I said, I'll attempt to read your mind, all you have to do, is take a look in my eyes for a brief moment, nothing more!  <br>Wait, you do more than one set? Why?<br><br>Why not just upload one image, then they upload one, then you go back and forth until you each have your set?<br><br>What even is a 'set' in terms of this tourney?<br><br>Should I just stop asking questions and go look through the fights myself?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It'd answer all your questions so option 4 would be sane.</br>  <br>http://drawchan.net/dc/arena/res/38<wbr>402.html<br>Here, this is a fight.<br>Look at it, there are also other fights on here that will show you how it's done really.</br></br></wbr></br>  Is anyone even here?  <br>It's kind of like flipbook dude. You don't have to draw it like a comic book. Draw one shot of your guy winding up the punch and then delivering the punch.<br><br>Since it's not about who wins/loses dies/lives it's more about presentation and being entertaining. A 'set' is just how you choose to show your response, but is generally at least two images, honestly should be no more than four.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm lurking, drawing ref sheet and stuff but i can probably be pulled away for a request</br>  Yo thread!

I've been drawing with my medicine cabinet to draw but I've been trying to get an adapter for my toaster because ive heard its easier to draw with that. <br><br>5) Do I NEED internet for this tournament? Because Its abit hard to get internet in the Himalayas, I've been running off my hotspot for 4 weeks now<br><br>6) Was roswell and inside job?<br><br>7) If yes to numbers 2 5 or 8, please PM me on AOL messenger, It's important</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Lurkin. Don't think anyone cares though.</br>  <br>This is a flipbook: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Z60<wbr>hRCKyfH0</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>You fight in stages. <br>1) Wind up the punch<br>2) Throw the punch<br>---<br>Next guy would draw<br>1) Raise his arms upward<br>2) Block the punch<br>3) If it fails, he gets hit, draw recoil.<br><br>Be amusing to win.

Do you roll dice?<br><br><br>Okay, I see how it's done now, but that just destroyed my morale. These people are way better than me.<br><br>If I get matched up with someone like themor some shit I'll just look like a complete piece of garbage.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>C'mon brandon.<br>Be a big boy.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice quads<br>Way better then coosbay though<br>Less violent here too</br></br></br>  <br>how bout you have a good night!<br><br>Don't worry I care... Who are you?</br></br></br>  <br>It depends on the situation, your character, and how you can be impressive with your reactions. And as for #2, it's not about being good at drawing, but being clear in your actions.</br>  is anyone taking requests?<br>I'm looking to get a scooter drawing for a logo.</br>  <br>hire a graphic artist, then.</br>  <br><br>.....Did you spergs actually take that shit seriously?</br></br>  requests?<br><br> shit delivery from last thread <br><br><br><br>that's level bruh</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The better artist would be able to draw more impressive reactions.<br><br>As for number 2:<br><br>Someone better at drawing would be infinitely more clear with what they were doing.<br><br>Still not understanding how it's not just a big 'who can draw better' contest.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>daniel is just always acting retarded for attention</br>  <br>Fair enough, fair enough. But if your pickup line flops, you buy me dinner.</br>  <br>Well if it messed up your morale you can drop, or just tough it out.<br>Again your scribbles just gotta look presentable, like can I tell what's going on in the image? That's it.</br></br>  <br>I barely know anyone :c</br>  <br>Look at this one: <br>http://drawchan.net/dc/arena/res/34<wbr>722.html<br>This guy couldn't draw very well, and he did it.<br><br>Or this guy, he's a stick:<br>http://drawchan.net/dc/arena/res/36<wbr>132.html</wbr></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>fat demon huffing and puffing making it to other side, saying "i dont think imma make it"</br>  <br>fag</br>  takin character reqs btw    <br>.............its true</br>  <br>?????? if you want a logo, get off your lazy ass and hire someone <br>dont come to /b/ for it.</br></br>  <br>But if the point is entertainment, then the better artist is going to win regardless of whether or not you can tell what's going on in the worse artist's image.</br>  <br>Your bratz doll.</br>  <br>thanks<br><br>nice dubs too</br></br></br>  <br>ride bike any kind</br>  <br>Character requests as in ...?<br>Like are we talking drawfag OCs or popular characters</br></br>  <br>The judges are supposed to not be biased. But yeah, I guess they do have contraversy about it sometimes. And since Marc is running this one, all the judges are probably his friends.</br>  <br>I want a drawing of a scooter.<br>not a logo.<br>if you're not taking requests<br>why even reply to me?</br></br></br></br>  <br> EMG <br> trying to prove the point that it isn't about art skills. <br>Oh....oh no.<br><br><br>Except that isn't JUST it, if you can be funny and if you can be entertaining with the images than you shouldn't have to worry.<br><br>If you're this caught up about the quality and think you can't compete, just drop and work on your drawing skills until you do think you can do it, if that's your mind set.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> all the judges are probably his friends. <br>He wont tell us who the judges are<br>I'm assuming its the people who made it</br></br></br>  <br>Nobody important.<br><br><br>How are ya, Murph?</br></br></br></br>  Anyone want me to draw anything?<br><br>I might just do it.<br><br>I need to git gud.<br><br>Or we can play video games.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  draw two of the same object  <br> is anyone taking requests? <br> I'm looking to get a scooter drawing for a logo. <br> for a logo <br>yeah. okay buddy.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Monk<br>Nelsha<br>Catbro<br>Soup<br>EHG<br>Overlord</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Requesting that Burr plushie as the villain in a horror movie.<br>MAKE ME FEAR.</br></br>  <br>Well you're not supposed to know who they are, because people will try to sway them. But they're probably all his friends, because when you think about it, hardly anybody wants to work with let alone talk to Marc. So this whole thing will probably be biased. That is if even 20 people sign up. It's pretty much a failed experiment at this point.</br>  <br> bad joke <br>which one<br><br>uh ok<br><br>any popular oc or just characters</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>That's amazing. Thanks burr!</br>  <br>MMM, provide ref for nelsha.</br>  <br>  popular OC <br>Kbai</br></br>  <br>Join the tourney pls</br>  <br>That will be 20 millions dollars sir<br><br>so am I :c</br></br></br>  <br>What is this tourney and why do you think I should join it?</br>  draw fishs' with human heads pls  <br>The judges are unbiased. They're going to discuss why they picked so-and-so to prove that they don't just have personal beef with the other guy. If they're shitty, you get new judges. It's ok. You'll get your internet street cred if you do well. If you're even going to bother signing up.</br>  <br>Just gotta trust that it wont be biased <br>they want to make it work and seem to have the drive to keep it working</br></br>    <br>Both of those people are better than me, and can manage to draw the opposing OC without it looking atrocious. I'm also willing to bet that 'Ranzick' lost.<br><br>Also, the stick guy shows obvious skill in drawing. <br><br>I'm still not seeing how it's not just an art contest.<br><br><br>Once again, being funny and entertaining with images is about the IMAGES. Something you can't do unless you're good at making the images. The person better at making the images entertaining is still going to win, and that correlates with your ability to make your images look good.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't trust it either way. That's why I'm not signing up this time, I'll just wait for Drawchan again.</br>  <br><br><br> HAHA I KNOW NAMESS IM SO EDGY AND MYSTERIOUS </br></br></br>  Draw the cymbalta stone at a BBQ, happy and surrounded by friends and family. Also give him happy children and a happy wife. He deserves that much. Poor thing.  <br> damage control! </br>  <br> this butthurt almost 20 minutes later </br>  <br>You're good at art.<br><br>You're funny.<br><br>Ask entity about what it is, or look at scribblechan and drawchan (google em)<br><br>But basically you fight another drawfriend's OC with yours. You both try to be entertaining, and draw a few images reacting to the other person's few images.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying something? </br>  <br><br>sorry google says its zoloft. but hes still so sad though.</br></br>  <br>But their names are common knowledge? Gtfo</br>  <br>much obliged.</br>  <br>I'm not sure what to tell you. Because I'm kinda 50/50 on the topic myself.<br><br>But I can tell you right now that if you've not been doing action poses or fighting on thread or other places with drawing, you might not want to sign up.<br><br>It's supposed to be fun overall and it's not if you struggle. Ranzick was actually going to win more than likely if he hadn't had to drop out. It was his first time and you kinda under-estimate the time you got to dedicate to it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Okay but why am I floating on two pillows?<br><br>And why am I a round ball<br><br>Also am I scarlet red or ruby red?<br><br>And finally.<br><br>Where is god?<br><br><br>Hey man, if you're the guy who drew the black claw thing and if you're upset because you stepped into something you knew nothing about, don't complain about how these things have been going on for a few years now.<br>It isn't an art contest.<br>That's it.<br>done and done.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  i bet the judges are the meme team  <br>sorry im bad</br>  <br>  </br>  <br>But I'm not good. I have to spend a bunch of time on anything I want to look good otherwise it's not worth looking at.<br> Self depreciation at max </br></br>  <br>sweet</br>  What a shit drathread  <br> didnt upload image ffs </br>  <br> Except when it IS an art contest <br>All you people do is shit on other drawfags art so why wouldn't a contest by you guys be the same thing?</br></br>  <br><br>Also which one do I even go two, since apparently those two places are different.</br></br>  <br>I mean, if it makes you feel better, Cad helped out too, and he does the Drawchan tourney.<br><br><br>Eat shit, brah.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/FCIpvV198mw?t=1m5s<wbr></wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Well now, let the numbers sink into your mind<br><br>3....<br><br>2....</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Art contest <br> literally a traffic cone is joining <br> two mspaint teir people joining  <br>yeah ok</br></br></br></br>    <br>you're being judged on your art ability, of course it's an art contest. all the people that got to the top of the drawchan fights were good drawers. how do you explain that shit?</br>    <br>They won't win. I'll bet you.</br>  <br> you guys <br>fucking who?<br>Drawfags?<br>Why would drawfags make a tournament that parallels with how drawchan did their's but without stats?<br><br><br>There is a current tournament on Scribblechan.<br><br><br> you're being judged on your art ability </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>how about you with fruit on your head??</br>  <br>If you don't know about Drawchan or Scribblechan why are you signing up for anything?<br><br>What happened when you knew drawfags got educated on this shit. That's why you have no new blood or nobody wanting to sign up for your shitty tournaments.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>that was a really good idea though. :|</br></br></br>  <br>strawberries fo breasts ;)</br>  <br>requesting orangy spreading butthole like this </br>  <br>Who did that? That shit is pro expensive commission god tier.</br>  <br>Because someone told me to.<br><br>And is that supposed to say I'm supposed to magically know where the Tome of Learning is?<br><br>Or is there supposed to be some magical guide coming to bring me to the Springs or Enlightenment or something?<br><br><br>Where do I even sign up?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   hit enter too soon <br><br><br> you're being judged on your art ability <br> all the people that got to the top of drawchan fights were good drawers <br>Big daddy lemons.<br>Someone who could draw, and by draw I mean he could show you what was going on in his images.<br>He was also entertaining as fuck.<br>See if you view it as such it's gonna be an art contest.<br><br>BUT I MEAN YA'LL COULD WHINE AND NOT DO SHIT, THAT'S GOOD TOO, YA'LL COULD JUST SIT HERE AND BE UPSET ABOUT HOW YOU THINK YOU'RE NOT GOOD ENOUGH OR WHATEVER INSTEAD OF JUST DOING IT TO HAVE FUN AND NOT REALLY WORRY ABOUT THE QUALITY OTHER PEOPLE PUMP OUT, YA'LL COULD JUST, OH I DUNNO WATCHOUT FOR YOURSELVES?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>nice double dubs ;)</br>  May I have a request?  <br>What happened to orange orangy?</br>  <br>wasa gift for me by a fan, was done by TFD or That Fucking Devil</br>  <br>I came, lol thanks.</br>  <br>No dude. I'm not saying it's your fault. What I'm asking is why the older drawfag are not teaching or helping the newfags.<br><br>Didn't they used to do that all last year?</br></br></br>  <br>  </br>  <br>  <br><br><br>m-moira brown?<br><br><br><br>just fine, how are you<br><br> you're reactions <br>I’m Nobody!

That is actually an anthropomorphic chart. With one being the least because the pony has human intelligence and behavior, or "anthro" traits as you call it. 5 is fully anthropomorphic, or anthro, because you are applying full human traits to a cartoon animal. Number three is actually not all that anthropomorphic as compared to 4 and 5. Plus your four does retain some human shape but it has the color of an animal, as well as hooves, and a horn and pony ears. 5 is the true humanized one because it's the only one that is fully anthropomorphic, my friend.<br>Please educate yourself.</br></br>  <br>I'm from /mlp/ and I think OP is faggot</br>  <br>This.<br>If she were real and just gave me these offers, I'd immediately run over to the bank to get a couple hundred dollars.<br>I might spill my spaghetti in the process by asking her if she has jaundice, though.</br></br></br>  <br> SLAPS $10 DOWN <br><br>Go wash your hands and get me a ham sandwich.</br></br></br>  <br>With that logic everything posted with two legs should be bannable.

It's a My Little Pony image, it's bannable expect in MLP.<br>Maybe you have a loose definition of what is human but I don't consider characters with animal color schemes to be human, even if that's only animal trait they have. Plus that character still belongs to the frachise My Little Pony, do you explictly tell you in the movie that the character is a human?<br>Remember, super man is very humanoid in appearance and pretty indistinguishable from the average human but he isn't human. He's Kryptonian.<br><br>Anyways, as I said, my friend it's better to post this in /mlp/</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying <br><br>by the way you're in a cartoon horse porn thread for one reason or another, can you really judge?</br></br></br>  <br>Thats my fetish.</br>  <br>Goddamnit</br>  <br>That's what your not getting. The character in your chart was NEVER human to begin with, my friend. 5 is pretty much giving an animal fully human traits but that doesn't change that the base character is not originally human.</br>   my friend   God Damn Pony Fags And All Your Pony Shit  <br>life is not fair....</br>  <br>Goddamnit</br>  <br> capitalizing every word </br>  OP here. post to pic related, ya faggots!    <br>Problem is its equestrian girls. they are human. not horse. Separate. Get it right. Big differences are as follows.... I MUST CALL ON MY INNER NECK BEARD!<br><br> 1 mlp has ponies eqg has HUMANS <br> 2 eqg takes place on earth in a HUMAN world. Even if the color is off they are human. <br> 3 different characters than the ponies. different universe. </br></br></br></br></br>    Why not kill yourself, you piece of shit  <br>Yes, but then we get into aspects of perspective and philosophy with that:<br><br>Someone that doesn't know the source could view it as counting down from human to pony, ie, it being Theriomorphic.<br><br>It also makes us question what we determine is human, say, a 1 week old fetus, it has little aspects of "being human", yet becomes more anthropomorphic as it develops, so, in that sense, all of us were<br> NEVER human to begin with. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  do you want me to ruin your hread with bananas again you fucking faggot?    What the fuck is going on in this thread?  <br>So... You're a bitch that likes bananas?</br>  <br>oh no please don't post the banana meme :^)</br>    <br> ruin  <br> implying that anyone cares about bananas <br><br>Go ahead waste you time</br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you high, my friend? Let me say this in simple terms. Twilight Sparkle, I think that's the name, is a cartoon pony from a children's show called My Little Pony. In your chart, the number 5 is a fully anthropomorphic version of the pony.<br>Not very hard to understand.</br></br>    <br>See this post.<br/></br>  a quick question I've been trying to form a satanic church I need a pony that represents hate 'n stuff    as you wish lori      <br>Just fags being fags, /b/ as usual</br>  grandmaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!<wbr>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</wbr>    <br>DEATH PONY!</br>    heres one for u op  <br>I was flipping through the channels a while back, my friend. I'm pretty sure I saw an ad for a movie called rainbow rocks and in the ad they called the characters "Pony Friends".<br><br>Plus I just did a little research. The characters from the movie have the exact same names as the ponies from the show, the same color schemes and I'm sure there are other similarities if one is willing to dig deeper.<br><br>There have been other series that have off-colored characters, my friend. But the Simpsons isn't based on a world of cartoon ponies. It's based on the real world, their color scheme is just an aesthetic choice. Unlike your movie which IS based on the pony's world and their color scheme is based on the ponies. So can you really tell me it takes place on Earth?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=TJH<wbr>0eBtnbcs</wbr>  [ ]</br>    Thanks hail Satan  <br>Fap fap fap</br>    This thread has been reported to the holy inquisition for heresy.  <br/>      Get some slightly less cancerous anthro in here      <br>As I said though, it's a matter of perspective on that, show the image to someone that knows nothing/seen nothing about the show and they will view it as 1 of 2 things:<br>A human turning into a horse-like creature.<br>A horse-like creature turning into a human.<br><br> 5 is a fully anthropomorphic version of the pony. <br>And that depends on the view of anthropomorphism, ie "A non-human thing, that gains human traits."<br>By using that definition, and saying, once something becomes 100% human, it doesn't matter if they are human now, they are still Anthropomorphic.<br>At which point, it brings up the question:<br>Are we, a 100% anthropomorphic version of a zygote? because, just like the origin of 5. we didn't originate as human either.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you posted an image of a banana</br>      <br>ok I admit, I kek'd audibly at this pic</br>  Hey kids want to see a dead body...  <br> implying that cancer fufills requests </br>      <br>Wiat you have 977 bannana pics in yuor pc ?</br>  <br>Dude.

All I know is that these characters are clearly based on the ponies from the show, down to their color schemes and names. <br><br>But I don't know 100%.

You keep jumping all over the place. The dictionary meaning is pretty much cut and dry about it. <br><br> ascribing human characteristics to nonhuman things <br><br>You have a hard time understanding a simple phrase like that. Let me put it even simpler. Humanized is a subset of anthropomorphism, my friend. Both can actually be used interchangeably because they both mean the same thing.
