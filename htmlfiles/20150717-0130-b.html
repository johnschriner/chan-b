So then it was just for fun.<br><br>Now slowed down a lot almost exclusively at festivals not</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Which ones?<br><br>I have none, but may be able to point you in right direction</br></br></br></br>  Only Marijuhana here.<br>I live close to the border to Netherlands, so no problem to get some of it.<br>It helps me with my skin sickness and i love this "high" feeling</br></br>  <br><br><br>Is DXM any good?</br></br></br>  <br>anything man, crystal, speed etc i want it for selling so i don't really care</br>  <br><br>Skin sickness?</br></br>  <br>I personally like it (Not OP).</br>  <br>how to inject the marijuanas?</br>  <br>How much are percosets worth?

I'll try anything besides like coke or heroin but it is so hard to find anything in Tokyo. <br><br>Any advice?</br></br>  <br>ahahaha not everyone wants an "escape" some people are simply curious, so much stigma attached to drug users even casual ones.</br>  <br>Is it possible to be immune to certain drugs? I've done cocaine and ecstasy on various occasions with very minimal effects. It was the real deal too, no bunk. <br><br>I've done acid and that shit is great, it destroys my perception of time and space, but the other two just don't seem to tickle my boner.</br></br></br>  <br>Buy some Yohimbine HCl powder online and mix it with dimethocaine(legal research chem) and there you go,lots of money. Yohimbine is strong though, so dont add more than 100mgs per gram of DMC. 4-FA is good to use as well. A protip is to mix in just a tiny bit of DOC to make it interestig. All of that shit is legal and speedy.

I believe that as long as you keep it under control, drugs can actually help improve your life.<br><br>With that said. I don't think they are for everyone. Some people are just not mentally strong or secure enough.</br></br></br></br>  i slipped a hefty dose of 25i into her vagina when she wasn't looking  <br>Try Kabuki-cho in Shinjuku</br>  <br>http://webehigh.org/toyko-japan/ <br><br>the fuck are you talking about</br></br></br>  I smoke weed from time to time, but the recent bag (bubblegum) gives me the worst heartattack feeling. Could it be laced or only strong?  <br>What are legal drugs I can get high from I can buy from walmart and online?<br><br>How come after I take DXM when I'm coming off the high I always have these auditory hallucinations of the devil laughing, and overall feelings of death, uncertainty, evil and feel like I'm going a schizophrenic where demons can fuck with me?</br></br></br>  <br>Ok, I've been taking adderal 30mg XR for 10 years (prescribed). How many mg should it take me to get actually high?</br>  <br>how many times? I seem to have a higher than average tolerance to most drugs ive tried and never really felt anything the first time.</br>  <br>You ever tried khat? It seems fun</br>  <br>I have a friend who is immune to all drugs. Or more like a natural tolerance. When we did molly i only did a half gram and was rolling dick, he took 2 grams and could barely feel it. Same with cocaine, alcohol, weed, benzos, opiates, just any kind of drug. Its fucking retarded, its like my mission to find a drug that effects him. I guess acid and crack combo did a little more than others</br>  <br>  Be me <br>  Decide to take acid at night <br>  12:30 AM, 4 tabs <br>  Take one tab <br>  1 hr passes, nothing <br>  take another, still nothing <br>  I thought 1 hour passed, but really only 20 mins <br>  take another <br>  start beating off to fap material <br>  blow load, feels like millions of dollars <br>  slowly realize that I still have 7 more hours of this shit <br>  realize I took 3 hits <br>  mfw <br>  send friend 80 text messages, all random <br>  comes over at 5:30 AM <br>  smokes weed with me and helps me cope with existential crisis <br>  Calm down <br>  She goes to work <br>  I go back inside <br>  Continue blowing loads until 8 AM <br>  fall asleep fully clothed with shoes and all <br><br>Man, I love acid.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I fucking love codeine.  <br>400mg mdma</br>  <br>Hang out with car kids.

Or HBr maybe? Frememberant remebeer</br>  <br>Hey man. I'm from Ga in USA just so you know I'm not talking out of my ass. A good way to get drugs if you have 0 contacts, is to start searching google ( with a proxie) which are easy to install for good dark ner drug sites. I used one called evolution that has since been shut sown due to internal theft. But once you find one you can easily do so by googling it ( not trolling I'm serious it's super easy) than you should be able to get the .onion address ( dark net uses it instead of .com) than download "tor" the dark ner browser. Once your on the site the sellers will have reviews like eBay or Amazon ( seriously still being serious) but You'll also have to buy bitcoins to make any transaction. You can do it easily at coinmx.com you'll have to have a card ( prepaid visa gift cards will work) but you have to register them for online use and give the website valid ID. But it's okay the Bitcoin you buy won't be registered to you. You can transfer them to a Bitcoin wallet app, than to your account on whatever site you choose on dark net. Make sure to find out how much money you'll need ahead of time and buy 10 dollars more worth of BitcoinAT LEAST. If not 15 because the wallet and all the sites will charge you a fee on your Bitcoin transfers. My weed showed up in three days double scealed in stealth packaging. Easy peasy</br>  <br>Well the cocaine was only one night, it was good shit because everyone was feeling that shit. I did a line and the only thing I got was that disgusting dripping in your throat.<br><br>The ecstasy I have tried various times over the course of 5 years and it doesn't hit me whatsoever. Tonight I took some and the only noticeable effects was my limp dick and the inability to sleep.</br></br></br>  <br>your not wrong at all but you are extracting the dmt, very different to synthesising meth (probably one of the easier main stream drugs to synth)</br>  <br>Only retards take those. They're like $5 a pill max, because they have acetaminophen so if you take a bunch regularly you can ruin your liver</br>  <br>ahahaha wait till you try other opiates codiene is nothing in comparison</br>  <br>Nope, no ssri for me.<br>I guess my coke and MDMA tolerance/receptors are fucked haha</br></br>  <br>I don't want to be a junkie brah. I rarely exercise self control in anything. I take shit too far.</br>  <br>Absolutely agree.<br>It seems like I do way better at life when I'm on speed/cocaine.<br>I get the right jobs, I do the right choices and I'm a better person.<br>Advice: Never use drugs for too long without a break. It's okay to be on speed/cocaine or whatever for 3-4 days and rest for a couple of days. I've been doing 6 month marathons of speed (daily use) and I can say it turns you rather autistic after over using it. but in the right amounts and time it's okay</br></br></br></br>  <br>how many weeds do i need to inject the marijuanas into IM?</br>  <br>Lucky fuck. I can't touch it or any unregulated opiates because I have a codeine allergy</br>  I have a packet of pills that are 500mg paracetamol and 30 mg codeine each.<br>Should i take two? <br>Should I try CWE? <br>What will happen?</br></br></br>  <br> speed <br>literally the worst drug ever</br></br>  <br>How Was your childhood? Did you Suffer any trauma? or did you have a normal life? Any family death? Abuse?I need the info to see if any ffamiliaritywiWith my friend</br>  <br>I was thinking more about adderall</br>  <br>yea I reckon if you gave it another go you would feel it (never done coke only meth). Generally speaking though stimulants are a lot easier to 'feel' especially when snorted. Maybe you didn't do enough?</br>  <br><br>also codeine is easy for me to get on prescription since I had a few bad fillings as a kid and now they've fallen out and those teeth are rotting so I just go to doctors and say I have a toothache. They always prescribe me codeine with a repeat or two. Only 30mg/tab though so I have to take 4-5 at a time.</br></br>  <br> 500mg paracetamol <br>lost</br></br>  <br>yea fair enough they are pretty good, can't say I was ever got addicted even though I had a free supply of oxycodone for awhile that shits niiiiice.</br>  <br>take 4 you'll be right. you'll just feel good, if a bit drowsy.</br>  <br>You probably didn't snort cocaine bruh.<br>If it doesn't get you high it's not cocaine.</br></br>  <br><br>Crush up and snort the 20mg, see how you go.<br><br>Or chew and eat the 30mg<br><br><br><br>No never got the chance to before it was outlawed (UK).<br><br>However MCAT/4-MMC is 4-methly meth cathinone. the active ingredient in khat is cathinone. But i imagine khat is way way more subtle <br><br><br><br>Fuck knows<br><br><br><br>You can be fine taking up to 8 as a one off, if you going to do it more I recommend CWE, you need your liver.<br><br>depends on tolerance, but start with 3</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  i'm going to a festival this weekend, so i have two options LSD or Ecstasy never done any of those, so tell whith one shuld i use and what would be the effects  <br>CWE that shit, paracetamol will kill you. take the extra 5 minutes you will thank me.</br>  <br>One could argue curiosity is a reason to escape, but, so are all types of distraction.<br><br>In Buddhism, meditation is learning to cope with boredom/nothing to do.</br></br></br>  <br>mdma</br>  <br>yea im a bit of a junkie when it comes to my opiate tolerance id need at least 10</br>  anyone know the effects of taking raw Sudafed? about 200-300 mg  <br>Sounds like you're prone to anxiety attacks. Lay off the drugs m8</br>  I just injected this whole thing into my eye.  <br>Clearly you're doing it wrong then. There's nothing like railing a nice line and then doing anything. It's like driving a sports car 120 mph on the highway; everyone you pass is moving in slow motion by comparison</br>  <br>kill yourself my man!</br>  <br>It's pretty much just a boil and reduce process with naptha and vinegar</br>  Does anyone have any experience with heroin? I'm not planning on taking any hard stuff like that but I've never heard any stories about it straight from a user and I'm interested  <br>huh? I've never done coke only meth and some other rx stims...</br>  <br>Mate it's not for nothing that it's called poorfag's cocaine</br>  <br><br>generally save the psycs till the end, short term tolerance with acid is ridiculously high.<br><br>I would say have both, start of with the acid on its own, keep the mdma just in case things go south, the mdma will make it much more manageable and make you happy taking you out of the bad trip, but you loose a lot of the mind high, so just straight acid first</br></br></br></br>  <br>heroin are many pain for get cus a tight in innr arm for tunorcit hurt and pleasur</br>  <br>Don't do acid in a large group of people. For the first time That is. Always do it with close friends to get the feel for it. that being said, go with Molly, can't go wrong there, just start of with a little and do more little by little till you feel fucking amazing, then keep bumping Till you are out of money. Boom, great fucking party</br>  <br>What was the outcome</br>  I tell you the best high ever, but keep it secret.<br>You take an ampulle of valium<br>1x pill of Xanax (alprazolam)<br>1x pill of Trankimazin (alprazolam)<br>0.5g of Cocaine<br>300mg of Whiskey.<br>best-high-ever</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>///////thread</br>  <br><br>probable not to nice ephedrine has a mild stimulating effect though</br></br>  <br>hmm well I never put too much though into my drug use as I only regularly smoke pot, but I cant say I do it purely to get fucked up either :/</br>  Why are drugs even illegal? It seems like the only thing probhition is doing is making drug users criminals instead of trying to "help" them.  <br> Asperger Syndrome  <br>This is not a skin sickness.</br></br>  <br>Do both faggot. Candy flipping is the shit</br>  <br>Money.</br>  <br>Please.</br>  Does MXE make you more susceptible to hypnotic suggestions?  <br>For me i did heroin a few times. Nothing special in my book, its a decent drug. But for some people, like my friend walker, heroin is the absolute best Thing in the whole world and he would do anything for it. Generally people who use heroin regularly are trash and are better Off dead, just the truth from all that i have Seen</br>  <br>What's a good drug that won't kill or make me sick that is better than pot? I've always wanted to snort coke. What's that like? Could I do it and not get strung out? Any other ideas?</br>  <br><br>First time acid, you really need to see what it is like on its own.<br><br>But I do love the combo<br><br><br><br>I think it is like when somebody is really ketty, you can just tell them to do somthing loud enough they will do it.<br><br>MXE is shit though, all of the confusion of a high dose of ket only with non of the fun of getting there</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I completely agree, its just revenue for criminals. Feeding the flame and screwing the people at the bottom of the food chain.</br>  what if any drug will help me to learn php, instead of reading it for 10 minutes then playing skyrim?  <br><br>what sort of high you after/what do you want to do on it.<br><br>Strung out?</br></br></br></br>  <br>yes both</br>  <br><br>Low dose of any amphetamine salt.<br><br>Less so modafanil</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah coke is fucking fantastic, just don't take too much.</br>  <br>amphetamines my friend, if any of your friends have ADD ask them for some of there meds. Crush em up and snort em.</br>  <br>Both. Take about 80mgs or mdma, wait 30 mins, take a tab of lucy, wait one hour take 200mgs mdma and 2 more tabs of lucy and you will have the time of your life!</br>  <br>A gram? Jesus. I did 900mg powder and was in some kind of dissociative vomiting coma for 6 hours...</br>  <br>thats waaayyyy overkill for a first timer but it sounds delicious either way</br>  <br>Talk to a whore</br>  <br>ahahahaha the japs really look down upon white drug users infact drugs in general from what ive read</br>  Aight here's a pretty specific question. I do a lot of drugs at college in the US (weed daily, used to do lots of psychs, enjoy speed, benzos, prescription opiates), but I'm spending the summer in Korea, where drugs are super uncommon and illegal. Do you know of anything that would be easy to synthesize or find here? I've heard there's some sort of cough syrup people like here, but other than that the scene seems really dry/nonexistent.  <br><br>intersting.<br><br>yeah it is best to space out the doses, prevents too much being converted to DXO which is more of the stimmy mdma part of it, keeps more as DXM<br><br><br><br>Darknet my friend, Use agora instructions online</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't listen to him. God gave us ritalin/concerta to study. Amphetamines will ruin you</br>  <br>Whoops, was not fully paying attention to it being a first time haha, I just gave my dosing</br>  <br>nope.jpg your pretty much fucked, unless you smuggle some blotters or something, and the cough syrup your talking about contains DXM which isn't really the most pleasant of highs, look it up.</br>  <br> strung out <br>You know, become a junkie. <br><br>I want an energetic high without bouncing off the walls or becoming paranoid but can still function at work, drive, etc.</br></br></br></br>  <br>How about you just not use drugs for a while? Jesus you are such a dick</br>  <br><br>Don't do more than a gram of paracetamol at one time. Definitely not worth it for a codeine high. Do try a cold water extraction, and try a dosage of 150mg at first. Better yet, start with a single pill to check for allergic reactions. <br><br>Also, don't take fucking drug advice on /b/. 95% are either legit sociopaths or edgy try-hards who like to act the part.</br></br></br></br>  <br>$10-$13 each. I could sell a whole script of 60 within a couple hours here in NE Ohio. Shits an epidemic here. Prices vary by location/availability though. I know I can get 30mg percs for $10-$15 in Kentucky or $5-$10 in Florida. If I had a reliable car id be driving to Florida and buying bulk to sell in Ohio.</br>  <br>Yeah, this was in a cap, on the way to a show in Pittsburgh. I had done plenty of tussin back in HS so I figured I was straight. I'd love to recount the experience if you care, it was fucking bizarre</br>  <br><br>not familiar with korea.<br><br>other than taking it on the flight, not advisable.<br><br>Darknet, if no vendors in korea try and find out which country they are friendliest with to minimize seziures</br></br></br></br></br></br>  op how much information do you know how to access about the toxicity of the NBOMe psychedelics? <br>i am v interested in things like the health impacts, because there is (from what I can find) very little actual study (outside of anecdotal erowid shit) on the series as drugs.</br>  <br>sorry meant to say or* ask for meds like ritalin, dex etc.</br>  <br><br>Actually the Korean stuff has a different primary active ingredient, supposedly. It's close to an opiod but has more hallucinogenic effects. I forget the name but I think it starts with a T. I think it may also contain DXM but ppl don't take it for the DXM.<br><br><br><br>Lol sry to bunch ur panties fam</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>use that time to shake your addiction, in the long run in will be worth it</br>  <br>hmm interesting can't confirm this but I might look into it.</br>  <br><br>I snorted quite a bit of heroin last year. For the first month of casual, chipping use, it was fucking awesome. Then came a few weeks of daily use, not so awesome. Felt more dead than alive, half-sick most of the time if not numb. No real euphoria. Got my act together and kicked it after two weeks, had slight withdrawals, which where still very, very shitty. I do not have the capacity to imagine the pain you'd go through if you'd been shooting the shit into your veins for years on end and had to stop.</br></br>  <br>Ok word thanks dude, I'm not here for too much longer so the darknet would maybe take too long. Plus I don't speak Korean so I don't know what my address is lol.</br>  <br> some sort of cough syrup <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=UkE<wbr>h5Un_Kk0</wbr>  [ ]<br>not a good idea to do this often. smoke weed, it's everywhere. fuck the police.</br></br></br>  I haven't took MDMA ever...what are the exact effects ?  I am beyond drugs now. brushed too close too death. stay safe and don't do anything every day.  <br><br>herpaderpaderp. methylphinidate is a phenethylamine Substituted phenethylamines include a wide variety of drug classes. This includes but is not limited to psychotropic drugs (including hallucinogens such as dl-2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamin<wbr>e a.k.a. DOM), central nervous system stimulants (e.g. amphetamine),</wbr></br></br>  <br>Its dose dependent and also how much sleep you get factors in too. For example if i took 20Mgs of meth for breakfast i would have a nice energetic edge for most the day, nothing to strong or noticable to others, even though its meth. Now if i took a fuckload of caffeine i would be more "Strung out" than i was"On meth." Moderation and self control is key</br>  <br>twice i've been sure i'd die. been through opiate cold turkey too. plus i have brain lesions. still can't get sober. my life is fucked.</br>  <br>usually, you feel quite energetic, in love with everything and everyone, and incredibly happy. ecstatic, even. <br>seriously where do you think it gets the name ecstasy from</br></br>  <br> please do sire<br><br><br><br>its pretty fast but buying bitcoin may be problematic in diff country though</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I went too far. It seems like nbd at first, but when the hook is in, it is in deep. I wish I had never started, it was an on-again-off-again love affair with something that didn't love me back. Lost my gf of many years. Lost my confidence and trust in myself. <br><br>clean for 6 months. I hope to never touch any opiates for as long as I live.</br></br></br>  <br>Methylphenidate is not even close to an amphetamine? Have you seen its structure?</br>  <br>You need 4-MAR, or 4-methylaminorex. It goes by the street name euphoria and is very hard to find and hard to sell. The high lasts much longer than meth without the jitters. Theres not really a market for it because it doesnt cause the same dependence as shooting meth, so not as much repeat business.</br>  <br> read  <br>Ok faget</br></br>  <br><br>Sort of like the pillow-talk honesty that you get after satisfying sex. Oh right, this is /b/.<br><br>It makes you accept everyone, as well as everything about yourself, with such unrelenting loving kindness and tolerance that it'll blow your mind. It'll basically turn you into Buddha for a couple of hours. <br><br>Yeah, may sound faggy, but that shit is awesome.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> addiction <br>Not actually addicted to anything. I was clean a month before coming here in case of drug tests for my employment, and I've been here almost 2 months now. I'm mostly bored and overworked (12+ hour shifts)<br><br> it's everywhere <br>$100+ a g here in Korea, and you have to buy it from seriously sketchy dudes.<br>Also I'm p. sure the active ingredient in the syrup here isn't DXM (which i've fucked around with as well).

It's one thing to understand a concept a certain way, but to understand it in a completely different way is marvelous and IMO pretty important for learning about the universe and how it works.</br></br></br></br>  <br>you can do it, from one junkiefag to another. life is better on the other side.</br>  <br>Nope the withdrawals don't actually get any worse dude.

My brother lost his mind to it also acouple years ago but luckily he was treated quickly and ended up being normal after a year of medication that made him fat as fuck. My other friends didn't get treated right and now they're stuck like that unfortunately. Seriously, otc drugs are the most easily accessible but they're really the most dangerous too.</br>  <br><br>like you said very little info out there. If i recall correctly over 2mg is too much/very bad but I would double check though</br></br>  <br>Nice analogy. Meth is some shit I've always been very reluctant to fuck with at all because of what you hear. I don't know much about it. Don't want to lose my teeth smoking it, or get into needles. Meth was all the rage back in the eighties. They called it speed back then. Is it the same?</br>  <br>oh man pls do bro</br>  <br>(Not OP) Well assuming you aren't on an SSRI or SNRI, or MAOI... Here's my take.<br>At a normal rolling dose (varies on the purity), once you ingest it it takes about a half hour to hit you, less if snorted (burns tho), and then you experience a huge mood lift. I get a kind of manic energy, and a sense of control. Conversation is natural, and you'll feel confident and on top of your game. I always feel like walking, and even dancing, though thats not my normal thing. I also tend to kind of clench my jaw, which is why gum is always good. What else you wanna know friend?</br></br>  <br>Where would you start looking for weed?</br>  <br><br>Is there any side effects ?</br></br>  <br><br>Seriously? And I do agree, I've jumped off the opioids a couple of times by now, and sure, it's real painful, but not the kill-yourself-to-find-solace kind of pain. I always chalked that up to my low doses and short spans of addiction, but whaddyaknow, might be that it doesn't get much worse.</br></br>  <br><br>1/?<br><br>NOMAN BAREBONES DMT TEK<br>This is a simplified and edited version of Noman's DMT A/B extraction tek.

I've seen this behaviour in every girlfriend and her friends and sisters. It gets even better when they are all getting married or planning weddings.
