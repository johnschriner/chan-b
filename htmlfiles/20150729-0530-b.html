[ anons who have had sex, how does it feel?  bump  <br>alright i guess</br>  Like your cock has finally found its place in the world. Its warm, wet, wonderful place.  <br>it's ok but i often feel like shit after. but that's just me</br>  <br><br>It is really slippery, VERY warm, and depending on her skill, she can make it feel like your dick is getting ripped off by a soft wall (insta cum almost), or if she is terrible it will feel like fucking a warm pile of jello because she is loose or lacks the ability to contract.</br></br>  <br> this </br>  <br>depends on your dick size and how fast you cum</br>  <br>touch the inside of your cheek with your tongue<br><br>feels like that but softer</br></br></br>  s'good  Overrated as fuck. It's ok but I prefer fapping.  <br>That made my dick tingle</br>  As long as you don't get drunk and wear a condom at the same time or you don't fap before it happens it's bretty gud.  hitting it raw? best shit ever. Condom fucks the entire experience but not having a kid might be worth it.  <br>You're a poet, Anon. I almost fropped a tear</br>  Meh. I prefer fapping.  <br><br>usually, but when its good! ohh... its good.</br></br>  Just looking for the last hex<br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;631000000  #</br>  How long have you been on /b/?  <br>whole summer</br>  Too fucking long, I was here before any captchas and when #fortune made its debut  Since Toaster Steven. I witnessed it. Good times. /b/ has really gone downhill since, though.  I have no idea anymore.<br><br>Leave newfags while you still have some humanity left in you.<br>I am a robot</br></br></br>  <br>What's /b/?</br>  @ OP<br>I just started browsing 4 Chan today L.O.L XD How do I join Anonymous?</br>  <br>phahahahahahahahah<br>ahahahhahahahahahahaha<br>hahahahahahahah<br><br>roody</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>LOL dunno, im anonymous cause im on 4chan, right??? LOL top kek</br>  <br>Talking about oldfags</br>  ITTY BITTY BABY ITTY BITTY BOAT  Since 06. I was in Iraq at the time, and a site with gore, porn, and lolz is perfect for soldiers with downtime.  <br>Since 2011 so pretty new</br>  2012, newfag  I came here after the name drop in Pixels.  <br>Shouldn't 2011 be considered oldfags by now?</br>  I've been here 2 years.  <br>only newfags are the ones who shout newfag and summer</br>  <br>Not really, maybe averagefag</br>  2008? I think so yeah. Still was only lurkin since just a few weeks ago.  newfag reporting in, only been here for a few months<br> inb4 lurk moar <br>i already spend most of my time here</br></br>  <br>Since the motherfucking pools closed</br>  <br>8 years ago when i was 18</br>  <br>2011, and no know I will always be a newfag.</br>    <br>It really only takes a month or two to know what you're doing.</br>  Late 2007, I think.  <br>The last scale I checked was from 2012, where they were considered newfags and 2012 as cancer</br>  <br>Oh man, who cares?</br>  <br>That's cancer, not newfag</br>  <br>Trips can't lie.</br>  <br><br>Originalfag.<br>I found out about you guys on WinMX on in a chat room for illicit goods that I now no longer have or have access to.</br></br></br>  <br>Apparently I'm reddit even though I haven't been on there</br>  <br> #fortune <br>proved</br></br>  <br>Just for nostalgia purposes</br>    Since 8th grade. I'm now 23 so I dunno.  Long enough  <br>Don't beat yourself up about it.</br>  <br>late 07 newfag<br><br>fight the powah.</br></br></br>  2008  <br> how long <br>Started in 2006/2007, but I never lurk it continuously.</br></br>  <br>peanut butter<br>your luck: Godly</br></br>  <br>just quit with the b8</br>  <br>It's pretty easy to spot who is lying</br>  <br>2011</br>  <br>That graph seems inaccurate. If somebody spends 7 years on here, they're not new.</br>  07 is the first time I encountered it, during the pools closed 1 year anniversary. 09 I started lurking.  2008 and late  <br>Two hours.</br>  <br>That graph is right: oldfag and newfag came out in those periods (at that time nobody said you had to go back to reddit, but rather that you were a newfag), consequently the following periods had to take another definition.</br>  Long enough that I would still call people who quote giga puddi newfags  <br>10 ducking years... Holy fuck</br>  I created it<br>mfw newfigs can't orange text&lt;</br>  I remember trying to figure out what the fuck /5/ was before it got taken down.  <br>Well then newfag shouldn't be an insult.</br>  3 day old newfag<br><br> ▲ <br>▲ ▲</br></br></br>  <br>Kill you self newfag</br>  <br>it's not an insult, newfag.</br>  <br>It was back then: now there are worse insults. Now that you know it, fuck off back to reddit.</br>  Since 2009 apparently.  <br>Alright thanks for the clarification. <br> tfw I'll always be a newfag </br></br>  Remember back when the wordfilters took us by surprise? Yeah, fun times.  '05-'06ish. But stopped lurking as much around 2012  <br>It's a badge of honor: signifying you had something better to do for all that time you didn't spend lurking for pizza and memes.</br>  <br>Fuck off, roodypoo</br>  When crackychan first posted here, 2004 or 2005 I think  <br>  Cracky <br>:(</br></br>  <br>No u candy-ass</br>  <br>It's a state of mind coming from the culture you came into.
