[ Mom to son thread  <br>this is my kinda thread</br>    can't let this thread die            bump  This is considered healthy in America.  did tammy die?  <br>You just saw this is a webm thread...<br><br>No. This is not considered healthy in America.</br></br></br>  Oh wow, these bastards have fat foreheads now.  Not really. But okay    <br>Why do people even care if America has a high obesity rate? Theres fat people here. Its gross and disgusting, but at least your not one of them.</br>  <br>How fat and ugly do you have to be to try and convince people that this is healthy. You're not fooling anyone fatass</br>  <br><br>same bitch?</br></br>  <br>Kyle Gass?</br>  <br>I'm even from the great ole' US of A and this is fucking disguising. Ugh. I can't believe how people can live like that like seriously did they become the human epitome of Mississippi? Sheesh I bet the only action they do all day is reaching into their 5 lb bag of Cheetos and walking to the cupboard twice a day to get another 20 of such bags. Fat fucks. This is not normal in the US and will never be. I feel sick just from looking at them.</br>  <br>poor guy</br>  <br>Nah man it's not, go back to trolling on /int/, they believe anything.</br>    <br>You can see the pain and regret in his eyes. In his uniform because he's most likely shipping out the next day to sandnigger land to stand in the line of fire to avoid that meatuniverse.</br>  <br>that isn't considered healthy anywhere</br>  <br>Only if you're retarded</br>  <br>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^</br>    <br>is she melting?</br>  Nope. Considered gross and fat in 'Muricah.<br><br>The only people who believe it's good/healthy are fetishists or other really fat people.</br></br>  I was fucking disgusted to watch the video on their gofundme page because the one ham planet was in the hospital. The one bitch starts crying saying how if the other one died that the coffin would be really expensive because it would need to be 3 times wider or something.    <br>checkd and I agree with you 100%. Contrary to popular belief most Americans feel the same way. I don't really understand why everyone seems to think we're all fat</br>    <br>this would piss me off so bad if I saw this at any store. This pisses me off now actually</br>    <br>Don't forget the feminists<br>They seem to love fat people too</br></br>  mericuh!    <br>Holy shit who's so primitive to not get there info online? I don't believe any mass media.</br>  -----------------------------------<wbr>--------------------------<br>--This thread is now a fat hate thread--<br>-----------------------------------<wbr>------------------------</wbr></br></br></wbr>  Who are those whales?    <br>Someone post the full one I need to see the man get broken down on a spirtual level.</br>  <br>Oh yeah, I forgot about them.</br>  <br>where's his dick?</br>  <br>Shut the Fuck up. No it's not.</br>  <br>I fucking love this pic</br>  <br>True but try to make the faggots on /b/ believe it.<br>This is a challenge, mind you.</br></br>  <br>It's not considered healthy you ignorant piece of shit, it's just considered socially unacceptable to insult them for their weight.</br>  <br>That fat fuckin whale wiped her blubbery lips on the inside of it's shirt? WHAT A FUCKIN SLOB.</br>  <br>Damn. He caught me.</br>    <br>Wow! what fit americans!</br>  How does one get so goddamn fat that they turn Chinese? Imagine if Chinese people got this fat, they wouldn't be able to see shit.  <br>This</br>  <br>Actually it's not, landwhales claim they are healthy despite being 300 pounds or more, overweight. Don't confuse the opinion of landhwhales with the opinion of people, we are two very different species.</br>  <br>This IS healthy. You're just a angry europoor that can't get enough to eat. Emasiated Faggot.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Why do you hate the US? Just because we are richer than you, safer than you, have more competent leaders than you, hell, even better politics (looking at you UK) doesn't mean that we are inferior.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Obvious troll.</br>    <br><br><br>How are you safer then us? Its obvious that these land whales are eating people.</br></br></br>    <br>Kek</br>  <br>I see a strong beautiful independent woman.</br>  <br> safer than you <br> guns </br></br>  <br>anyone find this guy? filename</br>      <br>That's a woman???</br>  <br>We only allow the landwhales to live near criminals. This way, they can eat bad people, making them happy and us safer.</br>  <br>British master race reporting in <br>Stop before you embarrass yourself and further impose your stupid stereotype</br></br>  <br>no its not you retard<br> be from america </br></br>    <br>Outside of local news I'm not sure...but I think you missed the point of what they were getting at there...<br> Captcha: Select all the food. <br>I don't even...</br></br></br>        <br>This picture is the real slaughterhouse five.</br>    <br>That's just depressing.</br>              Thats probably the most grotesque thing ive ever witnessed.                <br><br>that is the weirdest shit, when people are fat everywhere but their hands and feet<br><br>their limbs look like sausages</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Yes, the brunette one sitting on floor on the left side of the pic...</br></br></br>      <br>I can't believe someone actually made a realistic image. I thought only the crazy faggots that actually put that much effort into visually supporting their lunacy. Probably the best image I've seen on one of these topics to date.</br>  Obesity rates in the US are skewed, because 40 percent of our population are either Mexicans or black people.  <br>That's considered healthy on tumbler.<br><br>OP is probably right.<br><br> I'm American. <br><br>Can't go to any buffet restaurant because of landwhales. Lardwhales eat so much the places have to charge stupid high prices to stay in business. <br><br>I like salad and lots of vegies with my meal.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> M-Muh colonies <br> Muh colour <br> M-muh own language <br> M-mush all white and perfect non melting pot superior society <br>All you fags should take your head out your fucking asses already<br><br>Bait harder faggot<br><br> Implying </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's right about the height thing though.</br>  <br>10/10 joke anon i kek</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=v6m<wbr>MpE8AaA0</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>this always pisses me off<br><br>the point of escalators is to climb stairs faster, not stand on one step and wait for it to take you up or down</br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm high and that looks good enough to nom the monitor.</br></br>  <br><br><br>  higher violent crime rate <br><br>MUH GUNS<br><br>fuck off. You people arent trusted with guns. The country would be an even bigger shithole than it already is with guns. At least the US is so big, you can choose to live with niggers in a high crime area where guns are undoubtely banned, or you can live in a place that hasnt had a murder in 30 years and everyone carries a gun.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No. No it isn't.</br>  As a britfag who has visited the US three times I can safely say that most of these stereotypes are wrong. Actually people there are a lot friendlier and open with strangers which is something i really admire.<br><br>People posting the stereotypes are probably poor french and swedes who just had their mothers fucked by sandniggers.<br><br>autists.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>witness me!!!</br></br>  <br>used to be mall</br>  <br>Glorious</br>  <br>  we are richer <br>  richer <br>Lol, dont make me laugh. 16,4 trillion dollar debt makes you rich???</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck you those are delicious</br>  <br>You can't seriously say America is safer than Britain<br><br>American homicide rate: 4.7<br>UK homicide rate: 1.0<br> INB4 population  <br><br>Accept that your empire is falling America, like every empire, it shall fall and be forgotten.

What do? Pic unrelated.<br><br> Be me, 6/10 nerdy white guy <br> Meets 8/10 black chick at coffee shop <br> Sounds white <br> Has a non-ghetto name <br> Is really sweet <br> I get her number <br> we hang out everyday at her house and listen to similar music <br> A month later she wants things to get srs <br> Try to bring up the fact that she's black to my parents <br> My dad is all for it, my mom freaks and grandpa said he'd disown me <br> wtf do I do. she thinks I'm stalling because she wants to meet my family. I don't wanna tell her they're racist...I'm also afraid she might move on. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  did you bang her yet OP?  Do it op. I felt the same. My family eventually got over it.  <br>Not yet...she won't let me until she's sure we're serious. I really want to, its starting to get increasingly difficult to hang out with her because of it.</br>  <br>I'm really thinking about it. My dad doesn't give a fuck, but my mom and grandpa are threatening to kick me out, ect.</br>  lel just do it you faggot. If you were female however i would've said you are a race traitor whore bag but ur not so good for you!  <br>Stop welcoming Cultural Marxism, wise up, understand your family is actually smart, Make gorgeous white babies. Problem solved.</br>  OP you know exactly what I'm about to say...  <br>I don't care about that shit, anon. All I know is she's smart, hot, and I'd be a dumb fuck to let a nigger fuck her instead of me...I just can't.</br>  Just curious OP, how old are you and do you have a job?  <br> I'd be a dumb fuck to let a nigger fuck her instead of me...I just can't. <br><br>Are you sure you're not racist too OP?</br></br></br>  <br>I'm 22, in the process of getting my masters degree in Computer Science. She's 21 and finishing her last year of uni. I don't have a job at the moment, but she's already working in her field.</br>  <br>I understand you OP. She sounds like a keeper too, so I say just go for it. Quit being a beta faggot and don't let your family come between you and dat ass</br>  <br>Black people behave like civilizedhuman beings, niggers are fucking savages. Know the difference.</br>  <br>This<br><br>I'm not into niggers, but I'm into black girls that sound white and are actually educated. Whenever we hang out, niggers are always staring her down...it's fucking annoying.</br></br></br>  <br>You sound like a fucking cunt OP. I'm sure she'll just love you calling her race "niggers"...</br>  <br>Then you are left with three options:<br>1) get a job so you have money to move out, shared accomodations are your best bet. <br>2) call your mother's bluff and tell her anyway. Hopefully your pop will have your back and you can continue to live at home. <br>3) explain to your gf what would happen if you brought her over, be honest with her. If she's worth a shit, she will understand and things will be fine. If she flips out and turns her back, get rid of her and focus on getting your own shit together.</br></br></br></br>  Some pretty solid advice in this thread, OP. I was in a similar situation. Ended up bringing the girl home anyway, four years later my family loves her. It takes time, but if they love you, they'll get over it.  <br> Mom freaks <br>Woman<br><br> Grandpa disown <br>Can you inherit anything valuable from him? (implying that ship hasn't sailed by merely mentioning the situation)<br><br> Dad's all for it <br>What a bro</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Alright, well don't let me stand in your way. I fucked a black girl for a while and this is how it went... Met her at a CHRISTIAN youth camp... She was very nice, we talked about God a bit.. She said I was very cute and smart. She said she was someone who had morals and wanted things to be serious before "anything" happened........ Then one day I frenched her out of nowhere. She kissed back, grabbed me, and then we had sex in the park.. Then we had sex a lot, then it was behind a store, behind a door, on the floor, she just wanted more. Sex was her core and she begged me to make her my whore. Christian she was, but the sex was her core... All she could do was ask for more. Soon my dick became sore while she asked for more. 3, 4, 5, times a day was the average score when I saw my little black whore. This chick had no lore, she only new God and gore. In and out, in and out was what she asked for, not a conversation about the world or how to hunt a boar. She was smart... but there was no conversation that could keep me hard core. The moral of the story is simple, don't be to quick to pop that pimple! She may be smart, she may be keen, but she can never talk to you like a pure white queen. For this is foreseen!</br>  <br>I'm thinking about that, honestly. Get a job, work my ass off, then tell my mom. My dad usually always has my back, but my mom's kinda insane...and has my grandpa to back her up. If she still kicks me out, I'll just end up living with my girl. The only problem with that is...her family is kinda religious. They're non-niggish Caribbean blacks, and don't believe in moving in until marriage.<br><br>But fuck that.<br><br>Also, yeah...I'm probably gonna tell her. I'm hoping she stays. fuck.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>KEKEKEKEK</br>  <br>This. <br><br>Who gives a fuck, OP.

I mean.. you are sad and depressed, then you take the pill and boom 180' changes ?</br>  <br>If it's SSRIs it's literally modifying your brain chemistry, fuck with your chemicals</br>  <br>Depends.<br>My depression came from laziness and not doing something productive.<br>Getting a job may seem annoying and shitty, but if it's not some kind of McD Bullshit, it occupies your mind and leaves you with money that you spend on nice things.<br><br>Smoking weed supports said laziness, but if you do it moderatly it could still work.<br><br>If you smoke erryday, try to stop for some week and just see how it feels. <br>I smoked for 5 years straight and was amazed to see how good I felt when I stopped for a longer period of time - actually didn't expect that, I was so used to it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Was cutting one day when I looked at my wrists, at all the scars, and asked myself what the fuck I was doing. Then I just stopped being such a little bitch and got a job.  listen to muse or something  <br>So one day you are sad and then everything changes? Is it like yoyo effect?</br>   quit shitty corporate job <br> started smoking weed </br>  <br>Not at all, you take it for years or months, try a lot of different ones to find which one works better with you, all of course prescripted by your psychiatrist, he'll be keeping track on your response to the meds, they don't feel like they work, you don't feel any changes but you start giving less shit about being depressed, until you slowly don't feel depression anymore, you don't feel happy or high, it just heals you, but in a long term intake</br>  <br> Also this:  <br>http://www.ted.com/talks/andrew_sol<wbr>omon_depression_the_secret_we_share<wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br>   Also this:  <br>http://www.ted.com/talks/andrew_sol<wbr>omon_depression_the_secret_we_share<wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>When do I know if its time to look for help ?.</br>  <br>Here's a good starting place. This paper is pretty great.<br><br>It doesn't precisely identify the issue with psychiatry and rambles a bit - for example he mentions that the number of illnesses had increased by 100 in 7 years and that "caffeine induced sleep disorder" and "phase of life problem" are listed as mental illnesses. And that's great but the problem is a field doesn't need to be that ridiculous to be not science. It failed way before it ever got to that point. And I would have liked to see that point driven home more thoroughly <br><br>But then again there's a lot of shit wrong with psychiatry so it's an enormous topic to tackle.<br><br>Anyway enjoy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And I like Dead Brothers at the moment.<br>They have a nice melancholic touch<br> https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=KJ<wbr>V533-04Zo</wbr>  [ ] </br></br></br>  <br>Shit I forgot the link:<br><br>http://www.arachnoid.com/psychology<wbr>/</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=XZp<wbr>3Mtn-YsI</wbr>  [ ] <br>check this band out. it's pretty good. depending on your taste in music of course.</br></br>  <br>Fuck man, when you can't function as a working part of society, you won't go to work, have friends, enjoy things you used to, just the feeling of worthlessness, that there's no point on getting out of bed and just lay there for weeks or months, you know when you're really deep in depression, when you're fucked up</br>  <br>No, that would be dexamphetamine, meth, MDMA and shit like that</br>  <br>OP here.
