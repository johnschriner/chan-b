[ This has quite a bit of potential. Could we do it, /b/?<br> for original thread</br>  Look at this, too.<br/>  Bump  bump  feed it too the SJW's and that shit will spread like a wildfire  op from the last thread, lets hope this goes better  If you feel like making some sort of fake news audio clip I can do a pretty mean autistic black man impression  this is one of the shitty shops I did, low quality but could be used to look like facebook click-bait  If this is going to work, we need to make the story and spread it like fucking wild fire. As said before, the SJW's on Tumblr and Twitter are a GREAT target, but we need to make the thing first  we need someone famous  Fuck it. I'll do it. I'd rather it be like Bill O'Reilly or something though. Can't stand that fucker. It's funny watching how much Trump is pissing everybody off.    CANT STUMP THE TRUMP  just for the lolz?  other shitty photoshop    <br>but why would you want to take down the biggest troll in the history of mankind, a man that dares to troll even the presidential election?</br>  On tumblr, I have a few hundred followers.<br>They think of me as a SJW.<br>I can spread it.</br></br>  <br>That's why it will be even funnier to see this happen. Thanks for making it, anon.<br><br>Also, let's get some screencaped of this thread and the previous one in case this actually does take off.</br></br></br>  <br>if you were organized, yes.</br>  /b/ump  <br>I don't like the "!" <br>Also it's 16 year old</br></br>  Do it to someone else or something, Trump is the fucking man  <br>Nah. It doesn't look convincing enough.</br>  <br>yes, start by saying you "heard that he had &lt;blank&gt;" and raise a fucking sjw army</br>  Someone grab a CNN article with trump and use inspect element to change everything about it.<br><br>Also, anybody that can great twitter bots outta use them.<br><br>Someone make a kik group too. And decide a date.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes. Thank you very much anon.<br>Let's also get the hashtag #NotInMyWhiteHouse going.</br></br>  <br>yeah. like i said, shitty.</br>  You're retarded  this meme isn't dank enough  I AM MAKING FAKE ARTICLE RN KEEP BUMPING THREAD. KEEP POSTING IDEAS  <br>I'm gonna need everyone to dump their kik in that case.</br>  <br/>  <br>link when you are done and spread it on all media ?!</br>  <br>But of course.</br>   mfw none of these threads ever work   Should we make a huge kik group chat? I can make one and add all of you.    <br>because he raped my kid</br>    <br>DUMP YOUR KIK NAMES FOR THOSE HELPING WITH THIS</br>  <br>kik is kek</br>  <br>Bump. Everyone dump their kiks. This actually might work.</br>  we can start putting vague stuff out tonight to get everyone hyped up, then release more info later  Being an undercover SJW with a few hundred followers,<br>I know that if we also say "He's republican anyway" will grab their attention because they're usually democratic<br><br>also ass bc im bored</br></br></br>  <br>kekks kik kik kik</br>  make a twitter/tumblr page devoted to this shit , make a sob story from the family or something with it. they love victims  <br>good idea</br>  <br>Are you actually going to participate or shitpost?</br>  Kik chat has been created. I'll add anyone who dumps their username. Hopefully we can actually do this shit.  <br>why do you keep posting nudes we said we wouldnt help you</br>  <br>kyke</br>  Someone send a tip to fox news. If it gets main stream, the SJW's will do all the work them selves.  start the #notinmywhitehouse  <br>you didn't even read the comment</br>  <br>shes doing the trump shit</br>  boomp  <br>not fox , something more left-sided , they would eat it up faster</br>  The kik hastag is #NotInMyWhiteHouse for anyone interested. See you there, fellow anons.  <br>Huff post</br>  <br>when did your face become that of a child corpse</br>  <br>is TMZ still a thing?</br>  itt: faggots trying to stum the trump  <br>yes</br>  People photoshopping clickbaits?

Is season 3 trying to ruin Pinkie Pie's reputation?<br><br>Not to the fandom. It's clear that the fandom creates their own content and many base their beliefs of the show in fan-made material, like fics, arts, animations or music.<br><br>We all know that Pinkie is the hyper, happy, party monster character of the show, but on season 3 I've seen Pinkie Pie fracturing the thin line of being hyperactive and fun to being idiotic and characterless.<br> <br>Since season premiere, I noticed Pinkie being like this, and this disconfort me, because she's not like the Pinkie that I used to love.<br> <br>Then came out "Too many Pinkies", a Pinkie Pie episode. I felt her being SOOO reckless, she usualy is, but she's wise at the same time even if she doesn't make sense, like in "Feeling Pinkie Keen" or "Green isn't your color", because she knew the consecuences of making copies of herself, did she even thought of what if she was about to do to get rid of these clones? Rewatch the clones parts if you don't believe me and see the reactions of Ponyville's villagers, they really hated her XD. The episode was fun though, very WTF for her 4th wall breaking abilities, but she usually do that.<br> <br>And now, in this episode of the CMC, Pinkie Pie RUINED THE WHOLE EPISODE, even if her lines were very brief and not important in the slightliest, she still had a HUGE impact on me and it impress me how IDIOT she was on that episode, her lines didn't make sense, not in WTF way but in a really STUPID way, her behaviour, her voice, her STUPID puns. <br>I don't even want to slap her, I want to slap the person who wrote that episode and did that to Pinkie. Anyways, I'm not confortable of what I'm seeing of Pinkie Pie in this season, and I hope to see things getting in place with her, even if she makes cameos during episodes.<br> <br>I didn't expected this to feel like rant LOL. But I'm curious, what do you think of this?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>roll</br>        six million just ain't enough  I wish I had cancer so justin bieber would visit me in the hospital, caress my head with his soft fingers, and kiss me like only he could.  <br>Roll</br>  I jack off to random mens cocks on 4chan.
