If he wins prepare for the fox news shit storm calling him a socialist commie  <br> implying i'd vote for a jew </br>  <br>well, he is a socialist</br>  <br>he's a bolshevik jew</br>  <br>That's why US is turning to a 3rd world country police state</br>  sell everything you have and give the money to the poor, then come talk to me about a man who basically wants to give other people's money away  <br>Socialism is awesome. Ask Nordic states</br>  <br>Completely agree, just hope he makes it past the primaries hoping so much.</br>  <br>Bernie Sanders: ‘As a Nation, We Have Got to Apologize for Slavery’<br><br>no thanks</br></br></br>  <br>Socialist whose ancestors happen to come from israel<br>Tough shit</br></br>  <br>You're fucking retarded, do you even know what third world means? Obviously you don't, police have to much power without repercussions when shit goes wrong but we aren't close to becoming a police state</br>  <br><br>he ain't gonna make it past the primates</br></br>  <br>trump is our best choice</br>  He wants to overturn citizen united by stripping constitutional protection from corporations. What could possible go wrong.  <br>No, that's what Christians are supposed to do, not Jews.</br>  <br>Sadly it will probably be the same story with Ron Paul</br>  <br> primates <br><br>ooga booga</br></br></br>  <br>if someone makes alot of money legally, why should the state force them to give it to the poor?</br>  <br>The same guy who blamed starvation on the fact that there were too many brand choices for food?<br>Don't be a fucking idiot.</br></br>  <br>ha ! which part, the hordes of sand niggers, inefficient healthcare system or feminist utopia</br>  <br>4 years of comedy sounds great. Pretty sure all comedians would vote for this ape</br>  <br>Implying rob paul and Bernie sanders are anyway similar.<br><br>Ron Paul a libertarian that stood for minimal government.<br><br>Bernie communist cunt sanders stands for government intervention and large government.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>like any free man would vote for him</br>  <br>You dont understand, most billionaires do not pay the same tax as most tax payers, they pay half if not less than the average american. Warren Buffet says he pays less than his assistant in taxes</br>  <br><br>He implied they won't make it past the primaries. <br><br>The rest of your fail is due to your shit learning comprehension.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Bla bla bla bla bla<br><br>Pay more taxes! We need more nsa, more wars, more more more<br><br>How about we cut everyone's taxes</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Im not saying they have the same ideas, Ron Paul was ignored by the media</br>  Carly Fiorina is our best option.  He's going to be the least shitty option available.<br><br>I mean, I like him mostly, but he could be vastly worse and still be the only not-shitty choice.</br></br>  <br>You trying to speak reason to conservatives? Not gonna work. Try insulting minorities next time, that gets them hard</br>  <br> Warren Buffet says he pays less than his assistant in taxes <br><br>Warren Buffet is a transparent hypocritical douche. <br><br>He tells reporters "I don't pay enough in taxes" while he hires an army of accountants to make sure he doesn't pay a cent more than he has to in taxes. The asshole's free to write a check to the government for more if he wants. <br><br>What he really means is "I don't think anyone else pays enough in taxes"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>who told you that?</br>  We don't need no immigration  <br> they pay half if not less than the average american <br><br>What are "statistics I just pulled out of my ass," Alex?</br></br></br>  If youre interested on who you would vote for take this: <br>https://www.isidewith.com/</br>  <br>And cut which programs?<br><br>Also, most people who would be in support of bernie would be against more NSA, and more wars.</br></br></br>  <br> if someone makes alot of money legally, why should the state force them to give it to the poor? <br><br>It'll teach them to stop making so much money and making the rest of us look bad, for starters.</br></br></br>  Trump 2016  <br>http://money.cnn.com/2013/03/04/new<wbr>s/economy/buffett-secretary-taxes/</wbr></br>  <br>IRS statistics don't show this to be true...<br><br>Look it up. It's a fact that the top 10% pays half and the top half pays 97% give or take a point or two. Face it. The rich pay the vast majority of the bills.</br></br></br>  <br>Well by putting both of them together like that he makes it come off as if they are both some how together in a way.<br><br>They are no way similar and Bernie cunt boy should just drop out. <br><br>I'll just let you uneducated peeps know this so we have no misunderstandings on the situation.<br><br>Ron Paul freedom<br>Bernie sanders less freedom</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>Cut everything that doesn't help me personally /republican</br>  <br>*citation needed</br>  <br>He might've meant percentage-wise, though I think it's still untrue.<br><br>I'm personally much more bothered by corporate welfare, and the ability of some companies to get themselves to a negative tax rate.</br></br></br>  <br>Wants more money?<br><br>Wants to cut programs<br><br>Boy do I have a bridge to sell you</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>http://money.cnn.com/2013/03/04/new<wbr>s/economy/buffett-secretary-taxes/</wbr></br>  <br>Seriously? Warren Buffets earned income is the highest possible bracket. You mean unearned income? IE investments? Which are inherently taxed at a lower rate to encourage investment and lets people save for retirement?<br><br>Yeah good idea jack up the taxes on unearned income and watch how fast the rich put their money in bonds which pay ZERO percent tax.</br></br></br>  <br>Ron Paul is horrendously retarded, and is a terrible fucking choice.</br>  <br>it's not just giving it to the poor, mainly people for health reasons can't work the same amount as other people and for a general safety net, you'd probably also complain if there was homelesss people sleeping all over the place around where you live, also not providing any assistance to these people would lead to a massive increase in crime, the amount of robberies would go through the roof. The persistence of life is pretty crazy and once people get hungry enough or even more if their offspring starts to get hungry people will do a lot of things just for survival. <br>and this is the problem here, the super rich pay a lower rate then people like me that are just scraping by working my ass off yet those people don't have to pay the same rate? If it's just money sitting around that especially should be taxed highly vs. if it's in investments which would be an incentive to invest in the economy or especially small businesses, tax that at a much lower rate so the money isn't just going stagnant.</br></br>  <br><br>So if Buffet really feels like he should be paying more, why doesn't he just pay more? Give me a reasonable answer. No one's stopping him. <br><br> hint - he's a lying, hypocritcal douche </br></br></br></br>  Bernie gets pissed businesses take their factories and banks overseas but wants to tax the shit out of the wealthy business owners. What a fucking idiot  Can't wait for trump to win. Always wanted a racist, slimy, business man who pissed away his money on crap to represent the American people. Fuck progress, let's go backwards by putting even more money into politics  <br><br>an intelligent, informed opinion, to be sure.

He can't imaginably be worse than Cuntion, Bush 3.0, or Donald Turd</br></br>  <br> You must have been indoctrinated in shit tier EU school system. <br><br> implying you don't get indoctrinated in shit tier US schools </br></br></br>  <br>health reasons = medicaid and disability. we already have that. <br>giving incentives for failure increases failure</br></br>  <br>mccarthy was a god<br><br>fuck off you dirty kike</br></br></br>  <br>/pol/</br>  RAND PAUL FOR PRESIDENT<br><br>Surely he will win, libertarianism is the sole way foreward!</br></br>  <br>well used trips. Like the use of Ad hominem.</br>  <br>cuck</br>  Bernie is the man. Sadly I only have girls in poly sci to talk to it about and they just want a woman in office. Idiots.  <br>yes one example obviously proves your point, how could i be so daft. assuming he isnt lying or im ignorant about the laws regarding his lower tax rate</br>  <br>Well you sir are correct. We do get indoctrinated in the us school system. I suppose it isn't as "pro government" as EU systems but I suppose they are both pretty pro gov</br>  <br>We know what socialism is. We just have to look at the EU going down in flames as Greece falls apart with Spain and others not far behind.</br>  <br>bernie is no better than crypto-jew clinton</br>  Vote Trump. He'll send the Mexicans back to Mexico, the blacks back to prison, and the Jews back to the ovens.  <br>also keeps crime down which costs a ton to our society already</br>  <br><br>Make them some Vagina for President t-shirts.</br></br>  <br>voting is pointless, all they want is power and money. doesn't fucking mater</br>  <br>Because if Buffett pays more but his peers do not, he is worse off than his peers. <br><br>However, if ALL his peers pay a similar percentage, he hasn't lost out compared to them. Prices for ultra-rich stuff will change to reflect that. <br><br>So yeah, he'll still lose a bit of cash, but the people at the bottom will suffer less. And in the long run, wealthier people at the bottom means less crime, and many other benefits for the WHOLE of society.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not getting past bush unfortunately</br>  <br>nigga third world means unassociated with the US or USSR</br>  <br>/thread<br><br>Also he hates mudslime, he might drop a bomb on that stupid cube</br></br></br>  <br>"...the people at the bottom will suffer less."<br><br>This implies giving the US government more money will help in any way. Yet time shows the governments in general are pretty shit when it comes to running anything soooo.... No?</br></br></br>  <br><br>You failed. If Buffet personally believes he ought to pay more taxes, then it matters fuck all what his peers are paying, he ought to and is perfectly capable of paying more. <br><br>Why doesn't he?</br></br></br></br>  <br>THIS.</br>  <br>I see you know what ur talking about master</br>  it won't work because the poor will use the money on things which do not grow.<br><br>the rich by definition KNOW what to invest in, therefore enriching themselves as well lifting up the poor. <br><br>certain poor people are more worthy to become middle class than other poor people, e.g. there are harder working poor people who do not waste their wages on trivial expenses.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You came to the wrong place for intellectual discussion on this topic.</br>  <br><br>Diehard conservative here. Trump is an arrogant, rude, self-promoting moderate that stands out simply because he's rude. <br><br>He'd make a horrible president. Thank God we don't have to take him seriously.</br></br></br></br>  <br>fucking niggers just have to fuck it up for everybody else</br>  <br>thank you finally someone who knows what the term means, during the cold war allies of the west and NATO and such were first world. Being an ally with the USSR means second world. No alliance which for the most part meant small countries in central america, africa, and southeast asia being developing nations</br>  <br>Rand Paul is the way to go tbh.<br><br>My efforts will go to him even tho I joke trump for potus</br></br></br>   all this mud flinging <br>It doesn't matter whether you have a donkey, a goldfish or a horntoad as president,<br>nothing can be as bad as Hillary.<br><br>That's what you should focus on.<br>Keep that witch out of office.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> the rich by definition KNOW what to invest in, <br>most people who are rich started their life rich, most inherited their fortune.</br></br>  1. Read every comment Bernie Sanders says<br>2. Decide how that idea will be implemented<br>3. ???<br>4. The Government Profits!!<br><br>Conservatives call him a socialist because he IS a socialist.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 2016 <br> being an authoritarian faggot </br></br>  <br>Boo fucking hoo</br>  <br>The problem with Rand Paul is I fear he won't do enough.</br>  <br> Trump is an arrogant, rude, self-promoting moderate <br>you mean he's a republican but instead of masking his agenda and saying things like "urban votes" he just says what's on his mind, I'm a socialist but hey at least he doesn't hide who he is unlike most republicans who beat around the bushes</br></br>  <br>that wasn't a complaint ... was just saying that they didn't get rich from investing properly</br>  <br>But when Obama actually does shit you people say he's overstepping his powers and should be impeached but you'd love for a conservative president to do it</br>  <br>back to /reddit/</br>  Trump is hilarious, he is not a serious candidate to vote for. He's a troll man  <br>Almost close. The difference between Socialism and Democratic Socialism is the difference between the EU clusterfuck and FDR getting elected so many times they had to amend the constitution. <br><br>Being mandated to give a modicum of a fuck about the worse off makes a society function, and is unfortunately necessary since Conservifucks made it popular to be selfish prick [spoiler]even though 80% of you will never be even close to rich enough to be affected by high corporate or progressive taxes[/spoiler]</br></br></br>  <br><br>I literally just answered why. Of course it matters what his peers are paying, if it means he's significantly worse off. <br><br>Get it through your head. Left-wingers are not in favor of charity. Charity is the right-wing solution to poverty... but after centuries, it doesn't seem to have worked has it? <br><br>The left wing says charity is great, but never goes far enough. Hence the need for systems like welfare. And if you look at the empirical research, all countries which adopted welfare have seen a massive decrease in the number of people living in absolute poverty. <br><br>Just as no-one should question a person's right to free speech or freedom of religion... so should there be no question of a right to food, water, shelter, electricity, and so on. <br><br>We have the resources to ensure everyone can get these things, and still allow the incentive to rise higher than this minimum standard of living. It's time we moved to the next stage of human civilization.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Iv actually heard he has shown support for Hilary in the past. There is a good chance he is just making the Republican Party look bad to sway votes to her.<br><br>Who knows tho, all speculation</br></br></br>  <br>If it's free, I'll take the / democrat</br>  <br> free </br>  <br>I've never said that, I appreciate what Obama did, he definetly left the country in a better place then what he started with.</br>  <br><br>Obama hasn't been able to do anything because he is famous for being incapable of working with congress.<br><br>He has done everything in his power to avoid working through the people's representatives. He doesn't like doing that.<br><br>So instead, he does things on his own, superseding the authority that was vested in him.<br><br>Just the beginning of this year in January he stood before the American people and said to them that if congress didn't do what he wanted he would change the law through executive order. <br><br>And the people riot with joy. Americans are a lost cause.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>that'd be funny if he was and hopefully it is so. fortunately though the republican party doesn't need help in looking bad lol either way the democrats have already won I just hope it's Bernie</br>  <br> I literally just answered why. Of course it matters what his peers are paying, if it means he's significantly worse off. <br><br>You answered, but your answer is absolutely wrong. If Buffet feels convicted, as he says he does, that he should be paying more, then it is utterly irrelevant what his peers are paying. Sure he'll be worse off, but that doesn't affect is conviction. <br><br>If I see someone drowning, and I feel convicted that I ought to help them, it's no excuse that I don't see anyone else helping them. If I fail, I've violated my conscience. <br><br>The real answer is obvious. Buffet doesn't actually believe he should pay more to the government, because if he did believe, that, he would. He wants taxes raised, and then guess what you ignorant motherfucker, he'll STILL pay a minimum thanks to his massive army of accountants employed to see to it that he pays a minimum. But you'll pay more, and he'll have a good little chuckle at you over his next glass of 50-year-old scotch.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Bullshit. For all their flaws, governments in most developed countries do an excellent job of providing education, sanitation, roads, sponsoring scientific research. <br><br>Stop riding the ancap/libertarian bandwagon and consider the benefits that the State has brought you. Read some Mariana Mazzucato or Steven Pinker.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh, you mean going back to when throwing hundreds of millions of dollars into smearing people so your own personal servant becomes President. Yeah, shit already went wrong when SCOTUS let corporations be people. They never go to jail for anything, and I've never seen a corporation die for this country. Fuck off Ayn Rand Faggot.</br>  <br>Lmao<br><br>More fuel to international wars, expanded gitmo, let minorities flood our country, raised taxes, forced me to pay for health insurance, expanded nsa, tpp, restricted the rights of citizens to own weapons for protection, expanded police state, militarized local law enforcement .... <br><br>I could go on<br><br>He was by far the worst thing this country has ever witnessed</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>With the whole ISIS situation I think we need more of a hawk than Bernie</br>  I want him for president  <br> Just as no-one should question a person's right to free speech or freedom of religion... so should there be no question of a right to food, water, shelter, electricity, and so on. <br><br>I'm questioning it. There are no rights to stuff. Your answer will be either "oh yes there are" or "Everyone agrees with me." Neither of those are valid points.</br></br></br>  <br>ISIS isn't doing anything to us, just let them kill each other.</br>  <br>Yup. I hope he's on the ticket.</br>  I defintlely encourage you guys to take this presidential quiz. Even my mom was surprised that she sided with Bernie Sanders<br>I sided with Sanders 93%<br><br>https://www.isidewith.com/</br></br></br>  <br>Again stats don't back this up. About half of millionaires in the USA are self made and basically ALL the billionaires. You're using left wing talking points but have never actually checked the studies before have you? I mean seriously? Most rich people who inherit money blow it all. Seriously go look it up.</br>  <br> Obama hasn't been able to do anything because he is famous for being incapable of working with congress. <br>lol by that do you mean the republicans in congress who just will say no to anything he says ? that's why nothing was getting done anyone who wanted to look good to their constituents had to say no to ACA and such or else they wouldn't be around for the next election which is the problem right there, congressmen and senators mostly just try to lay low and not ruffle feathers so they don't do anything that would be perceived as bad so they could have another run and do shit for the next election. they aren't doing things for the nation they are doing it for the votes</br></br>  <br>Nothing a couple solid nukes wouldn't solve</br>  <br><br>God no, i dont want that clown leading my country</br></br>  <br>For a fraction of the cost as well</br>  He is really really old.  <br> I literally just answered why. Of course it matters what his peers are paying, <br><br><br>Didn't your mom ever ask you "would you run your dumb ass off a cliff if all your friends were doing it?"<br><br>That's basically what you're arguing, that Buffet's excuse for not paying as much as he says he should be paying is because all his friends are doing it. <br><br>I guess your mom was right about you being a dumbass.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Trickle-down economics is working out really well; for just a few people. The rest get trickled on.</br>  <br>Actually believing people can be "mandated to give a fuck about the worse off of society".<br>This is why Socialists are brainwashed. They think they can change human nature.</br></br>  /b/ supports Trump  <br>yes its only around 30 percent of billionaires inherited their money but when it comes to millionaires yes a majority of them inherited their money</br>  But lets all agree that a republican president is definelty what we dont need for next election.  ITT: Redditfags who think socialism works.  <br> implying i need a quiz to determine my vote <br> <br>is your iq below 70?</br></br></br>  <br> putting troops in the middle east to deal with the problem we caused. <br><br>No thank you. Besides isis isnt a threat to us. We should be worried about our police being a threat to us</br></br></br>  <br>Don't you talk to your lord and savior Obama like that!<br><br>I'm reporting you to Tumblr and Reddit!</br></br></br>  <br>In my little hometown we sometimes do the following:<br>A guy takes a pot with water to the front of his house, someone else joins with potatoes, another comes with salt, another one may bring meat...<br>you get the idea, afterwards we have a blast.<br><br>I rest my case.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Link to poll?</br>  <br>This comment sums up the stupidity of the right-wing. <br><br>You expect people to be saints or do fuck-all.<br><br>Have you considered the possibility that Buffett wants to help, but is also self-interested?<br><br>This is what progressive taxation offers to people like him - the opportunity to help the less well-off without being inordinately disadvantaged by it.<br><br>Furthermore, he advocates for progressive taxation because he recognizes that even with his vast wealth, he wouldn't make much of a dent on his own. <br><br>And lastly, you question his willingness to help when we have proof that he does. He made a record-breaking $2.8 billion donation to the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation in 2014.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's irrelevant anyway. That talking point is just used to appeal to your greed when socialists point to a pile of money and say it's okay to steal it. It's not your property, but they want to rationalize it so they say "Bob, the owner of that money, didn't work really hard to earn it so...go ahead, make it yours"</br></br>  <br>it does<br><br>exactly lol capitalism is trickle up economics while socialism is trickle down. both systems are redistribution of wealth only in a capitalist economy money flows towards the rich</br></br></br>  <br>pulled it out of my history<br>http://strawpoll.me/5009542/r</br></br>  <br>A) Citizens united was about free speech, not money. <br>B) Even if you are a mouth breathing idiot who doesn't understand citizens united, removing freedom of speech from corporations isn't the solution.</br></br>  <br>It actually is pretty helpful to see the percentage with each candidate you agree with</br>  <br><br>No ones too old to be the president</br></br>  <br>Blak Bla bla<br><br>No more taxes!<br><br>There are no multi-billionaires in America getting richer and richer every day just sitting on their thrones of gold. We're all just poor people getting raped by the tax man.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>"Education"<br>That's why private and charter schools have the majority of rich peoples children in the USA right?<br>"Sanitation/Roads"<br>Seriously? The society of civil engineers in the US gives the US sewer system and roads C or D grades.<br>"Scientific research"<br>Right, because So many companies like GE, Intel, Micron, Apple, Bell, etc don't have the majority if applicable patents... Oh wait... Look it up! It's public record!</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>reaaalllly?</br>  <br> n <br>There are rights that we as a society decide to recognize in one another. <br><br>Rights are merely choices about how we wish to live, now that we've advanced beyond hunter-gatherer societies.</br></br></br></br>  <br>First off it's half the millionaires.<br>Second most of the ones who didn't blow the money invested and GREW their money.</br></br>  <br>Lol our police are fine you stupid hippie.</br>  <br> You expect people to be saints or do fuck-all. <br><br>Wrong, I don't take someone's word at face value like a naive child like you do. I examine their actions to see what they really believe. <br><br>Buffet says he believes he should give more to the government. However, instead of giving more, he hires a massive army of accountants to ensure he gives the absolute minimum. <br><br>Your posts show the stupidity and naivete of the average liberal high-school child who believes everything people say instead of examining things critically.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Also, corporate personhood as been a legal concept since 1819.</br>  <br>what? money flow to the rich because they created a better product for customers.</br>  <br> thinking socialism works in 2015 <br>kek</br></br>    I think the real problem that we are missing when it comes to wealth inequality is that rich people don't spend their money. Let's say someone makes 10 million dollars a year, they don't spend 10 million so that money won't go back into the economy.  <br>Bashes capitalism... The very system that turned the US into a world superpower.<br><br>Lifts up and extols socialism... The very system that will pull the US down our of being a superpower.</br></br></br>  <br> There are rights that we as a society decide to recognize in one another.  <br> Rights are merely choices about how we wish to live, now that we've advanced beyond hunter-gatherer societies. <br><br><br>This was a was of meaningless fluff that did nothing to establish that rights exist to food, water, shelter, etc. <br><br>"Rights are choices about how we wish to live" doesn't even make fucking sense.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>but thats wrong the supreme court says corps are people.</br>  <br>So much this.<br><br>If more people would just ignore what politicians and candidates say, and only look at what they do by examining several sources...this country would be a very different place.<br><br>Of course that requires effort and most people try to avoid things that take effort.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Are you american? And if you haven't been paying attention, theres dozens of news about police beating and abusing their power. White or black.</br></br>  <br>Wrong the rich INVEST their money.<br><br>Don't believe Duck Tales dude, the rich aren't Scrooge McDuck swimming in their money. They invest it which generates wealth and economic activity which does more for the economy that poor people spending it.<br><br>Why? Because rich people (who stay rich anyways) spend their money more efficiently than poor people.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, it's being over-reported in the news. Stats show the crime rate in general is down. INCLUDING the police.</br>  <br>you defend this shit like you run a large corporation that needs to be regulated.</br>  <br>That guy looks like he'll be dead in 2016<br><br>Good luck with that america</br></br></br>  <br>slightly over half which as I said, is known as a majority, and saying most blow it is why people can't take people like you seriously you're just making an assumption.

It's all the socialism that's been injected over the years. Maybe if all the unions weren't total asshats about their wages we'd still have a strong auto industry. We STILL make the highest quality steel in the world but no one buys it because steel workers think they deserve 75 bucks an hour. Plenty of people had the middle class life in the USA working steel mills making reasonable wages and got their american dream white picket fenced yard. It's when all the socialist crap started coming in that all that went to shit.</br>  <br>pretty much. we are fucked.</br>  <br>kek</br>  <br>Fuck his politics, he's a walking heart attack or stroke or some other old people shit waiting to happen.

Look up the average pay of a auto worker, steel worker, longshoreman. They make more than i do and i have a fucking chemical engineering degree! NOW THAT is the problem. Shipping costs aren't small and our policies are making it financially easier to make things and ship them into the USA. Maybe if we didn't have one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world companies might stick around hmm?</br>  <br>I don't blame you for caving to the rhetoric and endorsing the same policies that have landed you in your current situation. Socialists like Sanders promise bread and circuses - it is an easy trap to fall into and I don't fault you for your desperation. As someone who is desperately poor myself I find it tempting to vote for a Sanders or a Warren who talk big when it comes to helping the poor.<br><br>Sooner or later, though, you will realize that it is empty rhetoric, and people like Bernie put high-level Union officials and special interest groups above the interests of the common man.<br><br>The best way to help the poor is to create an environment in which they are given opportunities to lift themselves out of poverty, not make empty promises of monetary compensation to them.

It couldn't be because they are *gasp* more efficient at it?! Take away their reward and they'll come crashing down on the middle class so hard your head will spin.</br></br></br></br></br>  Does Bernie Sanders campaign managers put these shits up wtf....    <br>yes, so put capitalism back in place. get rid of the federal reserve and IRS and only tax outcome. everyone will have to pay the same tax no matter what, with no loopholes. the reason those jobs go overseas is because of all the regulations and costs to hire workers. if i was the CEO and I wanted to maximize profits without having to pay for all these payroll taxes and bullshit, then hell yes i am going to ship my jobs overseas.</br>  <br>10/10 would trait my race for<br><br>i for one welcome my new communist jew overlord.</br></br></br>  <br>He's actually a rumored atheist, but I think he uses his jewish heritage to cover him when it comes to the religious voters.<br><br>Democratic Socialist.<br>Scandinavia seems to be doing fine on the top end of the World Leaderboard</br></br></br></br>  <br>related &gt;&gt; http://www.usdebtclock.org/</br>  <br>nope, just redditors.</br>  While you were bitching about that black lady on welfare cashing her $200 check Citi just took $500 out of your back pocket  <br>Shit, cut our military spending.<br>The F-35 program is a joke.<br>Give that funding to NASA</br></br></br>  <br> not understanding national debt <br> not understanding economics </br></br>  <br>PEOPLE help people.<br><br>That sums it up best i think. Government doesn't really help people because you feel like you're OWED the help when its government. You have no one you're truly beholden to.

It's 10. Any other answer on an exam is wrong.</br>  Whoever is arguing it's not 10 should anhero  <br>this reads correct to me, but i am delusive. waht is a q ring</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>so much dubs</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You don't seem to understand how parentheses work</br>  Nice try you little cunt.

Get fucked kid.  <br>Tfw PEMDAS/GEMDAS<br>aka it's 10</br></br>  <br>You added 4 to 2(3) before doing the exponents, multiplication and division.</br>  <br>58 now move on faggot</br>  <br>uh...<br>36 / 6 + 4<br>6+4<br>Its not 58</br></br></br></br>  <br>What's inside the parenthesis first, jackass. Not what's attached to it. The debate is over, it's 58. Pee porn or GTFO already.</br>    <br>you're literally retarded.</br>      Order of operations (PEMDAS):<br>36 / 6 + 4<br>6 + 4 = 10</br></br>  <br>It's 10, are you 8?</br>  <br>Quit posting photoshopped pictures. You think youre so smart right?<br><br>Summer</br></br></br>  <br><br>funny that all these niggers disagreeing with you aren't posting their proof. <br><br>cause their dumb fucking faggots.</br></br></br></br>  <br>(6^2)/(2)(3)+(4)<br><br>Hur dur</br></br></br>  <br>you are so right, discussion is the worst thing on an image board.</br>  <br>Omg ur so dumb</br>  <br>2ez4rtz<br><br>http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?<wbr>i=6^2+%2F+2%283%29+%2B+4</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Only one of those is dubs you nigger</br>  <br>Ur so fucking dumb amerifat. U have to calculate / and * at first and ^ at very first</br>  faggots.  <br> &lt;- yes<br>Distribution is not in PEMDAS, the D is for division, and the M is for multiplication. <br><br>Distribution is really just used if there were different units in the parenthesis such as x or y, otherwise you would just multiply by the result of whatever was in the parenthesis. So it is really just multiplication.</br></br></br></br>  <br> implying I photoshopped this before even doing it. <br>10/10 bait m8</br></br>  <br>You know someone is a summerfag when they're still calling summer and its almost August</br>  <br>The answer is 58, but you expect people to be tricked into doing 2(3) first because of the horrendous spacing of the numbers.</br>  <br>^THIS</br>  Great, even the autistic of /b/ can't do fucking math.<br><br>It's 10 you christian taught morons. They probably teached you how to correctly do math in Jesus land, but in real math, it's PEDMAS.<br><br>holy fuck, /b/ is probbly just bad because of all the fucking summerfags coming in</br></br></br></br>  <br>See </br>  <br>check this<br><br><br>wolframalpha doesn't lie</br></br></br></br>  This is 10 lol. Whoever says otherwise is a troll or an idiot, probably both. <br><br>Move along.</br></br>  <br>this</br>  <br><br>Low quality bait</br></br>  <br>the equation he punched into wolfram isn't the same equation the OP has. <br><br>It was manipulated to give a specific result.</br></br></br>  <br>You kids dont even start middle school until late August.</br>  <br>huh wtf does this nigger site wolframapha think they are, some kind of math wizard? <br><br>srsly, nobody gives a fuck for wolframalpha cuz of shit like that.</br></br></br>  The number of people saying the three is in parentheses, therefore multiplication comes first is astonishing. Did you not take algebra in highschool? And the pople putting multiplication before division rather than treating them the same. Every division is just a fraction, shitheads. Jesus fucking christ.  3.6  <br>Thank you.</br>  <br>No you moron, it's confusing because it's using an ambiguous operator. The division sign should not be used with multiple operands. It should be a clearly written fraction, if so. However, PEMDAS would dictate:<br><br>((6^2) / (2(3))) + 4 = 10<br>(36 / 6) + 4 = 10<br>6 + 4 = 10<br><br>Note at the second step, the division becomes ambiguous and some people might want to divide 36 by 10, but that would be disobeying PEMDAS.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Not sure if people are trolling or complete morons when it comes to math since they didn't even learn the basics. You do brackets first.  IN PEMDAS, MULTIPLICATION AND DIVISION ARE DONE IN THE SAME STEP LEFT TO RIGHT, AND THE SAME TECHNIQUE IS APPLIED TO ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION.<br><br>THEREFORE, YOU DO NOT DO THE MULTIPLICATION OF TWO AND THREE FIRST, BUT RATHER, THE DIVISION OF THIRTY SIX AND TWO, AS IT IS THE FIRST MULTIPLICATION OR DIVISION PROBLEM IN THE EQUATION.</br></br>  <br>http://www.purplemath.com/modules/o<wbr>rderops.htm</wbr></br>  For all of those calculating.

Wtf? How can you possibly get -1? Goddamn.</br>  <br>umm i'm going to say no ha ha. i have a feeling most of you who thought it was 10 were simply fooled because you were never taught thoroughly in math class, or maybe just simply fooled, but after seeing Google tell you that you're wrong, those who still think it's 10 are just ether dumb or acting</br>    Im blown away at all these 10's......<br>answer is 58....<br>Pemdas is conusing you kids... Multiplication does not precede division, just like addition does not procede Subtraction.<br><br>You do the exponents, and then solve it left to right. Dont get confused by the parenthesis, its just another way of writing 2x3<br><br>Pay attention in elementary please.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  /thread  <br><br>and you're a dumbass</br></br>  <br>Poor students.</br>  <br>What!?????</br>  <br>Really hope all those replies are trolls.</br>    10^2/6+4 is around 20.67  <br>Oh, also to not get 58, remember PEMDAS puts multiplication explicitly before division. To not do so would be contrary top PEMDAS. And it disobey PEMDAS would be to create your own rules in place of rules everyone agrees upon. That's like op saying he's not a fag for sucking so many dicks because he redefines fag as meaning a person who can stop sucking dicks any time they feel like it.</br>  i got 36  Conclusive  <br>No, faghot, its not (6^2)/(2*3) its ((6^2)/2)*3 god damnit, too many highschool dropouts in this thread.</br>  <br>PEMDAS MOTHER FUCKERS<br><br> 6^2 / 2(3)+4 <br>Solve any parenthetical equations first, but since there are none you move onto Exponents<br><br> 36 / 2(3)=4 <br>Multiplication and division are up next, if you have both types in your equation you solve from left to right.<br><br> 36/2(3)=4, 13(3)+4, 39+4 <br>Add 4<br><br> 43 </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  How stupid do you have to be to get 58 and -1 LMAO  <br>The thing is, everybody in this thread, even those claiming it's 10, know this. Those who claim it's 10 know it's 58, but they're trolling. This is a math troll thread. These people are disagreeing for lulz. There is no convincing these people because they already know. So, really, we're all wasting our breath and everybody who knows it's 58 should just fucking leave the thread and leave the trolls to continue their circle-jerk.</br>  Can we keep this conversation educational?

Please take a closer look at it again, sir. Remember multiplication and division go in order from left to right, so you will divide 36 by 2 first, and then multiply by 3</br>  <br>I'm American so the answer doesn't matter. They quit teaching math here 30 years ago because niggers couldn't pass the classes. Now the only math we know is what comes out of a 4 function calculator.</br>  <br>woah take it ez faggot</br>  <br>No, you fucking kid, multiplication and division are on the same level. Every division is a fraction that you then use normally.</br>  <br>10</br>  <br>Thanks OP. You riled up /b/. What else did you expect to happen? <br><br>You opened up a can of retard faggotry and now we have chaos.
