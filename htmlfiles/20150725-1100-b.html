Seriously. I left when I was 13-14. It was ultimately WikiIslam with the help of this place that helped me realize Islam wasn't the goddamn perfect religion it was supposed to be. WikiIslam might have a few things that are incorrect, but don't use it as an excuse to discredit the whole thing. On the contrary, you can't say the same thing about Islam. It's supposed to be from Allah, which means it would have to be perfect, flawless. You can look up "refutations" on various Islamic forums about various topics, but they are weak as fuck and it seems like they're for convincing themselves and giving themselves a pat on the back for "disproving" them.  <br>We didn't do it. They are setting us up.</br>  Drop dead?  <br>Just one button press away</br>  <br>1. idk<br>2. u can laugh at what u want i dont think particullar things people are joking about are funny</br></br>  I'm not a muslim but I really wanna see a mosque.<br>how is it?</br>  <br>i dont know what the full Quranic message is<br>but the themes that I gathered from it are<br> self-restraint <br> patience <br> willingness to submit to a Higher power <br> humility <br> respect </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What does the Koran say about beating your wife?  <br>I, or rather my parents and other ancestors, am from Palestine, but I was born and raised here in America</br>  <br>Ehh...

Atleast in northern Europe where I live.<br><br>But then again a few punishments in the hudud (this part of the Sharia is what you westernes mean when you say Sharia law) I would consider too strict and unpracticable. Like the death penalty for apostasy. I will have to say that ex-muslims are the worst ATHIST FEDORAS on the planet.

Every religious person would say that. The "cleaness" u feel after praying is realy making u free.</br>  <br>No it doesn't. That sura is hotly debated and some suggest that you may never beat your women at all (the prophet never beat his wives and he had like 50 of them) also there is some debate that the old word for beat actually means walk away or leave alone. Even those who think the affirmitive say that one may only strike your women if she is about to dishonour herself greatly and only as last resort. <br><br>Not because she is tired or her vagina hurts or whatever reason she won't fuck.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>lol</br></br></br>  <br>You've stated your religion, that means you need to be completely pure or get criticized</br>  <br>Why do you idolize a pedophile, Aisha was 6 when muhammad married her, 9 when marriage was consummated</br>  <br>im the anon you replied to and i have to say that made me kek</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;63018456 they didn't.

"O Muslim! There is a Jew hiding behind me, so kill him."</br></br></br>  <br>This world is just a temptation. I would say both equally, u wouldnt want ur kids to live in such a fucked up place would u?</br>  <br>the "consumation" was only him jacking it between her legs<br>ik it sounds fucked up, but better than banging her<br>and it only took place because there was pressure to legitimize the marriage</br></br></br>  <br>To be a pedophile you need to fuck a child. If you claim he did that then I ask for evidance. <br><br>I don't know if you have heard about the subject called history but marriage in the arabic peninsula 1400 years ago means a different thing than it does in Europe or Yankistan today.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>lol it's amazing that religious people have to go through such mental gymnastics and become scholars of their holy books just to say that "maybe" it doesn't say you should beat your wife. If these books were divinely inspired/written by an perfectly moral being there would be no question about such things.</br></br></br>  <br>No it doesnt, tell whoever told you that to proove it to you, That asshole is lieng , but thereis something about beating a wife but not litteraly beat her, just softly pat her , women are respected so much in islam.</br>  <br>Its based on wartimes.</br>  <br>I don't follow Hadits that are incompatible with the Qur'an.</br>  <br>Kek, also, cell phones have a use other than setting off road side bombs?

In which case i took the bait</br>  <br> They're respected so much they're kept in cloth bags, only allowed to leave the house with a male escort of her family, not allowed to drive, have their genitals mutilated, and kept from education. such respect such wow</br>  <br>When does young muslim will built islam 2.0 ?</br>  <br>Innocent my ass. Who do you think he/she was innocent ? Berkin elvan ?</br>  <br> holy books just to say that "maybe" it doesn't say you should beat your wife <br><br>It doesn't say you should beat your wife. I have been studying a thread about the Koran for the last 5 minutes and I have never heard that.</br></br></br>  <br>Interesting concept ironically applied to religion.<br><br>Aren't all religions based on belief in things unproven and unprovable?</br></br></br>  <br>I agree, was gonna convert but then saw the Qur'an and ran, that shit is way too long</br>  <br>Yes hadiths tell that if ur women cheats u r allowed to hurt her a little like for example by "punching" her with a small pencile, as much as i know, and u shoukd avoid to sleep/talk with her.</br>  <br>durka durka mohammed jihad</br>  y u bomb m8?  <br>my father never beat my mother, and he always taught me to care for the women in my life, the men in middle eastern countries take advantage of this<br>you arent supposed to oppress women you are meant to shield and protect them, with a bit of extremism protection can lead to oppression</br></br>  <br>Mud-slime</br>  <br>Protect Innocent muslims<br>Defend islam (not kill innocent people)<br>And brw suicidal bombing is a very big sin in islam if you kill yourself.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Men are the maintainers of women because Allah has made some of them to excel others and because they spend out of their property; the good women are therefore obedient, guarding the unseen as Allah has guarded; and (as to) those on whose part you fear desertion, admonish them, and leave them alone in their sleeping places and beat them; then if they obey you, do not seek a way against them; surely Allah is High, Great.<br><br>-Quran verse 4:34</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Thats only in saudi arabia.</br>  <br><br>Is this why he didn't want us drawing pictures of him?

Is that why Muslim countries never offer aid to western countries? No innocent Muslims to protect?</br></br>  <br>indeed and i would hope your arguments didnt have the same problem</br>  <br>I agree it is very long, and even I still havent read all of it, but that doesnt mean you have to avoid being muslim altogether, just take it one verse at a time<br><br>a lot of times as long as you have the intention of doing something and at least try, Allah swt will forgive you.

Born and raised in Michigan. I can help OP out as well.</br>  <br>This</br>  <br>Qur'an (4:34) - "Men are the maintainers of women because Allah has made some of them to excel others and because they spend out of their property; the good women are therefore obedient, guarding the unseen as Allah has guarded; and (as to) those on whose part you fear desertion, admonish them, and leave them alone in the sleeping-places and beat them; then if they obey you, do not seek a way against them; surely Allah is High, Great."</br>  <br><br>I totally understand where your opinion is coming from. But for us moslems, a big part of the evidence that Islam is the true religion (or among them) comes from the Book itself. This has historically been one of our strongest if not the strongest case for Islam being serious business when it comes to religion. Because of that, the Qur'an has to make sense and we need be able to practice it's content in real life. There will be arguments among muslims what to practice, how things should be interpreted and so on. Now we know that Mohammed got the messege but he could not write, so the book was written down by human hands. And humans unlike God, can make errors.<br><br>From an outside perspective these arguments are stupid, but without this our religion would be stale and irrelevant. One may think that everything should be right from the beginning but God gave humans the free will to choose our distiny.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Words to live by.<br><br>Imagine if the Western world heard these words, maybe we wouldn't have so many problems today, that stem from kids coming from a broken home.<br><br>Can you post more?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What?</br>  <br>Continue to fuck donkeys but do not ever fuck with Turkey.

Why are we surrounded by everything, including the things that have made it possible for us to be? Why is there not just absolute nothingness?<br><br>I have obviously asked myself this question many times, but I became particularly annoyed at this moment. It must of been something I read recently but can't remember. I just don't think anyone can give any actual plausible explanation to why we are surrounded by everything, instead of ceasing to be in complete nothingness.<br><br>inb4 big bang<br>inb4 man in the clouds<br>inb4 "There is something rather than nothing because something is more stable"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  there has to be something because that's the nature of something to be something.<br><br>there can't be such a thing as nothing because there would be nothing.<br><br>because there is something, there must be something.<br><br>there can't be nothing because nothing by its very definition is nothing.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  There cannot be said to be a cause in the sense you are thinking about.

The fact that there is a you to perceive 'something' presupposes a non-null universe.</br></br>  <br> can exist anywhere <br><br>you talk about nothing like it's space.<br><br>nothing is nothing. no dimension, no space. nothing.</br></br></br></br></br>  question: how was the universe created?<br>scientist: probably, all the mass in the universe was infinitely dense, which would have streched time infinitely, so there would be no such thing as "before the universe" and hence, the universe cannot have been created (at least it would be impossible for us to know)<br><br>question: how was the universe created?<br>religious guy: god<br>question 2: how was god created?<br>religious guy: YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO ASK THAT!!! I KILL YOU!!!</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Something can appear out of nothing. <br><br>Just like 0 is considered nothing, you can get a -1 but with it follows a +1. Now hide the -1 and you will have the illusion of "something". That is the whole concept of positive and negative matter. The negative matter is hidden and we can only see the positive.</br></br></br>  OP here. I here what your'e all saying. I've been looking into it. But the way I am thinking of it is more deeply, and in fact its quite daunting.<br><br>I must admit that I did ket last Saturday and my experience was well Interstellary. I remember making crazy connections about space and dimensions and all that, which after my buzz I couldn't remember how I comprehended it. I was left trying to thing something from nothing.</br></br>  There IS nothing, OP! <br><br>It's nothing. You get it?<br><br>Nothing already is nothing.</br></br></br></br>   Why is there something, instead of nothing? <br>Don't laugh, that exact sentence is considered a major unanswered question in physics and philosophy.</br>  <br>can exist anywhere where there isn't something</br>  <br><br>that would be nowhere.</br></br>  It's another case of the puddle thinking the pothole was made for it. If there was nothing, there would be no one to ask why there was nothing. I know that doesn't seem to answer the question, but if you think about it from the perspective of particle-antiparticle pairs, there probably is also nothing in addition to all this something. "Why" implies a choice was made, but that isn't actually the case.  <br>Meditations on First Philosophy.<br><br>First published: 1641<br><br>Influenced: An awareness of the impracticality of philosophical scepticism, empiricism, the scientific method.<br><br>Great job, OP. Maybe if you waste a few more years smoking pot you'll see that being a waste of space makes you feel like one, maybe you'll come up with the brilliant, original, thought: 'if you gaze for long into an abyss, the abyss gazes also into you.'</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>even though you can see and sense all the something that is around you, there is much more nothingness surrounding you than somethingness</br>    <br>Too bad the OP never actually said the universe must be made for humans.<br><br>Your fedora is showing.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Haha I'm taking on a PhD producing new knowledge in the field of social psychology thanks</br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=fdL<wbr>AN18CSDE</wbr>  [ ]</br>  Maybe all this is nothing. Your experience with chemical interaction and the holograms that feel like real things are no more than a convenient mirage that dissipates if you focus hard enough. But I guess that begs the question who then is concentrating? I'd say we're just the system looking at itself in an infinite loop and this thing called reality is just our personal channel on the infinity station. I'm you you're me we're reality. <br><br>Something is just a fluctuation of nothing anyways; it's all a wave and the nothing just has angular motion. One is horizontal, one vertical and the nothing waves plummet in this fashion in all directions and the microcosms and spurts and reverberations we witness are of higher and lower orders that stretch onwards to a fractal precision. It's compelling to think this system was created but what we don't think is whether it is self created from inevitable order and that God is just the waves acting in a way that waves only can act. Sentience by the way is only regarded in humans and higher apes by the use of language, of organized methodologies and active adaptability. We define it and in its definition excludes the greater sentience of our Operating System and thus gets the squeaky clean label of God</br></br>  <br><br>that's not nothingness. that is space. space holds matter. it's not nothing.</br></br>  <br> Haha, I am so insecure about my real world achievements I need to lie/brag about them.

He does this intentionally before issuing her the warning because he knows if she knows she's only getting a warning it may calm her down. He wants her angry. <br> After she responds to his question he gets an attitude about her answer. He asked why she was angry and she told him. <br> Clearly annoyed at the black woman, he asks her to extinguish her cigarette (even though he has no right to do so), knowing this will likely push things over the edge. <br> She knows her rights and refuses, enraging the officer because she failed to bow down to his almighty holiness. <br> He unlawfully demands she exit the vehicle. She refuses, and that's the beginning of the aggraravated assault by this officer. <br> Just off camera he beats, humiliates, and injures Ms. Bland, causing her some very serious injuries. <br><br>When they get to jail, the assault by the officers continued leading to the strangulation of Ms. Bland and attempted cover up.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>no shit<br>its pics online that should the police dept where she was<br>oddly the floor is the color of the back wall in her pic<br>people are saying she was already dead<br>and this pic was taking of her lying down</br></br></br></br></br>  ITT: Retards  <br>racist detected</br>    <br> ITT: Retards <br> posts in thread </br></br>  <br> racist detected <br> /b/ <br>fuck off newfag</br></br></br>    Lets jack off to girl feet!

Thanks for posting her.</br></br></br></br>  <br>For me, if the girl is sexy, all of her is sexy and the feet are part of it. I'm not into the whole smelling thing and the splayed toes do nothing for me unless they are on my cock. But the sight of bare or sandaled feet on girls when they've only been in winter boots and shoes forever seems like a little bit of revealing nudity. Dunno why. I like small toes, give a great foot massage-as long as they've been washed, and love to have my feet worshipped. I'll do stuff for her in return too. It's just part of my kink menu. I like 'the pose" and prefer pics of people barefoot in natural settings.</br>  <br>just doin my part lol</br>    <br>luckily, there's others who have those awesome shots all the time</br>    <br>and those never cease to amaze</br>  <br>Best explanation I've read is that the area of the brain that deals with the mapping of sensory nerves has the feet set very close to the genital area, thus in some people the areas are closely wired together or even intertwined in a way.</br>    <br>Great toes on righty</br>  <br>more of left pls</br>    <br>Thankyou</br>  <br><br>See<br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>oh fuck yesss</br>      Are there really feet in any of there pictures?
