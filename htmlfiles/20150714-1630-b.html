You don't hope for it, but the day she does something like this, you've got it made, because it instantly grants you the upper hand in the balance of power.

You need to avoid over-using it, because that will whittle away at your relationship until there's nothing left. You need to declare right away that you're owed, and what you intend to use your credit on, and get it done. You can't wait, or the expectation that it's in the past will creep in, and remain an open wound that will fester.<br><br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/627806014#p627813344">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>kiss her on the cheek and put my dick in her ass when she got home. now shes loose enough to take it</br>  R34 thread<br>Bonus points for rosalina</br>    <br>If there's room left<br><br>3/10</br></br></br>  <br>Two, The basketball one and the fundraiser one</br>  Hey /b/ rate my aquarium.<br>General Pet Thread</br>    <br>I spent an hour at night staring at the bristleworms in my aquarium the day I found them.
