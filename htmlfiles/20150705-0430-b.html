[ How can we make America great again?<br> Happy fourth of July </br>  Eradicate the niggers  <br>Nuke it and start from scratch</br>  <br>This includes all uneducated, lazy fucks.<br><br>Oh and gays</br></br></br>  get rid of the internet  <br>this.<br>can't wait to see the fall of america.</br></br>  <br> not the Jews  <br>idiot</br></br>  <br>Send the niggers back to Africa</br>  <br>This exaggerates, but I tend to agree. Too many national institutions are too corrupt and too powerful. The Supreme Court sacrificed its legitimacy this summer to force a policy preference on 330 million people because democracy was too inconvenient. And they will pay no price. <br><br>I can't even bring myself to celebrate this weekend.</br></br></br>  Giving back what made the land of the free what it was<br><br>Freedom.</br></br>  <br>who says america isn't great right now - republicans?</br>  <br>I'd say spending several trillion dollars annually on programs that don't work instead of trying to pay off our debts is pretty awful.<br><br>Not saying America is awful, but it can be a hell of a lot better if our government actually was run by people with brains in their heads.</br></br></br>  Fuck the federal goverment  <br>Everyone under the age of 40. There was just a poll. Fucking read the news.<br><br>And if you're implying "Blame America First We Deserved 9/11" Democrats are patriotic, you're on crack.</br></br></br>  Get rid of niggers.  I'm rich, well educated, and happy. America is perfect. Suck on it faggots.  <br> great again <br> again </br></br>  <br> There was just a poll </br>  kill the fags. get rid of the rice n beans. cage niggers and take away the freedom of women  <br>it's already great. and it just keeps getting better. it's better right now than any time in its history. the american dream is fucking alive and well. i know, i lived it. <br><br>amazing fucking country.</br></br></br>  <br> Promoting the removal of freedoms <br> American <br><br>Statist scum.</br></br></br></br>  <br>HAAAHAHAHAHa<br>Do the gene pool a favor and an hero, ignorant filth.</br></br>  <br>yes please an hero</br>        <br>Burn your constitution. It has you hog tied for actually progress. <br><br>Take your asshole extremists on the political left and political right and kill them all. The argue forever over whether to raise tax and raise spending or to lower tax and lower spending while both run the exact same deficits. Fuck raise taxes AND lower spending. Pay off your fucking debts before you turn into the next Greece.<br><br>Your right is greedy and corrupt for not supporting obamacare. Your left is weak and hypocritical for supporting obamacare. It is just another brand of stupidity. Dump it all and bring in real universal health care for all. Fucking banana republics can have free health care and not bankrupt themselves but the richest most powerful country in the world is to cowardly to try.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>F R E E D O M<br>R<br>E<br>E<br>D<br>O<br>M</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>its like the chart s upside down...</br>  <br>So, full on communism complete with mass slaughter, property seizure, and reeducation.<br><br>Shocking that this is what liberals cunts realky want.

Here's what I would do if I were in charge:<br><br> End the war on drugs. Legalize weed, mushrooms and possibly XTC and cocaine. At least $100 billion is saved in lower police/prison expenditures, lower crime, economic growth from the legal drug industry and putting tax on drugs. <br> Legalize prostitution <br> Cut $300 billion from the Defense budget. $500 billion will remain, the US will still easily be the #1 power <br> Close Guantanamo Bay and apologize to the victims of torture (also admit that it's actually torture) <br> Reduce the federal debt <br> Reduce income taxes below $200k <br> Change the age of consent laws (enprisoning people of 23yo for fucking a 17yo is retarded. European laws are better) <br> Religious institutions are no longer tax exempt <br> Put a man on Mars before 2030 <br><br>It's pretty much Libertarian I think. Thoughts?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>your pic is a black man. FYI</br>  I'm here to save the day.  <br>everybody knows this would work but it will never ever happen. theyre just going to elect another puppet and keep making money of the middle east. money that will go to rich capitalists until america collapses.<br><br>I really hope america falls during my lifetime</br></br></br>  <br>It will. There is a season for everything.</br>  <br> enprisoning people of 23yo for fucking a 17yo is retarded. European laws are better <br>This is on a state-by-state basis, many have clauses against doing this sort of thing to people.<br> Legalize prostitution <br>Also state-by-state, Nevada for example has it legal outside of Clark county<br> Close Guantanamo Bay and apologize to the victims of torture (also admit that it's actually torture) <br>The admitting has been done, the Senate outlawed any form of enhanced interrogation, although the military may still practice it, they'd get fucked over if caught<br> <br>Otherwise you're pretty on point</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Agree with stated above besides Gitmo and religious institutions.<br>That being said, caveat:<br> Summary execution for unrepentant prisoners of war and those who commit crimes against humanity, most at Gitmo qualify. <br> Since most Religious Personnel in non-modern civilization take vows of poverty, allow exemptions for religious institutions on the most basic amenities, and allow only funds for maintainance and building grounds. Nothing more or less. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Raise Taxes on the richer classes<br>Remove benefits from being a worthless jobless lowlife from the poorer class, and give back more of the money to the middle class<br>revamp the educational system by taking it out of the hands of lawyers in D.C.<br> inb4 right, left or communism/fascism </br></br></br></br>  <br>i really hope your right.<br><br>Its like USA is a huge bubble thats gotta burst sometime. The soviet union collapse came pretty much out of the blue and maybe USA will as well but im not so sure</br></br></br>  <br>although the military may still practice it, they'd get fucked over if caught<br><br> if caught. <br>lol</br></br></br></br>  F R E E D O M<br>R E E D O M<br>E E D O M <br>E D O M<br>D O M<br>O M<br>M</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Raise Taxes on the richer classes <br>Lowering taxes for non-rich is a better idea<br><br> Remove benefits from being a worthless jobless lowlife from the poorer class, and give back more of the money to the middle class <br>It would surprise you how little money is saved with this. Taking away all benefits for unemployed and giving it to the middle class, would be like a 1% improvement for middle class and a 90% reduction in income for unemployed. There aren't as many long term unemployed in the US and they don't get as much money.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The Soviet Union is a good example because their people were rekindled inside, unintentionally, by Gorbachev's glasnost. The same will happen in the West but on an unprecedented scale. Just as puppet regimes fell in the satellite states leading up to the collapse of the Soviet Union, so current regimes will come to an end across the world. A growing number of people are becoming disillusioned with the various dreams they've been raised to believe in. Cultural, local, racial identity are come to the fore again.</br>  <br>...also increased crime rates cost more money. And the reduced spending by unemployed is bad for the economy. Middle and upper class tend to save much more than the poor. That's why you can't save as much money by not giving anything to the unemployed.</br>  <br> Its like USA is a huge bubble thats gotta burst sometime. <br><br>The bubble bursts every 30 years or so<br> 1929 <br> 1987 <br> 2008 <br><br>Followed by a depression, followed by a recovery.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>America IS great</br>  <br>I think he was meaning more along the lines of the rise and fall of empires, rather than cyclical economics; but you're right about that. My state stupidly invested $1b (then, not adjusted for today) in a giant shopping center in the capital city, right in the middle of a recession (1990-91). Naturally actual profit fell far below projections, the state bank collapsed.</br>  <br>Forgive all 100% of all debt owed to the top 1% of people or the institutions that the individuals own shares in relative to their relative ownership of said institutions.<br><br>Go to mars, start new civilization. Human culture goes on forever as American/western based.<br><br> Win the Game of Civilisations </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. — That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.<br><br>My fellow Americans, tomorrow is the Fourth of July, which of course we celebrate as our day of independence. The quote above is from the Declaration of Independence, among the great documents of our nation. It's my favorite quote of similar works of the era. Whereas most of the world was ruled by kings, the Founding Fathers, following the example of the Magna Carta and expanding it to its natural conclusion, determined that a government only can exist so long as it has the consent of the governed, that no one person by birthright may rule another human, that leaders are to be determined by individual merit, leadership skills, and offering a coherent vision of the future so that citizens may choose for themselves what the future should look like. We have stumbled in the past, often unsure how to interpret different parts of the documents. But what has been consistent is a greater recognition of a truth integral not only to America but the whole western world, a thought that was dangerous and revolutionary: the belief that every human has a certain dignity on the merit of being human. It is this belief that challenged the abuse of monarchs and emperors, and it is this belief that has been upheld by courts time and again. It is this belief, that all have dignity, that allowed for the birth of modern democracy and liberty. And it is this belief that is under threat to this day. <br>1/2</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hm yes. The American empire might collapse. But, that doesn't mean America becomes a poor Syrian-like anarchy. Britain lost all its power after WW2 and it's still a "rich" country and a regional power. <br><br>Same with a country like the Netherlands. Dominated the seas in 1650, now a small and unimportant country. But it's still very rich and in the top 5 of best countries in the world to live in. Americans might lose their power but that doesn't at all mean they'll lose their wealth. There's not much to fear. You'll drop from #1 to #4 or so in the next 100 years. So what.</br></br></br>  <br>Whenever a government imprisons someone for an opinion, this cherished belief is threatened. Whenever a government determines your life choices, forces you to suffer physical indignity like abortion or torture, this belief is threatened. Whenever you are threatened into silence, this belief is threatened. <br><br>Never allow that belief to die. Tyranny takes many forms, from the visible horrors caused by despots such as Stalin or Pol Pot to the quieter tyrannies such as "forced disappearances" or government-paid thugs that beat peaceful protestors, detain them infinitely for dissent, rape inmates in prison to intimidate them, or systematically slander them or prevent them from working. There are many forms of tyranny, and on the Fourth lets remember to look out for it in all forms, to call it out, and drag it before the light of liberty.<br><br>2/2</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The bubble bursts every 30 years or so <br> 1929 <br> 1987 <br> 2008 <br>The restriction implemented by the US Government in the 1930's didn't cause a bank crash for all most 50 years. <br>Those restrictions where lifted and... well 1987 and 2008!</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Only because their rebellious offspring the US replaced them as the economic power. That too was when countries were molded around their own people. Today is more similar to the Roman Empire, which after extending privileges to almost everyone experienced a decline on every level and eventually succumbed to barbarians; who still had their identity firmly part of their culture.</br>  <br>Easy, we remove all the white people.</br>  <br>War... war never changes.</br>  <br>He said great, not shit.

This has been the situation for most of history. A sole superpower is rare, happened only with the Roman Empire, Britain in 1850-1910 and USA in 1990-2020.</br>  <br>Exactly. Our nations rule the goddamn world. And we fight over this and that like children.<br><br>Man the FUCK up and realize how goddamn awesome we are and stop the stupid bickering.</br></br></br>  <br>"Good morning. In less than an hour, aircraft from here will join others from around the world, and you will be launching the largest aerial battle in the history of mankind. Mankind, that word should have new meaning for all of us today. We can't be consumed by our petty differences any more. We will be united in our common interest. Perhaps it's fate that today is the 4th of July, and you will once again be fighting for our freedom. Not from tyranny, oppression, or persecution, but from annihilation. We're fighting for our right to live, to exist. <br><br>And should we win the day, the 4th of July will no longer be known as an American holiday, but as the day when the world declared in one voice, 'We will not go quietly into the night! We will not vanish without a fight! We're going to live on, we're going to survive.' Today we celebrate our independence day!" <br><br>President Thomas Whitmore<br>July 4th, 1996</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Multiple powers then, not multiple superpowers. Sorry to seem petty.<br><br>Putin's Eurasian Union is expected to form this year or at least start taking shape. States that have traditionally had ties to Russia (excluding ones that would obviously not join and cede power such as China) either via trade or otherwise, including Mongolia.</br></br></br>  WWIII ft. America.  <br>How about we do like we did when it was great, like when we had unions and a middle class and manufacturing instead of letting them ship our prosperity overseas so they can get rich sucking the last drops of blood from us?</br>  Initiate the conscription, either go to the military or go to Job Corps. Military because, well, you always need fuck tons of people in the military and Job Corps because no good hippies will have an alternative to the military that will teach them something useful to society. <br><br>Bring back industrial jobs and to compensate, pay them shit wages or have some sort of commission based pay, let teenagers work for the shit jobs for extra money or something. <br><br>Get MUCH tougher on crime, you think police are bad now? Hundred years ago, they'd beat you half to death for petty theft and shoot you dead for running.<br><br>Gentrify black neighborhoods with 2 whites for every 1 black but don't raise the rent so blacks will stay. Blacks hate living around white people, and white people don't give much of a shit so long as they act civil, and if blacks know they are outnumbered, they won't do a damn thing. <br><br>More federal/state/corporate funded jobs to improve roads, build underground electricity and spread of wireless communication and internet to rural areas. <br><br>But what do I know? I'm just a cock sucking liberal faggot.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> dat Independence Day quote </br>  <br> Putin's Eurasian Union <br>Lol no. There aren't any countries that are on Putin's side, apart from fucking Belarus and a bunch of drunk rebels in the east of Ukrain who like to shoot down civil airplanes.</br></br>  <br>This has been planned for a while now, anon. It is not reliant on compliance.</br>  <br>Unless he decides to invade another state like he did Ukraine. How many Germans or French ppl are willing to die over Estonia? Hopefully we don't see them blink.<br><br>But when Putin is pumping the natural gas for Europe... They might.</br></br></br>  <br>this guy</br>  <br>Dude nothing's going to happen. The Crim is now Russian and that's it. The Russian economy is crippled because of low oil prices, corruption and the boycot and there is no support whatsoever for Russian politics anywhere. Russia will never become powerful unless they change to a more western system of democracy+capitalism.</br>  <br>Estonia is in the NATO.</br>  <br>Barroso, is that you?<br><br>By the way, I am not basing this on what has happened regarding Ukraine.</br></br></br>  <br>I know this. But how many NATO members will look at their dependence on Russia and go "well... Estonia DID have a bunch of Russians...."<br><br>That's the same reason Germany hasn't been hard on Russian sanctions, nor the rest of the EU. Putin correctly calculated they will blink and do little. If anyone does anything it would be America and those not wholly dependent on Russian gas exports.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe Allods</br>    ...................................<wbr>...................................<wbr>...........

I know she's been going crazy, said she's been with over 20 guys in the past few months, pulling from craigslist, tinder, etc. Someone's gotta recognize that ass.  <br><br>Tell her he cheated on her ex. Send her a photo or something</br></br>  <br><br>Elizabeth???</br></br>  <br>Blackmail her for more!!</br>  <br>Come on guys</br>  <br>.....Wait, did you?</br>  <br><br>Maybe. Last name initial??</br></br>  <br><br>Dat ass, pussy, skin, hair all look familiar from that angle</br></br>  <br><br>tell me what you did, she's told me a lot of stories. will post more if it's her...</br></br>  <br><br>The only time the guy is a bastard is if he personally knows you. Your wife is just a whore. Never get mad at the dude doing your wife, it's not his fault.</br></br>  <br><br>Met her on Tinder. Met up for some drinks. Lots of flirting, basically starts rubbing my dick at the bar. We leave, she gives me head on the way back to my place. We fucked that night and again in the morning. Haven't heard from her since tho</br></br>  <br> <br>The only way my ass. Just sign the fucking papers and move on. Or take a trip to South America for a "romantic getaway" in which she doesn't return.<br><br>IE Peru, climb a mountain, push her over the summit. Problem solved.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sounds like something she told me... fucking weird. Did you guys do anal?</br>  <br><br>How about some self respect you fucking pussy.</br></br>  All I got back  <br><br>Might have tried it for a couple minutes. I was pretty drunk at the time so I'm sure I probably tried to stick it in. What's her initials? Btw is that just some random Internet pic or is that her? It's got a bullshit water mark</br></br>  <br>guess im in the clear</br>  <br>Lauren Phoenix</br>  <br>yeah, she used to post on gonewild. ok that sounds legit, where did you cum? Initials EM</br>  http://www.primewire.ag/external.ph<wbr>p?title=Rick+and+Morty&amp;url=aHR0cDov<wbr>L2JldGEudmlkdXAubWUveHFlOWMzcmdpbms<wbr>0&amp;domain=dmlkdXAubWU=&amp;loggedin=0</wbr></wbr></wbr>  <br><br>Holy shit, think that's her. I definitely came in her, she said she was on the pill so I said fuck it.</br></br>  anyone fuck katie g from 313  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Samefag</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>nice. That sounds just like her. She usually tries to drip it and swallow it. Said she's done that from her ass too. Will post face if anyone else fucked her.</br>    <br><br>Yup, that's definitely her. So what are you dating her now or are you like an ex bf? She seemed like a freak. I've tried to meet up with her again but it never works out.</br></br>  L  <br>No we broke up a little while ago. She was a freak and seemed like she's become even more of one.</br>      I really wish see my gf with two big dicks  <br>is her name sarah wise?</br>  <br>...what did you do?</br>  This thread is actually kinda creepy if its real and not just samefags. What are the odds that this stuff happens?  <br>looks like a girl i used to fuck, if its her....came in her every time, wasnt on the pill or anything so we used morning after a bunch, begged me to do anal after only dating for like 3 weeks</br>  <br>Tell her she shouldn't have been a bitch and cheated</br>  <br>I dunno about her dating anyone longer term. Do you know if she was with anyone else at the time? Would she ever just leave with her cum still in you? did you ever cum in her ass?</br>  Hi guys!<br><br>Any dutch /b/ros in here? I'm happy to announce that I will soon move to the Netherlands, Rotterdam to be exact, to indefinitely live and work there since my country is not as well off.<br><br>I can give more details if this thread isnt ignored.<br><br>Any tips or considerations? Thank you guys in advance!<br><br>Also, what do you think about living with flatmates?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Nederlandse accenten zijn zo kanker.  <br>wat</br>  <br><br>btw /b/ro since you are from there could you give tips on getting housing?<br><br>budget is 1800€ a month for living</br></br></br></br>  You Epic fuckers need to go eat a duck.  Dude i want to do the same but im from france, can the language be a strugle?  <br><br>well the only dutch word i know is kanker, but its doable as long as you know english, you can learn it there<br><br>personally i would try to secure a job before getting there, though</br></br></br></br>  you niggers are the cancer that kills our country. fix your own shithole instead of freeloading off of ours.  <br><br>nice attitude man, among all the countries that are in europe, i will actually go to the netherlands to work and live with your people, and you respond like this instead of thanking me .... no comments</br></br>  Stay the fuck out of my country you fucking nigger, fix your shithole of a country instead of running like a little bitch  <br><br>samefag</br></br>  Dutchfag here, actually Rotterdam is a kankerhol. I would recommend aborting your plans to live there. Go to Den Haag instead, which is obviously shitty as well but less shitty than Rotterdam and only 20 mins away. With €1800 you can easily rent a proper appartment for yourself.  <br>I'm not from the Netherlands, I'm from Belgium. Can't really help you with getting housing. Prices depend a lot on where you're going to live.</br>  <br>Prepare to feel like a midget OP.</br>  <br>Gtfo dutch thread verrekte zot</br>  <br><br>i understand, thanks anyway m8<br><br><br><br> kankerhol <br><br>kek<br><br>does that mean cancer hole? if so i just doubled my dutch vocabulary<br><br>i cant choose, i got a job in rotterdam. every dutch says the same about it being shit, idk why, its the second biggest city in the country</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I just moved from there, to belgium.. :)  <br>this<br>and 1800 euros seems too much for rent, I did 1000 and rented a 2 story apartment in rotterdam</br></br>  also prepare for a shitton of brown people and kebab every corner  <br><br>i mean for living, thats the net salary im gonna get<br><br>i heard you cant get a solo flat straight away because you need proof of the last 3 months salary in order to rent, is that true?</br></br></br></br>  <br>One of the reasons i left the big cities..</br>  <br>It's an ugly city OP, it's like the Detroit of the Netherlands and it's probably highest in criminality. I guess if you really want the Dutch feel you're way better of in a city as Den Haag or yes Amsterdam. Could also consider Delft which is a nice city, but it's mostly just students there and not that much to do if you ain't a student. <br><br>PS Yeah kankerhol means cancer hole</br></br></br>  <br>not really, I mean maybe if you get it through estate agencies.<br>I got mine for a month from local help.</br></br>  <br>This could be true if you're doing it through official channels OP. You can probably sort something out though, we ain't that strict as long as you're considered trustworthy.</br>  <br>OP if ur gonna live there, check if your job is easily accessed through public transport, try to live as far as possible from the center, because its quiet expensive to live in big cities. Flatmates is a good start, maybe try to find a dutch person. this way you will learn the language alot easier, he also knows the way around the city. Knows where to go out, have dinner or go shopping etc.</br>  <br>Rotterdam huh, je wordt kapot hard geneukt in je aars door al die negers.</br>  <br>Welkom in België, Nederlandse vriend.</br>  <br><br>well, now i know 2 dutch words :p<br><br>that sounds very nice, but i tried to get a job in amsterdam and i couldnt yet, maybe later<br><br>im not a student but im 22 years old, also, rotterdam is a big city and probably has a university and many young ppl and all, i bet its not that bad. maybe 'highest in criminality' doesnt mean much in netherlands<br><br><br><br><br>thats nice thanks a lot /b/ros<br><br>about being trustworthy, well, im gonna have a 7 month contract as a web designer, 1800€ net a month<br><br>with that kind of money would you go for a solo flat or a room in a shared flat? maybe i dont want to live with room mates if rotterdam is truly a kanker hole</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Vlaanderen boven, jij vieze vuile kankerlijer.</br>  Also OP, I'm not sure how well this one works for Rotterdam, but you could join the Woningen te huur in Rotterdam fb group and make a post there. The Amsterdam one has a lot of updates, just be careful for cons.  <br><br>i dont really use facebook but thanks for your tip i will definitely consider</br></br>  <br>Waarom?</br>  <br>I am from Rotterdam. Lived here all my life. There are shitty neighbourhoods for sure, but they are the cheapest. Try to get some place with bus, tram or metro nearby if you dont have a car. Don't go and live in Rotterdam South. Its a shithole. People only go there for football and sometimes for the film theater or a mall, but the rest is shit. If you can for your budget try to live in Blijdorp or Bergpolder, try funda.nl if you want to go solo.</br>  <br>well you should be thanking him just saying for telling the truth, so wich shithole of a country are you from greece?</br>  <br>Krijg de tyfus gare kkmongool.</br>  LOL fuck rotterdam, i recommend you to move to Arnhem, Much better trust me.  <br>For €800/€900 you'll have a nice apartment on your own if you look around. Fuck flatmates. You'll spend about 10-12 euros a day on food/drinks on average. An calculate about 100-150 euros on top of your rent for Internet/electricity and shit. If you want to do flatmates you'll probably pay €500 max for rent for a nice place.</br>  <br> rotterdam <br>thats not the netherlands<br>enjoy living with somalians and morrocans<br>no but really u should consider living in any other place</br></br></br></br>  <br>kamernet.nl is probably the biggest site to find housing quickly.. it focusses on sharing flats and renting rooms</br>  <br>Shit, I think I just stepped on a kakkerlak.</br>  Are you really aiming for Rotterdam? I would go with The Hague or Delft  <br> &gt;Kamernet.nl <br><br>Kek<br><br>Just finished the middelbare kiddo?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>hahahahhaha ik ging kanker stuk</br>  <br>No retard, have you actually ever used the site</br>  <br>Thanks :)</br>  Btw OP, if you come to Eindhoven I'll give you a beer, my treat.  <br><br><br>Stay out you fucking foreigner</br></br></br>  <br>Kut land, fuck de verneukte overheid :) en belastingvoordelen!</br>  Well OP,<br><br>Dutch people are pretty direct and open about everything. They are very punctual aswell. I wouldn't recommend Rotterdam either. Try Delft, Den Haag or Amsterdam. If you consider going to the north, definetly pick Groningen.</br></br>  <br><br>it was bait m8 chill<br><br>spain</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>according to wikipedia:<br><br>Total: 619.879<br> Netherlands: 390,043<br> Suriname: 52,732<br> Turkey: 47,900<br> Morocco: 41,125<br> Netherlands Antilles: 22,972</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Voor betere politiek zou ik niet zo snel naar Belgie gaan ;)</br>  Hey /b/ro,<br><br>Rotterdam is a nice and great place, I've been living here since my birth and I think it's safe to say that its multicultural policy will help you fit in. Rotterdammers are mostly nice to foreigners, except for the undereducated shitheads. Have fun here man!</br></br>  Why going to Netherlands for only 1800 Euro's. I would stay in your own country..<br><br>Geez i wouldn't survive in the Netherlands with only 1800 net salary. And i even live in the north of Netherlands.<br><br>1800 in Rotterdam will not get u a good living.</br></br></br></br>  Waarom helpen we in vredesnaam een kanker buitenlander?

See my calculations of earlier. You'll have a decent apartment plus about 500 euro left per month to spend on other things than rent and food.</br>  <br>The hague has an important political building and the city there is really tough against criminality but they often mislead innocent people as criminals. They killed last week an innocent man now there areriots all over the hague. Rotterdam is really nice to live and alot of culture out there.</br>  <br><br><br>kanker godverdomme eens een keer op met deze kanker eeuwe oude kutfotos</br></br></br>  <br><br>it is enough but you'd want to earn more later</br></br>  <br> Je moeder</br>  <br>Last week a black dude (Netherlands Antilles tourist) was killed in Den Haag while resisting arrest. Arrest was filmed, put on internet and the police got blamed for death. Kebab youth has been using this situation to riot. The particular part of town had been a kebab problem for some time. The excuse is the black guy's death but I seriously doubt any of the rioters even care. They just want to kebab chimp out because 'muh culture not restecpa'. Fucking faggots. Been several days of riots though I believe it's been calming down. Surprised actually that this didn't got mentioned on 4chins before.</br>  <br>Greek detected</br>  <br>Last week this retard walked out of a park and looked at 4 cops. While passing them he said "what are you looking at, i hate your kind, watch out because i'll grab my pistol". When the cops heard pistol, they jumped him. Several eye witnesses have confirmed he said this. I have no sympathy for retards.</br>  <br>If you would've followed the news properly you would've known that the majority of the riots actually came from outside de schilderswijk and even outside of den haag gare kankerpauper.</br>  IK NEUK JULLIE ALLEMAAL DE KANKER MOEDER  <br>yeah because if you wanna shoot cops you sure as fuck warn them upfront right?<br><br>fucking retard<br><br>he was obviously retarded<br><br>the 5 cops handled badly but the biggest problem is sandniggers rioting in the hague<br><br>the 2 do not belong together btw, they riot because they are sandniggers, not because of the dead guy</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>*Rioters</br>  <br>First of all he wasnt black he was American. Second there was a documentary about the police in the hague they are litterly ruining peoples life. This isnt the first incident that happened and they always keep getting away with it. Now the hague had enough of it. Also the OM (police corp) lied about the death of the American and because of social media the OM was pressured and said finally the truth. The 5 agents are suspended till the investigations are done. This would never happen in rotterdam.</br>  Ik weet dat er meer van deze chick rondgaat, wie kan mij verblijden?  <br><br>thanks a lot /b/ro for this<br><br>there is also the problem that, admittedly, despite being 21, i have been living with my parents up until now (and until i go there), and i dont really know how to manage myself, let alone in the netherlands. <br><br>i should be able to since im not exactly a spoiled kid, but idk... would you consider getting renting a room at first, just to socialize and to use their help with stuff, besides the cheaper housing? or is that likely to make things worse? to be honest i have only heard about horrible experiences from people sharing flats tbh</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>As long as they fuck up the mudslime shitskins in De Schilderswijk the police is doing a great job<br><br>Schilderswijk is lost ground, just like Rotterdam<br><br>Its hardly Dutch anymore, Sharia Police runs the streets</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Uneducated Schilderswijk inhabitant detected. Je Engels is krommer dan m'n pik.</br>  <br>It's indeed just an excuse to riot. Police should be shooting with rubber bullets and actively disperse them. If that shit happened in my street i'd be beating ppl with baseball bats and protecting my property.<br><br>Filthy muslim scum</br></br></br>  <br>MOAR!</br>  <br>So because the majority are foreigners the police need to step up and take actions? Jij bent een kk racist.</br>    <br>Shitskin spotted<br><br>And yes they need to do it because it isnt the White dutch folks who riot, its the shitskin mudslime folks that riot<br><br>They fuck up our country because where Islam is there is destruction<br><br>All muslims deserve to be shot on sight</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>BUMP! Anon please be a hero!?</br></br>  <br>Blijf maar slapen. Wordt maar geneukt door het kanker systeem. Eindelijk staan mensen op ze zien in. En meeste rellers waren niet eens van schilderswijk.</br>  <br>Dutch accents are so cancer.</br>  <br>Just come to Eindhoven OP and I'll give you an integration quickcourse. Tbh I would just move on yourself, it isn't that hard you know. Just use your budget wisely and learn how to cook. If you don't want to do your own laundry go to a laundrette. Dutch people are overall friendly and open so you'll probably build up social contacts at your work quite fast. If not, just join some internationals meeting shit or something.</br>  <br>Het is een minderheid van de allochtonen dat relschoppen wat zoals allochtonen zoals ik dat hbo doen? Nooit in aanraking zijn gekomen met politie? Alsof ik nederland verneuk ik betaal rustig belasting alles. Smh. En val niemand lastig met mn geloof.</br>  <br>also its the sandniggers who are racist towards us</br>  Name one reason you're broke  my wife  I...i am not?  <br>Laziness is the main reason most people is broke.</br>  Heroin.  <br>Wrong asshole</br>  There are Americans who believe that 9/11 was not a "conspiracy". <br><br>REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEE</wbr></br></br>  OP u have no idea child   implying a fuckton of metal slamming against a concrete building isn't going to cause shit like this. why does it have to be bombs? is a plane crashing not enough?   <br>It Wasn't</br>  <br>You just need to think bigger.</br>    <br>how many buildings in your town or anywhere else (except 9/11) collapsed after a huge fire? zero!</br>  <br>I don't believe a plane would be enough. I don't believe two planes would be enough. Maybe from where it hit up, Maybe a little lower, But not two whole towers bring completely brought straight down into their base. <br><br>That being said I agree with that a lot of posters have been saying. That being who cares any more? It was well over a decade ago, They got the laws the wanted, They got the control they wanted, They got the war they wanted, finished said war, Fucked the economy well fucking proper. It's done. Even if you can somehow 100% prove to all Americunts without a doubt that it was planned do you really think they will even care any more? I think they'll just go back to watching x factor or whatever the fuck</br></br></br>  Wouldn't the pressure of all of that shit falling into itself cause stuff like that? <br><br>All that air being pushed out towards the bottom of the building</br></br>  <br>If you open your mind too much your brain is gonna fall out.</br>  <br>Nope.</br>  Secretly Obama is a shapeshifting lizard who's trying to gain control of america While drinking cool aid and singing russias album while disguisting the fact that he owns 2 major UFOs he flies around because he can transform to a space breathing alien with green skin colorings.<br><br>2much4me2handle</br></br>  <br><br>Yes it would if that was indeed what happened. It's a shitty piece of evidence. But at the same time it doesn't prove that it wasn't a controlled demolition.</br></br>   implying bait this poor will do the trick, why cant you try harder? why are you such a faggot?   <br>It's just overall a shitty piece of evidence that doesn't prove anything either way</br>  <br>This guy gets it</br>  <br>Nice illogical nonsense.</br>  <br>You should just stop. There's really no point in arguing with conspiracy nuts. CLEARLY it was aliens conspiring with the illuminati and using HAARP and chemtrails to trick is into thinking the buildings collapsed due to explosives and that the government wants us to believe it was terrorists.
