You sound like my mate. We call him nigger all the time, yet obviously don't give a shit, 'cause he is just a nice guy. But see it the same as calling a ginger person, ginger. But the only people I have seen genuinely give him shit about racism were other black guys, saying he is betraying his race by being friends with us white boys and shit like that. So is that the kind if shit you get, people saying your betraying your race, or is it more like, where like Indians and Pakistanis hate each other?</br>  <br>they would eat there own shit if they could afford sugar, oh wait!? im sure they can afford sugar by the fucking tons when 50 ( all in the same block of flats , mind you)of them are abusing the benefit system</br>  <br>a lot of my mates are indian, when a freshy doess ay im too white , I laugh in his fucking face and tell him to fuck off back to pakistan, I do meet retarded pakis like that bu they don't get to me , i'll usually outnumber hem anyway , no one takes a freshie who loves pakistan more than Britain seriously</br>  <br>Sheffield born and raised.

You are a dog born in a stable. When are you and your kind going to leave Britain?</br></br>  <br>are you proud to be British?</br>  <br>when they have fucking drained my land of money and resources and destroyed our culture by the looks of it mate </br>  <br>Pakistani American here. Is it true that pakistanis have the same reputation in britain as black people in america ? Aka low life bottom feeder</br>  <br>I know islam is shit, I've made many other muslims leave islam, I can understand why a lot of white people are angry especially when people are struggling to be employed and they see people abuse the benefits system, I understand, but i'm not superman , i can only change within my personal groups, I help make muslims around me a lot less religious, I've had to debate people who believe in sharia law all the time <br><br>that's like your opinion, man , and i'm not leaving <br><br>yes I am</br></br></br></br></br>  QMUL? what course?  <br>HA!

We don't have much of a nigger problem - though they are more than capable of chimping out - it's the muslims that mainly deal drugs and rape kids.</br>  <br>tell Tyrone to fan you to sleep</br>  I need to sleep but the fuckin heat  <br>Drunk guy again. So do you practice in any for of religion? May have been asked, but seriously the longer this goes on the drunker I am getting. Also you know where Asian communities seem to all cling together, like Bradford or Birmingham, do you think that's a good idea? Like when Brits go to Spain and they seem to live in a community where there's British pubs an to me it just all seems stupid. I always think, just go for it, Britain isn't exactly great but immerse yourself in it if you're there... I'll be honest I have kind of forgotten what the hell I was talking about.</br>  <br>Tyrone got caught by the rozzers despite his excuse he dindu nuffin</br>  <br>Strange that, considering that the Falkland Islands were British before Argentina even existed as a proper country.</br>  <br>What's your bench?<br>Do you say 'bruv'?</br></br>  Last one, the burqua or however you spell it, <br>Religious belief?<br>A way or expressing religious views?<br>Or a fuck you to the west?<br>Worn in Birmingham high St, not kubul.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>i was by the canal near dixy today enjoying the sun lol<br>hope exams went well and mysis messing up didn't stress you out too much - enjoy being grilled by these guys and maybe see you in drapers for freshers haha</br></br></br>  <br>No I was just trying to convey how my spelling would be if I wasn't so hammered. So praise be to the squiggly red like! I SAID PRAISE THE SQUIGGLY RED LINE!</br>  Well paki, you seem sound as fuck to me, mate.  <br>I live in a mixed community with many white, black, asian people, I'd prefer for communities with high levels of just Muslim families to be dispersed away from one another, if you let them house together they will make the street look and smell like pakistan all over again <br><br>I don't say bruv, bruv <br><br>women who wear that shit look like ninjas <br><br>good luck with you results bro <br><br>cheers mate</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you feel the lightning strikes near you? It is fucking scary here.</br>  <br><br>It's not an opinion. Being British is about heritage, not being born into a muslim family and growing up here. By calling yourself British, you are trying to devalue my heritage and my culture. I do not want a so called multicultural Britain.</br></br>  <br>Where in UK are you?</br>  <br>East London</br>  Fair play to you, western paki,<br>Good and bad in every race, just seems yours has got a long way to go. Integrate, and get on with been British, and the rest can fuck off to Syria!</br>  <br>Do you think the UK has a serious problem with racism?<br><br>What do you think of Niggers?<br><br>What do you think of ISIS?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Drunk guy again. Nothing to ask. I'm just... well I am drunk. Need bed or to drink a bit more 'til I wake up on the sofa tomorrow. Either way, take care of yourself, you seem an alright guy. Lots of love. The drunken Northern white boy.</br>  <br>In that sense so are the white Britons<br>Every bloodline migrated at some point from Africa. <br>Having a sense of pride because you was randomly born somewhere is a fucking joke, you are no more British than a Muslim who was born in the country you self entitled cunt</br></br></br>  <br>the UK does not have a serious problem with racism <br>niggers or black men? niggers are shit but I have enough black friends who are cool <br>Fuck isis <br><br>take care drunken white boy <br><br>thank you</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't understand why you hate Islam personally. Another British Paki here btw</br>  <br><br>OP is from London, anyone who can't get a job in London is a fucking retard. <br><br>You can always do *something*<br><br>No excuse for sitting on benefits if you live in London. Might be different round your way though</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>South East here bud, I've got plenty of minority friends. And It literally makes my blood boil the amount of racism and stupidity that goes round. <br><br>It's understandable, stupid people don't understand the idea of generalizing and normally consider it a good guy, bad guy scenario. <br><br>As I said, plenty of minority friends. Now I'm atheist myself, I absolutely hate religion, but of course, humans must remain tolerant to eachother before we wipe eachother out. <br><br>I've got a question, my Muslim friend cherry picks his religion to a huge extent, he doubts his faith loads, the only reason he doesn't say hey you know what, i'm not sure I want to be Muslim anymore is his family. He said his family would openly shun him if he leaves his faith, is that common throughout the Muslim community?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Respect to you and yours buddy. I've studied and worked with loads of British Pakistanis and you seem like a pretty cool bunch. Smart, work hard, family oriented. Most make a contribution to British society which outweighs any of the problems that come with integration.<br><br>Blacks in our cities are another matter, though.</br></br></br>  <br><br> my family is loosely muslim, I'm not <br><br>Im not a fuckin muslim either, my parents don't give a shit about religion also but I still live in fucking Turkey. jealous of you. being a non muslim in a muslim country even in Turkey sucks.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>OP sounds like a nice guy. I used to live near Bethnal Green, lots of muzzies round there. I liked it there, felt more intimidated by the skinhead EDF types that used to protest outside the mosque than I ever did with Muslims<br><br>Some of the shops had signs in the window saying "ISIS - not in our name" which was pretty cool<br><br>Asian women are so hot. But hard as fuck to pull</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>who are you? morrissey??</br></br>  <br>I dislike religion in general, within islam i find people defend the prophet fuckin a 9 year old , so islam does get props for how shit a faith it is <br><br>If i was you I would have real heart to heart convo with him and bring up the problems with taking a book a peasant wrote in a cave seriously in the 21st century <br><br>I think judging any group as a whole is a bad idea , I always get proven wrong , I was raised in a somwewhat anti Semitic upbringing because of my uncles, and when I met a jew the dude was like me , if i was born jewish , so I think theres the good and bad in every group <br><br>tell them you're a sufi and you have your own relationship with allah <br><br>I lived round bethnal geen once too , shit tons of Bangladeshis who hate pakis</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> my Muslim friend cherry picks his religion to a huge extent <br><br>Christians do that a lot too. If we followed every rule in the bible England would look like Saudi Arabia. The Bible has some right mental shit in it</br></br></br></br>  ill just leave this here, dont bother responding cause i wont be here  <br><br>well duhhh errbody knows that tell us sumpin we don't know</br></br>  Drawthread.  <br>go away, anon</br>  Heyo thread, what's up?  don't worry, i didn't get lost  2 loli kissing  Reposting delivery from last thread.<br><br>I´m still taking non-lewd requests.</br></br>  <br>Nope.</br>  <br>Thats hot, gj man</br>  <br>you eating ice cream, ice cream headache, bluish blush and upset face about it</br>  <br>Sup.<br><br>Rate my Marc fanart?</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah.

If it helps you have the net, you can pull up a reference picture to help you beings as you're trying to draw Solaire. Practice using lightly sketched shapes to make the shape, then going back in and filling details over them then erasing the unnecessary lines. Frames also help for body placement. These are tips I can give, though I do not necessarily follow them myself.

You flamed him for claiming it was oc.</br>  <br>This is fucking cringe...</br>  <br>name?</br>  <br>Why is it too soon?</br>  What watch are you wearing /b/<br><br>So then, I've been in the market for a Rolex for a while now, I've been an enthusiast for quite a while now, mainly window shopping and such, but recently I have made my mind up, and I'm going to buy a Rolex for myself on my birthday which is coming up in 3 months. I've decided on the Datejust 16233 model, however I can't decide what color combinations to go with, all steel, two tone, blue face, black face, diamond hour markers, or gold hour markers. Maybe some of you idiots have some insight. I've been leaning towards the Datejust 16233 two tone with a black dial with gold hour markers. Any suggestions?</br></br>  <br><br> spending more than $10 on a watch </br></br>  Core.  <br>A Rolex watch is artwork, a status symbol, and also an investment. If you're going to buy a Rolex just to tell time then you are better buying a $10 watch.</br>  <br><br>When I look back on my life when I'm old as fuck I think I'll be pretty glad that I never bought a watch that could pay off a small mortgage.<br><br>What a waste of resources on everyone's part. I don't deny that they're elegantly crafted, and maybe it is a form of artistic expression for those that make them, but holy shit, spend money on something that does something other than show your "status." What an absolute waste.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I guess you don't share the same appreciation I do for the brand. What else would you spend your money on?</br>  <br> enthusiast <br> still buying a rolex </br></br>  <br><br> What else would you spend your money on? <br><br>Provided I had incredible finances that could do far more than support my basic needs and comfortable living? Spend money on things that both interest me and allow me to create. I would probably get myself a small art studio, or maybe invest in some machining equipment; lathe, mill, CNC, and start a small machine shop. Maybe a nice little boat if I'm near some water. Certainly not a small complex chunk of metal that spins two little hands around a dial.</br></br></br></br>  Back to /fa/ with ya, heeb  <br>I think that you are under the impression that all Rolexes cost $50,000. The watch Im in the market for is about $4000</br>  <br><br>The answer still applies though; something pertinent to my interests. An object or place that allows me to do something more, not just something that goes on my body to make women's vaginas get marginally more damp.</br></br>  Breitling Navitimer bitches, 21st birthday gift.  <br><br>Gift from a friend a while ago.</br></br>  <br>Currently wearing my pic related Sea Dweller 16600.<br><br>As for your Datejust options... they are pretty subjective.

Either SS or full white/yellow gold if you ask me.</br></br></br></br>  Got this Invicta watch only because i wanted to use it as a watch and because it looked reliable, but looking at other Rolex watches i feel that this one is just a shitty copy, it did some with warranty etc within its case but I'm not sure what to think of it. <br>It works great and does the job but it really does look like a copy of a Rolex, any thoughts?</br>  <br>Bro. I have that exact watch but with Diamond hour markers.</br>  <br>Rolex is an investment like a diamond is an investment.<br><br>Tell you what....check ebay and see how much used Rolex's have appreciated.</br></br></br>  So many fake watches  <br> I also agree about two-tone being pretty nasty on any model watch.

I got carried away.<br><br> Either SS or full white/yellow gold if you ask me. <br><br>I could take any of those. The solid gold is a bit over the top, but if someone can pull it off, more power to them. I wouldn't pay retail for one, though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>how gay are you? like sparkly diamonds?</br>  <br>change the strap for god's sake</br>  <br>this guy knows</br>  <br>no worries /b/ro<br><br>I agree the Precious metal watches are ridiculously priced.

An 18K sub costs exponentially more than a SS model even though it only has a couple grand of gold if you melted it down <br><br>this. It's criminal the premium that Rolex gets for the precious metals watches. If I were pulling in 250k a year, well, you only live once, why not, but if I had to consider the cost, I'd buy used. The depreciation once you get out of the store is horrendous. <br><br>That said, they're real lookers. Too flash for me, but if I were in sales or something...</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You obviously aren't well versed on vintage Rolex pieces... Most vintage models (30+ years old) are going for way more than they cost new even accounting for inflation...<br><br>Look up what a vintage Daytona, Submariner, Sea Dweller, Milgauss are going for! Some are well into 6 figures now</br></br></br>  <br>It really depends on the model, man. Watch values aren't as cookie cutter as you might think.

Garbage quartz movement Tags hold up surprisingly well in the secondary market. <br><br>Aspirational mid tier crap. If you're in college, early 20's, it shows you know nothing about watches. <br><br>Now go get that oh-so-original submariner. <br><br>Maybe at least consider doing it right, and get the no date, huh?

Some are but many are not. But yeah maybe if you are talking about re-sale in 30 to 40 years it might be worth more, or it might not. Its a nice watch but to call it an investment is a bit much.</br>  <br>I will never buy a Rolex again! Had ond, a cheap model, in two years I had to repair it seven or eight times, it just stopped working. I threw it away, and never again will I buy one of those lousy watches.</br>  <br>bought my rolex for £3.5k and have been offered £4k cash within less than a year. Your wagecuck logic is pitiful. stay pleb.</br>  <br> things that never happened </br>  <br>I have the exact same one</br>  Deepsea Sea-Dweller  <br> "cheap" <br><br>well there's your problem</br></br></br>  <br>By no means am I saying that a modern Sub will be priceless in 30 years... just a comment to another poster who said "used watches will always sell for less than a new one"<br><br>Thing about Rolex though is they dont radically change their design so the models are never "out of style". So its safe to say the submariner 30 years from now will look damn similar if not identical to a current one. And since Rolex has been increasing the MSRP on their watches steadily every couple years (well in advance of any inflation)<br><br>Its a safe bet that if you bought a Sub at MSRP today, you will probably be able to sell it 10,15 or 20 years from now and at least break even if not come out a bit ahead. Not many other luxury items or watches carry this distinction</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Even a cheap Rolex is more expensive than lots of other watches, and should therefore be better. Rolex is the shit. My experience.</br></br>  <br>please.<br><br>What will it cost you to service a Rolex for 30 years? Don't forget to include that.<br><br>Oh, I know, you have a great independent watch shop that's just as good as Rolex servicing that does it for tree-fiddy.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>For example the two Rolexes I own... a 16710 Pepsi and a 16600 SD were both purchased about 10 years ago for right around $5K each. Today the Pepsi and SD will easily fetch that if not a bit more.<br><br>So If I were to decide to sell either or both I could get all of my money back and then some... basically 10 years of Rolex ownership and enjoyment for free (minus the pesky $500 services they have both gotten)</br></br></br>  <br>dat lume</br>  <br>Movement service from a good independent watchmaker with a Rolex parts account is about $500. And the recommended interval is 5 years, though many owners will go 10+ without ill effect. Modern synthetic lubricants in the movements mean they can go much longer without maintenance</br>  I have a GMT master II red and black. bought it when I was 18, worked my ass off for that watch! 23 now and it looks brand new, never serviced it and I have been quoted by numerous people for prices higher than what I payed, if you like to save money but hate seeing it doing nothing and want to spend it without losing your money buy a rolex. A non depreciating if not slightly appreciating asset, they show wealth, class and good taste. best thing I ever bought. By way of real logic and mathematics its the cheapest watch you'll ever buy...  <br>I have the 16710 /b/ro :D but mine is "cola" red and black.</br>  <br>This guy knows whatsup!<br><br>My GMT hasnt been serviced in about 6 years and it still works perfectly, and maintains the swiss chronometer standard -4+6 seconds per day</br></br></br>  <br>I spent more than 10$ on watches. <br>I still love you for making the watch autists butthurt. <br><br><br> investment <br>Yeah nah, nigger, not every god damn regular rolex is an investment.<br>Also a lot of watch collectors say that the rolex bubble will burst soon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thats a great watch! Heres my Pepsi</br>  <br><br>ooopss, wrong photo XD</br></br>  <br> status symbol <br> douchebag symbol <br><br>Corrected.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd never call a Rolex purchase an investment (unless were talking a good deal on a vintage Red Sub or Daytona or something along those lines)<br><br>If you want to spend a few grand on a nice watch though it is certainly your best bet brand wise to get most of if not all your money back in the future should you ever decide to sell. (especially if you buy it smart and get a deal on a preowned model with all boxes/ paperwork)</br></br></br>  No battery atm.  Casio socialist watch  <br> Yeah nah, nigger, not every god damn regular rolex is an investment. <br> Also a lot of watch collectors say that the rolex bubble will burst soon. <br><br>"investment" is pleb/salesperson talk. They make millions of these a year in factories. <br><br><br><br><br>OK, you got me. Now wear it swimming and tell me how well it works. Oh, are the seals "modern" now, like the lubricants?<br><br>You're not including tax, servicing, inflation, depreciation and risk for dings or theft.<br><br>Nice watch? Not my style, but it's still a Rolex. Investment? no.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  @625222746 nice trips!  Here is mine  <br>Granted I wouldnt dive with my Rolexes without an annual pressure check... but I jump in the pool and ocean all the time for a swim with my SD and GMT with zero issues. :)</br>  <br>that's fake</br>  <br>stunning</br>  <br>have exactly that samewatch, and those same fucking socks.</br>  Jialilei "TV" Style watch<br>Bought it for $2</br>  <br>jelly pleb? jelly pleb.</br>  <br>Thanks for correcting. Yeah, vintage models sometimes go for crazy prices (for a rolex). <br>But i like the vintage ones way more than the gaudy newer ones. With alls those <br> qr codes <br> engravings <br> writings <br>All that just to proove that it's not fake. <br>Really makes the watch ugly. <br><br>Also<br>I will never drop so much money on a watch, shit's to expensive, for an unoriginal design. <br>I'd rather get the Steinhart ocean vintage one.

The movement is pretty bad, apparently</br>    <br>lol, a rolex knock off?</br>  dive watches. because I scuba dive.  OP here, thought the thread died a long time ago, I feel the two tone can be multipurpose, whereas the SS is viewed as more modern and less dressy however can be dressed up, the two tone, is very versatile as well and look a bit more sharp and more suited towards a businessman. I'm leaning in the direction of a black dial with gold markers and two tone jubilee, but idk yet.  <br>that date magnifier is atrocious</br>  Of course /b/ would be full of ill fitting rolex replicas and other over-priced garbage imitation...

It's been a struggle since my teens. Ive looked at pornography and felt lust towards men etc.<br><br>I'm currently in a program to remove these feelings. I've connected to another guy in the program, and we support eachother a lot.<br><br>However, i fear he is starting to relapse into homosexuality. Last night he confessed over the phone he was masturbating to thinking about men.<br><br>tl:dr I'm afraid he is planning to destroy all the progress Ive made by trying to seduce me.<br><br>wat do /b/, do i have to sever the unhealthy leg in order for the body to heal?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  It's time for you to "connect" with him in a whole new way  <br>It doesn't matter what you do, deep down you will still be a homosexual and until you let that out you will never be happy. Unless your home town is occupied by ISIS you should just get it off your chest,</br>  <br>You need more women</br>  <br>This x50 stop living a lie and go fuck what you want</br>  <br><br>No, I'm a man who just had some problems.<br><br>I learned that boys who dont see their dads a lot growing up might become gay. It's just that I lacked a male rolemodel in my younger years.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It still looks as though you are running away. Why can't you just be who you want to be?</br>  <br> Why can't you just be who you want to be <br>That's what I'm doing. I dont feel same sex attraction is me. I know it's a mental condition that I don't need. It makes me depressed not being right in the head, so I really want to cure it.</br></br>  <br>How many years are you going to lie to yourself and accept bullshit "psychology"? When you're an old man and you've been living a lie your whole life, don't you think you'll look back and wish you'd done things differently?</br>  <br>I dont think it will be easy to battle a mental condition, but hopefully I will succeed. Then I will look back and be happy that I managed to overcome it.</br>  <br>Everyone who claims to have "overcome" gayness goes back. It's not something you can "cure." And really? There's nothing wrong with it. You don't have to be ashamed.</br>  <br>So youre trans straight? Lol!<br><br>Why not just be prude and jack off to men in private? What about women is so necessary in your life?</br></br></br>  <br>Well, God in fact did create Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve. I think in order to live a full life, I need to live to my full potential. And if I have same sex attraction due to some childhood trauma, I should look into sorting out my problems.</br>  <br>I'm not trans, I've just been confused.</br>  <br>Gods not real. Its doesnt matter how straight can become. As long as you believe in ancient feel good hippie bullshit, you will always have problems.</br>  <br> Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve <br>Tell me you're joking.<br><br> if I have same sex attraction due to some childhood trauma <br>Wouldn't you know if you had childhood trauma? You don't need someone poking around in your head, trying to find an event to blame your feelings on.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Gods not real <br>Care to prove that statement?</br></br>  <br><br>You do know that God created Eve only after Adam fucked all the animals first and couldn't find one he liked?</br></br>  <br><br>If God was real, you wouldn't post breasts because that will send you to hell. But you do post them because you know nothing bad will happen. Therefor, there is no God.</br></br>  <br> Wouldn't you know if you had childhood trauma? <br>Well, we've discussed this a bit, and I think as a kid my dad wasnt always around, and he was working a lot. So staying with my mom I lack a male rolemodel, which might have made me prone to finding males to bond with in a sexual way. It's really just a fluke I have to straighten out in order to become normal.</br></br>  <br>kek</br>  <br>Dont fight the feeling</br>  <br>Never heard that story.<br><br><br>my counsellor advises me to look at straight porn to discover my lust for the female body.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Or maybe you just like men, and it's perfectly normal</br>  <br>God created breasts amd it's our duty to cherish and enjoy all of gods creation</br>  <br>Just be bisexual then. That's what I am. There is no problem with having fun man. Being 100% straight is not possible, so there is no real way to shut off the gay. You like what you like man. Period.</br>  <br> my counsellor advises me to look at straight porn to discover my lust for the female body. <br>So he's trying to get you into one "sin" to stop another? Who is he to say that heterosexual lust is worse than homosexual? Does he have verses to back this up?</br></br>  <br>Just learn to keep your gay shit on the super-low and pretend to be straight like all of your counselors are doing</br>  <br>THIS lol</br>  <br>No, I know what is right, and I know what I want. I want a normal life with a woman and a family. The gay alternative will not lead to anything good.</br>  <br> my counsellor advises me to look at straight porn to discover my lust for the female body. <br>Sure, but there is no changing what you like if you like cock bro</br></br>  <br><br>Genesis 2:18-20</br></br>  <br>Dude. You're gay. Just accept it, move on, and don't give a shit about the haters.</br>  <br> implying you can't have a normal life with a man and a family </br>  <br>why do you think being gay is bad? Do you even like women at all? Be true to yourself</br>  <br>Correct me if I am incorrect but does straight porn consist of a man and a woman? how do we know you won't spend it watching dick?</br>  <br>This. OP, you'd better restrict yourself to lesbian porn from now on.</br>  <br>Bisexuality isnt something I want. When I enter a relationship with a woman, she must have my fill attention.<br><br><br>Dude, dont make this into a religious debate. I really just want to get rid of my same sex attraction.<br><br><br>My counselors are all straight. Some of them are even married.<br><br><br>At times I can feel I conquered large parts of my same sex attraction, and a homosexual picture will disgust me instead of arousing me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So you're trying not to be gay and your solution is to hang out with a bunch of guys talking about gay shit?<br><br>Sounds pretty gay. <br><br>Stop talking to a bunch of faggots about gay sex and cocks. <br><br>Go talk to some girls and try to have sex with them,.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>become trans. then you can love men without looking gay.</br>  <br> My counselors are all straight. Some of them are even married. <br>They probably still suck dick on the side</br></br>  <br>He can't because homosexuality is wrong.</br>  <br> My counselors are all straight. <br><br> My counselors are all straight. <br><br> My counselors are all straight. <br><br> My counselors are all straight. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  This is one one the dumbest things ive heard that may or may not be a troll. Your mental condition is that you think being homosexual is a mental condition, not the homosexuality itself  <br> and a homosexual picture will disgust me instead of arousing me. <br><br>really? this disgusts you hey?</br></br></br>  I'm guessing you're doing this for religious reasons?<br><br>I don't think it's healthy to suppress yourself like that. If you're legitimately gay just accept it and learn to love yourself. Do you think that one day you'll just stop feeling intimate towards men? I doubt it will happen, sorry.<br><br>If it's because of your parents saying they'll exile you then just tell your dick to shut the fuck up and finish it until you can get away from them. Don't make it worse by throwing it in their face.
