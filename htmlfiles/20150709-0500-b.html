[ remember when /b was awesome?  <br>No</br>  I have a lot of matches but I'm not sure how to start conversations with them. Give me your best opener lines niggers.  <br>You're dad must be an asshole because you are the shit. GG /thread</br>  pussy wet?  <br>Dayum.</br>  <br>just say: "Hi, do you want to talk about jesus? you will die if dont"</br>  I found that <br>"What's up, mind if i take the lead?" works pretty well</br>  Just say 'Hey, you're hot and I want to stick my large erect throbbing cock inside your soaking moist hole' she cant say no to that its tinder  <br>90% of them have will unmatch if you are rude or some shit on their bio</br>  <br>girl once unmatched me for calling her dad a mexiCUNT</br>  <br>She clearly has no sense of humour</br>  Hi I'm Jared have a collection of kiddie porn, would you be interested in a foot long or 6" meatballs sandwich  <br>Roll</br>  <br>Reroll</br>  <br>Rolz</br>  <br>Terolz</br>  <br>Rerolz</br>  <br>kekrolzz</br>  <br>I like this</br>  I normally start with Hey they say hey back I ask how they're doing and they ask the same. But then unless they take control of the conversation which 1/10 do I am not sure what to say next.  <br>Do you work with dogs or horses?</br>  R U the gurl from the Logo?<br>Caus ur supahot</br>  <br>r u car, because</br>  <br>Rerollz</br>  "Bad pickup line or cheesy joke? The choice is yours" works for me EVERY time because they immediately think youre this friendly, quirky guy. If they pick the pickup line, you know theyre interested in you sexually already.  Hi I'm Jared, I like little boys, would like to see my kiddie porn collection over dinner, what do you prefer foot long or 6" long sandwich  here is the plan: wait until she messages you, then ignore for a few hours, assert dominance and authority, remember you want to be the one in power. Then reply with just 'hey' and let her do the talking, trick her into thinking she actually wants you. The more you neglect the convo the more she will come crawling back, begging for more.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;6266220 <br>I'm gunna use this. Thanks for the future pussy anon</br>  <br>Pretty good anon I'll try this</br>  <br>lol @ this red pill garbage. Have a real conversation with her.</br>  OP. This line has worked for me nearly every time. <br><br>"Does this mean we are dating now? :D"<br><br>Its not aggressive, not ask8ng for tits like a beta and most think its hilarious. It has led to many conversations and I promise will work. Godspeed OP</br></br></br></br>  <br>i will be honest, that sounds horrific. seems like it could never work, terrible use of ':D' and your implying your dating which is a big turn off. this is a no go in my opinion, creepy and childish</br>  I have gotten 4 phone numbers with this opener:<br><br> she messages first (always) <br> Greetings, these are dark times <br> My planet shrekkan IV is under attack. <br> Only you can save us with your prayers. <br><br>9/10 reply with lol your funny/crazy<br>1/10 Actually roleplay along. Maximum kek assured.<br><br>general info: got 200 matches, live in Holland</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Wht the fuck would you talk to a match?<br>Just fire them up and stuck them up your anus nignog.</br>  <br>My sister showed someone who wrote that exact line to her. We both laughed at it. Does not work every time.</br>  <br>The one that has got most responeses in for me is "Pancakes or waffles?"<br>Usually gets the convo going</br></br>  A simple 'hey' is best, opening lines/pickup lines are overused and come off as try hard. just short back to back small talk for the start, then work your way up  <br>wow. you got game.</br>  <br> W T F </br>  <br> A simple 'hey' is best <br>If you think this then don't be surprised when you get immediately unmatched or ignored. How many other guys do you think send that exact thing? It garners no interest, offers nothing new, and can only be responded to with another greeting. Plus a single meek "hey" is as beta as it get's.</br></br>  <br>No no the trick to getting lady's is just being a complete asshat to everyone in fact if you get into a fistfight and win while on a date you will get laid</br>  <br>I know really. Although the one time I actually tried and just added her on sc I did get laid.</br>  <br>Cringe<br>I usually open with "got an important question before this goes any further"<br><br>It gets their attention, then I usually ask them bout pizza, then after that if they wanna get pizza.<br><br>Everyone likes pizza so it works pretty much every time</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this is bait</br>  <br>Tell them youre a top tier paladin in world of warcraft. It always worked for me.</br>  <br>how many guys will send cheesy pickup lines/clever opening lines. hey is perfectly fine to start a convo, and besides if she has matched with you she will find you attractive enough you don't need to create these ingenious openers</br>  <br>A simple hey works but only if you're super fuckable.</br>  <br>wanna challenge me in twister nude?<br>if i win i get to make love to you and if i lose i will give you a full body massage<br><br>-<br><br>btw, how do you even win in twister?<br><br>-<br><br>and i dont even have twister so it would go straight to love making<br><br>-<br><br>we can also just have wild sex if you dont want to get your feelings involved, im up to both of them</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But I'm a druid <br>Do i throw in that I'm diamond on lol master?</br></br>  <br>I didn't say you had to drop some cringey PUA-tier line, but a single "hey" isn't shit. The first message you send is your only opportunity to make a first impression, and when you send "hey" it makes you seem bland and boring. Shit, even "What's up?" is a better first message. "Hey" is unconfident, unimaginative, and unoriginal and you deserve all the lonliness and blueballs that will result.</br>  <br>Kek</br>  <br><br>Godverdomme waarom verpest je het nou weer voor de rest</br></br>    You know what your scarf and I have in common? We both wrap around your neck and choke  "what's the craziest thing you've ever done? " ...OP ALWAYS start with a question. They won't reply unless they have motive  <br> these ingenious openers </br>  <br>i bet your hair smells like vanilla?<br><br>-<br><br>btw do you like to cycle?<br>(she answers yes or sometimes)<br><br>-<br><br>this is a weird question but can i have your bike seat i collect them<br><br>-<br><br>i have a full trophy case of them and one is lance armstrongs seat from the bike i cycled around the moon<br><br>-<br><br>i just thought it would be a good seat to have in my collections top shelf i could have such a pretty girls seat<br><br>-<br><br>alltho id probably get mad while watching it cus i know youve sat on it but never on me, so would you like to sit on me?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ok so.. Timmy, Annie, Tony, Dan and Lisa went to a movie theater and Timmy sat in the end of the row next to Dan who was sitting two seats away from Lisa right next to Tony so the question is.. would you like to sit on my face?</br>  <br>No joke, I use a variant of this one. Works pretty damn well.<br><br>"So we matched on here. That means we're married, right?"<br><br>If they say yeah (Which they usually do) then you ask them what we're doing for the honeymoon. They say some foreign place, I say we should start smaller. Burgers and making out in my car for a while.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>just send this to a girl and she invited me for a glass of wine</br>  half the girls on tinder are fake. i had one that was really into me and she turned out to be one of those sign up here to see my nude pic girls.  making my way down town....  <br><br><br>Seriously why the FUCK do you have to go through this shit??

I see you called someone a "faggot" I'm assuming you meant this jokingly, but I've been mulling this over in my head for several days and it does not sit right. Let me please (re)iterate you on this word. Not only does it aim hatred at a large group of people that I myself and many of my friends are a part of, the word has the power to tear down and undermine a fight that we have been fighting for decades. I don't know where you stand on the issue, but I'm assuming you value your rights to equality as a citizen of this country. You may think that this is only a word, a mere configuration of letters, but this word is the foundation that keeps LGBT people held in the depths of inequality, while men like yourself toss around hateful slurs in a joking way thinking immaturely that you are immune to hurting anyone. This is not true. Next time you throw this word out (however jokingly and privately you may thing you are using this- in this era NOTHING is ever private), think about those who have struggled for the right to feel safe in their own country. The word "faggot" creates a hostile environment and makes many LGBT people feel unsafe around those who have enough power in society to use such words. Don't make me feel unsafe. I have a right to my safety. And although I have tremendous pride in being a mature, strong, bisexual woman, it really sucks when your words get in the way of my pride.
