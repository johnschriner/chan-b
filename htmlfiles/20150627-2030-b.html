Gay marriage is the gay's undoing.<br><br>Gays only exist because human culture basically has required people to get married and have children to survive.

So do not associate anal sex and homosexuality because lots of heteros do it too--are doing it this very minute.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I honestly can't believe you retards are so worked up over the gay marriage shit. That's not the real reason for this decision,how small you all have become. <br>Not one of you are smart enough to see this was a direct attack on the first amendment, and our constitution. Gay marriage doesn't matter, the fact that the church cannot discriminate who and who they can't marry anymore, and the fact the government now has the ability to regulate the church, through discrimination law.<br>That's why they were s adamant about rushing gay marriage through. It was the same reason the pushed for the Discrimination Act of 1963.</br></br></br>  <br><br>What is your point? Besides stating the obvious.</br></br>  <br>lesbians love anal sex.</br>  Here ya go buddy, map of countries with anti homosexuality laws. :3 hope it helps.  <br>Yeah except any sort of gay gene would have been one of the very first things evolution would've taken care of millions of years ago. Being gay is symptom of:<br>a)A coping mechanism for a trauma at some point in early life, even if you don't remember it.<br>b)Hormone disrupting chemicals in food/water<br>c)Mental illness<br><br>It's one thing to like the sensation of something up your ass, but to solely be attracted to your own sex just simply isn't natural.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Derr  <br>Not that you care, but sexual orientation is not passed down directly by genes; gay people are born in families with no history of it at all. Plus, even though there probably is some family component, it need not be directly parent-to-child; probably passes through siblings to nieces and nephews, so even if every homosexual person DID stop reproducing biologically, they aren't going away, sorry to tell you.</br>  First they take over the White House, SCOTUS, our landmarks, and next they'll take our freedom.  <br>Heh heh it's all coming together</br>  <br><br>People have a right to be happy after being repressed from their constitutional right to marry for decades. You know, civil rights and all that.</br></br>  <br>i'm gay and appreciate your support, but you might want to fact check that. america is only the 20th nation to legalize same sex marriage.</br>  <br> the real reason this passed in congress <br><br>Didn't pass in Congress; it was a Supreme Court decision.</br></br></br>    <br>This actually has nothing to do with the church at all. Nothing says churches have to perform marriages, straight or gay, to be recognized by the state.</br>  <br><br>This makes sense since the south always has been a bunch of faggots. Nice to see them come out of the closet finally.</br></br>  Jack: America, where all you have to do is complain and people start kissing your ass, and "white" people are afraid to go out on the streets because of the "backs" rioting because of "hate crimes" but the U.S is better than most other countries  <br>Why didn't we listen to Ben when we had the chance?

You are the victim of confirmation bias, meaning you only notice the "flamboyant" gays because you have decided that's the only kind there are.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Canada, they certainly don't have gay marriage.</br>  <br>NEVER FORGET!<br><br>how much we deserved it.</br></br></br>  Anybody gonna mention how this completely undermines the states ability to make their own decisions, in essence more power pulls from the federal govt? Most don't care because most are in favor of this, but what happens when another "super supreme court" decision undermines the states again for shit the majority doesn't want? Oh wait, I'm assuming checks and balances still exist. HA!  <br>To the point though; who cares? Not me.<br><br>Butthurt much? Lol</br></br></br>  <br>This person perhaps sees that there is a right way we could have done this, and a wrong way that the court decided to do. We didn't give them the power to legalize "same sex marriage", we have them the power to change definitions. Gay people don't have the same relationship as a straight couple. Marriage laws refer to males and females in a marriage, but there is no male in "gay marriages".</br>  <br>Even in Sparta the gay soldiers were expected to have wives just to have children. The point is that gayness emerged were it was basically had no choice but to be passed on to the children</br>  This was a horrible decision that marks, in many ways, the crumbling of the last of the checks and balances that made our nation a democratic republic. It's damaging enough that this administration is treating Executive Orders as if they were laws (they aren't), but the idea that a small panel of unelected, non-representational legal figures can dictate to the states how they are to behave represents the start of the total destruction of the legislative process. We now have a government that defies description, being a weird hodgepodge of autocracy, parliamentary democracy, and oligarchy.<br><br>What makes this so bitter is that the entire debate is based on a false premise, that is, that the government, whether federal or state, has any authority to dictate who can marry whom or in what way in the first place. They don't. Nowhere in the Constitution does it state that any branch of government has any authority to say anything about marriage at all. The majority opinions of the SCOTUS are flat wrong from a Constitutional standpoint; they quite literally made it all up.<br><br>Does anyone even know any more why marriage licenses were created in the first place? The fee for the license represented the salary compensating the Justice of the Peace for officiating the ceremony. It was an option implemented for anyone who was unable (or unwilling) to be married in a standard religious ceremony. A marriage license legally had nothing to do with making the marriage "legal". You could be married in a church by a minister for free and it was still viewed to be just as valid as it had always been.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're going to sit in your mom's basement like normal, you're going to cry and mope over everything and nothing is going to change. Grow up...</br>  <br>At 7-11</br>  <br> teen detected <br>Man you got some serious angst going on.</br></br>  <br>(cont)<br>At some point, however, the states realized this was yet another potential revenue stream, and so they decided that they would only recognize marriages that involved the purchase of a license from the state as "legal". This makes a marriage license, in essence, a tax (specifically it's yet another form of taxation without representation). You know how you can tell it's a tax? Because they penalize you for not buying one -- with taxation.<br><br>The entire concept of a marriage license being required to make a marriage legal is ridiculous. Marriage is and always has been a private contract. The only thing that a contract requires to be legally binding is that the signatory parties sign the contract before a witness. There is currently no form of private contract in the United States that requires a license to create and be recognized as legal other than a marriage.<br><br>The state (and the State) has absolutely no authority to dictate under what conditions or with whom you may form a private contract. You can form a private contract with anyone, for any reason. The only input the state should have on a marriage contract would be if there was a breach of that contract, and the dispute was then brought to court in a civil suit for the state to arbitrate, the same as any other contract. The entire argument around who gets marriage licenses under what circumstances is a complete fabrication. It assumes the state actually has the authority to restrict the formation of a marriage in the first place.<br><br>On the basis of this utterly fallacious argument, the Supreme Court has just gutted the ability of the people of the United States to demand any form of representational government.<br><br>Please note. I've said absolutely nothing up to this point about homosexual or heterosexual anything. That's utterly irrelevant to all the negative legal ramifications of this decision.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Uruguay. <br>Don't question it, just do it.</br></br>  <br>STOP BULLYING ME!!!<br>I WILL SEND SCOTUS FOR YOU AND YOUR GODS!!!<br>*runs away crying*</br></br></br>  <br>&lt;Insert any Middle eastern country here&gt;<br>Keep in mind that your probably going to end up beheaded or some shit. Price of Freedom</br></br>  <br>who<br>the fuck<br>gives a shit?<br><br>if you're straight, this doesnt change shit to you</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> America is officially destroyed once and for all <br><br>Why?<br>It's not like it has any effect on you.<br>They didn't ban straight marriage, did they?<br><br>And you're OP so you're a fag anyway.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  the fact that the church cannot discriminate who and who they can't marry anymore, and the fact the government now has the ability to regulate the church, through discrimination law. <br><br>Try again. The ruling was about CIVIL marriage. NO church or temple is or will be forced to perform a religious marriage to any couple that doesn't meet their religious standard. If you disagree, please find a single example where that has happened in any of the 37 states where same-sex marriage was already legal before today.<br><br>Some religions already have "odd" (apply only to them) rules on who can get married, and they are not forced to violate them. Many Catholic priests won't marry someone who has been divorced, without and "annulment"--still, that cannot stop that couple from getting a CIVIL marriage at City Hall, but the church is perfectly free to refuse to marry them in church.<br>Many conservative Jewish groups refuse to marry a Jew to a non-Jew. That's their right, but they can't stop the couple from going to the couthouse and getting a CIVIL marriage that would affect Social Security, taxes, etc. <br>Thus it will be with same-sex marraiges: no church will be mandated to perform a marriage, but at the same time, the church cannot interfere with that couple's right to have a LEGAL marriage for legal benefits and responsibilities (not having to testify against spouse in court, inheritance rights, hospital decisions, etc).<br><br>Please don't believe everything you hear Pat Robertson or Fox News say.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, OP should be very happy in any of these red countries. Have a good trip!</br>  <br> This actually has nothing to do with the church at all. Nothing says churches have to perform marriages, straight or gay, to be recognized by the state. <br><br>http://www.becketfund.org/wp-conten<wbr>t/uploads/2011/04/Same-Sex-Marriage<wbr>-and-State-Anti-Discrimination-Laws<wbr>-with-Appendices.pdf<br><br>Some light reading, it has everything to do with the state dictating church affairs through regulation</br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>What you wanna live out your anime fantasy in Japan now?</br>  <br>I don't understand how Asexuals are faggots that are hellbound.</br>  <br>lol</br>  Something to keep in mind.  <br>I suggest you read the reams of scientific research debunking almost every point you make.

It takes my own badgering, which I hate doing, to get them to hang out with me.<br>- I've been told that the reason my friends didn't like me at first was that I was depressing.<br>- I take a long time to get close to anyone, which doesn't help making any friends or any encounter with girls. <br>- I don't talk about my problems in real life, because either nobody cares or because I don't want to burden anyone with my problems.<br><br>I have a lot more stupid shit that hinders me, but those are off the top of my head.<br> &gt;inb4 stupid optimism </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Nothing? <br>Too many trap threads, I guess.</br>    Welcome to hell newfriend, try the pizza etc.<br><br><br>Go own and do it. Try. Drown yourself.

I don't want to cause others pain. <br> &gt;suicide causes others pain <br>I mean physical pain.</br></br></br>  <br> Deciding to kill yourself is not a rational/well-considered choice. You are having trouble making good decisions for yourself. <br> You have social problems. <br> You don't talk to anybody about your problems. <br>The obvious solution is to go see a shrink or someone else you can pay so that they listen to you bitch for a while.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think we're brothers op. So that means your not gonna be a faggot and die</br>  <br>Listen but not hear. Good plan.

I just don't have a proper outlet for my emotions. I can't even call a helpline without hanging up as soon as someone picks up.</br>  <br>Help lines are cheap. Start somewhere...<br><br>Psychologists are expensive and have a longer list of mental issues then yourself. (Expensive lols tbh)<br><br>I wouldn't recommend venting on people close to you. It's mentally draining for them and puts them in a morale grey area, and after a month they will think it's over - "she'll be right mate"...</br></br></br></br></br>   &gt;mistype the capcha, fuck you <br><br>Which enforces my idea of being a drain on the few friends I have. I will do anything for them, but I don't want them to bother with me. He's just feeling down, I hope they think.

I dreamed that a gay man hired a straight male battle-hardend prostitute to rub shit all over his body and fuck him, but instead of prostitute fucking the dude after the shit was rubbed on his body he instead shoved a heavy copper wire brush with a power drill attached to it up the guys ass and kept reversing the direction of the rotation so that the wires would stab the inside of his rectum. He then proceeded to take like 5 other pieces of copper wire and stabbed it through the gay guy's face while he moaned in agony.
