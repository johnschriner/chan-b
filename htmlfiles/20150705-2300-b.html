[ Any Greek fags here? Explain what you are going to do after your country defaults and you are more poor than Somalia.  <br>greekfag here<br>I am leaving to go vote now...<br>YES or NO?</br></br></br>  <br>Οτι θες μαγκα μου</br>  <br>σωραίος</br>  <br>Does it really matter?</br>  <br> implying ? </br>  <br>lel yes. Eurofags say NO means they gonna fuck us up.</br>  <br><br><br> Is property cheaper to buy now in mainland greece?</br></br></br>  install the drachma and you can have prince Phillip back ! !  <br>That's what, like €3.50?</br>  <br>lel they gonna print new drachma imbecile<br><br><br>not really checked... But it should be for eurofags if we default and go to drachma.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Νοt yet.Maybe tomorrow :)</br>  <br>Damn right scum. Bow down to the german masterrace!!!</br>  So what actually happens to a country if it goes bankrupt?  How does it feel, to be inferior to Yuros?  <br><br>Ask germans for money.</br></br>  <br> kek <br> greekfag here. </br></br>  <br>get drachma back, devaluate the drachma, export and live like a hobo for a few years</br>  <br>You need the currency to deapreciate in order to gain competitive edge and boost export! Euro is stuck, other eu won't let it go down, the only sure solution is another currency which can devalue and gain value once export is achieved. It shouldn't take long as greece.is a rich in resources country and have a shit ton to export! Goodluck /b/ro</br>  <br>Remember to pay debts, Greece!</br>  <br>how do I holiday in greece per 2 person for 600 eur?</br>  <br>In Greece's case, we'll have to print our own money,Drachmas, which will be extremely underrated in comparison to Euro.<br> rekt. </br></br>  One cannot rule britannia i want to come back home and rule you !!!!  <br>yeah and in the meantime pay liabilities in Euro</br>  <br>American here, i'll laugh at your poor ass and eat some fucking mcdonalds.</br>  <br>I could spend four days back in the day with that money.<br><br>Γαμήστε το κωλοευρώ, ψηφίστε ΌΧΙ.</br></br></br>  <br>Hhahahahahha,yeah right.</br>  <br>First of all all Public institutions wont get any pay... which means if the police firefighters airport staff etc. etc. wont work for free without pay everything will have to close down. The banks wont get any mones meaning there will be no fresh currence arriving in greece. after a few days prices should start to skyrocket... and then some major shit should start going down.</br>  <br>Τα λεμε στη σειρα για το γαλα και ταυγα μαγκα μου.</br>  <br>Cheap holidays incoming.</br>  Greece your country is fucking hilarious. You have forced national service to a government that's so shit it can't even keep from going broke, and your women are ugly as fuck. Why does anyone even stay there?  <br>well, a country is pretty much like a private buniess. It needs money to run every day activities and pay its employees. A bankrupt country would mean no police, hospital, schools or infrastructure, no one who is payed by the guv. has a job anymore. Worst thing is no one will borrow it money anymore bc it wont trust it since it did not fulfill its previous payments.</br>  <br>I am hyped for the chaos that will go down in greece... and for some real cheep hookers.</br>  Greece will come back even stronger when this shit is all over, but it will take years.  <br>Thats for sure but im afraid it will be embargo from EU countries towards Greece.<br>Hope not though.</br></br>  <br>Another type of export. Greece get the drachma back right in the tourist season and it should gain value fast! OXI!</br>  <br>Καλύτερα στη σειρά για αυγά παρά στη σειρά ποιός θα ρουφήξει περισσότερα γερμανικά καυλιά μάγκα μου.</br>  many, many years  <br>Yeah like hell it will, tell me how many times did they bankrupt in last 100 years? About 26?</br>  What can greekers export ?  <br>No way that will happen. Greece is part of nato, any embargo would let russia move in to fill the vacuum</br>  <br>Tax evasion. Would you like some?</br>  Why dont they just pay their fuckin taxes? and not work black all the time.. ffs  Vote WAR for Nike :^) go take your shit back from those filthy turks  When they default and the police eventually leave I assume it'll be fine to rape people right  In a series of unfortunate events the winner is made clear.

I remember once, when I was 14, my ex and I had planned our whole lives together. We were supposed to have fluffy dogs and a robot bartender and live in a huge mansion. I drew pictures of that mansion and that bartender daily and almost cried the first time she let me hold her hand. She meant everything to me. I called her every night before I went to sleep to tell her how much I loved her, and whenever I'd masturbate, I pictured her wearing only her training bra and half the time I wouldn't even finish because the thought of me being with her was satisfying enough. Then, one day, she called me and said that she was cheating on me with the entire cross country team. To this day, I'm still not sure how that's physically possible, but she did it. She now has 2 kids with 2 different men and I would still take her back if she'd have me. But alas, she won't return my nightly calls, and it seems the box of kittens I left on her porch were snatched by a hungry raccoon before she got home. But it's ok. Life goes on.</br>    go kill yourself cunt  <br> So that means we're still fucking then right? </br>  <br>Post this<br><br><br>Then this <br><br><br>Fag</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>WINRAR</br>  boards.4chan.org/b/thread/625938102<wbr></wbr>  <br>ayyy</br>  <br>rolling this <br><br><br>fuck this gay shit</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>kek</br></br>  <br>Roll</br>  <br>Oh, fuck me. gonna need a minute to type this out on my phone</br>  <br>Winrar</br>  <br>Rollin</br>  <br>HAH! 6 Winrar!</br>  <br>maybe copypasta?</br>  <br>summer v4.retard</br>  <br>double roll<br><br>what this means is that the next post is now invalid and is a roll for this post which is a roll for  <br><br>double roll</br></br></br></br></br>  She doesn't seem all that interested  <br>mate, longpress over a word in the post and then move the highlight sliders to cover the whole post.<br><br>Copy and paste <br><br>Fucking dumb nigger<br><br>Also great job ignoring the other winrars</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Ask her if she'll let you eat her asshole after she's taken a shit, so she won't have to wipe.

Never played but looks gay but at least 1/10  Because I got hit by honorbuddy banwave for 6 months. Now I have to fuck my wife for 4 more months...  <br>PvP is best it's been in so long.</br>  <br><br>because it's an expansion for WOW.</br></br>  it's nothing new whatsoever. There's a new continent but it's practically identical to every other new continent ever made, just with different names and monsters. Same boring quests, same retarded story. And if that's not enough to make you hate it, it has the fucking stupid addition that you can't fly.  <br> PvP is best it's been in so long. <br>Because nothing good has happened after Sunwell Plateau.</br></br>  <br>I'm quite sure I quoted the first post but on the other hand I'm quite drunk right now.</br>  Vanilla was great, Burning Crusade was great, Wrath of the Lich King was great, Cataclysm was da fuq, Pandaria was stop what are you doing Blizzard and Warlords of Draenor is a piece of shit facebook game.   Cost more for less content. <br> Patch content lasts two weeks at best before dying. <br> PvP worst it's ever been. <br> The lore has been absolutely butchered. <br> Two raid tiers instead of the usual three or four. <br> Dev team doubled, nothing to show for it. <br> Ham-fisted appearance of final boss. <br> Garrisons, 'nuff said. Made worse by shipyards. Weren't meant to be mandatory. Are mandatory. <br> Four difficulty levels of raiding. <br> Flying constantly put off from being introduced, then Blizzard had the gall to promote an in-game shop flying mount. <br> No Farahlorn, Tanaan pushed back from launch, then 6.1. <br> A patch with twitter integration and a lame selfie camera as the highlights. <br><br>It really has been terrible. So much marketing, so much development work (allegedly), and SO MUCH negative feedback from the community. And Blizzard continue to defend it tooth and nail (see: Ashran) and act like nothing's wrong. I get why from a marketing perspective (nobody wants to admit their product is terrible while it's the current flavour), but I honestly don't think they can talk up the next expansion as "the best thing ever in WoW" (like they always do) this time and have anyone really trust them to get it right.<br><br>Mark my words, they'll wait until WoD is done with until they come out and say it was bad (and they'll say it in a round-a-bout way, like "we acknowledge it had its shortcomings"), all the while promoting the fuck out of whatever comes next. But WoD still has a shelf-life of at least another 9 months at the bare minimum, and in that time Blizzard's reputation (at least as far as WoW is concerned) is going to get dragged through the mud by their own community.<br><br>This time, people won't come back.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  sounds like a bunch of butt hurt faggots who can't fly.  <br><br>Oh, I forgot to include, where the fuck is Wrathion and the Infinite Dragonflight that brought him, Kairoz and Garrosh to Draenor in the first place? Way to just fucking skip explaining those SIGNIFICANTLY IMPORTANT PLOTLINES Blizzard...</br></br>  Paid 50 fucking bucks and it was too painful to make it past Shadowmoon.<br>Fucking garrisons are shit<br>Same game nothing new but fucking selfies</br></br>  <br>I'm sure that'll all be covered in a novel.<br><br>Which is fucking retarded. The game's lore isn't even in the game itself.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Although I'd hate to admit, these are good points.</br></br>  <br>Faggots like you have said that about every expansion. People will keep playing WoW forever...</br>  <br>also 1ft three raid difficulties shares the same mechanics, so if you aren't full progressive raider, you are getting bored after two weeks.<br><br>inb4 unskilled n00b, i was in a full progress guild, but resigned, cuz this game is too boring right now to wipe 20 hours a week...</br></br></br>  I liked playing mistweaver before wod.<br>Too bad blizzard had other plans</br>  <br><br>You're probably right, and that really fucking irks me. Blizzard just want people to BUY BUY BUY, and so they put all the most important parts of the lore (or at least those that connect expansions) into novels.<br><br>I've never read a Warcraft book, I just read summaries. I've got a bookshelf full of actually good literature and fantasy novels, why the fuck would I waste time reading poor quality novels from an already mega-rich franchise, just so I can connect the dots that should be connected within the game? I refuse to have to pay more money to get more information. This isn't the fucking Church of Scientology, there are limits on how much of my money I'm willing to give to Blizzard for plot resolution.</br></br></br></br>   no content <br> continued to dumb down the game <br> even more single-player focused <br> didn't fix existing problems (dungeon finder, LFR, butchered Azeroth with flying, etc.) <br> Twitted and selfies, more IRL stuff that has nothing to do with the world <br> ability to buy gold, game slowly moving to f2p model <br><br>I played less and less since 3.3 and pretty much quit in cata, but was still coming back sometimes for a few months. WoD put the nail in the coffin.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>WoW has always been a case of "kill this dragon so you can get the gear you need to kill the next dragon", and the dragons never end, but when you're gearing up just to kill the SAME dragon 4 times (and the mechanics only change the 4th time), then yeah, fuck raiding.</br></br>  <br>best bait ive ever seen. /slow clap</br>  <br> have to do those fucking apexis dailies for half a fucking day, every day <br> mfw yesterday the bonus objective zones didn't even work properly and you couldn't finish half the quests </br></br>  <br>Poo story that will have the main nigga getting rekt and he escapes and goes hit up illidan and gives new class for expansion. You heard it here first folks. Gg</br>  <br>cata was better</br>  <br>all good points except<br> Flying constantly put off from being introduced, <br><br>holy shit do you faggots seriously care that much about flying?<br>I honestly didn't even notice it or found it annoying, I even keep forgetting that I could fly in azeroth and keep using my ground mount</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  Wrath of the Lich King was great <br>kekd hard³<br><br>after tbc everything was shitty as titty.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Professions being destroyed <br> some classes being utterly devastated (AKA arms warrior) <br> Bosses are shit, it's just avoid aoe and the fixate <br><br>Man, Blizzard lost the route after Cataclysm, Pandaria wasn't so bad tbh but I'm a casual gamer (less than 10 hours per week) so what do i know.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>as an arms warrior.. yes theyre fucking useless.. im forced to play glad stance with thunderfury cos anything else makes me cry blood</br>  Mythic content (Hellfire Citadel) is amazing, but I wouldn't expect you plebs playing it. You should probably stick with your pvp and mount farming  <br>pandaland Wasn't that bad it was for sure better then Cata and WoD</br>  i have never hated WoW as much as I do now, ever since the release of Tanaan Jungle. They couldnt have possibly made it any worse. The fucking place is full of glitches, and mobs are hitting like trucks. They have to realize that not everyone is in mythic gears, and that majority of WoW players are casuals. Lately I've been running around tanaan as Brewmaster because Windwalker (il 658) just simply wouldnt cut it if I get ganged up by 2 elites, or even fighting some rares.  <br> wotlk was great <br><br>you wrath babys dont realise that wrath ws thedownfall of the wow community.<br><br>panda shat all over cata and was n par with wrath, bc was only good cos it took 3 years to come out and was catered to the old community of hard workers.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Untrue man, I agree that Toc and ICC sucked hard but Ulduar and Naxx were pretty good Imo.<br>I really loved raid in Cataclysm and they tried hard to get better classes in Pandaria but then they dropped everything in draenor cause the vast majority of players is now underage kids with no clue to get "skilled", they want their loot right and now with little to no effort.<br>It's a videogame so "effort" is something overrated of course but all I'd ask to Blizz is to make a uber retarded spec and a "professional" spec. Nothing else. Grounding every class to 3-4 for spell is really shitty.</br></br></br>  <br><br>too busy getting laid</br></br>  <br><br>if you retards havent figured it out yet,wod is a short bridging expansion to introduce the burning legion back into the story.</br></br>  <br> rushed the game and content suffered for it, faralon cut. Last minute tanaan jungle removal <br> garrisons went from optional cosmetic feature to mandatory fun 60% of the game <br> unplayable launch. Personally I got on before the queue and never logged off till I was 100, but for others it was unreal login queues <br> pvp unplayable and ashran mandatory fun <br> store mounts overtaking ingame application. See fey dragons and laughing skull ravagers. <br> complete miscommunication from different devs. Ion and lore should be the only ones allowed to converse with the public <br><br>The good<br> raids are solid. Encounters are well designed save for a few <br> draenor looks fucking amazing <br> darker nights </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I quit 4 months ago because a lot of these points . The bait only works for so long. They supposedly have the largest dev team they have had in a while yet this expac has only 2 raid tiers , Facebook games , twitter, and a PvP zone that nobody really liked . All for the increased price of $70. <br><br> Always said only blizzard could kill WoW, well I think its happening</br></br></br>  <br><br>i started the expansion as arms, and it was dreadful. i hated every moment of it. I fucking hate weaving whirlwind into the rotation.<br><br>at least fury is still good, but prot is way to go, especially for tanaan. <br><br>still though, fuck 6.2, and fuck blizzard for making such a shitty expansion.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>they haven't let you fly since pandaria because it removes the exploration and adventure aspect of finding all the treasures and hidden parts. You will be able to fly soon</br>  <br>I liked Ulduar for the setting and the hard modes. Naxx was too simple imo.</br>  <br><br>they didnt let you fly mainly because you will run out of things to do too quickly, given the fact that this expansion was planned with only 2 big patches.<br><br>every other reasons were simply bullshits.</br></br></br></br>  <br>fucking normies, amirite?</br>  Only thing I enjoy doing in WoW now are mount runs  <br>Well Naxx was the first tier so it's supposed to be funny and entertaining, not super hard. That's why they introduced the concept of heroic and mythic. Even Bastion of Twilight was easy as fuck in normal mode, heroic was totally on another level.</br>  <br>True But other then Vanilla they first raids of Each Xpac have always been somewhat easier then the others</br>  Havent played since early cata, resubbed out of the blue since the movie is coming out next year.<br><br>Fucken love the story driven content. Also love that daily quests are not taking up all of my fucking time.</br></br>  <br>He's right, opening raids are not intended to be hard, When we were going for Server first naxx back in wrath most of us did the raid in bits and pieces of sunwell gear.</br>  Huh, didn't think of that until it was was mentioned, this is a severe time-line fuckup.<br><br>Like, everything we ever knew about Warcraft 1-2-and-3 and WoW made moot by the fact that we've fucking time traveled before the event that caused EVERYTHING to spiral out of control isn't being acknowledged by the fucking time-traveling dragon police? The ones that got prissy as shit from more minor (but significant) events in history like the "First Step to Arthas's Downfall", "The First Step to the New Horde", "The Battle for the World against Archimonde", "The Battle of the Fucking Ancients", and the "Opening of the Fucking Dark Fucking Portal" (which is even more of a fuck you because, again, this expansion made a fuck you to 'that').<br><br>I acknowledged "welp fuck this makes everything moot" but I completely forgot Marty McDragonflight's interest in this shit. Brought this expansion down a further notch.<br><br><br> Another food for thought: now that we've pulled a Back to the Future, is the next expansion going to be an Azeroth without any of the Fel changes? <br><br> also, Time Police <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=i0Z<wbr>r_C74DQU</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> love that dailly quests are not taking up all of my fucking time <br><br>lol</br></br></br>  i honostly like mop, i like the raids the legendary quest lines, and the fact the brought world pvp in timeless isles.  <br>yea they also fucked over enh shammys</br>  <br>I don't play wow, never have, but I heard this expansion was badass.</br>  <br>so youre a cata baby who quit n enjoying the even easier, shitter game?</br>  <br>same fag here again, there are also private servers.</br>  warlords is the best expansion over all the shitty ones like burning crusade garbage the fuck  <br>They fucked over every class and spec. Everyone has 3 or 4 spells and as long as you are spamming them you are ok. And that's ok for the LFR contents, still they should do something to recombine glyphs and talents and give you something back for your effort.<br>Give me back Cataclysm arms warrior, give me back wotlk affliction warlock and so on. Give us a spec that will be funny and not just 3 or 4 buttons.</br></br>  <br>Are you on drugs? I can solo mobs in Throne solo with ~660 mw monk. It is a "group" daily witch you can solo easily. <br>Whole WoD is shit, raids were fun doing first few clears. What the fuck did they do in 1+ year of SoO beats the shit out of me.</br></br>  <br><br>Because it is a game in the World of Warcraft series.</br></br>  Also, what was the point of Item squish? Tanks are already near the million hp, they crunched numbers and busted balls and now you are doing 30k dps with 400k HP, nonsense.  Locks are boring esp affliction. no curse spells or even shadow bolt to cast like wtf  they ruined my favorite macro<br>#showtooltip Bladestorm<br>/use Bloodbath<br>/use Bladestorm</br></br></br>  <br>Stat squish inc next expansion. They are just milking the cow, but the problem is, there are no good mmos to go to.</br>  <br> What the fuck did they do in 1+ year of SoO beats the shit out of me. <br><br>They fapped with their fingers go their asses while swimming around in money like scrooge McDuck</br></br></br>  <br>I'm a "wrath baby" and I totally agree that it was wow's downfall. It was the beginning of the end. It was the last time I had any fun playing the game. <br><br>Unrelated but sort of related, I started to develop a social life when wrath came out...</br></br></br>  <br>Well, some were good, but the flabby folds and fats that is WoW's power and influence makes it so difficult that they're only left with one choice:<br>Gamble and try to be like WoW, or gamble and stay unique.<br><br>No one has won yet.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Thank you so much. Ioved WoW, but pve past your level cap is fucking lame.<br><br>Gear to get gear to get gear</br></br></br>  <br>"Gear to get gear to get gear" - pretty much the point of pve wow. Unless you find their stories actually interesting enough to go through over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again.</br>  <br> the fucking time-traveling dragon police </br>  <br>PvP was fun. I miss AB so much.</br>  WoW<br> Kill that dragon <br> Grats, now kill the bigger dragon <br> Grats, now kill the bigger dragon <br> Grats, now kill the bigger dragon WITH FRIENDS <br>or<br> Grats, now kill people <br> Grats, now get items with bigger numbers to kill people <br> Grats, now get items with bigger numbers to kill people <br> Grats, you're maxed level <br> Grats, you're grinding SPECIFIC numbers for SPECIFIC Experience bars (reputation) <br> Why, you ask? For that sick mount! What? This isn't fun anymore? Here's an expansion! <br> Please scroll up to see how next expansion goes. <br><br>This is why I play for the roleplay, bitches.<br><br> inb4 pornshire and Moonguard </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>enhance shamans are stronger than ever, my survivability in pvp is insane.</br>  <br>I don't. <br>I don't even remember what ab is. I do remember pvp was fun like 6-7 years ago.</br></br>  <br>post your Argent Dawn name or you're a faggot</br>  <br>WrA<br>And I'd rather not, but I'll give you a hint<br> I don't roleplay by standing in a tavern quietly, brooding, and wearing plate armor 24/7 while starting fights in a city <br><br>Oh but I had a troll hordeside named Jam'kin. Haven't played him in forever though. WrA, Moon Guard (WHEN IT WAS GOOD, YES THERE WAS A TIME FUCK YOU) and Feathermoon.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>so you're a fat manchild who plays video games all day? who's the lucky lady?</br>   it's on its final patch - no more new content until next expansion <br> it came out about 7 months ago and it's already done </br>  <br>It was a typo of AV (Alterac Valley - he's referring to when it was actually good and one faction didn't keep a near-perfect win rate through an expansion)</br>  <br>If real life were easier than wow you would probably be a part of it.</br>  Am I the only one who didn't give a fuck if it was bad or not?  Came back to WoD after not playing since WotLK. This piece of shit is just sad.<br><br>They completely fucked up all the classes. Warriors don't even feel like warriors. There's no stance dancing. There's no skill, you just mash buttons like a retard. Boring as fuck.<br><br>Same with other classes. Warlocks got 2 buttons to play with. Shamans, on the other hand, have more keybind than they did before the ability pruning.<br><br>Everyone is just afking in garrisons etc.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh yea, I remember that shit. Especially the part about one faction winning almost every time. I was on the winning side so yea, it was fun.</br>  <br><br>Yeah but you do 0 dmg. You're just a purge bot and you use up MW procs on heals.<br><br>You need to pop most of your CDs to start making a dent in anyone's HP.</br></br></br></br>  Sooo...what's a good class for a noob like me just starting?  <br>Get in the van</br>  <br>I always tell noobs to play hunters. Easiest class, almost always a top dps, easy to level, easy to learn, mildly fun. Not much variety.</br>  Should I buy wod or just leave it until next expansion?  Was okay with Draenor.<br><br>Until shipyards.<br> was hyped, like naval shit and was okay with the companion shit <br> Found glitched vendors I have to constantly leave and return to the area to spawn <br> Expensive and long wait time for ships. <br> Very limited ships <br> Forced to start with crappier ships <br> Above not so bad, if EVERY fucking BEGINNING mission didn't require traits IMPOSSIBLE for you to obtain (I.E. Battleships, Subs, Carriers, etc etc etc) <br> Severe limit to fleet keeps a decent, variable trait fleet from being plausable (you are not going to be able to deal with storms, whirlpools, land, ice, battleships, carriers, subs, transports, speed, etc etc at the same time) <br> 45 gold takes two fucking days? <br> 90% mission success, fails, fucking LOSE MY SHIPS? <br> Go up about seven green text entries to see why fucking losing ships is awful <br> Assenine quest/requirements to get more ship upgrades you need? <br><br>I'm not fond of losing shit. If the game requires me to litterally sacrafice the shit out of my ships to continue on, okay that's the game mechanic.<br><br>I don't like how it takes forever to replace them, not enough room to create a stockpile of backups, and it takes forever to do a single, fucking quest.<br><br>Two fucking days for a fucking measly 45 gold? It takes two hours for that shit with the NPC companions! And I don't risk them dying in the process!<br><br>Rewards =/= time and frustration needed for ships.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>you neckbeards get so angry when you're called out for being shit.. dont worry your mlp doll wont hurt you</br></br>  Literally canceling my sub right now.  <br>Keep your mythic citadel. I'd prefer to have real world content than mythic. Because at the end of the day, WoD will be gone in 'x'months, I'll have finished my gym plan and you? Well, still trying to reach that haribo on your ass I presume.<br>I don't even play wow anymore, they lost me at the end of cata.</br></br>  <br><br>Yes i've heard about hunters, are there any other classes you would recommend? I like to have a couple of options...<br><br>And also, ally or horde?</br></br></br></br>  <br>The gym, cooking classes, musical instruments, knitting, beer brewing, science, math, poetry, history. Any of these are good and not exclusive. Spend your time on real life skills. <br>Or if you don't know any better, see<br>Sometimes you have to learn things yourself.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm not worried if twilight sparkle is going to hurt me...<br>It's if I'm going to hurt him/her/it...</br></br>  Pvp died end of wrath, The raids were fun the first couple of times but then just became a grind fest<br>Cataclysm Heroic Dragon Soul Only redeemable piece in the game. Pvp confirmed dead.<br>MoP Fucking panda land. "Neutral faction" lvl 10 choose.<br>WoD Hi Here is some shit to do outside your garrison.. Wait no sorry.</br></br></br>  <br>Ally is definitely better. I regret switching to horde. You should try out rogue (fun, strong), druid (variety), paladin (variety), or shaman (variety, strong, fun) if hunter isn't your thing</br>  <br>Thanks dude, i'll try em all out a little bit to see what suits me best.<br><br>Just one final question if you don't mind, why is Ally better? Is it those racial stats or just better lore/story/playerbase?</br></br></br>  <br>More visually appealing in every way (cities, races, faction-based leveling zones and areas), arguably better racials, seemingly more PvP wins, seemingly nicer/more vibrant player base</br>  <br><br>Okay, i've played WoW a little bit before and i preferred the Horde, i'll take a look at the alliance and go from there.</br></br>  Anyone have the version of this with wod very poorly drawn and it says "maybe well finish if we have the resources"?  <br>Bwahahaha vanilla raids so difficult where half of the raid could be braindead. Nah m8, raids are getting tougher with every xpac</br>  Catering to the Casual killed WoW  <br>Honestly, the Bronze Dragonflight aren't getting involved because the timeline we are stepping into is a Different Timeline, not ours, and a lot of people are speculating that ours is the only one with Azeroth, hence why the Legion and whatnot are so incredibly adamant on taking it over. Though, that idea's just kind of meh, because its full of flaws.<br>But the whole thing is, the timeline we're fucking up isn't ours, its an alternate timeline that has no effect on ours.<br>The Black Dragons were trying to fuck with ours and change our own history, hence why the Bronze said fuck no. But this is a different timeline, a different universe.<br>If it had been ours, Orgrim Doomhammer wouldn't have died like a fucking bitch in one hit.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It really did. Used to be able to finish a raid with the same group spamming multiple days depending on the content. Now a days I hardly go 3 bosses without having to go find a new group because of some lame ass bullshit.</br></br>  <br>spanning*</br>  <br>Take that fucking tabard off right now, you unmatching, OCD killing piece of trash.<br><br>Other than that, i like your mog bruh.</br></br></br>  been playing since 07, loved bc wall the way through to wrath, cata was eh, loved mop everything felt fine in pandaria, but wod gets no love, they fucked up big with this shit, some of it is good, draenor looks sick but everything else is boring as fuck, they fucked up pvp, so just waiting till next expac now  I pretty much stopped playing because they haven't added any new pvp content aside from the fucking ashran bull shit. Forcing the pvp community to deal with the shit grind fest crap the pve'rs like to do. And I can't cast Lightning Bold while walking. As if it wasn't hard enough already to keep a god damn melee class off my fucking ass as it were.  <br>What could you possibly like about it, that is the ugliest warlock set in wow. Looks like somebody made it out of the stuff he found in trash can</br>  <br>The bait is strong in this one</br>  sorry /b/ but YLYL threads here are just as shit as front page /r/funny<br><br>/b/ is just recycled shit material everyday. <br><br>here is a front page /r/funny picture that beats any 4chan OC.</br></br></br></br>  Have some faith in humanity dude. <br>www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=T549VoLca_Q<wbr></wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>lol jane lynche trying so hard not to laugh at this retard.</br>  I'm dumping pics        Who gunna stop me huh?      <br>so why don't you go back to reddit you cancerous piece of shitfuck.</br>    <br>Is that orange soda or shit</br>  <br>Staged.</br>    <br>Probably.</br>  <br>Nuh uh</br>  <br>Jesus this is cancer.</br>  But Instagram is free.  <br>it's actually pretty funny. faggot</br>     selfie <br> is fire <br> comrades <br> Instagram <br><br>A list of things i couldn't give less of a fuck about.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Cry about it faggot.
