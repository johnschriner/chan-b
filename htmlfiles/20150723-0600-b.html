It was pretty straightforward, we mentioned to eachother that playing with our dicks was fun, found that playing with eachother's dicks was more fun, and then I found out I really liked having a dick in my mouth. Whenever we got together to play it always ended with me sucking him off (too young to cum).<br><br>Weird thing is I completely grew out of it. Doesn't interest me at all anymore.</br></br></br>  <br>seven<br>shared a small room with my two older brothers<br>older brothers would get random puberty boners all the time<br>first time i saw one in its full glory, woke up early and brother had morning wood, he was wearing baggy boxers and it was sticking out the open pee slit that some boxers have</br></br></br></br>  <br>Grew out of sucking penises of your own age, or grew out of sucking all kinds of penises?

I didn't really know what a boner was until 10+ years old...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Grew out of liking any penises (besides my own). Unpopular opinion, but I'm pretty sure being gay is a choice (or even just something like a phase) based on my experience.</br>      10 or so. I used to fap with my friend, same age. I think he was straight, but because I'm a total fag I decided we should fap with no bedcovers so I could see his cock. We were gonna fap each other once, he told me that he and his brother used to jerk each other off and it was good, but then he changed his mind and said it was gay. Told him I didn't see the problem, but he didn't want to. Pretty sure he was straight, but he died in a car accident like 5 years ago, so I can't ask him.      fuck it... who has an off-topic pad??        when i was 13 and there was one in front of my face  <br>storrry</br>    <br> We were gonna fap each other once, he told me that he and his brother used to jerk each other off and it was good, but then he changed his mind and said it was gay. <br><br>Maybe he had to jerk his brother off for medical reasons? Blue balls can be a real pain in the ass.</br></br></br>  When I was 8<br> friend decides to try playing gay, we find a set of bushes next to playground along the rec center and pull out our dicks <br> first fondling, then rubbing against each other, eventually he mentions he read that putting it in your mouth feels good <br> I'm curious, and confused, take his into my mouth, try various motions, he's slightly aroused, but nothing major. <br> after a few mintues he finally grabs the back of my head as we lower down to our knees, then I take him in my mouth again and he starts pumping my head back and forth, I accidentally bite/scrape with my teeth and he yelps, we pause to make sure no one heard us.  <br> we're clear, I try licking and sucking on his balls, he starts laughing, but also moaning, a little more of that and it's back to him pumping my face into his crotch. <br> still too young to cum, but feels good, I eventually get him to lick and suck mine, he goes for the balls too, was great. <br> a few more minutes of that then we practice kissing, zip up, and then sneak back on out to play on the train tracks, this led to years of "playing gay" with increasing success <br><br>But of course since it was "playing gay" <br>No Homo.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>13<br>walked in on my friend jerking off<br> turned into a fun time though so whatever</br></br></br>    <br>sleepover at a friends</br>    <br><br>Stories!</br></br>      <br> be 13 <br> friend is 15 <br> on a camping trip because i was in the boy scouts <br> tell a friend a few days before we went that i think i might be gay  <br> we forget about it  <br> second day of the trip  <br> we're both hanging out in this small cave we found in one of the hills by our campsite that he and i found <br> "Anon, you said you think you like guys right?" <br> i tell him yeah <br> as soon as i say yeah he stands up and pulls his dick out right in front of me  <br> tells me he's been wanting to try something like this with someone for a while and asks if i can suck his dick <br> there's an awkward silence for a minute and i tell him yes <br> end up sucking his dick and he comes in my mouth <br> after he's done we sit there for a few minutes, asks me if i can do it once more <br> i do  <br> we go back to camp <br> end up blowing him again in the tent before we go to bed <br><br>and that's how i found out i was gay, and we continued to do that for a few months until he had to move away</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>maybe slow down a bit sh0tabro, plenty of time to bump for stories, unless we just going all out</br>    <br>honetly i just thought this thread needed some more visual</br>  <br>oh god, dem Boy scout camping trips, supreme experimenting fodder, so much free time in secluded woods, nice one anon</br>    <br>true, was just suggesting, is all, definitely needed it at the start, we've got a good pace now though it seems, but it's w/e</br>      <br>got a comic if you are interested ?</br>  <br> friend discovers German stip-tease tv-channel <br>you never stood a chance</br></br>  <br>Jeez, that cock looks like eerily like mine, though I don't thing I'm quite that big, sounds like you got rewarded very well in a special way, and got out safe, pleasing others is super hot</br>    you all seen dragon ball super yet ?  <br>Based Tokuda, haven't seen anything new from him in awhile, I wonder what happened</br>   Be me, 14yo <br> Art classes <br> So fucking bored <br> Cute feminine classmate comes to my table and sits <br> He is also bored <br> We start talking, and conversation goes lewd <br> We talk about girls, and that things <br> I've always loved him, since the first time I saw him <br> I have boner <br> He notices <br><br>Moar?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do eet</br>  <br>cont</br>  <br>Not yet, how is the new canon version?

Make it small and quiet..My Mic cost me 50 dollars..This mic. https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=pB4<wbr>eIOR5tCI</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Getting new equipment soon tho.<br>Any way so quiet space. Then what I did was use ACX they are the platform that Audible uses..also just because some of these books are on royalties. http://www.audible.com/search/ref=a<wbr>_mn_mt_ano_tseft__galileo?advsearch<wbr>Keywords=Christopher+Hudspeth&amp;x=0&amp;y<wbr>=0..Those are what are on sale so far.<br><br>Anyway so I used ACX at first..still do. And upwork. which is a freelance site. You MUST search for voice work tho. Its not dedicated to voice work. There is voices123 and voicesdot com..but those are strictly pay to play sites.<br><br>so far it has worked out pretty well. A book I finished about a week ago, is being submitted for consideration of a Grammy. Not a nod but could be, and that would be awesome! Not expecting it tho. Just cool that Im actually in an industry that could win a grammy..i had no idea till the guy contacted and asked for the CDs of the book so it could be submitted.

So, I do a lot of stage acting, and I have a deep voice, but with a wide range, and I can do quite a bit of accents and different voices as well. I'm also articulate and have a very neutral accent during normal speech (I'm from Ohio).

Je me suis même résigné à me retaper 3 ans d'école d'ingé en alternance juste pour avoir le titre car j'ai l'impression qu'en France les seuls BAC+5 qui valent un truc c'est les ingénieurs...

Suivie de près par les Roms et les mec qui t'arretent pour que tu leur achete une carte postale comme ça Mamadou pourra faire de l'accrobranche mdr.</br>  <br>La finlandaise pourrait se défoncer je pense</br>  <br>Généralise (à l'ei.Cesi de Nancy). J'ai déjà DUT (GEII), licence pro (réseaux et télécom) et bientôt le master comme je disais...

Fait chier mais bon ! :)</br>  <br>La finlandaise s'est mise au crack putain</br>    <br>ah mais ça le piston et le réseau c'est essentiel quel que soit le domaine mec.

Insulin is a hormone that has many functions, one of which is to cause your body to slow fat metabolism. Therefore if you constantly eat carbs you will have a harder time burning fat and while you may "lose weight" you won't look much better unless you work out way more than you need to.</br>  corn/10  <br>Looks delicious. I love burned pizza; I'm sure that sounds ironic, but seriously. So good.</br>  <br><br><br>Who honestly gives a fuck?

Next time you order a pizza try a bit on a slice.<br><br>Hell, the locals put it on a good half of the pizzas they offer.</br></br></br></br>  <br> as a dominos employee <br>FTFY</br></br>  Is that bologna? 1/10 for effort.  <br>Thats because Japanese are weird as fuck.<br>We either nuked them too much, or just not enough.</br></br>  <br>being mexican, not knowing anything about how carbs helps the body cells to work if you are exercising, do exercise, eat less shit, youll be ok, keep the tortillas,</br>  <br><br>Are you an actual retarded person? Or just used to seeing shitty processed toppings on shit tier pizzas?<br><br>There is a grilling tray on the right side of the picture. If I wanted/needed to use it, I would have. It's much better when cooked directly.</br></br></br></br>  a flat pizza  <br>The onions are too thick, and I would have made them into caramelized onions before throwing them on there. Other than that, it looks good</br>  Pizza on the grill  <br>And, not to labour the point.<br><br>Tortillas are the low carb option. Even wholemeal and multigrain breads have more carbs than a tortilla.</br></br></br>  Strogonoff pizza  <br>fucking bananas on a fucking pizza? i thought pineapple was bad enough. that's a new low.</br>  <br>mayo on pizza, ok...<br>some people will never learn, porcodio</br></br>  <br>dont know why anyones hating those look bomb</br>  <br>oooo grilled pizza looks good. never really heard of it before but i think i might try it next time i make a pizza</br>  r8  <br>processedingredients/10<br><br> do you even cook bro? </br></br></br>  <br>I'm finnish and I know of one pizza place that has corn in one of their pizzas. <br><br>I like fresh/boiled/grilled corn as much as the next guy, but I don't think it has a place on pizza.</br></br></br>  <br>1 your mozzarella DOES seem a shitty processed topping<br>2 in fact, naples' pizza is baked on grills... not<br>3 toppings under mozzarella<br>4 way too many olives<br>5 uneven temperature<br>6 you should add leaf vegetables after baking pizza<br>7 fottiti, faccia di merda blu</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yes ... I used what I had in the fridge ... haha</br>  <br><br>A little tip to save you from destroying it the first time (like I did). Roll out your dough and cook that on one side for about 3 minutes till it gets a little stiff.<br><br>Add your toppings to the COOKED side, then place the whole thing back on the grill.<br><br>No doughy top, no sagging through grates, just delicious smokey grilled pizza.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>best pizza i've seen here so far</br>  <br>1 Made fresh that morning<br>2 Wasn't going for neofagitan pizza<br>3 layer of mozz, then toppings, then more mozz<br>4 preference (and fuck you, my wife and i love olives)<br>5 Nope<br>6 Preference, I like the spinach flavor to bake into the rest<br>7 I don't speak faggot</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Water, yeast, salt, sugar, unbleached white flour, and olive oil. You just have to play with the ratios to get the consistency you like. <br><br>I brush the crust 90% the way through cooking with EVOO, salted butter, garlic powder, salt, sugar, and Italian herbs. That's why it looks like it's got stuff on it.</br></br></br></br>  I like to finish guys off by keeping their cock deep inside my mouth/throat and forcing them to jizz there. After some additional chum covered sucks I'll make out with him and transfer his jizz into his mouth until it disintegrates from our mouths and tongues from making out so vigorously. During ganbangs I'll request my tops to cum in my mouth like a receptacle and I'll swallow the entire heap with pleasure. With two bottoms I'll get my ass filled with cum watch the other bottom get his ass jizzed then suffocate my face deep into that guys asshole usually with him sitting on my face then he'll slightly squeeze the semen out of his anus and directly into my throat where I'll eat it no problem but continue to rim said asshole and appreciate eating something so forbidden all while gasping for air  <br><br>They're square because I use a 1/2 inch thick baking steel to cook them, and I don;t like wasting any space on the steel when cooking. So they're slightly rectangular.</br></br>  <br>did i harm your pridem sweetie?<br>however, if you wanna brag on b about your cooking skills please go on, i'll have another laugh.</br></br>  <br>if you bake the above mentioned ingredients, you get op's pizza</br>  <br><br>Best pizza you'll ever eat, guaranteed 100%</br></br>  <br>i doubt that</br>  <br>thanks kind anon</br>  Mussarela  Hey /b/ i got this girls nudes and sucking dick, i know her and i found her facebook <br><br>what do? what can i get from her?</br></br>  <br>Moreeee</br>  Start by posting the nudes  <br><br> Latinas <br> Dark skinned latina  <br> White panties <br><br>100$ says she has a hairy vag</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Desktop R8/H8 Thread   2015 <br> vista <br>faggot</br></br>  Rainmeter is a stupid gimmick for hipsters  need a new wallpaper<br>help?</br>  <br>windows 7<br><br>retard</br></br></br>  <br> Ccleaner </br>  <br>i'm in no way a hipster.I like rainmeter.a lot of the stuff is useless but i like what i'm using.</br>    <br> 8.1 </br>      <br>can you post that wallpaper?</br>  <br>what is all this info on the left about space and speed and shit ?<br><br>how can I, the fucking peasant get such a gadget ?</br></br></br>  I like mine clean,  <br>It's rainmeter.
