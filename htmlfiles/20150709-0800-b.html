The makers say it should be able to do around 273 mph. Either way, it's got 1:1 power/weight ratio, 1340hp, 1340kg, and 610kg downforce at 162mph, and fastest 0-200mph and 0-200-0 mph. It broke the Suzuki without really trying. It would undoubtably beat the 918 at Nurburgring. They estimate it to do atleast around 6.30, but Nurburgring has forbidden makers to do lap times.</br>    <br> Their super cars are still running from the 70's and 80's while ours are in junkyards. <br><br>That's really more an issue of initial collectability and rarity. <br><br>If there is always a strong market for a car (which tends to happen with european supercars), then people are more likely to hold on to them and maintain them properly.<br><br>All cars require maintenance to stay running, and in fact J.D. power and associates dependability ratings for 3 year old cars lists way more american and japanese cars than it does european cars.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>is going to get thoroughly spanked by<br><br>although it's just Brits beating Brits.</br></br></br>  <br>Regera will be limited by gear ratios since it won't have a gear box. It is going to be limited to about 250mph</br>  <br>Hahaha fair enough <br><br>But rebuilds are fun</br></br></br>  Do your worst  <br>Ah, yes, i forgot this, right !<br>So, the One will stay the fastest.</br></br>  <br>You've done enough</br>  <br>simplified:<br>fastest road legal car</br></br>  <br>The suzuki, you mean the Escudo ?

Fuck you and your Shitty fucking nigger taste</br>  <br><br>God damn that is moving. <br><br>I think this guy did 270mph a few years back. Although, just like the ONE's top speed, Guinness was not there to record it.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Very recently. There was a crash and some spectators were either killed or injured.<br><br>No more manufacturer testing there. <br><br>They are thinking of moving to Spa i think, or maybe laguna seca.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How the fuck do you drive this cunt car? Lie on your belly, feel the road vibrations on your dick, and steer how?</br>  <br>http://www.worldcarfans.com/1150527<wbr>94430/koenigsegg-one1-tackles-suzuk<wbr>a-circuit-sets-new-unofficial</wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Buuuuut proves my point that europoor cars are more in regards of "worth" maintaining and still running. They hold their value where as ameripoors. Not so much.<br><br>Hell I can stumble into my local scrapyard or junkyard and come crossed more corvettes and mustangs then any euro cars. (Not saying regional differences but overall shape their in)</br></br></br>  <br>Thought laguna was being sold off</br>  <br>The Radical SR3R (not sure of the complete name) is the fastest car on the nurburgring, it'll be hard for the One to beat it.</br>  <br><br>Oh right, i gotcha now.<br><br>For some reason i thought you were making a reliability argument or something.<br><br>I'm dumb.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Eat my baguette you dirty faggots.<br>Everywhere fucking nigger pussys from the chon.</br>  <br>Thats an amazing innovation. Was this produced or a concept?</br>  <br>Thanks for the update.<br><br>Strange though, people come out there, pay admission, and crash their cars every day, so, why not mfgrs???</br></br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=qNb<wbr>ep6-NShQ</wbr>  [ ] <br><br>kek</br></br></br>  <br>It's SuzukA, you wrote Suzuki, i thought the Suzuki Escudo had the 0-200 record</br>  <br>But she not gon let you ride her unless you have an expensive ride which has 4wheels.</br>  <br>Ha.. that's a coincidence; that actually is my ride..</br>  <br>Sure. It's not really a production car though, and not really a "real" road going car. However, Koenigsegg say they are estimating a 6.30 lap time based on some testing they've done on the Ring.</br>  The reason the ONE:1 and/or the Venom GT don't have the fastest production car record for guinness is because they have not produced enough of them to qualify as a 'production car' according to Guinness.<br><br>They've only made a few dozen GT's and like 7 One:1's</br></br>  <br>Sorry, never been much interested in tracks :P</br>  <br>God damn. Rally cars look so nice.</br>  <br><br>Yeah i thought it was silly too.<br><br>Or they could, you know, not let people sit in that area where the crash happened. <br><br>Not sure what they're thinking there. Probably don't want the bad press.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the One:1 hasn't actually gone above 270mph either because they lack a large enough track.</br>  <br>That datsun 240 is very nice but they will never be worth as much as a Hakosuka (most are going for about $150k-250k)<br><br>When it comes to classic JDM cars nothing beats watanabe wheels. <br><br>Also I personally prefer the Toyota 2000 GT to the 240z</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, it's a thing. They're called volksrods.</br>  <br>Yep, damned shame, decades of directly comparable lap time down the drain...</br>  <br><br>I wonder if the salt flats could be used?</br></br>    <br><br>Aurora's V8 was SO fucking awesome.<br><br>had DOHC and all alloy block and heads... such a nice motor. I think GM axed it because it was expensive and shit-ass old people don't know how to appreciate nice shit.</br></br></br></br>      <br>Is that an Atom?</br>  <br>0-60-0 Record owner that's correct ?</br>  <br><br>Yeah i guess it's not a huge loss though.<br><br>That track is so long that it causes lap times to be highly erratic. There have been manufacturer teams who have seen 7 second differences in the same car, just by running it on a different day. <br><br>A shorter track with a good straightaway and a collection of tight/sweeping turns would probably be more accurate anyway.<br><br>Like suzuka or road atlanta or something like that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ariel Atom 500 V8</br>  <br>Dubs confirm diamond dick status</br>  <br>What's the part sticking out under the engine? Looks like a 4WD transfer case but I know that's not it.</br>  <br>Venom GT is thinking of trying them I heard, and they say they might get to 278mph. Anyway, Koenigsegg say they aren't very interested in beating top speed records; that the handling of the car is the most important and that top speed isn't. Besides, I think the ground resistance would be worse than that of Volkswagen's track, and at those speeds that can probably be enough to knock a couple of MPH off the top speed, and at this point "a couple of MPH" is what's on the line pretty much in this top speed war.</br>  <br><br>Man, i wish 2000GT's were as plentiful as 240s though. An original 2000 is SUPER fucking expensive these days.<br><br>I think they make replicas though, which could be cool i guess.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Those cars are something else</br>  <br><br>Yeah i agree, the highest top speed stuff gets silly after awhile.<br><br>Just let bugatti keep it and move on haha.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That old early 90's s-class, that was to wide to load on trains, in perfect old timer condition.</br></br>  <br>No idea.</br>  <br><br>Whatever you do, don't by the V12.<br><br>Unless money is no object, in which case just buy a new S class.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But the Hellcat is a piece of shit on a track, and using the key to even use all that power voids the warranty so obviously it's not quality. And I've read many articles of C7's blowing engines within a month of them being purchased. The new Mustangs are nice though, and that GT350 is actually a pretty fast car, even having the lowest horsepower of the newer muscle cars. Until the Super Snake comes back anyway.</br>  <br>And then you run into a speed bump and you're stuck</br>  <br><br> Whatever you do, don't by the V12. <br><br>Why? <br><br>I would use it for weekend tours.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What is this, Mad Max? Haha. But seriously though, I don't know what I'd do with something like that</br>  <br><br>Because if you don't have the money for a lot of expensive repairs, when something goes wrong with that engine (and it will), you're gonna be fucked.</br></br>  /o/ here<br><br>every car ITT is shit</br></br>    <br>Fuck you.</br>  <br>I own one right now but it's beat up with a lot more wear and tear than I think I could fix, but one day I hope i can own a fully restored Aurora. Maybe that's the hipster in me but it really is a fucking awesome car</br>  Caught any fish today?  <br>Someone with some goddamn sense</br>  <br>no fuck you leatherhead</br>  <br>This. Its definitely on my "gotta have it" list.</br>  <br><br>Actually, the red key does not void the warranty, that was a rumor. Also, the hellcat is not a track car, just like a big mercedes S class is not a track car. It's a huge hulking powerful sedan. It's a highway cruising car. <br><br>And the C7 Z06 has had some issues with very few of the new cars. They seem to be dealing with it the same way porsche did a few years ago when their were setting themselves on fire fresh from the factory. Shit like that happens sometimes, doesn't make it a bad car. <br><br>I want to have babies with the GT350.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh most definitely, I think the 2000 GT's go anywhere from $500k and up.<br><br>Toyota Celica TA22s are also quite nice cars that, are a bit more plentiful than 2000GTs</br></br></br>  <br>Because OP just loves to ride on people's rods, right</br>  Non or completely indifferent. I do get a chuckle every time I see someone e whos obviously poor driving a relatively expensive vehicle but that's about it on this  <br>this car is autistic as fuck</br>  64 1/2 Mustang, got no pics sorry.<br><br>Basically is a 1964 mustang but made from the ground up completely modernized, price starts at $120k.Slap it with muh dick and claim it.</br></br>  z3  <br><br>Those are cute cars, but dream car?</br></br>  <br>I love BMW, but I'm really not a fan of the z series</br>  s13 silvia<br>very rare where i live</br>  <br>Nice dubby dubs anon</br>  <br>This guy, this guy knows what's up.</br>  cressida ftw   Someday.  '28 bugatti royal  <br>I have a buddy that has a pretty nice S13 240SX, with about 30 grand dropped into it. Mostly suspension and chassis work done to it.</br>  <br>Man... I want an VW type 2 camper.</br>  <br>Yea but then bring up the fact that the GT350 wasn't a drag car and Hellcat fans get pretty butthurt when you show them lap times, where apparently anything going for them is valid but anything that makes them look bad doesn't count. Just seems like a stupid argument. Personally, I'd say track times are better. Driving a straight line is pretty damn simple.</br>  <br><br>Dat hood doe.</br></br>  I find this one to be interesting  <br>kanker nederlander</br>  <br><br>Yeah i mean, there's gonna be fanboys on both sides of course.<br><br>Personally I value drag times over lap times. Setting lap times involves a professional driving the car at its absolute limit, which is a place 99.9% of drivers will never approach on the street anyway, and if they do, they are being extremely unsafe.<br><br>Acceleration on the other hand, that's something where every car owner can enjoy the full potential of the car, or at least very close to it.<br><br>Not to say that cars shouldn't handle well. I hate driving cars that don't handle well. But "handling well" is often times very different from being fast around corners and setting good lap times.<br><br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/626630750#p626651767">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Godver, nog een?<br>Had gehoopt dat meneer tapijt de enige zou zijn. <br>Zijn er nu dan al 3.
