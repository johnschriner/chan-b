She bitches about how she gets taught things you dont need. Then either stop taking subjects you dont need or realize that most students who take the more advanced shit are planning on following up in it.<br><br>How does she expect a modern schooling system to work without having standardized testing. Theres other stuff you should learn sure. But the world is too connected and employers expecting a certain standard. You cant have schools just doing what the fuck ever and ditching out on actual education about the world in favour of teaching some nutsack about budgeting.<br><br>Heres a tip.

We ban things and pretend it wont exist.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They should both be rejected they're enemies of freedom and the American way.</br>  It's a fucking cake store they probably had no idea what it was. It's not like it's a passport or some official shit    <br> mfw I share a world with this shitter </br>  <br>  implying a piece of cloth can be racist &lt; </br>  <br>Why are all the stars in the background smiling</br>  <br>Those are ghosts to scare niggers, immigrants, faggots, and jews.</br>  <br>kek</br>  <br> recognizes Confederate flag <br>NOPE DAS RACIST!<br> no fucking clue what the IS flag is <br>DIS OKAY<br><br>Ignorant Americans.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who cares about racism the confederacy was a terrorist state that lost. Honest Abe did the world a favor.</br>  <br> yfw he's right, because most arabs are extremist muslims <br>inb4 "b-but moderate muslims"<br>they just want someone else to do the killing for them</br></br></br>  <br>At least Daesh has the balls to admit they hate the US. Confederate fags hate the US too.<br><br>Of course they always want to tell you how fucking patriotic they are<br> which is why they want to LEAVE the US <br> which is why they wave the flag of an enemy country that killed more Americans than any other <br><br>Why don't you go fly the flag of Best Korea next time you go visit South Korea. Tell me how that goes you turncoat little bitch.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The Union is the Largest terrorist state in the world, Yankee. Congratulation on helping to divide the nation over empty platitudes.</br>  <br>It's no contradiction to be loyal to our part of the nation and despise the self righteous idiots in the North who are committing demographic genocide on OUR people, north and south.</br>  <br>Because muslims are a oppressed minority.</br>  <br><br><br>This is the stupidest story in recent months.<br>It's Walmart, most of the employees speak English as a second language and those who don't are barely literate. <br>Obviously after the S.C. shooting a memo was sent to the stores saying not to sell the confederate flag so even the Mexicans recognized it. I doubt any Walmart worker even knows what an ISIS flag is.<br>Seriously, I doubt Jose or John bob working for minimum wage and living in a trailer park read a fucking newspaper or watch the news. It is simply stupidity.<br>Or you can choose to believe Walmart has been taken over by ISIS and islamists in the middle of redneck America.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>it isn't about ending racism you idiot.<br><br>It is the same reason Government buildings in Germany don't fly the Nazi flag and Walmart does not sell Nazi flags.</br></br></br></br></br>  Because the Islamic State flag is the tawheed and the seal of muhammad. Two things with no racism or in fact any evil linked to it.  same paper in both pics, op just wants people to get pist  <br>b-but you're a stupid faggot who is using the exception as the rule.<br><br>Whatever. Hate on Muslims all you want. Your intolerance makes the world go round and my tolerance is just a hurdle you need to shit post over.<br><br>These threads are just trolls trolling trolls.<br><br>Enjoy your ego fap.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The problem is NOT that you can get an ISIS cake, you should be able buy such a thing if you are free after all. The problem is that you cannot buy a CSA cake because of fear. We live in a free society and no group has the right to force it's views on individuals.</br>  <br>So Nazi flags and swastikas are completely okay in Germany except on government building?</br>  <br>Lol you had to use the same image twice. Photoshop fail.</br>  <br>This<br><br>Just compare the X's in the boxes, they are exactly the fucking same, one picture was taken before sending it an one was taken after sending it, then they just found a random ass picture of an isis cake.</br></br></br>  <br>no. they are illegal</br>  <br>The problem is not that free people can buy an ISIS cake in a free country. People should be able to buy or say whatever they want without some disheveled mob coming down on them.</br>  <br>So much for individualism and freedom.</br>  <br> It's no contradiction to be loyal to our part of the nation and despise the self righteous idiots in the North who are committing demographic genocide on OUR people, north and south. <br>You didn't quit "The North." You quit The United States of America. And you quit before Lincoln did a fucking thing. You had your 3/5ths comprimise ADVANTAGE and disproportionate representation compared to your population in the Senate<br> still not enough because maybe, just maybe you won't get your way 100% of the time so you ragequit the USA. <br><br>You didn't war with "The North." You went to war with The United States of America and that includes every state (beyond the ones who quit), rather than just "The North."<br><br>That "genocide" is very much in your fucking head.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> people should be able to buy whatever they want <br><br>Yeah, like anthrax and nuclear bombs<br><br> Within reason of course! <br><br>I hear you say, but then who gets to draw the line and where? complete freedom only leaves room for idiots to fuck things up.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   heritage not hate <br><br>i love how white people can just ignore reality because white people</br></br>  <br>its all hate not heritage?<br>this little nigga works at that cake store!!</br></br>  <br>this. <br>the problem is that the confederate flag was not selled.<br>the problem is not that the isis flag was selled.</br></br></br>  <br>What about a swastika on German war veterans Iron Cross?</br>  <br>I am sad that the flag is getting removed, that was all we have left and now the yankies are take it away too, I hope someday that they find it too expensive to continue occupying the south but I am afraid that day will never come, because we are too damn polite.</br>  "can not do cake cuz of picture"<br><br>I take it the people working at this cake store aren't the smartest of people</br></br>  all this shit over a faked pic.  <br> selled <br><br>Come on man...</br></br></br>  <br>non american here,<br><br>Id buy the dukes of hazard toy cars if you can, make sure a good authentic brand, they will be worth some money in 10 years the way the future of US is going.<br><br>Also I am a bit of an oldfag but last time I checked during the racism years they tied blacks to the back bumper of their car and dragged them down the road by their arm? raped their kids with sticks? but I guess the flag and saying the word nigga on twitter is extremely racist!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It's no contradiction to be loyal to OUR PART of the nation <br>That isn't patriotism. That is plain and simple tribalism. I guess you don't know the difference.<br><br>I'm not loyal to my state or region. I'm loyal to The United States of America<br> you turncoat bitch <br>Don't you faggots say<br> America - love it or leave it <br>Well GTFO already</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Glad I wasn't the only one to notice this. The green tick conveniently cover's the word "red" when there is clearly no red colour in that cake<br><br> captcha got me to verify cakes lol </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yeah, like anthrax and nuclear bombs <br>Yes, coward. If we are speaking of how things should be then yes.</br></br>  <br>Except the south didnt kill 6 million people or subhumans in this case (niggers). Theres really no reason why it's banned other than the fact the north has an inherited hate for the south and they dont know why. Even back then the north would say the south is racist and their flag is a symbol of racism, so they wouldnt get exports. And its no surprise that retards from Jew York City and similar northern states say its a symbol of racism, because they are completely ignorant of the history of the united states/colonies, and anything else.</br>  <br>not my fault, why fucking human race can not make a language logical ?</br>  <br><br>very edgy posting *tips fedora*</br></br>  <br> same paper in both pics, op just wants people to get pist <br>I think what you are trying to say is<br> The cake is a lie! </br></br></br>  <br>Just stop, never type anything again.</br>  <br>Your reality is not another person's reality. The perspecitve of the many do not take precedent over the individuals.</br>  <br>No, because we aren't on Tumblr.</br>  <br>son, wherever you're from, you're a fucking shame to your country and should learn history.<br>Shameful dubs, aswell.</br></br>    <br> OUR people <br> As if negros, latins, natives and even the chinese aren't an integrant part of your people <br><br>hehehehehehehehehe....</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Clearly you don't belong in 4chan and it apparent now you're a muslim...<br><br>please, kindly get the fuck out.</br></br></br></br>  <br> they tied blacks to the back bumper of their car and dragged them down the road <br><br>By that description you would think they would be banning the Toyota symbol, not the confederate flag, it wasn't even involved.</br></br></br>  <br> You quit The United States of America. <br>If we do not have the right to leave the Union then we are not united but bound and we are under no moral obligation to stay prisoners against our will. <br> That "genocide" is very much in your fucking head. <br>White people are a thing of the past. These arguments will hopefully die with us.</br></br></br></br>  <br> everybody is racist and stupid except me!  <br><br> i'm so smart and civilized </br></br></br>  <br> selled <br>topkek m8 B)</br></br>  <br> That is plain and simple tribalism. <br>United "STATES" of America. And nationalism IS a form of primitive tribalism. <br><br> Well GTFO already <br>We will.<br><br> you turncoat bitch <br>Go rejoin the British Empire you treasonous dog.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  hey /b/ i need help<br>i want to fuck my milf neighbor<br>her son is at summer camp untill friday so, now's the perfect time.<br>today i went over to her house, she invited me in and we watched a movie and talked, but i didn't make a move because i don't know how <br>can you help?</br></br></br></br>    if you dont know how to make a move you wont fuck her. but you know how to fuck?  <br>You already snoozed bitch</br>    <br>Will you see her again?

Also, is pic OC?</br>  If you need this to happen fast, you will most likely need alcohol. Make up any excuse to bring a bottle of wine over and share it with her. <br><br>Also try making physical contact with her, like bump in to her on purpose and apologise. See how she reacts. Sometimes you can get a good indication if she's interested.</br></br>  <br>Picture sauce?

There any limits?</br>  <br>not really</br>  <br>Go right now, if you can, anon. Shes probably thinking about you, too.</br>  <br>can you get her to get alcohol, or can you get your hands on alcohol?</br>  <br>ask to spend the night for some bs reason like theres a leak in your room and tell your parents your sleeping over at a friends house</br>  <br>its 4:57 am</br>  <br>Later today then. You think you got a good shot at sweettalking her?</br>  <br>maybe, don't know exactly what to say</br>  <br>i wunna fuk u</br>  just balls up and hit on her annon. If she goes into the kitchen to get food or drinks, follow her. get up close behind or in front and touch her somewhere safe ( hips or tunny) andlook her in the eyes. Tell her she's fine ( or hot or turns you on or what ever you would say) if she's down she will blush and act embarrassed or jump on you. If not she will push you away and say sorry. just do it and do it soon or the chance will pass you by.  <br>Ask if she'd like to watch another movie with you. What did you see last time? Had dinner? Ask if you could help her with anything, like getting a job with anyone she knows or her.</br>  <br><br>Go for the kill and get sued for sexual harassment.</br></br>  <br>*if she could help you get one. You know if shes seein anyone?</br>  <br>you can't get sued for harassment for hitting on her unless at work. if you assault her you can get sexual assault, so don't go grabbing her ass or tits.</br>  <br>we watched jupiter ascending</br>  Let her see you stare at her ass and then act embarrassed when caught,<br> sorry I don't normally.... <br> its just you're..... <br>If she smiles and giggles continue acting beta which should be easy for you <br>If she says <br> anon im old enough to be your.... <br>Cut across her and finish her sentence with teacher or secret?<br>Then try to kiss her and either get rejected or win<br>Unfortunately no matter how strong the vibes, you eventually must make a move and she can say no<br><br><br>Then you rape her</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>protect your sarcophagus though if you go for the rape.</br>  For fuck sake. <br><br>Here's the scenario. <br>She either wants to fuck you or she doesn't and just so you know, she's already decided which. <br><br>I think it's pretty obvious how to play it</br></br></br></br></br>  so do i have a chance or...?  Just pull your dick out in front of her  <br>Will you come back and tell what happens when you see her, OP?</br>  <br>Of course</br>  <br>Would this really work?</br>  Start crying for some reason and when she comforts you smell her hair.<br>Then run home and masturbate furiously</br>  <br>Make sure to make eye contact</br>  <br>If she wants you. If not it'll be hilarious.</br>  <br>Alright, anything else?</br>  <br>No just make continued eye contact for 5 minutes</br>  <br>Only person making any sense.</br>  <br>ty</br>  <br>Be prepared</br>  Rent movie, bring it over to her place, ask if she wants to watch it with you. Alcohol is a plus but the chances of you fucking her are essentially zilch. If you were a few years older maybe.  <br>How do I play it?</br>  <br>Why zilch?</br>  <br>The only prep you should do is cum beforehand so you last more than a few minutes so there's a chance she'll shamefully fuck you again. If you're fucking a milf you're going rawdog you colossal faggot.</br>  <br> inb4 bait <br>Stop shitposting/gaslighting, OP<br><br>JUST DO IT</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ok Shia</br>  <br>Zilch because 18 packs a creepier punch than 20, or even 19. If you had any game whatsoever you wouldn't be looking for advice here. So if my calculations are correct you had no chance from the beginning and you're basically about to embarrass the fuck out of yourself and get laughed at by someone's mom.</br>  <br>18 creepy?</br>  <br>Play it in a 'got nothing to lose' situation. <br>So go over there and get comfy with her. <br>Work things in order of:<br>Talking&gt;Proximity&gt;Touching&gt;Cuddling<wbr>&gt;Kissing&gt;Fucking<br>Don't go over there expecting things to unfold like you see on brazzers where you walk wink at her and she turns around and begs for your dick in her ass. <br><br><br>If you get shut down at any point just say something like "the least I can do is flatter you", tip your fedora and walk away, as I said, she has already decided.</br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>  Hi, /b/<br>What do you feel like when youve got a shitty hp computer and Ive got this beautys.
