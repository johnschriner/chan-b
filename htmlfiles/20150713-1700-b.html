Hopefully things will get better for you and your mom</br>  <br>bad, stuff happened, want a long greentext story time?</br>  <br>Last week my family decided that I needed to see a psychologist so they set it up and I went. on top of being a complete faggot, the "doc" wasn't all that bad. Towards the end of his line of questioning and stereotypical pictures, he told me that it is likely that I am a sociopath. I asked him what does that mean so he told me. I have never considered myself strange or abnormal, but he said that was another symptom. I don't trust online personality disorder tests or I would take some. Not sure what to do</br>  <br>yo i say fuck people. if your not hurting anyone or yourself why should anyone care?</br>  <br>Sure, if it'll help.

Most likely attributed personality traits to a personality disorder ( a la antisocial personality disorder).</br>  <br>doing it since I'd like some support besides my friend's, but nothing big, gf stuff<br><br>starting in next post</br></br></br>  <br>You can do it! And thanks for asking, I'm doing okay my cousin has a 50/50 chance of making it through open heart surgery in two weeks so… a bit worried</br>  I'm depressed and defeated on the inside, but I have to keep a brave/straight face (for the sake of my family and what I do for work)<br><br>I feel that I may one day rage really badly because of it</br></br>  <br>same</br>  <br>Alright</br>  <br>Chances are probably better than you think. Open heart surgery is near routine in hospitals. She'll be just fine.</br>  I'm alright. A little nervous to be going back to college after my summer hiatus. Missing my girlfriend who actually went out for the summer semester at the same school and has been too busy to hang out lately. Wondering at the extent of my feelings for my ex-girlfriend in Utah who I recently started talking to again. Thinking about my future, about whether I can hack it as a cop in LA. Trying and failing to convince myself to take my ass to the gym and get back under 200. All in all, I'd say life is just fine right about now, these small anxieties aside. My old man is in good health despite his advanced age, my annoying younger brother is out for the night, and I'm all comfy in bed talking to my insufferable, maladjusted, antisocial /b/rothers in arms. I love you all, you bunch of assholes.  <br>Just remember that no matter what happens be brave through your downs and try to have as much fun with the up's as possible</br>  <br>What is it you do for work anon?</br>  <br>Thanks. She is going to have it at Stanford</br>  <br>She'll be fine bro. Surgery gets safer and more effective every day.</br>  <br><br><br>You do know what a sociopath is right?<br><br>They are self righteous assholes who only think of themselves. <br><br><br>You should remove yourself from society.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Work with/manage people in high pressure situations</br>   manthisfeelsgood.exe   <br>well people are fucking lame anyway</br>  My life sucks right now (I can barely sleep) but Im making a shit ton of money, so its ok I guess  <br>I'm feeling that second feel right about now. Aside from the fact that I haven't been laid in 6 months and would really enjoy popping her cherry, I genuinely enjoy hanging out with my girlfriend. She's just been too damned busy lately, and she's the type who enjoys a bit of space.</br>  Dying of an unknown disease, so that kind of sucks  <br>Cont<br><br>Cant really show weakness/stress/fault because I am responsible for my department in the same way they are responsible for their performance</br></br></br>  <br>what are you an EMT or some shit?</br>  <br>As are you.<br><br>A fellow human being.</br></br></br>  <br>Everything will hopefully fall in to place soon. Glad that your dad is doing alright. And this dysfunctional family will stick up for each other</br>  <br>Revel in that space. You'll come to long for it in the long term.</br>  <br>What are your symptoms?</br>  <br>I'm sure the irony wasn't lost on you. Everybody needs a way to vent, doubly so for somebody in a situation like yours. What's got you so down?</br>  <br>I'm ok. You? <br>Although gf I live with its going through cymbalta withdrawal. These are the symptoms and she has ALL of them. She's abusive and stressing out our house mates. But it's not her fault. Depression and ptsd from 13 yrs in the army plus some other health issues. I'm worried and want to help but no idea how. She's lost 15lbs this month from not eating.

I rock</br>  With hangover and existencial doubts . Not ok at all  <br>Feeble bait is feeble.</br>  <br>Probably. That's exactly what happened in my first relationship. Then again, that one turned out to be bathsit after a few months. I'm kinda weird like that though. Like, whenever I'm busy or working hard for an extended period of time, I start to bitch about it, and say over and over how much I'd like a day or two of just sitting at home playing video games in my underwear. And when I finally get that? I get bored as fuck and want nothing more than to go back to work.</br>  Broken.<br><br>Because my anxiety has damaged my life ever since I have memory.<br><br>Because I love someone that cannot be with me. It kills me to know she has a shiny life away from me.

I feel like I'm fighting a losing battle :(</br>  <br>No I'm not taking any anti-psychotic stuff<br>And I've been tested for just about everything testable for each individual symptom. The weird thing is, I'm not sure what these "hallucinations" are. They happen only at night, and are all "demonic" in appearance. My girlfriend has slept over and has seen similar things, which I have no way of explaining. Weird stuff happens around my house that I can't explain, and other people notice it too. I see more things the sicker I get, and they get pretty spoopy<br><br>Shit, am I haunted?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh and also my only pet is more than likely going to die soon and My father has cancer. Not complaining though, life was harder when i was a little girl than it is now</br>  <br>I think im falling for my best friend and that's kinda ruining all my current relationships. Also broke min wage job shitty apartment ect</br>    <br>Who cares? Unlikely to be accurate anyways as there's no conclusive way to determine number of participants. B- paper at best due to shit study design.</br>  <br>I feel as I always have and always will. Like worthless garbage.<br><br><br>Also, Satan gave us some advice on volunteering.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I can sympathize with that, most definitely. I'm 20 years old now, and I lost my mother at 16. My father is pushing 80 now, so even if I got off my ass and got a job, I couldn't just leave him here. My younger brother's adoptive parents kicked him out, and we took him in to keep him out of the foster care system, which sucks in California. He's lazy, has no respect for authority, and smokes dope with his idiot friends all the time, all this despite the fact that he wants to go into the Marine Corps. All in all, I can't say my life is all that sunny at the moment, but I know that it could be worse, so I just set my jaw and power through it, fixing what I can. I think you'll be fine man. Just relax, take a breath, and realize that it could be much, much worse. You're still young. You're barely older than me for God's sake. The life you want will come in time. Just stick with it and don't lose your head.</br>  Terrible, very saddened by the death of one of my biggest inspirations Satoru Iwata. But I'll get over it soon enough. I always get over everything...  <br>Just curious. I'm still in college now, but I'm planning on signing on with the LAPD after I've got my bachelor's. Plus I've had a lot of experience with emergency services personnel, so I enjoy talking with them whenever I can.</br>    My dad went to prison a few months ago. Feels bad man  <br>oh stop being a diva</br>  <br>Thank you for the advice Satan. I've actually been doing volunteer work with a local food collection agency for about 15 years now, and still do twice a week, so I think I'm covered there.</br>  <br>Drama queen / attention whore</br>  <br> mfw i forgot to pic related <br> mfw i have no face <br> my friends tell me to chill out and talk to her casually <br> dont do so cus beta is still inside of me <br> smallest small talks <br> ask a friend of her and one of mine to talk to her <br> both say the same thing <br> "She is not into you nor noone and she doesnt wants a relationship atm <br> go talk to her seriously about what happened <br> tell her that.. <br> I wanted to take things slower <br> smooth <br> and i didnt planned to things to go this way <br> pretty much that I dun guf and so did her <br> she nods but says that we should just be friends <br> hearthbroken.gif <br> agree but frozen <br> she asks again <br> "you agree?" <br> autism takes over <br> assuming direct control <br> y-yes.. <br> dunguf.jpg <br> day forward <br>Is anyone lurking??<br>pt 4 inc</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>They didn't pay attention to me either, but there's no need for samefagging to bump your own post.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hmm. Without knowing her well, I couldn't really suggest anything that would convince her that a private doctor would be in her best interest. I'm sure you don't need me to tell you this though. The VA is not going to be able to make her well again, so you definitely need to focus your efforts on getting her to give a shit and going to somebody who can. Do you really love this girl?</br>  <br>*lurk lurk lurk*</br>  <br>Anytime.</br>  <br>Is it unrequited? Or likely to stay that way?</br>  <br>Thank again, fuckface</br>  <br><br>Anybody else dealt with withdrawal from an snri/antidepressant/maoi? Any advice besides patience? Luckily for her I have heaps of that.</br></br>  <br>bruh same thing happened here<br>mom started turning ricks just to stay in a hotel</br></br>  <br>Ok, I'm sorry. How you got 4chan to look like that? Looks more compfy for the eyes.</br>  <br>Found out by muself (Tomorrow style)</br>  Good.<br>I have a loyal girlfriend and i'm high up in the ranks of my company.</br>  <br>come on, any lurkers??<br> be sitting in couch at home <br> suddenly message <br> its her <br> mfw <br> she says <br> "Hi Anon, Nig (some dude) has been texting me, telling me that I should give you a chance because you're cute and stuff, I know you did not ask Nig to text me that so can you please tell Nig to stop? <br> tell her that I did not knew about that <br> i know she thinks I asked him <br> I actually didnt <br> she said that she told Nig that we had agreed on being just friends <br> mfw I agreed on that <br> mfw where did I signed <br> mfw i have no face <br> playitcool.bat <br> forward the message to Nig <br> uwotm8 <br> told me that "did his best and you dont win all the time <br> days forward as I am writing this <br> sob.exe <br><br>ta-da</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah, and i am genuinely sorry you have to go through this.</br>  bad  <br>Bottom right above settings. Set Yotsuba to Tomorrow.</br>    work in a couple of ours <br>bad</br>  <br>I am indifferent to this story.</br>  <br>fucked up on final 3 &gt;mfw<br>ignore that</br></br>  <br>Pretty sure it is. Its just ive known him forever and losing what is basically my best friend in years doesn't seem worth it. But fuck it hurts to see him with his gf</br>  bad, nobody is responding to a thread i just created  <br>Come on m80, wat do?</br>  <br> we agreed on just being friends <br>She played you like a fiddle, anon.</br></br>  <br>Im okay OP thanks for asking, <br><br>I was suppsoed to start my job as a business analyst this week but now i have to wait until the 20th... but then I am fucking caking cash and can afford to drive a car again...<br><br>its been a long 3 months out of work, but that all ends soon,.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I appreciate it. Not looking for medical advice here just cool to share and get input and talk about it. Actually is helping me rn. <br>I care for her alot. Idk if I'd call it love. But enough that I def want to help her through this. Esp since I'm fairly positive that she'd die without my help. Not feeling trapped, well, maybe a little. But I'm not the type of guy who would walk out just cause she's going through a rough time. Happens to everyone. Amirite?</br></br>  <br>and i just missed quints by 2, this is getting worse and worse</br>  <br>fuck, did not realized that, autism is inside of me</br>  <br>Ah, I see. You are a girl, yes? Unless I'm mistaken. I can only offer the male perspective on this, but I have been in a similar situation more than a few times. Mainly with ex-girlfriends whom I'd broken up with but had been very close to, who proceeded to move on to date other guys. I'd move on to, which is just what I did this time, but it definitely hurts to see somebody you love in another person's arms.</br>  <br>That tends to happen to me as well quite oftenly. And when I'm feeling down only 1 out of 8 posters say something kind lol I know it's /b/ but still...</br>  Bad as usual. Such is life. Perhaps there may be a good day or two in the future.  <br>and you spell like shit, but it's cool.</br>  <br>I've had a somewhat similar experience myself. Girlfriend with multiple peptic ulcers and a prior eating disorder. She would randomly go into seizures all the time, and I was worried she would die. She was nowhere near as messed up as yours though. I know what you mean when you say it helps just to talk about it. I don't think any of us came into this thread for solutions. Just ears and friendly voices. Well, if that's what people need, I'll be glad to give it.</br>  <br> I spell like shit <br>please enlighten me, no h8</br></br>    <br>Move on. Find hotter. Date her. <br><br>Same shit you can tell to 90% of the broken hearted lurking this board.</br></br></br>  Not great. Been trying to get close to people because I'd like to find someone to form a relationship with. Everyone I've been interested in is either taken, just got out of a relationship, or just not looking for one with me.<br><br>and lately I've just been feeling like shit and not really up for doing anything. Just keep getting more and more bad news from different directions and while I usually keep moving along, I don't have anyone to hold me after a long day and kiss me, telling me things will be alright</br></br>  <br>Doing good</br>  Terrible.  <br>What's wrong man?</br>  <br>this<br/></br>  <br>Also, it is unlikely and unethical to try to diagnose someone after one session.</br>  <br>part good part bad, i have a gf, which is fucking great, she makes me really happy, but i can't stop thinking about her and i'm fucking everything up, school grades (my last year on highschool) are going really fucking bad, it's like i don't give a shit about anything but her</br>  <br>About to cry myself to sleep :/</br>  <br>Human euthanasia is legal in a couple states.</br>  <br>Sounds exactly like my junior year. I got tossed into a continuation school because of that, don't lose your focus. I know you love her, but your future is your future.</br>  All wings report in  Pale squadron reporting in  <br>Chicken wings standing by</br>  Funny meme standing by  Red October standing by  ramen noodle standing by  <br>Bronies standing by</br>  Freaky fetishes standing by  red rocket, standing by  pupper on standing by  Best waifu standing by  Red Dead Redemption, standing by  Red shazbot standing by  I love me some chicken wings.
