Shit's been going on for almost a year now.<br>Just look at this smoldering ruin of an image board that was once entertaining and not filled to the brim with nigger lovers, tumblrinas, all sorts of queers and fags, feminists, jesus fuckers and whatnot</br></br>  <br>I mean a ton of subreddits are going black, they're firing everyone, and people seem generally pissed off. It's not a stretch to say they will be migrating to 4chan. It's like digg 2.0</br>  <br>some shit about the admins and the mods at reddit are being bitchy cunts so the site will be shut down and the assumption is that we are the alternative so they will all come to /b/</br>  Theres like a strike kind of thing going on<br><br>https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLo<wbr>op/comments/3bxduw/why_was_riama_al<wbr>ong_with_a_number_of_other_large/</wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>So true.</br>  doubledubs checkd  <br><br>a year? it has been that way for several years. but honestly, i would rather not go back to 2005 or so when this place was filled to the brim with pedos and GNAA faggots flooding the the boards with spam all day (even shutting this place down a couple of times)</br></br>  What happened?<br><br>At approximately 5pm UTC, 1pm EST, on Thursday the 2nd of July, 2015, the moderators of /r/IAmA took their subreddit, which is one of the default set, private. This means that only a very small number of people (consisting of the moderators of /r/IAmA, as well as any pre-approved users) could view and post to the subreddit, making it for all intents and purposes shut down; any other redditors would just see this page. Just after that, a thread was posted to this subreddit, asking whether anyone knew why it had happened. /u/karmanaut, top mod of /r/IAmA, responded with an explanation of why they took the subreddit private.</br></br>  <br>the truth about this situation was that all the conservative faggots thought it was because of jesse jackson's shitshow AMA going wrong, but victoria was fired because she doesn't want to do reddit AMA video answers.<br><br>video answers would get MUCH more ad revenue for reddit, but she felt that it was too similar to any other interview situation.</br></br></br>  <br>The situation was explained here by /u/karmanaut: the mods of /r/IAmA had just found out that without prior warning, /u/chooter, or Victoria, had been released from her position at reddit. They felt that they, along with the other subreddits that host AMAs, should have been warned beforehand, if only so that they could have someone or something in place to handle the transition. /u/karmanaut went on to say that many of the mods affected by this do not believe that the admins understand how heavily /u/chooter was relied upon to allow AMAs to go smoothly - something which is outlined below. Without her, they found themselves in a difficult situation, which is exemplifed by what happened today:<br>We had a number of AMAs scheduled for today that Victoria was supposed to help with, and they are all left absolutely high and dry. She was still willing to help them today (before the sub was shut down, of course) even without being paid or required to do so. Just a sign of how much she is committed to what she does.<br>As a result of this, the mods therefore took /r/IAmA private, stating their reasoning as follows:<br>for /r/IAMA to work the way it currently does, we need Victoria. Without her, we need to figure out a different way for it to work<br>we will need to go through our processes and see what can be done without her.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who is /u/chooter, and why was she so important to the functioning of IAmA?<br><br>/u/chooter(/about/team#user/chooter<wbr>), featured in our wiki is Victoria Taylor, who was, until today, Director of Talent at reddit. However, her essential role was to act as liaison between reddit, IAmA, and any members of the public that wanted to do AMAs; she therefore helped to set up AMAs with celebrities, and, if they were not too familiar with computers (like Bill Murray), she may help them out, both over the phone and in person.</wbr></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>nobody gives a fuck about reddit AMA drama except for the half a dozen newfag reddit queens on here.</br></br></br></br>  <br> as if it wasn't here already </br>  <br>What happened with the Jesse Jackson AMA?</br>  <br>also they're desperate for internet e fame</br>  <br>those were the days also dubs</br>  <br>if u want to know the rest go to the link im too lazy for this shit</br>  <br><br><br>Fuck off reddit faggots.

I wanna say due to me having ADHD, it's weird to say. I have to have things in a certain way. All of my pics in my hentai folder are really fucking organized. I've never been properly diagnosed with OCD, but I would not doubt if I had it.</br>  <br>those are dried peas, kneeling on peas was a common form of punishment in european elementary schools.</br>  <br>NOPE</br>  <br>that's just nasty</br>  <br>yeah.. this is like forcing everyone to say that apples are purple and everyone is just supposed to accept it even when the truth is completely different.</br>  <br>At least in the AIDS threads people who have a fever don't claim it's the same as AIDS</br>      <br>Fear of irregular patterns (expecially holes in my case). It makes me vomit if i look at it for too long.</br>  <br>THIS. WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS. For such a thing to happen you need to either cut the pizza, then cook it, or cook it, cut it and re-heat the whole thing so it melts again. <br><br>Holy fucking shit, also i hate who uses generic cheese and not mozzarella on pizza, you fucking ungodly heretics, you should be flogged and burned alive.<br><br>Also fuck fettuccine alfredo, it's not italian cuisine, it doesn't exist. <br><br>Fuck spaghetti meatballs, also not italian cuisine, yet people pretend it's italian.<br><br>Fuck Mac and cheese. You fucking degenerates, how do you dare call "maccheroni" "macaroni", when even the type of pasta isn't matching? Why drown the whole thing in gooey cheese, you fucking morbidly fat cunts? You should be arrested for this.<br><br>It's "ZUCCHINE" not "zucchini", it's "RUCOLA" not "arugola", and don't even get me started on that parody of salame that is "pepperoni".<br><br>FUCK YOU.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>OCD is an anxiety disorder. which is based on obsessional fears and/or compulsive behaviour. <br><br>OCPD is a personality disorder which he person has life in a very structured way. All aspects of their life. My friendships are all logic based. The routes I walk/drive. The way I do anything. Having your computer in order. Is just you being nitt picky. Haha</br></br></br>  <br>WHO THE FUCK SAYS "MEE-LEE"<br>IT'S FUCKING "MAY-LAY"</br></br>  <br><br>I get it mate, I have bipolar + ptsd... <br>Fuckers think bipolar = mood changes all the time 40 times a day. When it actually mean I have depression for months then normal for months, then manic for shorter months. <br><br><br> Point being; chan4 is not the place you're going to change anyone's mind as far as poking fun at mental health issues. Normies don't even give a damn... </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I love 'pepperoni' as well, haha<br><br>Americans kinda messed up the terminology when it comes to 'italian' food</br></br></br></br>  <br> Why are you so salty about food faggot?
