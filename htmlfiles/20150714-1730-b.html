Pathetic faggots.  <br>Not saying Drake isn't good but Born Sinner and 2014 FHD are better than anything Drake has ever and probably will ever put out</br>  Also consider Artifacts, amazing group.  <br>are you basing musical ability on appearance<br>you really do seem like a dumb person</br></br>    <br>No I'm saying his music is garbage.
