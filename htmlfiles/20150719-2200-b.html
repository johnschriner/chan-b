Why the fuck are these degenerate lifeforms alive? Literally all they can do is unconcious tasks like breathing. They have no mind, no soul whatsoever it seems like abuse to keep them alive.  <br>why so mad?<br><br>you've never watered a plant before?</br></br></br>  Mamamia get da pizza !  <br>It's no so much abuse.<br><br>It's like fighting for animal rights for a steak that's on your plate.</br></br></br>  Keep it easy men, it sounds like you are paying their child support  <br>I see these guys get posted a lot, but never any explanation. What's their condition? Do they know they're alive? Can they show emotion? Are they just missing a skull or what?</br>  <br>Bahahahahahaha</br>    <br>The father choked them to near death when they were babies and they became brain damaged with their eyes popped out.</br>  Technically they are just human fleshlights :^)  <br> 'missing a skull'  <br>you stupid fuck;<br>they have no brain literally.</br></br></br>  O,o  <br>KILL it with FiRE!!!</br>    <br>Then how are they alive?</br>  <br> they have probably been fed meat which had more sense of understanding and awareness, basically more alive than them slaughtered to sustain their non-lives.  <br> even a god cow or chicken has more sentience than these lumps </br></br>  <br>1. right click an image. <br>2. choose 'search google for this image'<br>3. ???<br>4. profit<br><br>  inb4 no chrome faggot </br></br></br></br></br></br>  Original <br>https://m.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=U_jNF<wbr>EnjxaY</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Remix<br>https://m.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=VHEUX<wbr>_3O0c8</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>    <br>The hindbrain I think.</br>  <br>enough of a brain stem to keep bodily functions alive, but nothing past that, no awareness, nothing to react to pain, no thoughts<br><br>They'd almost certainly be dead without modern medicine</br></br></br>  <br>Everyone keeps confusing microcephaly with anecephaly. These kids have microcephaly, meaning their brains didn't develop right in the womb. They have brains, but they're pretty much vegetables. Their parents like to exploit them for money/attention.</br>  <br><br>Finally. Thank you. That's all I wanted to know.</br></br>  <br><br>They only have the reptilian brain. Their brain makes them breath, blow, etc.</br></br>  <br>fucking kek so hard in my life</br>  obligatory  <br><br><br>Isn't it unlawful or morally wrong to keep them "alive" then?</br></br></br>  <br>I wonder how much money their parents get from the state. And people complain about fat fucks raising health premiums. <br>Fuck off</br></br>  <br>This pretty much.</br>  <br>see<br/></br>  <br><br>They still are babies for their mother (who seems a bit retarded as she consider them as god blesses), so i do not agree with stopping their tiny life.</br></br>  the family dog has a more developed brain that these two put together as it can understand simple commands: sit, stay etc.<br>these two cannot even understand their own names, let alone anything else.</br>  <br> Isn't it unlawful or morally wrong to keep them "alive" then? <br>Grey space tbh, i think the parent is a fucking retard for keeping them, and then an even bigger retard for trying to court attention online and not expect a backlash. But as they aren't suffering (can't hurt something which cant feel pain) its not really a problem, just a laughable waste of money.<br><br><br>this</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Can they grow/mature?</br>  <br>So basically they're average women?</br>        <br>Probably? Who the fuck knows or even cares.

They're living abortions; human houseplants.  <br>They are alife because it's possible. Kind of dick-ish to test medicine that way, but it is possible.</br>  <br>kek'd hard</br>  <br>proof they couldn't give two fucks about them and only exploit them for money</br>  Jellyfish have "brains" and vision. They are more functional.  check 'em    <br>I went looking for an appropriate response image, found this.</br>  <br>That shit made me rage as well, it's proof to me that these are nothing more than cash puppets for these people.</br>  <br>I would impregnate for the lulz</br>  <br><br>Even the kid looks annoyed with his shit.</br></br>  <br>donate their eggs to the mom, so she can have another go at it,<br/></br>  <br>Shit son, I couldn't get it up.

So far, the stay has been really nice. I recently resumed my conquest of the first (most competitive) LoL server when I got here but aside from that it's been going to the market, playing games at PC Bangs or going to the bar because i'm apparently 19 here and not 18 because of their aging system</br></br></br>  <br>first Chinese (most competitive) LoL server***<br>goddamn, I can't spell anything ever</br></br>  <br>how does that age thing work</br>  <br>they count the amount of years you've lived in, not the amount you've lived for.</br>  <br><br>so you start as "1 year lived" instead of 0 years old</br></br>  <br>as in if you lived for a day in 1995 you are 19?</br>  <br>And about half the time they guess. What a whimsical tradition.</br>  <br>i have literally no idea how you got that</br>  <br><br>Sounds like you are having a pretty chill time, would you recommend as a vacation destiny?<br><br>Oh, and the DPRK seems interesting, i dunno... Just curious how they live in that part of the world//<br><br>Also, that is some weird age system...</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>im guessing abortion is illegal there if they count the human fetus as human<br><br><br>i may or may not be intoxicated atm</br></br></br></br>    <br>Doing well?<br><br><br>THANK YOU<br><br><br>Are you gonna get sum korean booty?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>oh i read that wrong, if you were 18 and once it hits 1995, you would be 19, yes and no, abortion is legal here as far as I know</br></br></br>  <br>my roomie has a nice booty but the few times we've done anything i've been the sub</br>  <br>Doing fine, thanks! What about yourself?</br>         that fucking tower dive     <br>did your roomate just happen to be gay or did you search for a gay roomate?</br>    dripping cocks :3    Got any where the sub is clearly not enjoying himself?

Many people seem to think that "liberals" (I hate using this word) are the SJWs begging for free stuff and the ones saying "x should y" around every corner. That's only a small portion. It's people like those that give others a bad name. Both sides make heavy use of emotion (I tend to think the "right" moreso since they bring religion into it so often), but that's by people like you all: ignorant peons who pretend to be genius politicians, economists, and philosophers.

I barely have any friend at all tbh. <br><br>One time I was liked by a chick was when last year, last day of my English class in senior year when I found out this 4/10 mexican chick was liking me through entire year but was shy as fuck to even talk to me once.<br><br>idk i could've gotten laid back then but i just didn't do it but now im desperate as fuck<br><br>but it seems like to some guys it's so easy having sex with girls<br><br>i really wonder how you guys do it<br>im socially awk<br><br>not fat, not ugly, not manlet tho</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  its because you look you like the homosex  just watch this<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=-vi<wbr>MLaobEco</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br><br>this will answer everything OP</br></br>  i dont do it, i am 18 year old virgin and not planning on having sex with any human being.  bump  <br>it's not necessarily easy, but after you do it and get older, you just realize that it's not a big fucking deal. the mystery is gone, and with it, some of the anticipation, excitement and novelty. After a while, it becomes simple: get laid, get a sandwich. <br><br>Still difficult to get laid because social interactions are complex, awkward or not, but the pressure isn't as high as when you're a virgin. After a relationship, sex mostly becomes an attempt to get over that last person/get back out there, so it's a new pressure all together... fill the hole that was a person you probably grew incredibly tired of fucking, but now miss because you aren't, in the present second, fucking anyone at all.<br><br>So, yeah, I guess life is just one big worry about sex, but to answer your question, it's not as big of a deal as you think, but you won't believe that for yourself until you try it, fall head over heels for someone, then eventually learn to hate them, or find out they hate you. Then, from there, you'll probably aim to get laid to forget them.<br><br>Or you'll find someone you love, which many people also do, and hopefully you'll make that last. That's a beautiful thing, and if you're lucky enough to find that, your main worry will be keeping it together. <br><br>Anyways, good luck!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sometimes I just think people like you try too hard,<br>People can tell when you're acting different to get the girl, if you honest to god just be yourself, and don't give a shit, eventually you'll either get a girl or change yourself.<br>Up until my last year of middle school I never even hung out with girls, but I was a generally nice and polite guy, so eventually shit worked out. Throughout highschool I fucked around with tons of chicks, if you hang around girls a lot, eventually you'll fuck atleast one of them. As long as you're not being weird about it, shit should just work out. Just chillax, be yourself, don't be a dick, take care of yourself, pretend you're not really weird, because just between you and me:<br> That's what everyone else does, we're all weird as fuck </br></br></br></br>  <br>this bro here OP</br>  Hello OP. I've been with literally two hundred girls over the past five years, and I'll tell you how. Download the app called Backpage Cruiser, then set it to your location. Then go to "adult", then "escorts", then pick one you like and call them. Incall=you go to them, outcall=they go to you. Enjoy.  Getting laid isn't easy. But it also isn't hard. People want to have sex. That means women want to have sex, because women are people too. Don't buy into the all-women-are-evil bullshit that gets spouted around here. The trick is simple: you have to talk, you have to fake confidence if it doesn't come natural, and most inportat: STOP GIVING A SHIT.<br><br>That's it. You could get laid tomorrow if you did all that. I know it takes time to get there, it took me years. But you're 19, you're a child--I lost my virginity at 20. I'm 32 married have a kid and another on the way now. Stop being a beta faggot cuz all that does is waste your own life. Literally no one else cares, so you better fucking start.</br></br>  <br>getting laid is easy- just do some bodybuilding, find a house party, and walk in with some cocaine and Xanax and girls pretty much start rubbing all over you. the hard part is coping with the life-long humiliation of having a 4.5" penis that's physically incapable of stimulating a physical orgasm</br>   walk up to woman <br> yell HELLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO NURSE! <br> Pick her up over my shoulder <br> take her into bathroom stall of Albert and have my way with her </br></br></br>  <br>Dumb shit. Give a woman an orgasm with your mouth and she won't give a fuck about your size or if you last 5 seconds.</br>  <br>I second this...<br> or just read The Game </br></br>  Work on yourself. Dont worry about it. The more you like yourself the more attractive you will be to women. Being a 19 year old virgin isnt abnormal anyway. Youre fine mate. Right on track  Try approaching women with a set goal to fail at getting them to sleep with you.<br>This is how i got over the fear of failing to fuck bitches back in high school.<br>You're just afraid of looking like an idiot, or worried that who you are isn't good enough.<br>Seriously go start talking with random women without the objective being anything positive, and then you won't care when the outcome is unfavorable.<br>This way you will learn that rejection is no big deal, and you then can relax, be natural, and confident with random women.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, seriously, this dude's right. Like he said, most guys try too hard. They offer flowers or gifts. They pay 200 dollars at dinner, and then turn around and flip out when a girl's not interested in bedding them. <br><br>Well, let's break it down for a minute. When you spend that money on a girl, or buy her something, what are you really telling her? You're telling her that you don't value yourself, and that you need to offer her gifts in order to achieve her interest. Then, with that, you come with expectations. For a familiar example: do you know people who come up to you and sweet talk you for a minute or two, and then, after they've been chatting your ear off, ask you for a favor? My dad did/still does this shit all the time. It's obnoxious, and after a while, people catch onto your bullshit. They stop listening to you, especially if you're saying "nice" things, and they wait for the punchline. "Hi, sammy, isn't the weather just delightful." Yes, yes, I'm thinking, you are full of shit, little robert. "Oh, and also, Sammy, can you take out the trash?" At some point, you just want to say, fuck you, get to your favor. <br><br>It's the same way with beta males. Women pick up on your bullshit just as much as you know your dad's going to ask you to take out the trash. You might go through a hundred pleasantries, and offer a thousand gifts, but she--or he or it--knows what you're after. That IS NOT attractive. Just as I'm less likely to do the trash if I'm approached in this manner, I'm definitely not interested in dating you. <br><br>This type of communication exposes two things: 1) on the most basic level, you're indirect; you feel the need to bury your true desires within an incentive: a nice message or a gift; sexually successful men clearly demonstrate their intentions; 2) you have low personal value; if you had high value, you would not need to level the scale, because it would already be tipped in your favor and she--or he or it--would have their legs open for you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>All</br>  <br>words to live by: every moles a practice hole; every holes a goal.</br>  <br>i think OP, like us all, meaned without paying bro</br>  Start aiming for girls that no other guy would bang. Bang her. Then go for a slightly more attractive girl, so on and so forth.  <br>trying too hard isn't just flower gifts and 200 bucks dinners bro<br>the thing is that often (me included in the past) we put them over ourselves. that's the highest price we could pay</br></br>  <br>take the red pill<br><br>focus on your own life, and eventually the pussy will come to you.<br><br>also, at 19 your hormones are raging like mad and making you put pussy on a pedestal and make it a #1 priority.<br><br>you don't realize it yourself yet, but when you get older you will understand how overpowering the hormonal drive to fuck something is as a teenager/young adult. (im 35 now)<br><br>modern feminist influenced society has made you this awkward, by making society uncomfortable and unwelcoming of you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i second this</br>  <br>Start doing meth. Lowers inhibitions, builds muscle mass, gives you a life experience that the kids you interact with now don't have, and it's fun on a bun</br>  <br>Dont listen to this faggot</br>  <br>nein nein nein</br>  <br>this. <br>I did this for almost 4 years. <br>I thought she was the only girl I wanted to be with, I would buy her everything she asked for. <br>I put her over myself the whole relationship and what did I get in exchange? I got to discover she was seeing other dudes, multiple times behind my back, also got pussy. <br>Like this anon said, that is indeed the highest price we could pay.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Seriously, this guy has some good advice and is spot on.<br><br>I've been on that side of the fence to some degree. Was a total /b/eta for the longest time. Anyways, I was fun to be around and a pretty chill guy, but I could act kind of weird sometimes (ADHD) and I was a super nice guy. I wouldn't flip my shit on girls, but I put that pussy on a pretty high pedestal. Anyways, I would fucking bend over backwards, do whatever they asked, pay for expensive shit to make them happy, etc. You know what it got me? Two shitty, clingy, crazy girlfriends. Second time was 10x worse than the last, and I hit rock bottom in my life because of her. <br><br>I did a lot of self reflection during this time I started looking at myself objectively, and realized how much of a social retard I was. You can be nice, but don't be whipped. Most girls don't want a guy who they can push around easily. It's emasculating, and they want a man. Just be chill around them. I used to tense up a lot whenever a girl was around, and I'd end up making a fool of myself as a result. If you're just chill and talk to them like it's no big deal, then they'll respond well as long as you're not a creep or super ugly. If you treat it like it's a big deal for you, they'll since that insecurity and be turned off. It's hard to get over your anxiety, I know, but you don't learn unless you try. <br><br>Think about whenever you were a kid. You didn't know anything, but you'd try shit out to see what happens. Whatever the result was, it didn't matter, you survived and you learned something. Seriously, the trick is to just start trying it out. Look up some guides on how to talk to girls, and then relax, and go out there and try it out. The more you do it, the more relaxed you and the easier it becomes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>its probably because you didnt watch this video. </br>  I've had sex with about 25 women, get laid by a different woman about 2-3 months.<br><br>Looks/body increases your appeal, but its your personality that seals the deal. Initiative, then follow through.<br><br>A lot of the time its dumb luck, being in the right place at the right time.<br><br>About 1/5 of the population does not have sex frequently. Its not that hard to get laid, but I can see why its hard for some people.<br><br>Oh, and money. Money unlocks high-tier women and girlfriends that put out on the regular.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's because you never learned the social skills to. I was in the same boat. As you grow up, most kids interact with the opposite sex in high school. That's where they get comfortable around and with the other sex. The reason why they did is because they faced their fears and just put themselves out there. They saw it wasn't so bad, so they got more comfortable with socializing. You never experienced all the cringe from high school dates, dances, and sexual experimentation. You never learned that shit, so you don't understand it. It's so unfamiliar that you have no concept of how to approach it. It's understandable, but can be easily fixable. <br><br>A big help is researching online how to interact with people in a social setting. A lot of /b/eta guys never learn how to properly socialize or make friends. They literally just don't know what to say or what they're supposed to say. No experience, so no knowledge of what to do. This is an issue because people don't break it down into step-by-step guides for us to understand.<br><br>Anyways, some tips: Be hygienic (white teeth, smell good, showered, nicely haircut), wear some decent clothes (ditch b-ball shorts and a t-shirt, try and look more mature), and chill out and relax. I had some mental disorders that stunted my social growth (major depression, ADHD, anxiety), but meds helped make me feel normal. Some xanax also took the edge off the first awkward tries. After going out, trying, and then reflecting on what I learned, I was able to develop a game.<br><br>A tl;dr guide that I read once that completely changed how I interacted with people and made friends<br><br> continued </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> but its your personality that seals the deal.

I'm impressed /b/ .  <br> A lot of /b/eta guys never learn how to properly socialize or make friends. <br><br>i dont agree with this.<br><br>its more that the world has changed in a way that a standard young male has to jump through all kinds of hoops to be socially accepted.<br><br>its not so much a matter as "not having learned" as it is "not having learned how to behave superficially in this fucked up feminised and emasculated society that supports negative values, bitchiness and lack of camaraderie and mutual respect"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>both of you are still thinking on her terms, and putting the woman on a pedestal.</br>  DUBS GET  <br>haha a lot of my friends read The Game and were all about it for a while. They had some mild success with it.</br>  <br>no we arent<br>we're saying shes only going to consent if she likes your personality, looks dont get you laid. they just make it a bit easier. Are you a fucking rapist or something?&gt;</br></br>  <br>stop being a beta and having respect for women your age, make a move stop being a faggy nigger who wants to fuck goats just fuck bbitches who cares how hairy their pussies are. fuck these sluts as hard as ever. thats all they want. they just want to know that they are inferior and that your male dominance of them is practically normal so they will secretly be your bottom bitches but you can easily replace them every 2 months.</br>  <br>yeah it just comes down to initiative really<br><br>the game is helpful but eventually most people get over it</br></br></br>  <br>So basically, here's a 3-step guide on making friends. It's important to stay warm and friendly during this. Don't just stand there stone faced, show some animation; smile.<br><br>Step 1: Initiating contact. Here you lead with an icebreaker to start a conversation. This consists mostly of small talk. Your conversation topics should be light and easily agreeable by both parties. Something related to the environment you're both in is a good place to start. i.e. weather, a class, food, music, just something that's in your environment that you both can relate to and talk about. Be sure to introduce yourself soon after you break the ice. During this step, both of you will (probably subconsciously) be judging each other based off their appearance, way they project themselves, talk, etc. If they're seemingly willing to converse (not just giving one word or short answers, seems warm and friendly), then keep going. If not, just stop after you find a place in the conversation.<br><br>Step 2: Real conversation. Here's where you start to get a little more personal. You start to talk about your life more, likes and dislikes, hobbies, etc. Maybe even share a short (very short) story. If you find that you disagree on a lot of things, that's a good indicator that it won't work out. <br><br>Step 3: This the make-or-break step. You should be getting along well at this point. Talk about some things you want to do with your life, some hopes and aspirations. Gives you a good look at the other person and what they're like, a lot more personal. A lot of social awkwardness comes from guys jumping to step 2. This is awkward, as you're just a stranger. You gotta warm them up to you first, if they like you, then the conversation will progress. Anyways, eventually after a while you both need to go. Then you just see if they want to chill sometime. Like hey man, we should get a beer sometime. <br><br>Easy as that. Just go through these steps in your head every time you want to talk to someone.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Legit insight on 4chan. Listen to this man.</br>  Lurking /b/ and learning stuff. Daayuum.  <br>Dude. If I can get laid, you have no fucking excuse. GET TO IT FAGGOT!</br>  <br>No, that's not it. People can "socialize" through their computers and it's much easier to do so, as you never have to experience much fear of rejection. A lot of socially awkward guys spend a lot of time on the computer. They never step outside of their comfort zone, so they never learn, and they use the internet as a crutch for their loneliness and anxiety.<br><br>Getting a girl hasn't changed much at all. There are no new hoops to jump through. You just have to be able to socialize - something that everyone had to learn before computers and telephones. Not being ripped or good looking or superficial has little to do with it. You just have to be clean and have confidence. You can find attractive girls that will give you a chance as long as you're clean, not weird/have confidence, can socialize, and not hideously ugly. <br><br>Seriously man, I know girls who have turned down guys for being too nice and then turn around and make fun of them. It's not because they're ugly, it's because they try too hard and come off as creepy and clingy. Just act like a man. You don't need to woo them with all this shit that /b/etas think that they want. Just be chill and see if they want to hang. See where shit leads to. If it works out, great, if not, then move on. Women are a dime a dozen, just like men are. You can always find someone if you put yourself out there.<br><br>Think about it, you're trying to sell yourself. You're like a car. A lot of guys shy away from being social and interactive, thus never putting themselves out on the floor. Sure, they'll see a glimpse of you in the back somewhere, but they don't pay much attention. Then there are the shitty cars that try and overcompensate. They put themselves out there, but it's still a shitty car. You just need to act normal and put yourself out on the floor. Someone will come by and buy you eventually.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You should write relationship books anon</br>  <br>you are changing your behavior to accommodate women, as if they somehow should be treated differently than other males.<br><br>thats putting women on a pedestal.<br><br>i agree completely your personality is what matters, but you are trying to present yourself as someone you are not, acting in a way you are not, whereas i am saying be yourself and treat her exactly as you would anyone else.<br><br>its a small conceptual difference but a significantly different outlook.<br><br>dont change yourself for anybody. least of all a woman you don't even know yet.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>see<br><br><br>you missed my central point, and are having a reflexive reaction to what you THINK my point was, which is obscuring you from realizing what im actually saying.<br><br>its not that men are not "learning" how to fit into society.<br><br>its that men are not taught, or afforded, how to socialize, or a place in society, unless they "act" in a way that puts women on a pedestal.<br><br>i think we agree overall, but my focus is on not blaming young men for "failing to socialize" as if they haven't tried.<br><br>the blame is on society being quite hostile and limiting on young men by placing all kinds of expectations on how they should change themselves to please women.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>fair enough.<br><br>but consider, how often do women do this.<br><br>they don't.<br><br>they just passively wait for it to happen to them.<br><br>why are men the only ones socially required and expected to jump through hoops?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The only problem with this is that if that girl rejects you, then you're going to feel like the ugliest piece of shit out there. I feel like the anxiety/fear is what prevents a lot of people from trying. Emotions and feelings trump logic for a lot of people. No matter how stupid it is and how reality is completely different, it can't change the way you feel until you step outside of your comfort zone.<br><br>I would try steadily doing things that you're not comfortable with. A friend of mine did this and became a stud. He just started saying yes more often and facing his fears. Start small. Think of some things that you wouldn't want to do in front of people, and then try them out. Once you conquer those, then you can move on and shit will become easier. There's less risk involved too, like there is when it comes to asking out a girl. Work your way up to more and more risk of embarrassment.</br></br></br>  you guise are all retarded. who the fuck cares if you are a virgin or not. just focus on your person goals which do not involve women. why the fuck do people care so much about getting laid. i will never understand it.  <br>being rejected leads to disappointment, but its not something that is caused by the other person, its caused by ones own expectations crumbling.<br><br>if your job application is rejected, you will feel dissappointed and your confidence will be shaken, but its not personal from the other party.<br><br>i think what many young men are afraid of, rightly so, is the accompanying insults, joking and other cruel things some women do in conjunction with turning a man's approaches down.<br><br>and for good reason.<br><br>if a young guy gets particularly unlucky and is snubbed viciously by a string of women he has tried to approach, this starts eroding his confidence and trust in people (and in particular, women).<br><br>being turned down is not the issue.<br><br>being turned down, insulted, ridiculed and regarded as a creep/disgusting inhuman shit/joke of society, is the issue.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We do agree overall to a degree, but I don't feel like it's putting it on a pedestal. It's just you learning to do what you should've been taught in the first place. It's not even just how you should approach women, you should approach all people like this.<br><br>What I'm saying is that society isn't being any more hostile than it used to be. The expectations haven't changed, they're the same as they've always been. Act normal and be confident.</br></br></br>  21 year old virgin with Autism Spectrum Disorder here to make you feel better.<br><br>It's difficult to become more fucked up than me.</br></br>  <br>  It's not even just how you should approach women, you should approach all people like this. <br>men don't require from other men that they are approached in the tentative way you outlined.<br><br>women, however, do.<br>they are socialized into thinking "this is how it has to happen or that guy is a creep".<br><br>the whole situation panders to the woman, and puts her on a pedestal by affording her special considerations that they in turn DONT afford to men.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>u fit in quite well on /b/</br>  <br>That was implied and what I meant by embarrassment. Getting rejected isn't the issue, it's all the thoughts and feelings that flood afterwards. That's why I said you should work your way up. Try things in a public setting that you wouldn't normally do.<br><br>Also you can kind of weed out girls who seem like they would be more likely to ridicule you asking them out. Your gut isn't always accurate, but you can usually tell the nicer/normal girls from the mean/bitchy ones.</br></br></br>  <br><br>yeah, you are fucked, my friend.<br><br>women are emotional thinkers and communicators.<br>they dont listen to the content of what you are saying, they listen to how you say it, in what context, and apply their own imaginary filters on it in an effort to understand and speculate on your INTENT, rather than on the actual substance of your communication.<br><br>they also communicate themselves outwardly using that same scheme, and expect you to understand and psychically read their INTENT, rather than the actual content of what they are saying.<br><br>its a paradox between the sexes.<br>i dont know if its genetic, or socialized into us, but its definitely there.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I been socially awkward my hole life  <br>I get what you're saying, I think a lot of confusion stems from my outline. It wasn't an outline on how to get a girl, more-so friends in general. It could be applied to women, but it's not very flirty.<br><br>I get what you're saying though. The way society is, guys are expected to initiate contact usually. It is frustrating, because whether or not you're attractive, if you're not social and outgoing, you'll seem weird and girls won't want to talk to you. It's crazy. I can't tell you how many times I've been quieter in a class and no one wants to speak to me, and then in other classes I'll be more warm and inviting, initiate shit, and everyone wants suddenly feels like talking. Everyone's afraid of talking, but if someone breaks the silence first then people feel more comfortable to talk to you.<br><br>I don't view it as putting it on a pedestal, though. Unless you're severely changing your personality for a girl and obsessing over them, belittling yourself in comparison, etc, then I don't view it as putting her on a pedestal. It's a necessity that almost all guys do if they want to get girls. So if it were the case, we'd all have them on pedestals.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>well dayum. that makes me feel much better to be a virgin male not associating with superior females.</br>  <br>was expecting project GO</br>  <br> &gt;Also you can kind of weed out girls <br><br>This would definitely be a good thing.<br><br>Guys, especially when young, are so desperate for some pussy (both hormonally and due to social expectations of performance and stature), that they swallow a lot of shit from bitches who honestly don't deserve being told even the time of day (as they are more or less pretty terrible, selfish, cuntish people).<br><br>I think again, that draws back to the common denominator we both agree on.<br><br>That women should not be treated any differently than men. The conceptually hard part to understand there, is to realize just how much we really are putting women on a pedestal and giving them special privileges in social interaction.<br><br>By doing so, we put young men on the backfoot, and systemically disadvantaged in social interaction, compared to women.<br><br>This obviously leads to a great deal of failures for young men, and then they start to wonder whether they themselves are just completely inadequate, shit and unworthy of a woman, ever.<br><br>Compare that to how we celebrate ALL women, and call them heros, empowered, strong etc when they make even the smallest achievement, and help them up, pander them and console them when they fail.<br><br>We dont do that for men.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>think of it this way.<br><br>you are an autist in the sense you have difficulty understanding unliteral social invectives.<br><br>most women, however, are equally handicapped, because they are incapable of focusing on the substance and content of social interaction, but instead speculate on and imagine the INTENT of it (which is invariably wrong, because they are not psychic). What makes it worse, is they also expect YOU to understand their intent, without them ever actually expressing it directly (expecting you to psychically somehow infer and understand it nonetheless)</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The answer to your opening question is yes</br>  <br>r u telling me that i am as dumb as a woman because i am asexual and only want to pursue my intellectual endeavors? plus, humans no longer need sex to pass on DNA so it does not matter to me.</br>  <br>treating women any differently than you would any of your male comrades, is putting them on a pedestal.<br><br>now reflect on how much of that we really do.<br><br>very few women react well if you treat them as you would any other bro. they EXPECT special treatment.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Agreed. There are a lot of girls who are really superficial, vapid, and bitchy. They're the girls that you think you want, but really aren't worth it.<br><br>Yeah, unfortunately too many guys look at women as if they're a whole other species. But in reality they're just a person, just like you. Most of them have similar wants, and a lot of them want a guy. Once I started interacting with girls more, I was shocked at how many were single and wanted a guy. There are just as many single women as there are men. Unfortunately, young men are often duped into thinking that all women are greek goddesses and superior beings. Guys talk shit about girls to their guy friends just like girls do vice-versa. In the end, there are so many people out there, if you get rejected by one it doesn't even matter. They'll forget about you in 5 minutes unless you do something cringey that's particularly noteworthy.</br></br></br>  25yr old virgin here. This thread just might change my life.  <br> females <br> superior beings <br>kek</br></br></br>  <br>Just to clarify, this guy isn't the autistic guy. Too bad there's no ID anymore.</br>  <br>im saying you are incapable of understanding non-literal communication, because you lack the empathic capacity to emulate their emotional communication.<br><br>women, however, are incapable of understanding that when you say 1+1=2, you are saying just that, and only that. infact they dont even care WHAT you said. they are concerned with understanding WHY you said it.<br><br>its a result of their emotional communication.<br>they want to know your emotions, not what you are actually saying. <br><br>they communicate on the points of intent, not on the points of content,</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dude, that's not how it works. You cannot treat women--or anyone you're interested in, for that matter--like your buddies. You do not, I repeat DO NOT, want to fuck your buddies. If you do, that's cool, too, but you probably don't. <br><br>For that reason, you better realize that you're socialization should be vastly different than a night out with the boys watching the game. You aren't going to lean in and whisper into their ears, you aren't going to initiate physical contact (except maybe high fives, etc, but probably not in intimate areas), and you aren't going to engage in flirtation. <br><br>On its most basic level, verbal flirtation indicates your interest to a potential mate. You don't flirt with your buddies. You share insiders, you shoot the shit, you pass time. This is boring. But it's okay, because once again, you're not trying to fuck your buddies.<br><br>If, however, you are trying to fuck that blonde that someone invited to the big game at the house--that one stunner in the corner that's texting how bored she is of all these lugheaded idiots who treat her like "one of the guys"--then you better find a way to get her off that phone. If you think that means asking her what she thinks of good old Tim Tebo--unless that's the nickname for your cock, of course--then you're probably going home alone, stroking your Tim Tebo at the end of the night. That's what happens when you treat women like one of the boys.<br><br>The dude next door, the one who decided to lean in, to whisper flirtatious shit in her ear, and actually showed initiative and RISK, might end up taking her home. Or maybe he's just, as you say, one of the boys.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's not what I was saying, though. I wasn't saying to treat them any differently. I mean obviously you have to flirt with them, as you wouldn't do that to a guy (unless you're into that). What I was saying is that the same rules for socializing apply to both girls and boys. Just being chill and confident. I know that I'm not likely to be friends with a guy if he's socially awkward. Exactly what I've been saying is to not treat them any differently. A lot of guys who have trouble with girls have trouble socializing in general, which is the angle I've been approaching.</br>  <br>You seem educated on this topic. Psychology major?</br>  <br> There are just as many single women as there are men <br><br>Superficially true, its not the entire truth.<br><br>Truth is that most women cycle through the same relatively smaller pool of males.<br><br>Whereas there are far more males who genuinely never even get in on that.<br><br>Understand what I mean?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>man this should be screencapped, everbody is just as weird, the cools kids just hide it. I caught dirt on everybody just because I knew a variety of people and close with dealers, and skipped to much class so i saw it all</br>  <br>You are putting women on a pedestal, and affording them special treatment.<br><br>That inversely implies that you are somehow innately inferior, and have to change your behavior inorder to accomodate these special creatures with special priviliges and special needs.</br></br></br>  <br>that is exactly why almost all progress in human history has been made by men. <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=-vi<wbr>MLaobEco</wbr>  [ ] <br><br>after watching this video, i understand.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I understand what you mean. But the point I'm getting at is that the pool can get bigger. No one's preventing you from getting in but yourself. There are a lot of single ladies, and they'll date you if you act normal.</br>  <br>i studied 2 years of psychology, yes.<br><br>autism is what it is.<br>anyone can read about it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope you're not referring to the image</br>  i am a girl, and you guise are making me so horny.  <br>the point is again, that this is because women are put on a pedestal.<br><br>that smaller group of guys is treating them "differently", which fits the women's perception of how they feel they should be treated differently than males.</br></br></br>  <br>No, that's how it works with anyone, woman or man, gay or straight, when you're expressing interest. It's the way a woman flirts with an attractive man, too. It just depends what your goal is. Do you want to take a shot at getting laid--like an active shot--or do you want to wait and see what happens?</br>  <br>Show confidence, fuck. Hard ain't it m8?</br>  <br>  If you think that means asking her what she thinks of good old Tim Tebo--unless that's the nickname for your cock, of course--then you're probably going home alone, stroking your Tim Tebo at the end of the night. <br><br>No, that's EXACTLY what you do. Anything more, you are putting her on a pedestal. Anything less, then you're at risk of actually treating her like a bro. Asking a question like that is the perfect way to break the ice.</br></br></br>  <br> I'm not likely to be friends with a guy if he's socially awkward <br><br>why not?<br><br>why do you have such demanding social expectations of other people?<br><br>i have many friends who are socially extremely awkward. its not a problem for me, as i am concerned with who they are, not on their social niceties.<br><br>thats exactly what im talking about.<br><br>you put these expectations on other males, but you dont apply them to women.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ask yourself sincerely:<br><br>do you treat women differently than you treat men?</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Show confidence <br><br>Why is this never said to women?</br></br></br>  <br>No.<br><br>-- Yours sincerely</br></br></br>  <br>This Daniel?</br>  <br>he knows</br>  quints get  <br>You answered in 46 seconds.<br><br>That is not adequate time for you to have sufficiently considered the question and reflected on your behavior.</br></br></br>  <br>If you treat everyone the same, then it's like we're living in a communist society. Part of the social game is presenting yourself in a way so as to attract whoever it is that you want to attract. Whether it be male friends, female friends, or prospect dates. You change yourself a little bit to make yourself appealing to them. Everyone has to compromise a little bit, not many people are the exact same and will universally except you.<br><br>I've been saying that a lot of guys have issues socializing in GENERAL, not limited to only girls. I'm not saying to change a huge part of your personality. I'm saying that you need to learn to socialize and interact with society, not just girls. If you can socialize fine in the first place, then you don't have to work on making yourself normal for girls. Being able to socialize isn't some big demand by society, it's been a function of human and animal behavior for forever. I'm saying that a lot of people lack this in the first place. and therefore can't interact with girls. If they just learn how to socialize in general, then everything else will come more easily. I don't view it as putting it on a pedestal. You're not singling girls out, you're just like I want a girl, I'm going to try and get one, but if one doesn't like me it doesn't matter because there are millions more.</br></br></br>  <br>thanks, watson</br>  <br> inb4 he plans on having sex with his pets or his stuffed animal <br> inb4 he's probably already done that </br></br>  ITT: Autistic Weeaboo faggots  <br>anon I have the same problem as u it's a good thing u made this thread so I can get some advice here</br>  <br>nope, just jerk off.</br>  I think i have the saddest situation.

Know lot's of people, did drugs for many years with the 'cool crowd' but still virgin. <br><br>25 here.. seems like at aroun 19-22 i felt i was worthless piece of shit, undeserving of pussy so i tried to steer cleer as much as i could. 23 i started wanting it, but just feel awkward approaching women. <br><br>It's like i kind of know what to say, but there is a block. When it is time to say hi to one i don't know i freeze and end up not doing it.</br></br></br></br>    <br>No, I apply them to women too. If they're really socially awkward, I more than likely won't want to be friends with them. I'll associate with them, sure, but they just aren't the type of people that I want my friends to be. It's my right to invite whoever I want into my life.<br><br>That being said, it's also in part from past personal experience. Sure, some social awkwardness is ok. But if it's difficult to interact with them in the first place. there's no point wasting your time and energy on a person who you don't enjoy and you can't try and change their life.<br><br>In the past, guys who I've hung out with who are severely awkward just drag the entire group down. They do weird things, reflect negatively on the group, chase girls away, etc. These people are very obviously not able to socialize well. Like I said, I can handle it to an extent, but I've got some cringe stories from some weird guys.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you are confusing changing or improving yourself, with treating one sex differently than an other.<br><br>basic extreme example:<br>do you treat a man in a dress the same as you do a woman in trousers?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I'm not talking about treating one sex differently than the other, I'm saying to improve yourself. Bingo, perfect way to summarize it.</br>  <br>How old are you, may I ask?<br><br>Im 35 myself.<br><br>I was unpopular and called a faggot at schoolntill me and my d&amp;d group started having wild house parties cos we had understanding parents. Everything changed then.<br><br>Ive fucked some 30 women since then, and dont have difficulty approaching women, because i understand how they communicate and think.<br><br>But its exactly because i do understand, that I also see how differently women are treated, and how they also EXPECT to be treated differently.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yes, but its latent in your posts and sentiment that you acknowledge women expect special treatment.<br><br>men are required to do that. women instead are instructed to change their hair or wear a pushup bra.</br></br></br>  <br>i am 18 year old virgin and i dont care at all at this point. should i care?</br>  <br>THIS</br>  <br>Pretty much this. If you find someone who you truly love then sex isn't that much of a top priority. Lost my virginity at an abnormally young age and at this point sex is fun with my current girlfriend, but I would rather do other stuff with her other than just fucking. I honestly think if you just go and fuck everything you want then life will be dull when you finally try to settle down because it'll be too boring for what you're used to.</br>  <br>dont care.<br><br>as you get older you will realize how blinding the social and hormonal drive to get pussy is, and how unequal the playing field in terms of the hoops a man has to jump through to get it is, compared to women who have the ideal position of just choosing among them.<br><br>same thing in nature in many species.<br>the males have to perform elaborate rituals, compete, and often have physical features specifically designed to make their approach more desirable to a demanding yet passive female.<br><br>in nature, females are plain as fuck. no color, no elaborate rituals.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>22 and in college. I'm not saying that I won't give awkward people a chance, because I will. I've brought awkward guys to parties, put them around a bunch of chicks that they can flirt with, etc. Sometimes I'll even give them some advice. They almost never take it. It just ends up not being worth my time if they can't learn fast. They'll either change and someone else will pick them up, or they won't and that's their life.<br><br>I didn't mean to be inconsistent, but that was the point I was getting at. And yes, to an extent. But like I've been saying, I don't view that as putting them on a pedestal. You're expected to initiate contact and flirt with them. How is that putting them on a pedestal? Putting them on a pedestal insinuates that they're some great item. Initiating contact and flirting with them is just something that 9 times out of 10 you have to do. If you don't then you won't get any girls. You can give them special treatment to an extent and not have it hoist them onto a pedestal. You don't get girls by treating them like a bro, that's how you get friend zoned.</br></br></br>  isaac newton never had sex. try to win the debate now. <br><br>protip: you can't</br></br>  <br>putting an awkward guy in a group of women is not helping him at all.<br><br>what he needs is just your friendship and support so he can be seen as accepted and with a tribe when he is there. that alone will increase his own confidence, and he will be seen as more confident by women.<br><br>understand what i mean?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Neither did Tesla. Sex or greatness, pick one</br>  <br>thanks anon. i agree 100%.</br>  <br>greatness. but does watching porn also hold you back?</br>  Does /b/ want a story? fresh OC  <br>Yes, as said, women require and expect special treatment.<br><br>this is a huge problem for young males who are socialized to perceive them as equals, yet paradoxically expected to treat them differently.<br><br>this leads to false interpretations of what social niceties they should do, and them putting them on a pedestal with themselves as somekind of unworthy petitioner at her majesties feet, rather than as kings in their own right, with equal demands and expectations.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I get what you mean. However, it's not like we would throw him to the wolves. Would give him tips, try and make him feel welcome and comfortable. Chill environment, etc. One time it's a fluke, 6 times and it's a problem.<br><br>Let me give you an example. Go to a party at a friend's frat. Meeting up with some girls that I <br>met at an undie run (mainly something that happens at Californian universities, exactly as it sounds). We chill, try and get him and his friend something to drink. Introduce them to people, ask them some questions etc. Both are awkward. Awkward guy 1 takes his friend home because he's too uncomfortable. Comes back as my friend and I are going back to his place with some girls. He tags along. Get back to his place, friend goes to his room with a girl, while the rest of us hang in the living room. <br><br>Dude tries to jump into the conversation but is awkward and comes off rapey. Tries to hit on this one girl. Tries to put his arm around her, she moves to the couch that me and another girl are on. He waits a few minutes and then comes over closer, tries to touch her leg and flirt. Suddenly all 3 girls left get up and go to the bathroom. While they're in there he spreads himself out so he's laying on both couches and they'll have to sit near him. One takes what's left of the couch by me, the other two sit on the floor. He tries to usher one to the couch but she say she wants to sit. Says she's the girl and says no, he says, "I'm the man and I say yes."<br><br>Then they made up some bs excuse for me to take them back to the frat. Dropped 2 of them off, bounced with the other one, and the awkward guy went home.<br><br>Just an example. 20 million times more awkward irl, and more awkward stories</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>porn is a great equalizer in sex.<br><br>honestly, i dont trust a woman who doesnt watch porn. it means she has deep seated and complex inhibitions and a very complicated attitude on her own sexuality.<br><br>if you can find a woman who watches porn and/or masturbates a great deal, you got a winner. sex is not a moral impediment then, and she is more likely to relate to you as a person, rather than perceive you as someone only begging for her pussy.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Approach all females the same as you would a guy unless you want to pursue them. Simple as that. Not too much to learn. Just learn how to socialize and how to flirt. Both are used in different circumstances. You want to be friends with a girl? Then treat her like a friend, same as everyone else. Want to fuck her? Flirt with her, be confident, but don't take it too seriously.<br><br>I get what you're saying, I just feel like people make it out as a bigger problem than it actually is. It's just learning how to socialize with different groups.</br></br></br></br>  Is anyone going to publish this thread?  <br>i still maintain my previous point, though i understand your good intentions.<br><br>you do them a great disservice.<br>no way is an awkward guy going to score amidst a cackle of women. they will just pick him apart and at worst, start mothering him.<br><br>just be his bro and stand with him as one of your own. this makes him more confident, and makes women perceive him as worthy of consideration.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Someone probably should</br>  <br>Because we've never taught them to be anything but passive. Men are willing to do all the competing for them.</br>  <br>i disagree.<br><br>approach all women as you would a man.<br>women ultimately make the decision who they want.<br><br>dont demean yourself to treating them any different, but do pay attention and recognise when a woman starts making overtures of being interested.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I've been on that side of the fence as well, so I can sympathize. While not as creepy, I definitely had issues flirting and socializing with girls. I would have girls interested in me and I'd end up ruining it so hard that it makes me cringe. I just didn't know how to get a girl and would miss signs all of the time. Took me a lot of time working on myself to get to where I'm at now.<br><br>I try and stand by them, but there are a lot of factors that come into play. There are a lot of awkward guys out there, and I can't take them all under my wing. If one shows promise and we get along well as friends, then I'll do it.<br><br>I feel like I give it a shot. I give them the opportunity, I give them openings. Sometimes it works out, but more often than not, it doesn't. I help when I can, but if they have a lot of issues and we're not even a good match as friends, it's not worth my time.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>deep</br>  <br>yes</br>  <br>this.<br><br>with preferential treatment, weve made ourselves beggars at the foot of a pussies throne, rather than kings in our own right, equally worthy of respect, consideration, and a womans pursuit.<br><br>nash's competetive theories support this.<br><br>collectively we are making things much harder for ourselves, and empowering women over us by granting them preferential treatment.<br><br>women do not afford this to men reciprocally, unless you stand as the king of your own domain.<br><br>women often talk about confidence, but they dont see it like we do.<br><br>to them, confidence is a man who isnt afraid of being himself, and doesnt bend to her evrry whim.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I mean, you don't go up to them and immediately start winking at them and touching their leg. Approach them like you would in all situations, but if you're interested in one, go for it. Most girls will flirt back. Obviously you need to look for signs that she's not interested. But you can't just approach her like a man and expect for her to do the rest. You lose a lot of opportunities, as several women are timid and won't initiate flirting. Also some girls might not initially be interested in you, but once they see that you're confident and alpha they'll buy into it. Everyone likes attention. Even if they don't want to date you, as long as you're suave and not an ugly mofo, they'll flirt back.</br>  <br>TBH, if there's one change the fourth wave feminist movement could accomplish, changing this dating paradigm would have the longest-term consequences. All the male stereotypes they want to change are based on the alpha male behavior that dating sets up. The day a man can be beta as all hell and get picked up by a girl that's interested in him will be the day all the other issues feminists have start fading into the background.</br>  <br>Good post.<br><br>But whats also important to consider, which we often forget, is the womans role and responsibilities.<br><br>she also fucked up, and probably in a cringeworthy fashion, on her side, that she failed to reciprocate your efforts.<br><br>ee tend to see the guy as the failer, rather than considering what the woman also didnt do.<br><br>some women make the chase too hard and too convoluted, and ESPECIALLY when it comes to "nice guys".<br><br>thats why "douches" have more success.<br>they are braver, more direct, and take less shit, whereas nice guys keep begging for it as if they didnt deserve it, as if they where less than her, by putting her on a pedestal, which in turn makes her even more unnattainable.<br><br>keep it always in the back of your mind, that she needs to deserve you too, and that you also have equal value, and also can just as easily walk away or look down on her behavior.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Something constructive on 4chan?<br>On /b/?<br><br>How wonderfully surprising.</br></br></br>  <br>I mean, it still happens but it's rare. There's one guy I know who has a really attractive girlfriend. A solid 8/10, woodbury. Her boyfriend is a 4/10 neckbeard, no chin, dadbod, etc. They've been together for like a year and a half. Another guy is like a 2/10, super fat and ultimate neckbeard. Girlfriend is probably a 7-8/10. Very cute.<br><br><br>I mean, I feel actually like they put themselves out there and I didn't respond. A couple instances that stick out in my mind.<br><br>One time I met a girl in class. Hit it off really well, would talk every day after class even though she had a class. Several times she skipped her class just to stand there and chill with me. Very flirty, got along well. I was too awkward, came on too strongly (not really cringe and not creepy, just kind of inexperienced and desperate). Would text her and have some good convos, but I'd always blow it. I'd ask her to do something irl, and after a while I just too much of a social retard that she started backing out. I eventually just stopped keeping in contact with her. Wanted to date her but I was too much of a pussy even though she was into me.<br><br>Second time was with a friend. Didn't even know she was into me (a couple of my other friends liked her) until one night at a party. This was forever ago so I can't remember word-for-word. But, we were chilling at this party and she was talking to me about how she just really wanted a guy to make out with, and was giving me this look. Me, being the social retard that I was, didn't get the hint and said that she should make out with X (a friend that was into her). I'll never forget the look of disappointment on her face. She avoided me the rest of the night, hooked up with some guy and dated him for a few months. <br><br>But yeah, I getcha</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hopefully some internet warriors see this and use it. Or not, hey, more for everyone else.</br>  <br>hallelujah<br><br>flirting is a womans game.<br>they set the rules.<br>its a way to get to know you, judge your interest.<br>they are much better at it than men, also because its THEIR game. some women make it too difficult for you to follow, because they also set the pace of it, yet also expect you to (bravely and with risk) escalate it.<br><br>ultimately the irony is that the woman wants YOU to make the choice and commitment to pursue her and obtain her.<br><br>women dont want to feel like they made that choice, cos it makes them feel cheap and slutty. they want the man to make that choice for both of them, even if it means overstepping your bounds and possibly "offending" her.<br><br>as i said before, again, the best way is to always remember you are a king in your own right.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, you make a good point. When I got to high school I really started to decline socially. I developed major depressive disorder, anxiety, and (I already had it) my ADHD got worse. I ended up just being that nice kid who was shy but weird. People liked me, but I was just going through a lot. I wasn't on any meds (long story), and it wasn't until I got placed on them that my life got better. Completely turned it around.<br><br>It's crazy how complex it is picking up women. I still take some of the blame, as if I had been more experienced I would've seen the signals/taken action. I was inexperienced, though. Took me until I was almost 20 to completely get my shit together.</br></br></br>  <br> I mean, it still happens but it's rare. There's one guy I know who has a really attractive girlfriend. A solid 8/10, woodbury. Her boyfriend is a 4/10 neckbeard, no chin, dadbod, etc. They've been together for like a year and a half. Another guy is like a 2/10, super fat and ultimate neckbeard. Girlfriend is probably a 7-8/10. Very cute. <br>That's not exactly what I meant. We all know a few guys who scored women considered way out of their league. What I mean is women taking the initiative and asking the guy out before he asks her.<br><br>I don't mind admitting I'm off-the-scale beta and well into wizard status. Lots of reasons, but mostly lack of confidence from years of emotional abuse. The one time I even approached having a real relationship in college got be friendzoned; I'm pretty sure she was interested, but I lacked the nerve to ever ask her out on a real date, and she never took the initiative to ask me. Either of us could have asked the other and possibly went somewhere, but she'd been conditioned not to ask and I wasn't able to. THAT is the part I think we need to change.</br></br></br></br>  Damn it, why does /b/ only have decent conversations at such shit hours? It's very rare to see a good feels thread outside of 2-4 AM, and threads like this are even more rare.  <br><br>in addition, just had a thought about flirting compared to courtship in nature.<br><br>a flirt is basically her running from you in a forest, with you in interested horny animalistic pursuit.<br><br>you want her, she knows that.<br><br>she runs a bit, then shows her ass a bit in the forest, just to make sure you are still pursuing. chase continues and she kets you get closer and closer, keeping you interested with the occasional look back, flash of ass, or giggle.<br><br>if you go too fast, she assumes you are desperate, because instead you could be pursuing other females rather than her.<br><br>if you jump on her immediately, she basically assumes its rape impending.<br><br>if you do it right, you indicate enough lack of interest (because you could with all rights pursue another female and leave her feeling foolish), but enough animal interest that she is excited by it.<br><br>probably all of us guys should atleast pretend to be lost in the forest occassionally and to have lost sight of her, so she turns back a bit out of concern that you went after another femalw.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Confidence is your best bet, I'm not the best looking 20 year old out there but have been with a couple of girls this year. But yea that socially awkward thing needs to change</br>  <br>I've been there man. Like I mentioned before, I had a slew of mental disorders. I was very similar to yourself, just couldn't even bring myself to do it. Let to me having a couple of years of drug abuse. My first two girlfriends, only the first one I actually took the initiative. The second one, however, came onto me even when I was too awkward to kiss her. She had to ask to kiss me. Cringe, I know. Anyways, I learned a lot from that relationship and it eased a lot of my anxiety towards women. Like another poster commented, after that first nut it's not as big of a deal. <br><br>Anyways, both were super shitty relationships because I was so /b/eta. A lot of bad, but a lot of good came out of them. That first heartbreak breakup is the worst. So hard, especially after a long relationship. My advice: break up with your first girlfriend (unless she hits absolutely everything on your want list) after a couple of months. After that it becomes much, much more difficult to break up. Takes a lot more strength to do it, much more of a bond. Was so hard that first break up. You get over it, though. Just keep in mind that it's a small event in the grand scheme of things.</br></br></br>  <br>we are not used to direct women.<br><br>when a woman puts herself right in our path, it can be very perplexing and disorienting. i would assume women feel the same way sometimes with direct guys.<br><br>i suppose summed up, is remember flirting is the chase, and its important to only close in at her level of comfort, but taking the occassional risk she will be "offended"</br></br></br></br></br>  What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.  <br>haha dubs = winrar</br>  <br>Interesting thought. You definitely have to do a lot of calculating in the moment. Usually a carefree/dgaf attitude works for me. You kind of have to build up that instinct for what to do after a lot of trial and error.</br>  <br><br><br> :D</br></br></br>  <br><br>because you're betafag</br></br>  <br>Yeah we're definitely not used to direct women. It can be a bit of a curveball if you're inexperienced. Usually the better looking you are, the more likely women will take the initiative with you.</br>  <br>Good to know there's hope.<br><br>I recognized I was at rock bottom a few weeks ago, thanks in part to some real /b/ros. The lack of confidence and self esteem takes its toll in every aspect of my life, and it's taken me nearly a month to get into therapy. My first session is Monday, and I'm not quite sure what to expect. All I know is that it can't be worse than where I am now. I avoided the drug issues at least.</br></br></br>  first of all fuck eliot rodgers bitch ass. i go to school in santa barbara and that shit is real as fuck. i know people that were shot and some of them are no longer with us. The trick to getting girls is to not be discouraged by denial. if you put yourself out there and don't get discouraged by rejection, and just keep trying you will get pussy. it is not half as hard as you think. go on youtube check out simple pickup, and real social dinamics.  <br>When I was 19 I wasn;t getting laid often either but nowadays I am getting laid all the fucking time. <br>I have a 7.5" dick though. Once girls knew about it I had a bunch of fwb.<br><br>Long story short: don't lift, have a big dick<br>also, be just a generally cool dude. I dont mean cool but just be interesting. Lifting weights is BORING as fuck. Honestly people yawn when they hear about that. Just do something fun. Radiate fun. Women will come to you to have some fun with you<br><br>girls just want the same thing as guys man.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>confidence is a word thrown around a lot.<br><br>but what does it mean?<br><br>it means something very different to a man and a woman.<br><br>i would see women as perceiving confidence in a man as that you are not afraid to be somewhat direct, and also that you value yourself enough that you wont bow to her every whim.<br><br>women have very superficial and fleeting confidence. they are emotional creatures filled with self doubt and at the mercy of their emotions.<br><br>i cant overstate this enough.<br>remember you are a king, or atleast anprince, of your own domain.<br>your life and your choices are your own.<br><br>this is what women perceive as confidence.<br>that you are a man.<br><br>and thats what she wants, a man.<br><br>be a man.<br>we win some, we lose some, but its our choices and we take responsibility for them either way.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I went to therapy and got put on meds. My issues were very easily corrected with meds, but therapy gave me the tools to reconstruct my life. It's not always your fault, shit happens. What matters is that you better yourself; live up to your potential, otherwise you're wasting the glorious life that you could be living.<br><br>I got to rock bottom too. Flunked out of uni, lost all my friends, etc as my illness got worse. Was too anxious to get help until I got kicked out and hit rock bottom. Turned my life around, got readmitted, built up a social life, etc.<br><br>Just look at yourself objectively. What's not what you want it to be. Figure out what it is and identify the steps to change it. It's a slow process, but try breaking down things into smaller, more manageably bites. Do something different every day to improve yourself. Whether it be going out to the store and having a casual conversation at the check out, going to a party, etc. Break it down into less scary, smaller portions. And remember that it takes time. <br><br>We're often too afraid to try things. We get older, learn more about the world and its possibilities, and it scares us. When we're kids we try out everything and learn from it. It doesn't kill or (usually) scare us. We embrace that fear and step outside of our comfort zone. You got to get used to doing that. Keeping a sense of humor about you helps, too. Keeps you moving forward because you take everything worth a grain of salt.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i look like orlando bloom.<br>no shit, some women have wanted to fuck me just cos of the resemblance.<br><br>good looks can be a problem, as it makes women make you pursue them longer, as theybperceive you as inversely having a higher worth. they want to test how far you will run after them, how much this desirbale man wants them, because they equate that with their own self worth. if they can make a good loocking man chase for a long time, they feel all the more desirable.</br></br></br></br>  <br>i wouldnt say dgaf/carefree, though thats one way of approximating confidence.<br><br>id say more that dont forget your own self worth.<br><br>the world is full of women, and women know that.<br><br>keep your standards high in terms of how you are treated. dont make too many compromises, because it makes you seem weak. dont let her forget that she also has to be worthy of you, and that also is not automatic. she too has to come halfway to meet you, if she truly desires you too.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's a very good thought. If you're flat out ugly they'll find an excuse to get away.<br><br>I've been considered fairly attractive as well. Get hit on frequently, etc. Never knew how to handle it due to my inexperience. Was pleasantly surprised once I found out.</br></br></br>  <br>well, right now I have one that is dependent on me for emotional stability, so she is fucking trapped. That is how I get it.</br>  <br>I mean, what works for one person won't work for another. I'm confident and know that my life doesn't revolve around a girl or girls. A better way of saying it is that I just try and approach them comfortably.<br><br>But yes, keeping your self worth is important. I try not to be stubborn, but I know what I want in life.

I'm returning from a couple months in Cali, and I've had 8 (so far) who want to have sex (I'm too much of a man whore for anything else). Just work out and be confident and also not a nigger  <br>Live in Cali. Sloots everywhere. Hot too, especially in college towns. Some parts of SF where you walk around and all you see are models.<br><br>That being said, don't be so shallow minded. Some people have issues with these things. It's not as easy as making one or two decisions. It's a complex process. You may not have any experience with it, so it might not seem difficult to you. Consider yourself lucky. You have struggles in your life that are easy for some, just like others have struggles in their lives that are easy for you.</br></br></br>  Hey guys, would anyone be able to give a mate some tips about flirting/escalating a relationship? I'm really quite confident, and good at introductions, etc. But beyond the initial encounter I just flop and can't escalate it to where I would like it to go to. <br>e.g. I've been seeing a girl I made out with a few weeks ago, she's keen and I'm keen but I just don't know how to say without coming across too strong.</br>  <br><br>Most of my problem is that I'm not equipped to know what I need to change. It's not like I was normal and developed depression - I've always been this way. From my earliest memories as a kid I've been treated as worthless except for what other people can get from me. I can see happy people in relationships around me and I literally cannot comprehend how they all think they deserve each other. The very concept is alien to me, and I don't know how to change that.<br><br>I've pissed half my life away being nothing. People have dropped in and out of my life (or more accurately, I've dropped in and out of theirs) without leaving much of a ripple. I lost the one worthwhile thing in my life a few months back - my job - and those people are simply gone. Work was all I had in common with any of them, and their lives have moved on while mine hasn't. I've spent 37 years being an extra in other people's lives, and I don't know how to have one of my own.</br></br></br></br>  <br> advising OP to go after used goods like you </br>  <br>yes, its a paradox.<br><br>ugly men have the challenge of getting a woman to begin the chase based on character alone.<br><br>this is certai ly difficult, but also liberating compared to the good looking guy. ugly guy has nothing to lose, and everything to gain. this translates to women in a very interesting way, as they will obviously not concentrate on the superficial value of the man, but instead on who he is.<br><br>for a goodnlooking guy, beginning the chase is easier, but you have to run farther and faster, because the woman equates your perceived worth with her own, and thinks since you are a better catch, she has to run farther and faster to catch her, or else she is "cheaper" than you.<br><br>womens perception is inverted in this sense to males.<br><br>a good looking guy instead perceives he does not need to run as far and fast, he has other options. an ugly guy runs and chases like a motherfucker, which is very attractive to women, ehen done right.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's difficult and not easy to change. You have to really feel change and want it. Not even think about change, just want it. I would suggest reading some books by Dale Carnegie. Easy to get through and packed full of advice.<br><br><br>The thing is that the reality is that everyone pretty much deserves someone. Most people accept this, but you don't, even though it's a reality. It's just a concept that you're not familiar with, and it's hard to really get it without going through a relationship. <br><br>Sometimes you just need to think rationally, realize that it's all in your head, and not focus on that.<br><br>Focus on socializing. Utilize the internet. Searching for posts on reddit can be useful. Learn how to make friends, small talk, etc. Then learn how to flirt with girls. Practice in the mirror. Practice talking, flirting, etc. Do this in a way that you don't look weird, just look lively and fun and nice. Learn how to take good pictures. Learn how to groom yourself properly. Do a lot of self reflecting, think about everything and what you can improve. Practice what you learn. I don't know you personally, so there's only so much I can give.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks anon. You've helped a lot. I guess I'm hoping therapy will help with a lot of the things you've said as well.<br><br>It's 5 am here, and I really need sleep.</br></br></br>  <br>i understand bro.<br><br>but its never too late.<br><br>arguably only now are you infact coming into your prime, and as a man, you have the benefit of experience to now make the choices you want.<br><br>though you may not at the moment perceive it as such, your confidence is actually now better than it has EVER been before, as a result of your experiences.<br><br>all you now need to do, is stake your claim, retake your birthright as King of your own life, and make the choices you want, while accepting full personal responsibility, in good or bad, for it all.<br><br>that is the secret to being a man.<br>its not so ething anyone can take from you.<br>you still have it, you just have forgotten how to use it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A very interesting take. I know a lot of people assume that attractive people have an easy time, and that girls just flock to you. It's not the case. I've known some pretty attractive guys who bitch and complain, but in reality it's just their personality/lack of social skills that holds them back. If they're attractive and not getting chicks then they feel ugly, self-esteem goes down, just become more awkward, etc. It's a vicious cycle. Being attractive is just part of the game. If you don't seem approachable, you're not going to get anyone. It's awkward for them to approach an attractive guy who looks like a sourpuss, so of course they won't.<br><br>You could look like Brad Pitt, but if you sound like an idiot or strange in the first minute, they'll be turned off fast.<br><br>The mechanics of it all are really interesting. Interesting to think how many opportunities have been missed by people because of miscommunication/misunderstanding people.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No problem man, cheers. Seriously, utilize the internet. Ask questions on forums. Don't worry about what other people think, just think about yourself and what you want. Everyone's a salesman, everyone's selling themselves. You don't have to believe in yourself, you just need to make them think that you do.<br><br>Work out what you want in life and identify steps to getting there. Find out what your values are. It takes time, but eventually it'll all be worth it.<br><br>Cheers, have a good night.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Also, take a look at those around you. See what guys look like and compare yourself to them. Think about what you look like and what you could look like with work (if you don't already look after your appearance or are fat). Then look at the girls/people around them. Those are the type of people (in terms of looks) you'll have the most luck attracting (usually).<br><br>Be realistic about your looks, though. If you're a 4, maybe with the potential to be a 6, own up to it. Don't try and dilute yourself into thinking you're more attractive than you are just for your pride/ego. Otherwise you'll just live in a fantasy world. It's better to get laid and have someone in your league than to not get laid at all.</br></br></br>  <br>OP, listen to this guy.<br>I work out hard at the gym, but my fat slob buddy gets more pussy than I do and he does it with his "idgaf" attitude.</br></br>  <br>You are the sovereign ruler of your own life.<br><br>No judgement is worthy or understanding of your choices, except your own.
