Most of it has probably been around for way longer than our life. <br><br> Took two thousand years for us to start touching space ourselves. <br><br> Wonder what other life could accomplish with two million years <br><br> Or two billion <br><br> "Why don't they contact us!?" <br><br> When was the last time you walked by a worm after a rainstorm and tried to start a conversation with it? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> mfw two thousand years <br><br> two hundred thousand, whatever <br><br> two years </br></br></br></br></br>  NASA estimates we have 40 billion earth-like planets in our galaxy alone. So yes, there is intelligent life elsewhere.<br><br> what will happen when we meet aliens or they meet us? <br>They arrive, stupid humans form a hug crowd to meet them, we have private meetings with them to learn their culture and teach them ours, etc.</br></br></br>  <br> I believe it's already happened at some point in histort. <br>Interesting thought!<br>thanks for sharing!</br></br></br>  <br>Only a complete moron would thing otherwise.</br>  <br> &gt;"Why don't they contact us!?" <br> &gt;When was the last time you walked by a worm after a rainstorm and tried to start a conversation with it? <br><br>Good point!<br>There probaly is intelligent life and maby they do everything to stay hidden or they just don't care about us.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>They exist but I dont believe direct contact is possible.</br></br>  <br> They exist but I dont believe direct contact is possible. <br><br>Yet? Or not at all never?</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;is there life on other planets/galaxy's <br>yes, statistically impossible not to, and fuck all this 'planets fit for life' bullshit, think of the crazy life we have at the bottom of thenocean, and we're saying a planet has to be x miles from a sun in a... Fucking sad.<br> &gt;is the universe infinite and why. <br>No, there needs to be the space for space to expand into, and how can that space be without having already been and therefor a set location/size. It's just really fucking huge.<br>or infinate, I ain't no astronomer.<br> &gt;what will happen when we meet aliens or they meet us? <br>They'll either observe and let be<br>help<br>or harvest. Wouldn't doubt if there's some alien race fattening up humans or having us mine the earth for them.<br>Seeing as they've been here before, yet were still living as fuckups, I'll go with observe or harvest.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;is there life on other planets/galaxy's. <br>obviously yes<br> &gt;is the universe infinite and why. <br>i dont think so, i think its like a bubble and if you travel far enough youll wrap around and end up heading towards the point you started from. <br> &gt;what will happen when we meet aliens or they meet us?  <br>civilization with fall apart. were not ready to know were not the only ones out here.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>well the reason we look for life on X miles from their sun is because we need those specific things<br>why go to a planet that is really cold or really hot. also the reason we look for those zones is because everywhere on earth that we find water, we find life. liquid water only exists in warm-ish zones. we are in the perfect spot. mars is bit far away and venus is way too close.<br>tl;dr we look for places like us for us to potentially live</br></br></br>  <br> been here before <br>Explain please?</br></br>  <br> &gt;is there life on other planets/galaxy's. <br>Plenty of life on other planets, both in the Milky Way and other galaxies.<br><br> &gt;is the universe infinite and why. <br>Probably, but an infinite universe is weirder than most people realise. Someone once pointed out that an infinite universe it means that somewhere out there, there's a planet on which an entity named Bill Gates invents an operating system called Windows95... which is bug free!<br><br> &gt;what will happen when we meet aliens or they meet us? <br>They give us some advanced technology.<br>We give them cat videos!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not same guy, but read about the Sumerians.</br>   is there life on other planets/galaxy's. <br>Statistically yes. See point 2 but it's still large enough that some other life is guaranteed.<br> is the universe infinite and why. <br>Functionally so, there's an edge but it's farther away from us than we can possibly ever see or reach<br> what will happen when we meet aliens or they meet us? <br>Pic related, unless species molded by the necessity of survival somehow lose their destructive urges when they become spacefaring</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> is there life on other planets/galaxy's. <br>Yes there most likely is. But there is probably more life starting out than intelligent life forms<br><br> is the universe infinite and why. <br>Universe keeps expanding at higher and higher velocities. With that expansion, we have new light that reaches us all the time which helps us learn new things<br><br> what will happen when we meet aliens or they meet us? <br>Slavery of mankind</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah... no. <br><br>You know that "Ancient Aliens" is bullshit for gullible idiots, right? Guess not.</br></br></br>  <br>Or slavery of the other race. Or extermination of either party.<br>if a T3 civ discovered us they'd just wipe us out and be done with it. If we happened upon some tribal civ when searching for inhabitable planets, we'd just go in with machine guns and clear the place out.</br></br>  Drawthread.<br>Is anyone around?</br>  not a draw fag, but hi!
