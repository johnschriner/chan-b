A human's body is made up of cells, so where exactly is the soul located, if not in the individual cells?  <br>Inb4 fedora users</br>  OP where are your thoughts and feelings located? Point to the exact cells please  Soul's emitted by the brain, I believe.  WTF?  <br>Your brain cells you jackass</br>  <br>Brain cells.<br><br><br>But why are the brain cells so special? The rest of the body has important functions, why do these brain cells get to have souls and let's say for instance sperm cells, the very cell that becomes half a person during fertilization, don't get to have souls?</br></br></br></br>  <br>When the cells form a sense of sentience, like being able to produce thought I guess. I don't know, just go masterbate.</br>    Fuck you, you stupid fucking godfag. Faggot.  <br>The soul is a byproduct of sentience.<br>It exists in a different dimension or some shit.</br></br>    <br>Nothing has a soul, also they're diploid cells so from a religious/seekmentalhelp perspective no.</br>  <br>Brain cells, dumbfuck</br>    <br>The soul is the size smaller than an atom, neutrino, it is the smallest particle in the universe.<br><br>Discovered by Felix</br></br></br>  Soul is just another man-made conception like afterlife or human values. At the end of the day even freedom of thought doesn't actually exist, ultimately human beings, despite limited self-awareness, are impulse driven lifeforms. It's even studied that most of our choises aren't made consciously, but rather we rely on subconsciousness being a kind of autopilot.<br><br>Everything we do, ultimately, is because of altering brain chemistry. Do you ever think why we do the things we do? We have a hierarchy of needs, but why? Why does almost every carbon-based lifeform heed pretty much the same hierarchy? It's the force of life. That, too, is just a man-made conception but while we're still unaware of the ultimate purpose of life, we can only conclude that everything heeds a major principle.</br></br>  It's in a jar in another dimension  OP, are you karl pilkington?  <br>all hail the jar</br>  <br>Topkek</br>  <br>Yeah but the cells are made of atoms.

The answer is simple: life forms that follow it are better at surviving, and thus are naturally selected to pass on that DNA to future generations.<br><br>Maslow's hierarchy of needs is<br>1. Physiological: breathing, food, water, sex, sleep, homeostasis, excretion.<br>2. Safety: security of body, employment, resources/morality, of the family, of health, of property<br>3. Love/Belonging: friendship, family, sexual intimacy<br>4. Self-esteem, confidence, achievement, respect of others, respect by others<br>5. Morality, creativity, spontaneity, problem solving, lack of prejudice, acceptance of facts.<br><br>Everything in #1 is tied to survival trivially.<br>#2 refers to our *feeling* of survival, essentially our early alert system for #1. <br>#3 refers to our social support, as humans highly depend on each other for survival.<br>#4 and #5 seem largely arbitrary to me, based on the social constructions of whatever culture you live in. spontaneity and creativity might be considered a waste of time in some cultures, and morality could be considered mindless. it's not worth taking them seriously.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  the seat of the soul is in the pineal gland.  <br>Most of the time it's located in the anus, that's why women don't want to do anal and gays have no soul</br>  <br>That is called consciousness</br>  <br>The part that goes on living after death. The part that is never destroyed.</br>    <br>i wish i had never reached egg</br>  The soul doesn't fucking exist, what leads any stupid fuck to actually thinking it exists? Ever meet a fuck who had a serious stroke or a serious brain injury?<br><br>They're not who they used to be, plain and simple<br><br><br>Once you educate yourself on the human brain, that's just not really something you can put stock into anymore</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The soul must exist somehow at a quantum level. We just can't find it yet!</br>  <br>I know how you feel man.</br>    <br><br>If a sperm is wasted</br></br>  <br>No OP, cells do not have souls.<br><br>In fact, this is what is getting christfags so butthurt, as in recent years science has debunked nearly every Christian-based myth. The wagons are circling.</br></br></br>  watch that simpsons episode where bart sell his soul to milhouse  <br>Well of course idiot, its a mechanical injury to the brain that causes it to malfunction. The soul needs a functional body !</br>  <br>You need a certain amount of cells together before a soul can attach to it.</br>  <br><br>There is no such thing as a soul. The body is chemical and the neurons follow electrochemical action. Each neuron can take 400k inputs or combinations. The brain is made up of 100 billion neurons so you can imagine the possibilities in terms of connections. The brainstem, medulla and pons (parts of this stem) do low level functioning and many motor or arrhythmic type functions. The next level (think midbrain and the limbic system) does basic things, sensations, chemicals to the hypothalamus to regulate the body as it isn't really fully covered by the BBB. These functions don't really give us thought as much as basic function and general awareness. The lobes you have the occipital, parietal, temporal and frontal (let's ignore the insula). The input for higher level thought and arguably consciousness is the frontal (and prefronta, part of the frontall) cortex. The inputs here can be linked to the point where the temporal, parietal and occipital all meet and help provide input for it in synchrony with the limbic system and it measures these as the signal takes channels.<br><br>When you evaluate what the brain it is is very much a chemical, non conscious thing. The whole brain makes up thought and brain death occurs when these parts (parts that make you.. you) die off sort to speak. Consciousness dies as a result of failure of these lobes and regions. Nothing more. One could say "brain waves make your thoughts immortal" but brain waves are nothing more than the post synaptic measurements on an EEG. They aren't your through but are rather an effect from it. Unless they somehow help solve the binding issue (they probably don't. Very unlikely) then there is no immortal consciousness or immortal soul and a soul doesn't exist. Your brain is like a complex computer. That's it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>its only natural for concious organisms to make up an excuse to avoid mortality, but you should quit lying to yourself and just accept that your conciousness is only an illusion and once you die, that illusion fades</br>  <br><br>talks about cells having souls while posting a pic of pure RAPE happening.<br><br>BRAVO OP<br><br>B R A V O ! !</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br>Cells have spirit, humans have individual souls. Animals share souls, but that is too complicated to explain. A soul is a sort or spirit processing and shaping energy, spirit is the life force.</br></br>  <br>In like the chest area</br>  <br> The part that goes on living after death <br><br>When you die, you die. There is nothing that survives after death. If you think philosophically, you can say you still exist as a memory in those who you met in life.</br></br></br>  <br>Obvious bait is obvious.</br>  <br> hes back! in pog form</br>  <br>god gets quite irate</br>  <br><br>Feelings in the limbic system may come into question but think about how they aid survial. Fear? happiness (dopamine release) etc. They motivate an organism to live. Those that don't do it don't recognize danger (amygdala damage) and die. You really need feelings to survive. These lead to social networks in some species if it proves advantageous to them. Over time structures of the brain change favoring the social organisms. Morality follows survival. Moral values if you assess them seem to take root in biology too.<br><br>We are just mobile chemicals.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I still have a bunch of my pogs, none of which were Alf.

The force that enters a vessel when life is created, and the force that leaves when the vessel decays.</br></br>  <br> Do cells have conscience? A human's body is made up of cells, so where exactly is the conscience located, if not in the individual cells? </br>  <br>True.</br>  <br>so, what's the energy content of a soul?</br>  Your brain is just an antenna to receive signals from your soul. Brain damage causes the antenna to be bent so it receives the signal incorrectly or just partially so it causes retardation or unconsciousness.  <br>topkek</br>  <br>what is the function of the soul</br>  <br>define this "force". Is it energy? does it have mass? is it quantifiable?</br>  <br><br>More accurately: a magnetic field</br></br>  <br>not today sjw<br>we philosophy now</br></br>  <br>so where is the soul</br>  <br>to keep itself alive. and take many forms</br>  <br>How would I know?

All we know is this force just happens.</br>  <br>i mean what does it do<br>how would a human without a soul behave differently than a human who does</br></br>  The "soul" doesn't exist, but consciousness is pretty much just a very complex evolved behavior.  <br>how do we know that</br>  <br> how would a human without a soul behave differently than a human who does <br><br>They would go around claiming that people have no souls to people who believe souls exist.</br></br></br>  Your soul is located right next to the tooth fairy, ghosts, and god.<br><br>And hot girls who aren't how's.</br></br>  <br>can I sell my soul?<br>How much would it cost?</br></br>  <br>oh fug<br>theres still no such thing as souls</br></br>  <br>no, you don't get to claim ignorance if you posit the existence of something. that's not how this works. if you can't establish some sort of authority over what you claim, then your claim is baseless nattering.<br><br>are you just nattering?</br></br></br>  This thread  <br>a moldy sandwich and a worn ball</br>  <br>If you don't believe souls exist, speak for yourself. Go around saying that YOU don't have a soul and let people who believe they have souls believe they have souls.</br>  <br><br>What are you doing?</br></br>  <br>When discussing something like a soul you can't think so literally when debating where it's held in the human body.</br>  <br>no<br>no one has a soul<br>you have the right to believe you do<br>but i also have to right to believe you don't</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, YOU don't have a soul. I have a soul.</br>  <br>Maybe the soul is built into the universe itself. It just needs a developed brain to "connect" to it. Like a network!</br>  <br>sure ya do pal</br>  <br>There's no such thing as a soul. That was a guess based on almost no information. It was wrong.</br>  <br>that doesn't answer my question.</br>  <br><br>see:<br><br><br><br><br>Once you understand a bit about medicine and the brain structures it's pretty obvious.

I have one of those and it hurts like shit.</br>  <br>Well it does actually, a human has a developed brain so it automatically connects to its soul!</br>  ITT: fedora wearing atheists  <br>but what does it do? what are some observable differences between a souled human and a nonsouled human</br>  <br>I never claimed ignorance at all. I have no idea what you're talking about. Especially with what you're trying to say about souls. You're claiming that they something doesn't enter a body when life begins and ends.</br>  <br>I.E. every developed brain has a soul! Or there are no people without a soul!</br>  Only some cells have souls, such as white blood cells but not red ones.  <br>what do you mean developed?</br>  <br>a nonsouled human is a dead human</br>  How does a person without a soul behave differently than a person with a soul?<br><br>A person with a soul seeks out these kinds of questions about the soul, the higher up stages in the hierarchy of needs.<br><br>A person without a soul only cares about the lower categories in the hierarchy of needs. A person without a soul knows he doesn't have a soul.</br></br></br></br>  <br>the souls is not insdide the body liek people think or have always been shown, the souls surrounds the body.</br>    <br>now prove that the soul exists</br>  <br>People with severe brain damage cannot connect to a soul .<br><br>It seems that our brain is the biggest in relation to our body size. This might be the decisive factor!</br></br></br>  <br>I can prove you don't have a soul.</br>  <br><br>So, if a person without a soul poses a question to a person that claims to have a soul, but is unable to describe, define, or explain a soul, which person is actually seeking higher stages of need?</br></br>  <br>citation needed</br>  <br><br>You don't understand the concept of cortex neuronal density and its variations through sensitive periods and likely genetic origins.. do you?<br><br>Intelligence (through indirect study) can be traced to cortex development which can be traced to evolution. Some are more intelligent than others. The more intelligent people may be led to what you speak of (or not, who gives a fuck?)<br><br>The point is they are intelligent enough to think. That's what counts. Through reward and punishment systems they learn over time about what rewards they should produce or are expected of them. Such as success or strong morals (morals are for survival and are developed through social interaction and biology and then instilled on others by society in the form of ethics IMO with what research is telling me). This would lead me to the conclusion that how someone is raised, their genetic inclinations and the rewards handed to them for their goals sets them to do what you said (plus chemical levels in the brain in a healthy amount).<br><br>Not a soul.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>bet you can't</br>  <br>checkem</br>  <br> masturbate. Dumbass </br>  <br>there is no citation on an opinion, it is just my experience has lead me to believe that i am not simply my body or my brain, the mind is the link between the physical and metaphysical.</br>  <br>More likely the soul is in the universe itself, maybe at a quantum level.</br>  <br>what experience led you to that conclusion</br>  <br> So, if a person without a soul poses a question to a person that claims to have a soul, but is unable to describe, define, or explain a soul, which person is actually seeking higher stages of need? <br><br>The person without a soul isn't seeking higher stages of needs, what do you have to gain from it except causing mischief? Usually people who don't seek spiritual pursuits or the other higher needs are not very virtuous. What a person without a soul wants to do is debase a person with a soul.</br></br></br>  <br> quantum <br> souls <br> quantum <br>don't throw around words you don't understand because it seems science-y</br></br></br></br>  <br>could be, i mean all matter is the same energy throught all of the universe, just at different levels of vibration</br>  <br><br>According to Jains they do.<br><br> won't wash because will kill bacteria <br> wears masks lest breath disturb bugs <br> women not allowed because of vaginal bacteria <br><br>So if you wanna team up with them, have fun.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you have a soul?</br>  <br>could be, i mean all matter is the same energy throught all of the universe, just at different levels of vibration.</br>  <br>i just want to understand anon</br>  <br>what the fuck does that mean</br>  <br><br>I would also like to know.</br></br>  <br>I have no idea what you just said. but if you claim that something enters the body at birth and then leaves at death, the burden of proof lies with the side making that claim. So once again, the ball is in your court. You claim a soul exists. That claim is yours to support. There have been lucid and direct questions posed by many that you have failed to answer or even acknowledge. That points to a lack of legitimate knowledge of the subject matter. <br><br>If you can't at least offer some supporting evidence, you are either a liar or a fraud.<br><br>Which is it?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you have a soul?</br>  <br>citation needed</br>  <br>everything. everything i see andwitcness in the world and of people and of myself, i mean there are shrimp that can see spectrums of light we cant even measure, it is very difficult not to think there is more than what we are told there is by the limited findings of scienists or fanatical believes of organised religion.</br>  <br><br>On the small level things may seem the same but on the large level they may not be (also all things being vibrations is a very untested mathematical theory). Interactions between larger molecules is different. Also, the guy misused quantum to seem smart when he isn't like  pointed out. That question he posed is philosophical but not really worth out effort. It's like positing a God (saying God is the universe). It can't be asserted without some evidence and he lacks it. I'd throw that shit away until something tells us otherwise.</br></br>  Where exactly is the mind located if not in the individual cells?  <br>So what you're saying is there is no difference between a corpse and a living person?</br>  <br>DUDE<br>I AM CERTAIN OF THE FACT THAT WHAT LITTLE KNOWLEDGE WE HAVE IS NOT EVEN A FRACTION OF A FRACTION OF AN INFINITESIMAL FRACTION OF THE ALL KNOWLEDGE WE COULD HAVE<br>but that doesn't mean we can just start conjecturing stuff to fill in the spaces we don't know.</br></br></br>    <br>I'm trying to prove that you don't have a soul. To do it I need an answer to this question. Don't speak for other people, only speak for yourself.<br><br>Do you have a soul? Yes or no.<br><br>If the answer is no, then I just proved you don't have a soul.<br><br>But of course you're not going to answer for yourself or you're just going to ignore this altogether.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Opinions are like assholes, everyone has one. And in most cases they stink.<br><br>In this instance your opinion is less convincing than the science that shows no evidence for anything described by religion as a "soul". Opinions are not evidence or even logical arguments. As such, they are as worthless as a tits on a bull.</br></br></br>  <br>i understand what you mean, it really is what your world view is. there will always be people say oh without proof there is nothing or the absence of disproof means everything you want it to. as long as what you think or believe is your truth and youre happy then that is all anyone needs</br>  <br>but do you have a soul<br>and how does my saying i dont have a soul prove i dont have a soul. i can say i have a soul just as easily as not so thats not really evidence.</br></br>  <br>Yes, I have a soul. And you ignored my question.</br>  <br> Opinions are like assholes, everyone has one. And in most cases they stink. </br>  <br>So, you in your infinite wisdom can discern the motives of a person seeking knowledge.<br><br>That's very impressive. Of course it's utter bullshit, but it's an impressive way to dodge a legitimate question. for a person with a "soul", you're not very honest.</br></br></br>  <br>We have nearly reached the fucking Moon out of all this universe, moron. We still have many stuff to discover, 30 years ago black holes were sci Fi stuff. Just be scientific about it, not just because science can't prove it it doesn't exist!</br>  The only reason people came up with a soul is because without moral conviction, our world would be a really fucked up place. Religion is a former government, a very successful form where the fear of eternity dictates action. Could anyone really come up with a better motivation? There were hundreds of God's back into grecco Roman days because no one understood anything, like lightening. Therefore Zeus was prayed upon, but now we know lightning is made of positive and negatively charges ions colliding, and low and behold, no Zeus. Believe what you want, but when your brain dies, time will go by, without you, and you won't even know.  <br>i wasn't the guy you were asking but no i dont think souls exists so i dont have a soul<br>:^]<br>how do you know you have a soul?</br></br></br>  <br>is knowing how little we actually know that is exciting, i mean i'm not conjecturing the gaps by saying this is what there is there but we dnt know so i could be right or wrong. this is just my opinion on what i would like there to be, it makes me happy and life good to think that we are more than what we seem. wouldnt everyone?</br>  But how do we prove if we dont or have a soul if we dont know if its real ?  <br><br><br>Bravo. Abandon all hope you pathetic religiousfags - you and I are nothing, and that's what we well be after we die - nothing. <br><br>No amount of cognitive dissonance or pathetic hope can save you from this fact.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Prove we do dumbass.</br>  <br>Not op but How do YOU know you don't have a soul?</br>  <br><br>That would be true is people were passive about it but people pass laws, act on morals relating to non true or non verifiable world views and cause issues for scientists and doctors by these actions.<br><br>I think people are too stupid as a whole to be useful because they act on these non verifiable viewpoints and can't do judgement calls on their own (most can't.. general population here). Even a lot of college students are no good at this.<br><br><br><br>No, many sci fi things don't exist or are proven false too. Some things may be true but we will find them in time through work. Your idea posits too many false things ruining the bigger picture. Get it?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i have no reason to believe i do</br>  <br>Don't know, was hoping you could tell me. There doesn't seem to be any way to differentiate such a belief from the cultural indoctrination of children without some sort of quantifying methodology.<br><br>Maybe you could supply that methodology?</br></br></br>  <br><br>As euphoric as this reply to my post is... thanks for it.</br></br>  <br>Thats why i am asking you bonehead ,how do we prove it ?</br>  <br><br>see<br><br><br>that is fine man as long as you are happy, what else could i ask of you or anyone else on here i here. you are right these are just my opinions, they are only based on my human experience wich we know is very limited as it is</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>"Ignorance is bliss" basically?</br>  I think I might be god, there was no time before I was born, only nothingness. And then when I was squeezed out of my mother vagina trillions of years passed in an instant, and when I die trillions of years will pass in an instant again, then there will be eternal darkness until I choose to be born again. <br><br>So, as I am god... I hereby declare all cells have souls!</br></br>  <br>why i would i start making stuff up in the absence of knowledge</br>  <br>Trying to convince a person with a soul that he doesn't have a soul is not seeking knowledge.<br><br>I'd rather believe a beautiful lie than an ugly truth.<br><br>Even IF humanity's only purpose is to just live and die with no afterlife, here we still can choose what we want to believe in, something beautiful or something ugly.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ever got really fucked up, passed out for the night and woke up 8 hours later with no dreams, and felt Lome you just laid down. That's called brain inactivity. That's called have no brain activity forever, that's called dead, and you'll never know a bunch more time has passed.</br>   Souls <br>Go talk to your god somewereelse fag</br>  <br>yea that is sadly true but these people are stupid as you say because they have not seen or have been shown any better, they shouldnt need to be walked in hand to all the knowledge there is it should be a common goal in everyone but the way society and the way the world is that kin dof mentality is just not nourished</br>  <br>its in your penis. <br><br>%ITT women don't have souls.%</br></br></br>  <br>im not trying to convince you you don't have a soul. im trying to get you to convince me that souls exist. but i can't help but poke a few holes in your ideas.</br>  <br>lol, you're welcome. I was only half kidding.</br>  <br>Nice attempt at a strawman. But no, you are the one making the positive claim of knowledge. You have to tell us how to quantify this "soul" thing you claim enters and leaves the body. You have to establish how, when, and where. Otherwise, I could claim that a soul is alien mind control inserted into the egg at conception by tiny, invisible alien probes that exist inside of the 6th dimension.<br><br>care to try again?</br></br></br>  <br>mate if you think its a lie then do you actually really believe it?</br>    <br> Did you know that there is a thing called ENERGY, and is not made of cells </br>  <br>well actually anon, the father supplies the half the DNA though the sperm, and the mother supplies the other half AND the mitochondria, making the infant more related to the mother</br>  <br>Not him, but the "ignorance" you're referring to is your own. <br><br>No evidence whatsoever suggests that anything like a "soul" exists - everything we know about neurology, biology, chemistry, evolution, etc. suggests the opposite.<br><br>But you believe we have souls because that's what you were taught when you were a kid and you never questioned it. I was taught that as well, but I changed my opinion in light of education. Who is the ignorant one?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I believe I have a soul, no amount of influence can change that. People are hardwired with some fundamental beliefs. <br><br><br>I don't believe it's a lie. I don't believe in ugly things, there's enough ugliness in this world to accept. My beliefs in the afterlife are something beautiful that I will believe till death.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Implying we know absolutely everything in neurology, biology, chemistry, evolution etc. <br>Till then, " ignorance is bliss".</br></br>  <br>mate dont get all high and mighty. just ask questions that conveniently brings up the weak points of their ideas.</br>  <br> no amount of influence can change that <br>You know what we call an eye that can only ever see one thing?<br>Blind.</br></br></br>  <br>Absence of evidence is not evidence absence. Without evidence we can't say for sure whether a soul exists or not so either view is equally valid.</br>  <br>You believe in magic, like a child. Just admit it. You can't claim otherwise, you retarded twat.</br>  <br>WHAT DO YOU MEAN? SHOULD I START CONJECTURING DRAGONS ON JUPITER JUST BECAUSE I HAVE NO WAY TO DISPROVE THEM?</br>  <br>I never said we were even close to knowing everything - but any educated individual can clearly see where the evidence points. <br><br>As much as it may frighten you and hurt your ego to realize that humans aren't the special little end-all-be-all pinnacles of creation, it's a pretty solid fact, considering all the evidence. <br><br>But I know this fact scares you, so go ahead and believe that you are special. I won't interfere anymore.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ever heard of faith? It doesn't work by knowing it all. Faith only works when it's blind.</br>  <br>B y definition, there can be NO SUCH THING as "evidence" for something that has no material existence. You believe in magic. Good for you, retard.</br>  <br>underrated post</br>  <br>sauce on OPs picture<br><br>anyone know that actress?</br></br></br>  <br>why have faith?</br>  <br>I don't know if I've ever had a debate with someone more dense. There's literally nothing to deny. The only claim is that there is a difference between a corpse and a living person. Something is not there after you die. Life is a soul. That's what I'm saying. That is all.<br>In reality you're trying to sound logical but you're just in denial.</br></br>  <br>Don't tell me how to argue "mate". You aren't shit either.<br><br><br>No - both views are not equally valid. That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.<br><br>There is no evidence against the existence of a flying spaghetti monster either - does that mean that it's equally probably that one exists as it is that one doesn't? Kill yourself.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's one of the highest of those in the hierarchy of needs.</br>  <br> implying energy is made of atoms instead of cells </br>  <br>KEK'D</br>  <br>Do you need evidence for everything you believe? And that's basically the whole point of faith, believing in something because you choose to believe it.</br>  <br>whoops my bad Mr.neckbeard i assumed you wanted to actually learn from an alternative pov on something not shitpost and act like a cunt.<br>stay classy</br></br>  <br>absence of evidence when there should be evidence is very much evidence of absence. If something as important to human existence as the soul is claimed to be, cannot be defined, described, evidenced, or even quantified for the entirety of human existence, then yes, that fact is very much evidence that a "soul" as described my most monotheistic religion is not a real thing. But merely an idea inserted by the culture children are raised in.</br>  <br>how do you decide which topics to use faith and which not to?</br>  You guys have no idea what you're talking about.<br><br>It's called a Thetan</br></br>  <br>Faith never works when it's blind, that's a corrupted version of faith, you should test your faith often.</br>  <br> stay classy <br><br>You're goddamned right I will ;)</br></br></br>  <br>Nothing has a soul</br>  <br>I can't answer for others but I have faith because I choose to, because I like it, it feels nice, shit like that.</br>  <br>Did I said I believe in magic?<br><br>Well, are there dragons on Jupiter and can you conjure the? I guess not!<br><br>So my dear friend, we should all live in blissfull ignorance, not to question anything just because we do not think it exists? How scientific!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well said.</br>  <br>I don't understand your question.</br>  You're right, it makes no sense for your soul to be connected to your cells.<br><br>Your soul is linked to your magical core - obviously muggles don't have one.</br></br>  <br>it's only highest if you are culturally programmed to think it is. There are tribes in the Amazon that have no concept of religion and according to you, their "needs" are less than yours. That is simply your ego demanding that what you believe is important outside of your own head. Trust me....you are not nearly that important.</br>  <br><br>i have no evidence that there are dragons on jupiter</br></br>  <br> looking down on people too intelligent to be affected by religion <br><br>so american</br></br></br>  <br>Hey, I guess those ancient people were right. They could not observe the lightning, nor they could reproduce it so yeah, until proven otherwise they thought it was Zeus. Same thinking!</br>  <br> he doesnt know about the jupiter dragons </br>  <br>Except lightning is visible, so that is not a proper parallel.</br>  <br>Those tribes man... Look how advanced they are today with they modern spears and lack of religion!</br>  <br> So my dear friend, we should all live in blissfull ignorance, not to question anything just because we do not think it exists? How scientific! <br><br>You're an idiot - or a decent troll, one or the other. But I'll bite:<br><br>We HAVE been living in "blissful ignorance" for most of human existence - prior to science, people accepted things like "having a soul" or "god creating/controlling everything" as a given, because they had no other way to explain shit like memories, emotions, the sun rising and setting, blah blah blah.<br><br>As science has advanced, we find out more and more about the reality behind this "god delusion" (thank you Mr. Dawkins). It was science which BEGAN questioning everything and brought us out of the blissful ignorance that we had been in for thousands of years - not the other way around.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>do you have faith in things like astrology, voodoo, homeopathic dilutions? why or why not</br>  Will computers ever be programmed to think like humans? is a good question.  what  <br>oy vey you shputz why don't you tell the whole world?</br>  <br>separate thread on a different board my friend</br>  <br>Why do you think the ancient chinese worshipped dragons? They had really good telescopes and saw the dragons on jupiter, dumbass.</br>  What is a soul, I've never heard of this  Anyone wants to be in a coma for the rest of life with an awesome dream playing where you actually are happy. <br><br>It's like who cares what is happening to your body, you are in a coma and not knowing anything and if you are killed during it so be it.</br></br>  <br>None of that stuff makes a person more righteous. It has nothing to do with love. Voodoo for example is simply evil, it's all about hurting other people.</br>  <br>How advance are you considering that you believe in a bronze age mythology and magical souls?</br>  <br>Protip: souls, like religion, love, and anal bleaching, is a human concept, and thus doesn't actually exist.</br>  <br>You can't prove that the Jupiter dragons didn't build the pyramids. Checkmate athiests.</br>  <br>But dude, look at those fucking tribes with no religion! <br> TRIBES <br> 2015 </br></br></br>  <br> human concept <br> doesn't exist <br>shiggy<br><br>i have not done any research at all on voodoo but im pretty sure thats not it. replace voodoo with magic.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wrong, human concepts are human concepts.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Do you like talking to yourself samefag? Kek go on man go on...</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>If you want to talk about "love" as some metaphysical concept, you are off base. "Love" can be explained just like any other human emotion, through brain chemistry. Seratonin, dopamine and oxytocin are chemicals responsible for the emotion we categorize as "love." It's really quite simple when you actually think about it.</br></br>  <br><br>Man, you must be fun at parties!</br></br>    <br>That wont convince him, anon will say you shooped it. There's no way to prove. I miss IDs</br>  <br>Amazing, I've never actually met a samefagfag who's ever been right. Sounds like you need the Jupiter dragons in your life, bro.</br>  <br>Knowledge is actually pretty sexy, bro.</br>  <br>Voodoo is evil. It's witchcraft. They use it to put curses on people. They invoke the assistance of demons. God has nothing to do with what voodoo practitioners do.</br>  <br>mate recognizing that love can be reduced to those chemicals is nice and all but can anyone predict what a person "in love" will do?</br>  <br>goddamned faggot moot</br>  <br>What's the matter your parents didn't love you?</br>  <br>CHECKED</br>  <br>Actually, I am :) I'm pretty popular socially - easy to talk to and humorous. But you'll just have to take my word for it.<br><br>I'm sorry if the nature of reality as it pertains to this conversation saddens you, but I'm not the type of person to ignore science just because it would make me feel better to believe that some magical being created me so I could worship him and live forever in eternity.</br></br></br>  <br> Voodoo is evil. It's witchcraft. <br> God has nothing to do with what voodoo practitioners do. <br><br>What century is it?</br></br></br></br>  <br>the soul is just an imaginary thing, your brain cells make process and therefore decide what you think/do it's al scientificly explainable so the soul doesn't exist, this is your answer</br>  <br>Never met a Haitian before have you?</br>  <br>Of course no one can predict that - but what does that have to do with anything we're talking about here?<br><br><br>They do, very much :) And I love them - our oxytocin connection is off the charts ;)</br></br></br></br>  <br> "Loved" <br>How dare you say such a thing to science anon right here, you uneducated medieval chemical organism?</br></br>  <br>I wasn't talking about the voodoo, I was talking about the Salem-esque "burn the witches" stupidity.</br>  Yeah guys, you just thought the same Hippocrates did two thousand years ago.<br>He &lt;discovered&gt; that the soul (the energy that moves the human body) is located in the brain, and more exactly in the pineal gland, and then it was transmitted through lymphatic vessels to the rest of the body, good job.<br>But now we know that the brain is a cumulus of neurons and nucleus, specialized cognitive and emotional processes, and so, the &lt;soul&gt; is the conjunction of all this processes that motivate our behaviour, specially emotions.<br>Emotions, interests, feelings, an even will is what we call our souls. Now go to bed.</br></br></br>  <br>lol nice try but a little late - I already addressed it here <br><br>Thanks for playing, though!</br></br></br>  <br> They do, very much :) And I love them <br><br>NOPE. Kind of impossible to believe after seeing you post this:<br><br> If you want to talk about "love" as some metaphysical concept, you are off base. "Love" can be explained just like any other human emotion, through brain chemistry. Seratonin, dopamine and oxytocin are chemicals responsible for the emotion we categorize as "love." It's really quite simple when you actually think about it. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>its doesn't seem like a very fulfilling explanation if you can't make predictions with it<br>i didn't like that you said it was simple. as we know how or why it worked.</br></br>  <br>Look at those evil white men cough I mean sperm invading that delicate little ball.</br>  <br><br>If love is a chemical process that occurs in the brain, how does his knowledge (of what love is) impede that process?</br></br>  <br>Maybe you just need to not be so sensitive to words. You do know its the atheists fault that gay marriage is legal? Because you're all EVIL. AND YOU WON'T STOP INVENTING MORE BLASPHEMIES AGAINST THE ONE TRUE GOD! BUT YOU WILL ALL BE JUDGED! IT'S ALREADY DONE!</br>  I guess it depends on whether or not you believe that life itself constitutes a soul. Do you believe dogs have souls? Do you believe trees have souls? Do you think cognizance and sentience and a conscience is required to have a recognizable soul? If yes, then does a sociopath lack a soul? Does a person in a vegetative state after an accident have a soul?<br><br>I think the problem is that you're trying to assign something that's not a solid science a biological cause or location. I believe in souls. I believe we all share a collective energetic force that draws us together, that draws us to each other. From the trees to rivers to your racist Aunt Marge, we are all one. But I'm a fucking hippie, so you probably shouldn't listen to me.</br></br>  <br>lol - if it makes you feel better to play semantics so be it. Just because we understand the mechanisms behind "love" doesn't mean we can't feel it - it's just a matter of what we choose to call it. I still call it love because it's simple. That doesn't mean I don't recognize that it's NOT some magical, metaphysical concept.<br><br>Try again ;)</br></br></br>  <br>as if*</br>  <br>Thank you - my point exactly.</br>  <br>Then it's not love, it's just a chemical process between soulless people who have no reason for even existing. As mechanical as your existence.</br>  <br>Why is everyone assuming souls exist? Some bored jackass in the desert just made up that concept one day.</br>  Why am I so unhappy? why me? what does the universe have against me? is it because of my body that I was given? is it because of my actions that I had no control of? those are the questions I'm alive to answer before I finally conclude that I'm a waste that no one loves or knows.  <br>You can make general predictions with it, actually - but no one can say definitively what someone "in love" will do - there is an untold amount of other factors that may or may not be involved - you can't isolate an emotion and study it like that.<br><br>I still don't see where you're going with this or the point you're trying to make, honestly. Are you saying that because we can't definitively predict something, that must mean it's magical or metaphysical? Are you actually using the god of the gaps argument?</br></br></br>    <br><br>It's whatever name you want to assign it. Calling it Love or Smegma doesn't change what it is.</br></br>  <br>Well, between you and the meatsacks you call parents, I'd rather call it smegma. But let's be honest, your parents hate you.</br>  <br>no im just having an autistic reaction to him saying it was simple</br>  <br>Nope - it's still love because we have the power to define it that way. how do we have that power? Simply by virtue of being alive.<br><br>Yes, I believe we are all soulless and mechanical - highly complex biological machines, pretty much. But because we are alive, WE have the choice and power to give meaning to our own existence - and that is more powerful and wonderful than anything, in my opinion.</br></br></br>  What is up with this shit is /b/ are you all Fucking Christians? I'm not necessarily non spiritual myself. I hope you religious fags fuck off though sorry./b/ is antithesis of Christianity. You can't live an actual "Christian" lifestyle and browse this board it's just deluding yourself.  <br>I like you. Why do people on 4chan make more sense than people in the wild?

What a bastion of quality you are :)<br><br><br>The concept is simple and easy to understand - the mechanisms behind it are highly complex. I'm sorry - I thought I made that clear.</br></br></br></br></br>  you're presuposing a soul exists  <br>people hated ID's and always said how they wished the good old times back. /b/ was never happy /b/ was never good</br>  <br> Aaaand the discussion devolves into ad hominem and name calling.
