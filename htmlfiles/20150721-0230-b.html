Why is the internet going bonkers over this?  <br>Where did I imply that i wouldn't? You replied to my first post in this thread. I didn't say shit about Ledger.</br>  <br><br>In the Batman comic classic The Killing Joke, we find out that the Joker was tricked into becoming the Z-list villain the Red Hood, right before he fell into the vat of acid that transformed him into the Clown Prince of Crime. Though the Joker discarded that moniker, Jason took up the title of Red Hood after his own resurrection. Point being, the fan theory about Jared Leto's Joker has precedence, because Jason Todd has a built-in history of taking the Joker's identity. <br><br>The Joker being a former Robin gives us a whole new dynamic with the archrivals' relationship. As mentioned earlier, it would also give us a reasonable explanation as to why Leto's Joker looks like a god damned juggalo. <br><br>The thought of the kind of Joker we're normally familiar with, sitting down in a tattoo parlor for hours, days on end to get all that ink is frankly a little bit laughable. But what if each tattoo wasn't for the Joker, but for Batman? Sure, the J on his cheek could stand for "Joker," if this guy is super into personal branding, but what if it's a reminder that he's still Jason? An even more blatant message is scrawled on his right arm, where we can see a few feathers of what is presumably a tattoo of a bird -- probably a robin. You could extrapolate meaning from every tattoo; does the skull in a jester hat make sense if Joker ripped it off of a poison POG from the 90s, or might it represent Jason Todd's "death" and rebirth into the maniacal jester as shown in Suicide Squad?<br><br>If we've learned anything from years of movies, comics and video games, it's that you shouldn't put anything past the Joker when it comes to messing with Batman. <br><br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/629206904#p629210979">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> clown prince of crime <br>What joker are you referring to?</br></br>  Ask a Muslim girl anything <br>Ask a Pakistani girl anything</br>  where's OP? was OP beheaded?  <br>Why were you surprised? Sudanese Muslims were taken as slaves by the Arabs and they STILL suck their cocks. They're considered subhuman in Saudi Arabia, along with Pakistanis. The subhumans see it as "they are muslim, therefore I will trust them and hate everything they hate." While Saudi scum look at them both as servants who they will beat if they do something wrong.</br>  https://www.theknot.com/us/ahmed-kh<wbr>an-and-mashal-akhter-jun-2015<br><br>is this your marriage picture?</br></br></wbr>  (Pegging/anal stimulation) =/= gay  I really, really, really dislike this woman.<br><br>Sara Jay has got to be the ugliest porn star in existence.</br></br>  <br>I really, really, really like this picture</br>   interracial <br>Disgusting.</br>  <br>Much this.</br>  No League of Legends Thread?

You wake up in a small cell with a barred window, tied to a wall. In front of you is a tray of stale bread and what you think is meat of some kind, as well as a skull and a door with two beady eyes looking in at you. On the windowed wall there is a hole that looks large enough to squeeze through. Looking through the window, you see that it is night outside.
