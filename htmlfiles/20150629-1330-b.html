Than I guarantee you've laughed. Even a small chuckle you find him funny.</br>  <br>you sir, must be stupid</br>  His shit is so cringey it hurts, fuck him.  <br>There are lots of bad, overrated comedians.

You can't judge professional comedians when your idea of humor is laughing over stupid memes.  <br>yup. just learned about his stealing from other comedians from Joe Rogan and Marc Maron. that's just flat out shitty.</br>  <br><br>You really have never seen any of his shows have you. I feel bad for you kid.</br></br>  <br>oh so you like them boys with pretty faces, didn't knew that, the thing is, insulting me won't make dane cock a real comedian, so suck it up</br>  <br>Steve-Os not a comedian, he's a comedic stuntman...</br>  <br>He's not the only successful comedian that's steals shit. they all do.<br><br>Dane Cook is just more popular. I've never heard of JOe Rogan and Marc Maron untill you just said something about it.</br></br></br>  <br>Gabriel Iglesias</br>  isn't that green lantern?  <br>That post. made no sense. For Dane Cook is a real comedian. You're just a sad fuck on his computer crying about something you know nothing about.</br>  <br>this. and at least they stand by their words. everyone on 4chan wouldn't say 1% of what they say on here in real life if it weren't for the comfort of anonymity.</br>  <br>Close, but Cook is worse</br>  <br>That's because you have to be smart to be funny. Most blacks have the IQ of a dirty diaper.</br>  <br>you my friend need help.</br>  <br>When you become succesful. than i'll admit Dane Cook is bad.</br>  <br>true, but learn the story. Carlos was a different type of joke thief. He was an extreme case, border line sociopath stealing from the comedians below him trying to make a living, and broadcasting their material to a wider audience like it was his own. And if you don't know who Joe Rogan and Marc Maron are, you have no fucking place in a comedian thread</br>  this homo  <br>Every time I watch a black comedian I'll count how long it takes for them to start talking about racism/race relations/race whatever.<br><br>I get cynical everytime they announce a black comedian to host something or perform because you just know it's going to be "black people do this, white people do that"</br></br></br>  <br>This. Can't make a single joke not related to weed.</br>  <br>men I do know about this shit, I've seen his movies, they're lame as fuck, always about some sentimental moral bullshit and his stand-ups are straight shit, you gotta admit it, everyone likes something that's absolutely shit mate</br>  <br>This</br>  <br>all he did was act like a autistic scottish woman. lamest comedian ever. sooooo overrated.</br>  <br>Carlos is shit though. How he even got a show is beyond me. <br>And just cause i don't know who two comedians are doesn't mean shit. Just means i haven't seen them yet.</br></br>  <br>Please go back to grammar school. <br>And if everyone likes something that's shit. Then i'm sure everything you like is shit.</br></br>  that said, she could tongue my balls if she wants  <br>Not a comedian</br>  <br>forgot pic</br>  <br>whatever happened to the Mexican guy who ran the Channel?</br>  Dane Cook fags truly are the worst.  <br>i want her to sit on my face doe&lt;3</br>  <br>hahaha and you tell me to go back to grammar school, suck it up dude, there's more people that hate him than people that love him, numbers don't lie</br>  <br>oh yeah definitely agree, maybe she should just do porn instead</br>  <br>If you think he's shit. why did you watch his movies?<br><br>were you like,"Oh Dane Cook? Shit this dude sucks, better watch his movie so i can relate to his shittiness."</br></br></br>  No one can beat this..  Tom fucking Green<br>He is so unfunny it physically hurts me but so many people like his repetitive shit humour</br>  <br>yeah she's one of the worst</br>  <br>Joe Rogan is the Fear Factor and DMT dude, and Marc Maron has his own show. You live under a rock, brah?</br>  <br>I had to change the channel<br>watching him bomb was worse then any isis execution.</br></br>  <br>He has standup specials on Netflix and was on community.</br>  <br>ray miller johnson</br>  <br>Disqualified because women comedians aren't in the same category as comedians.<br><br>Like women's professional sports. They have to put a W before everything so people know to change the channel.</br></br></br>  <br>That fucker is dumb as shit. And you're all wrong. All comedians suck. All blacks joke about the same thing, attractive idiots scream, misunderstood assholes are just misunderstood assholes who complain. Everyone else is moot</br>  <br>because a moron friend was like yo you should check him up, after I did I was like, yo, you're stupid son</br>  <br>Am I seriously the only one that thinks Amy Schumer is fucking hideous? Between the shape of her face and how close together her eyes are, there's really nothing flattering about her. Add the fact that she relies on senseless shock comedy to squeeze laughs out of her audience, there's really no redeeming qualities. I don't understand why she's famous or thought of as good at what she does, other than the fact that she has a show and a pussy.</br>  <br>Maybe cause you made a post that features you hating him. Sorry when you become more successful than him. Then maybe i'll make a thread on here on why you are shit. and i'll have people agreeing with me.<br><br>until then leave /b/</br></br></br>  <br>That's Donald Glover you fucking tard</br>  <br><br>/thread</br></br>  www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=gNQQwg_CLts<wbr></wbr>  [ ]  <br>i dont think shes hot or anything, id still lick her asshole though probably</br>  <br>did he quit or something?</br>  <br>youre still stupid for watching a movie that you already hated the lead actor. You obviously wanted to watch the movie.</br>  <br>yeah, but you'd lick your mom's asshole, so...</br>  <br>Winner. His whole getup is that he makes "funny faces." Except the faces aren't funny. He just opens his eyes really wide.</br>  <br>it's the fact that she seems like she would be into femdom</br>  <br><br>was only funny during one set one time and never again. if you've seen his stand up without the puppets you'ed cry er tim</br></br>  <br>Wtf!! Louis C K is awesome!</br>  <br>how are you suppose to know someone isnt shit if you never watched the shit movies he's in?</br>  <br>and your point is?</br>  <br>jesus i fucking hate this guy</br>  HI /b/<br><br>There's this asshole coworker that likes to brag about how Ubuntu is superior to Windows and how it's -according to him- the best thing ever made.<br><br>What's so good about it that'd justify the average user that uses their computer for Facebook, games, YouTube, etc to migrate to Ubuntu from Windows 7/8?</br></br></br></br>  <br>its free. Other than that nothing. The average user can't go wrong by choosing either one.</br>  If you game, Windows is an obvious choice.<br>If you have an old computer, Linux will get the best out of it.<br>For everything else other than a few specialized uses, one is just as good as the other.</br></br>  <br>Other than being free, what are some of its benefits that'd apply mainly to the average user?<br><br>I know that Ubuntu is preferred when it comes to servers and databases but what about the normalfag that doesn't do all that?<br><br>What about support for games, programs, etc?</br></br></br></br></br>  Wind 7 master race  <br> Ubuntu <br> servers <br>Debian is so much better, though.<br>Games are limited. The only Linux games that I can think of are limited due to compatibility issues. PlayOnLinux is starting to close that boundary, though.<br>Not really much benefits.<br> crashes often <br> open source drivers for some hardware are complete shit <br> Unity (holy shit, this gets me every time. Xubuntu is the only right *buntu) </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I know that there are better alternatives, but I've heard countless times that Linux is heavily preferred over Windows for servers.<br><br>So why is this faggot attempting to shove Linux down everyone's throats? Does he like being "different" or something?</br></br></br>  <br>yes</br>  <br>A complete Newfag to Linux is the only one that tries to prove a point. It's obvious that Linux is great, but it also has its issues. Plus, Ubuntu is shit compared to Mint. Mint just works, compared to Ubuntu.</br>  <br>For the average user, Ubuntu is a step down from windows. Fucking chromium and Firefox both have issues, all the opens our cell and even commercial drivers are shit, the boot time is slower, and simple tasks become a clusterfuck when using the terminal. Although, it doesn't use any resources unless you tell it to, which is nice for low end hardware, also the lxde desktop is really lightweight. Windows is constantly doing shit you don't want in the background.</br>  <br>Linux Mint?</br>  <br>linux is the standard for servers and security. if you never want anyone to get into your computer linux is it if you just want to do banking and play vidya windows is where its at. anyone that says linux is superior is wither very cheap or they dont play video cames... <br> if you dont play video games then linux is definitely superior. </br></br>  <br>ubuntu also just werks</br>  <br> Windows is constantly doing shit you don't want in the background. <br>Yea, but nowadays most "normy" PCs come with 8GB RAM, i3/i5 processors, does that point still stand?<br><br>Computers can more than handle OS background processes nowadays, so I don't really see the problem.</br></br></br></br>  I'd be careful about Ubuntu. Had some bad experiences with it. Like one day I installed it on my Laptop and when I installed updates an error message popped up. I had to restart the Laptop because I couldn't do anything. Not even TTY worked. After the reboot i couldnt move the cursor. This was a non early stages LTS version. Should be stable they said lol. Breaks easily. Better choose another Distro like Open SUSE or something like that.  you dont need a windows online account to use ubuntu  <br>I agree, I run 8.1 on my modern laptop with 8 Gb of RAM and a quad core 2.5ghz cpu, but I run Lubuntu on my 8 year old MacBook with 2 Gb RAM and a 2.2 Ghz core 2 duo.</br>  Can't fuck up your system as easy, also it tends to be more light weight  <br>Ubuntu is not a server os</br>  <br>its a real issue on laptops even gaming ones. they say its for tablets but it does shit all day long when you arent looking... I'm not kidding when i say all day long. it defrags then scans for viruses every security update which is like every day and on a laptop or tablet for some reason it doesnt reconize you are active on the computer after it starts the shit leading to horrible perfomance. Windows 8.1 is a mess.</br>  <br>Yes, play Witcher 3 or new games with 8gb of RAM and still thinking that.</br>  Ubuntu is inferior to ms windows in many ways, and superior in only a few ways. Ubuntu sucks when using a projector, 3rd party software compatibility, and basic software applications, among many other things. For desktop use, only the most common applications are complete and functional. I despise ms windows, but it works.  <br>bullshit. every linux in some way is server os. I like how when I update the distro it just keeps working... justify any other distro with point please.</br>  <br> ms windows <br> MS WINDOWS <br>basically, disregard all of which has been said by this poster.</br></br></br>  <br>he is old school you are new school fuck you.</br>  <br> more light weight <br><br>Read what I said above about nowadays standards for hardware. Most computers come with i3/i5 and 8GB RAM sometimes more, even i7 seems to be the norm for laptops nowadays.<br><br>So I believe talking about "lightweight" is a bit redundant nowadays, since in today's standards, everything's lightweight, especially when it comes to everyday stuff like Facebook, YouTube, banking, browsing the internet and watching movies.</br></br></br></br></br>  tl;dr:<br>op, install gentoo on Hurd</br>  <br> old school <br> implying being "old school" is better then being "new school" <br>fuck off</br></br></br>  <br>you do have to admit 8.1 is a bloated mess that slows operations down if you dont think this you are a millennial shitbag and we dont care about your opinion.</br>  <br>I love Linux but since I pretty much use my laptop for websurfing and games its useless. Linux is just overall faster and more secure than windows but unless you need to install linux then theres no point in fucking with it</br>  <br>it just means he knows more than you faggot.</br>  <br>The only problem with -buntu and other distros of lunix is THE FUCKING TERMINAL SHELL<br> And software installation without using markets like Windows can, FUCKING DEPENDENCES </br></br>  <br>I use W7 for everything except my laptop which I barely touch and it has 8.1. Not a fan of it but with the right customisation tools, you can "unbloat" 8.1 to make it good.</br>  <br> bragging about using Ubuntu of all things <br>Literally babys first linux distro</br></br>  Ubuntu is superior... I'd buy a Mac however  <br>So saying "ms windows" means he knows more than me?<br>If I said "gnu linux" would I be "old school" and know more than him?<br><br>Are you retarded?</br></br></br></br>  <br>if you would learn to use the terminal shell you could install software nigga</br>  I dual boot all of my machines between MS and Ubuntu. I spend most of my time in Ubuntu because I do a lot of shell scripting and Power Shell is annoying. I need Windows for certain applications that frankly suck with WINE and it's less hassle to just have a Windows partition I can boot into natively vs running Windows in a VM.<br><br>Having said all that, however, I have been a Linux user since the Slackware days and I've said time and time again that what will keep Linux out of the mainstream, regardless of distro, is X. X can be a hassle when it goes sideways even for veteran users, and is a complete nightmare for newcomers.</br></br>  <br> Mac is only good with audio editing </br>  <br>it is a very taxing os but when you game it is actually better but if you installed xp on your current computer you would shit your self at the responsiveness.</br>  <br> lunix <br> TERMINAL SHELL <br>what's wrong with using terminal faggot<br><br> software installation without using markets like Windows can <br>get a debian distro and just install a .deb archive faggot<br>or use the make utility<br>or just MOVE AN EXECUTABLE TO A DIRECTORY IN THE PATH LIKE YOU'RE NOT RETARDED</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it means he was around when it was called ms windows and you should listen to someone like that but why would you you impose your bullshit opinion on everyone you meet no matter what they know. neo /b/ folks.</br>  <br>ubuntu is pretty bloated m8. Unity is one of the most resource hogging DEs out there and you hardly get anything to show for it</br>  <br>I like XP but Windows 7 is superior and the difference in responsiveness negligible compared to the benefits you get.<br><br>My 8.1 laptop is not fit for gaming so I do everyday stuff on it and Windows 8.1 is decent for that.</br></br></br>  <br>Hey Is there anything like CCleaner(deletes old prefect data, browsing data,etc) for ubuntu?<br><br>I tried looking everywhere and asking /g/ but got no answers other than ''you can do it your self'' but CCleaner overwrites the data with 1's and 0's.</br></br></br>  <br> Ubuntu <br> superior to winhoes <br>Not really, both are shit-tier OS</br></br></br>  <br>i have ubuntu on a 128gb flash drive. it pretty useful to carry around a desktop of shit around with you.</br>  <br>its absolutely not negligible you never even had xp thats how I know your a faggot.</br>  <br> familiarity with ME and earlier <br> intricate understanding of 7/8/10 <br>one does not preclude the other</br></br></br>  <br>Stop making assumptions, fag. I've had both 98 and XP. Windows 7's built in search in Start menu was the main selling point for me.<br><br>Windows XP was great back in the day, but it's time to get on with the times.</br></br></br>  Linux shits all over microsoft and apple. <br>Can they run on 512 mb of ram?</br>  <br>it just means we knew what it used to be like. dont be a faggot know it all. youre really bad at it.</br>  <br>Say that to the normies, that's why linux is changed to windows in some areas of Germany, cuz the normal people are not going to learn to use that fucking old piece of crap called TERMINAL.</br>  <br>You would have to be pants on head retarded to install Ubuntu, Linux mint, eOS, puppy Linux, Kali, or anything with kde or gnome add the de (really any de but those especially) <br><br>All of those distros are designed solely for personal use</br></br></br>  <br>You really are fucking stupid. Jesus Christ.<br><br>So if you call something by it's outdated name, you're automatically smarter and know everything about it. Even thought what you say is bullshit. Ok, I understand.<br><br>Oh, and saying someone is "new school" and saying they don't know anything is totally not "impose[ing] your bullshit opinion on everyone you meet no matter what they know"<br><br>Just unplug your router.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  The biggest draw of Linux is the amount of options you have, I think. Also, it runs better on older/low power hardware. Gaming is a problem, but nowhere near as much as before. Linux ports are becoming much more common.  <br>You didnt look very hard apparently</br>  <br>they all break when you update the distro fuck off.</br>  <br> Can they run on 512 mb of ram? <br>Are you retarded? Even Windows 7 runs on 512mb of RAM.</br></br>  <br> it just means we knew what it used to be like <br> dont be a faggot know it all <br> WE KNOW MORE THAN YOU <br> YOU'RE BEING A FAGGOT KNOW-IT-ALL <br><br>Jesus fuck dude. Do you have to consciously try to be that fucking retarded?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It had pretty shitty reviews at the software center.</br>  <br>stfu millennial faggot your all fucking google faggots that cant think for themselves as evidenced by your bullshit posts.</br>  <br> W10 also could </br>  <br>XP is much faster than 8.1 do you understand what I'm saying?</br>  <br> we <br>you're such a faggot.<br> We're so special for using MS Windows <br>no nigger I used ms windows too, but they haven't called themselves ms windows in so long that I decided to MOVE ON</br></br></br></br>  <br>Almost all current Gen pc games are optimized for 8/8.1.</br>  Both suck , Arch Linux master race  <br> normies need to use a terminal for work <br> IT people can't use a terminal <br>wtf am i reading</br></br></br>  <br>Have fun trying to get Win7 working smoothly on 512mbs of RAM.<br>Of course RAM is insanely cheap these days, so it's not a huge deal, except maybe for cheap offices.</br></br>  <br>a lot of shit in the software center has shitty reviews. Try downloading it, using it, and formulating your own opinion</br>  <br>nice memes<br> "millennial faggot" <br> "your all fucking google faggots" <br>I'm making pages on knowyourmeme as we speak. Thank you for giving me these nice memes!</br></br></br></br>  <br>faggot.</br>  <br> Arch  <br> master race <br>pick one faggot</br></br></br>  <br>Still less bloated than Windows</br>  <br>doesnt address the actual point good job nobodys impressed.</br>  <br> I can't learn simple shit <br> I'm retarded <br>if you know how to fucking type, you know how to fucking terminal</br></br></br>  <br> Average user <br> Arch Linux </br></br>  <br> Sudo apt-get faggot </br>  I haven't switched to linux yet but so far my reasons are:<br>*Fuck microsoft and their piece of shit OS cheap fagggots<br>*Linux is free and open source<br>*I heard Linux is FAR more customizable because there are different "flavours" you can install because apparently Linux is only a kernel, and for example Linux Mint might be the full os basically means you can choose different looks and desktop styles and a bunch of other shit - useful because the fucking windows doesn't even fucking give enough customization to the start menu, the windows 8.1 shit is so fucked<br>PS if you lose your windows copy and dont have recovery because the fuckheads are so fucked theres an error, LINUX IS FREE SO YOU DONT HAVE TO FUCKING DOWNLOAD CRACK TORRENTS OR SPEND ON ANOTHER FUCKING COPY<br><br>FUCK YOU WINDOWS<br><br>/rant</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> the most casualfag Linux <br> the best thing ever made </br></br>  <br>leave em be they know not which they do.</br>  <br>8/10<br>gentoo's alright too, but building everything from source is a little retarded</br></br>  <br>Probably because there was no point dipshit.</br>  <br>KDE distros are less bloated than windows</br>  <br>STFU stupid dumb dumb.</br>  <br><br> Other than being free, what are some of its benefits that'd apply mainly to the average user? <br><br>It's more efficient; a shitty ten year old rig can still run perfectly on Linux, even though it'd be trash if you put windows on it. That means you basically never need to upgrade your hardware, and you never need to pay for software updates. It extends your battery life if you're on a laptop, since your computer won't need as much energy to run. You're practically guaranteed to never get a virus. Also, you don't need to worry about Microsoft fucking around with your computer. <br><br> What about support for games <br><br>Windows is much better when it comes to gaming just because it's so much better supported. If gaming is a big priority for you then just get Windows. If you want the best of both worlds and you don't mind restarting your computer, dual booting is also an option. <br><br> ...Programs, etc? <br><br>There's a shitload of programs that Linux doesn't support, but in almost every case you can either get by using something like Wine, or you can find a free alternative that's just as good. <br><br><br>If you aren't very tech savvy, don't bother with Linux. If you play a lot of games, stay away from Linux unless you don't mind restarting your computer all the time to dual boot. Other then that, Linux is probably the better operating system.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> open source <br>Normies don't care/don't know about open source tho.<br><br>You ask them what it means and they keep mumbling "muh open source".</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not when you actually start doing it, things always run so much smoother when compiled for your own system</br>  <br>This is wrong. 8.1 uses UEFI, and ripped a bunch of shit off Unix based OS's. Show me your data.</br>  <br> yum install faggot </br>  All can i say is Android<br> /thread </br>  <br>Duh but still too bloated for a server</br>  <br> not shitposting from hardened OpenBSD <br> not auditing every single piece of code <br> using insecure OS <br> 1998+17 <br>pleb</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you dont even have a copy of xp you faggot stfu.<br> thats ok I'll google it. </br></br>  <br>dumb dumb faggot boy. do you think you are fooling anyone?</br>  <br>I'm talking about Linux for modern computers. If you have a modern computer then your first point is null.</br>  <br>Have fun with:<br> almost zero fucking driver support <br> googling shit and copying and pasting code into the terminal when shit inevitably breaks <br> no games <br> popular software on windows not supported <br> lots of other shit </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>free is right.<br><br>free as in you don't pay for it.<br>free as in you are free to do whatever you imagine without an annoying user interface shoved up your ass.<br>free as in free from viruses and security holes and windoz niggerware</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Using a 14 year old OS <br>It was solid of course, but Jesus Christ.</br></br>  <br>are you a mac fag? you sound like a mac fag.</br>  <br>yes. though the internal workings of different flavours is slightly different.<br>if you find a flavour you like, you can just install a different desktop or theme on it anyway.</br></br>  Ubuntu is nigger Linux.  <br>It honestly isn't on modern hardware<br><br>For one 32 bit on all stable versions (yes they made a 64 pro version but it was very buggy)<br><br>It also has a maximum support of 3GB ram</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I actually have unused 2 copies of XP professional right now. I'm also a different person than who you are arguing with.</br>    <br>windows 10 fag. I liked using linux but theres just no practical reason for me to use it and driver support is shit as well as other reasons i listed</br>  <br>Nice misconceptions there, mate</br>  <br>the point you imbicile is that its faster. why would an 8 year old os be FASTER than the new os and why would you want a slower os in the first place?</br>  <br>yeah, that's what I've heard. I didn't notice much except when doing benchmarks. That said, if I want to install something that requires 20+ dependencies, it takes a while to compile everything.</br>  <br>Yeah if you legit want to know whether you should switch:<br>* If you are tech savvy and don't want cheap shit<br>* If you don't support microsoft and want them to die in a hole<br>* If you appreciate the people who put effort into things<br>* If you have the resources to have both os just in case linux doesn't have what you want, but overall you hate microsoft because theyre faggots</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>mad because its true</br>  <br>I kind of want to see what Win10 can do.

I really enjoyed it. Any opinions about it?  <br>yes and yes.</br>  <br>Thats fucking cringy, hopefully thats a copypasta, can anyone confirm?</br>  <br><br>I would have to say Kurosawa's Seven Samurai is truly god tier even though it has become a cliche, helps to see it with fresh eyes<br><br>Ikiru good too</br></br></br></br>      <br>its interesting but birdman was like 100 times better</br>  <br>whats so cringy? and no its not pasta</br>  <br> birdman <br>another good one</br></br>  <br> Gran Torino <br> shit-tier </br></br>    <br>yes i love the way it was one continuous scene</br>  Lesson of the Evil, really good movie  <br><br>great poster, 'hilarious' lol</br></br>  <br><br>saw this keep showing up on several lists, found it on TPB but havent yet watched it<br><br>Sunshine too, but watched that and agreed</br></br></br></br>      <br>my favourite sci-fi film</br>  <br><br>yeah, this one really impressed me, though watched it with a friend and he hated it, jerky camera made me nauseous, but the alien concept was very well done</br></br>  <br>well, fuck you for disliking it, faggot. it can go both ways.</br>  <br> God tier film <br>A cinematographer's beautiful work of art that has become part of the zeitgeist despite how long ago it was made - Timeless storytelling<br><br> Shit tier film <br>Pretty much anything from the last 5 years - reboots, recreations, anything based off of 80s or early 90s titles, semi-philosophical bullshit with no basis<br><br>Ex Machina is objectively shite.<br>Kill yourself!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>chek</br>  <br>Nice cinematography, though not like House of Flying Daggers. Worth watching for the fight scene and fucking alone<br>Remake was meh</br></br>  <br><br>for the black comedy genre, 'Freeway' is one of the best i've scene so i would say god tier for black comedy, cant find poster sorry</br></br>  <br>Muh nigga<br><br>One of the few good Hugh Jackman films around<br>Nice to see Bowie as Tesla too</br></br></br></br>  <br>the fuck she so pale for?</br>  <br>9/10 only for lack of colour<br>Rated alongside The Pianist and Enemy At The Gates for best depressing wartime film</br></br>  <br>Fuck yeah.</br>  <br> Football star, interviewer and mad scientist accidentally a spaceship to another galaxy <br> Meet Ming the Merciless, master of Mongo <br> Start an uprising <br> Get fucked up <br> BRIAN BLESSED! DIIIIIIIIIIIIIVE!!! <br> Brian May and Queen <br><br>7/10 ending<br>Good film</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>great movie</br>  Just saw 'the butterfly effect' movie and it was really good. I like that memories-travel concept like in the 'Life is strange' videogame. What does /b/ think about this movie? Is it the second part of the movie as good as the first one?  If you're not an illiterate fuck and can see the difference between art and porn, you might enjoy this as much as I do.    <br>It's boring as fuck, but nothing like Michael Bay. There's very little CGI, mostly just the robot arm. It's beautifully made, I just think it's wasted on such a crap story.</br>  <br>pff star wars is shit</br>  1 - 2, not the reboot.  <br>Great movie indeed, one of my favorites.<br>Unfortunately, as is tradition with sequels, the next one is a lot sub par.</br></br>  <br>Not a movie, but god tier for sure.</br>  <br>ive heard about this but dont know what it is about. tell me</br>    <br>I've showed this movie to 10+ people who think they are ready. Every time I warn them. If we start this, you're watching the whole thing.</br>    <br>You have pretty shitty taste in movies, anon.</br>  <br>Agreed watched it as well good but not god .</br>  <br>Yeah, so typical. Do you recommend any other mindblowing, interesting movies similar to that one?</br>    <br>i think its the same director as Ex Machina</br>  BRONSON    Actually made me make an imdb account to rate it!  <br>4 old fuckers during ww2 kidnap a group of underage teens (boys and girls) and have sex with them, make them eat their shit and eventually kill them</br>  <br>thats a fucking good movie</br>  <br>Great movie...you should watch trainspotting if you like that one</br>  <br>100% correct. fucking Will Ferrel ruined it.</br>  <br>Well the only ones that come to mind with a similar setting (loss of memory) is Memento and Paycheck. Both pretty decent imo</br>  <br>Yeah it's the same writer.</br>  One of my favorites. <br><br>Don't know why they had to turn it into a TV show considering the story is self-contained. Don't know if I want to even give it a chance.</br></br>  This.  <br>Fookin prawn</br>  <br>That movie needs a remake, the story is great</br>  <br>I liked the professional gaming career jab. The rest was shit though.</br>  Squeel like a piggy you fags  Pulp fiction niglets  <br>Rig approves</br>  Actual God Tier movies.<br>Star Wars - the original 3.<br>Silence of the Lambs.<br>The Exorcist<br>Nightmare of Elm Street - only the original<br>Friday the Thirteenth - only the original<br>Halloween - again, only the original<br>Texas Chainsaw Massacre<br>Rocky Horror Picture Show - STILL played in some theaters.<br>Blade Runner<br>Jaws<br>Raiders of the Lost Ark<br>Gone with the Wind<br>Blazing Saddles<br>Airplane<br>Monty Python's Search for the Holy Grail<br><br>There's a ton more.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Not shitting you guys. I love in Los Angeles and 2 weeks ago they screened some shit indie movie called /B/tard.<br>They were advertising it as "The Fight Club of the Internet generation."</br>  Probably my current favorite movie  <br>Thanks man. I also meant like psycological movies. Ever saw Shutter island? Dicaprio's in it. That wasn't a great movir but you know the plot-idea. Also Personal reccomendations?</br>  <br>holy shit anon i saw posters for that to</br>  <br>You serious?</br>  <br>nice b8 m8, in all serious this more sucked major dicks</br>  <br>these dubs better be lying or there is going to be a shitstorm of the century</br>  Donnie darko<br>Mr Nobody<br>The raid 1 and 2<br>Pic related<br>Ip man 1-3<br>Boondock saints<br>Reservoir dogs<br>Pulp fiction <br>Fight club <br>Godfather<br>Inception <br>No country for old men<br>Memento<br>Anything by Quentin Tarantino<br>The matrix series<br>And our very own American Phycho<br> probably forgetting a lot watch a movie nearly every night and I'm 23 </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not one of the movies is fun at all anon, It seems like you just like watching bullshit with a deeper meaning, Are you 16 with a media elective?</br>  <br>Yep, dead serious. I made a thread about it that night. No one gave a fuck, so oh well. Shit even said "Inspired by Four-Chan" and had the url at the bottom. Good news is it was just a screening and an indie film, so not too popular.</br>  <br>Actually a good flick</br>  Can I get help identifying a movie? I was on some drugs at the time.. <br><br>all I remember is the movie taking you on a trip sort of thing.<br>It's about a guy walking places in a town. Perhaps talks to a few people over and over again. Like the butterfly effect. I can remember a house and torturing going on in a basement. I think that's when the movie ends.</br></br></br>  <br>Hm, I love movies with a strong element of deranged/crazy in them. <br><br>You've probably seen the more popular ones like Fight Club, Watchmen, 7 Deadly Psychopaths etc<br><br>For a more "intellectual" approach, I recommend The Perfect Host. It starts out slowly but then it's twist after twist after twist after twist. That last half hour of the movie is insane.<br><br>For a more brutal evening, I'd say Rampage (the 2009 one)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice 911 roll Allahu Akbar my friend <br>And I like you a lot sir</br></br>  <br>Why that's a bit familiar to Blair's Witch Project?</br>  <br>Great flick</br>  <br>And i cant stop muhself from smiling<br><br>If were drinkin then im buying</br></br></br>  <br>I love king of the hill and I love Office Space, This movie sucked more dicks then you Anon.</br>  Celeb Crush Thread      emma watson      <br>Greasy ass skin</br>  aubrey plaza everyday            <br><br><br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br></br>  Just finished this, what in the name of fuck actually happened?  <br>We are the aliens all along.<br><br>Turns out when Murph was getting signs it was her dad in the future.
