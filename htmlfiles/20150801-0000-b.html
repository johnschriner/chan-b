What you’re referring to as Windows, is in fact, NSA/Windows, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, NSA plus Windows. Windows is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another expenseive component of a fully functioning Spy system made useful by the NSA core-spyware, reverse shell utilities and vital keylogging components comprising a full botnet as defined by Gen. J. Clapper.<br>Many computer users run a modified version of the botnet system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of spyware which is widely used today is often called “Windows”, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the NSA system, developed by the NSA. There really is a Windows, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use.<br>Windows is the cover: the program in the system that hides the spying resources from the other programs that you run. The cover is an essential part of a botnet, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete botnet. Windows is normally used in combination with the NSA spyware: the whole system is basically botnet with Windows added, or NSA/Windows. All the so-called “Windows” versions are really versions of NSA/Windows.</br></br></br>  <br>I enjoy it so far tbh</br>  <br>My fillings are hurting from the massive amount of tinfoil you're using.</br>  <br>What virus protection u using negro.

When even that pile of shit runs actually well, you know you won't have too much problems.</br>  <br>I still haven't gotten the update notification?</br>  <br>Actually, he's kind of right on this one, in the fact that windows 10, when installed, and if you don't do a SHIT ton of settings changes, WILL log almost ALL your information, including your keystrokes, phone calls, messages, texts, emails, and keep track of ALL of it. It will also automatically give any and all of your facebook friends instant access to your wifi if they're around it, because it connects with your facebook itself.<br>Please see</br></br>  <br>That's always good. Thanks anon</br>  <br>right click -&gt; search -&gt; hidden</br>  <br>I trust my friends. What's your excuse for being a raging faggot?</br>  <br>Get a direct download from Microsoft website thats what i did</br>  <br>Be a pal and give me the link?</br>  <br>Good, thanks anon</br>  I FUCKED CORTANA.  <br>This anon shouldn't be allowed to vote.<br>Srsly.</br></br>  <br>Seriously /g/ has been pushing this meme far longer then any other, and know one has fallen for it yet, time to give up m8</br>  <br>mad or naw</br>  still waiting  <br>Are your friends so worthless that you compare them to politicians? The friends you keep says a lot about you as a person.</br>  <br>You dont need a usb its a direct download <br>http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/soft<wbr>ware-download/windows10</wbr></br></br>  <br>antiX at the moment, it is a Debian based distro without systemd, i would be using slackware but slack seems to be a little slow at kicking out a new release and slackware-14.1 is starting to show its age</br>  Whats sad about this is, even with proof and evidence in your face you will continue being the sheep that you are baaaa baaaa baaaa<br><br> Even Lame Stream Media covered this <br><br>What you have is a case of "Cognitive Dissonance" but you are too unintelligent to know what that means XD</br></br></br></br>  <br>Same here. Fucking crustacean.</br>  <br>Shit you do seem like a massive faggot tbh</br>  <br>You do need to worry about windows sharing your wifi, you don't have any friends.</br>  <br>Thanks so much.</br>  <br>I have schizophrenia and use Linux + change my password every week.. not even I am that paranoid..</br>  <br>Don't*</br>  <br>i do not care sgt faggot<br>also check em!</br></br>  Doing just fine.  <br>What exactly is faster? In all benchmarks I saw the performance in programs and games was +-1% compared to Win7.</br>  <br>You must be young not to know that even the best friends may fail. It happens to everyone, sooner or later. Trust is good, control is better.<br><br>Just imagine you fuck the wrong person and have phoned to them. Then they decide to destroy your life. Do you really want to have an open WLAN?<br><br>Just imagine, someone you know has a psychological episode and decide you are the devil, because they suddenly became clinically paranoid.<br><br>There is plentry of reason to be cautious.<br><br>People who think like you are allowing the establishment to take away the little freedom we still have left. Our ancestors died for those freedoms, you anti-hero. Become an hero, please.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There a a few examples, but not very many. However the games coming out from now on will be much better on Win10, using Dx12 and all that.</br>  <br>You have a very colorful imagination.</br>  <br>No problem anon</br>  hey guys, I also got that w10 update option yet I dont want to backup and shit.. Is there any chance I might be able to install that and keep all my apps as they are? I stream a lot so like setting everything again would be pain in the ass..   Somethings been up for the passed 2-3 days /b/ro.....this shit has been on here every hour<br><br> its indoctrination and behavior modification </br></br>  <br>Sorry anon, but what the fuck are you saying? Couldn't understand a damn thing you said other than Windows=NSA, I have an itching feeling there was more to it than that.</br>  <br>The best browser coming trough.</br>  <br>The upgrade leaves all your software and shit alone.</br>  <br>You keep all of your applications</br>  <br>No, just several decades of life experience.<br><br>Weird things happen.<br>E.g. once I've even seen a UFO, but it looked terrestrial due to position lights.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not sure about others, but when I downloaded the tool from MS, I could simply upgrade (w/o burning the image to a cd or usb) and I had the option to keep my settings/apps. And I have everything running just as they did before, even my pirated word/excel.</br>  <br>Use something to create a disk image.<br>Look into Norton Ghost, CloneZilla or use any Linux with the dd command.<br><br>Once your windows is tainted, you just rewrite the image back to the disk and your Windows thinks, it never aged a day.</br></br></br></br>  <br>kek<br>You don't even know how to secure a fucking network and then you proceed to talk like Aiden Pearce. Please continue.</br></br>  <br>oops.... this ^<br>should link this:<br/></br></br>    <br>It's GAHNOO</br>  <br>HOLY LOL</br>  <br>Audio is fucked up. VLC and other players sound like everything is in a wind tunnel.<br>Otherwise I'm liking it.</br></br>  <br> NSA/Windows, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, NSA plus Windows <br>Nobody understood that reference? Jesus fucking Christ.</br></br>  also if your not using this your a faget  <br>No system is secure, except you disconnect it from the network and the power grid, remove all batteries and put it in a sound proof container. To maximize security, pour concrete and have it cover the box, then sink it in the Marianna trench.<br><br>Seriously, I am an expert.<br>The only reliable way to secure something is to make it more expensive to get at the item in question compared to it's value.<br><br>If you should do something you do not want the man to know, do not use electricity at all.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is there an option to give Cortana a British accent?</br>  <br>Bro what the fuck are you talking about i wasnt even talking to you</br>  <br>I disconnected all drives except the main os drive and now it seems to be working. We'll see.</br>  <br>I got it. I thought it was hilarious.<br><br>Seems /b/ is far from the good ol' days of anonymous</br></br></br>  Win10 vs Linux (any) Thread<br>What do you prefer and why?<br>(pic unrelated)</br></br>  <br>Try PotPlayer</br>  <br>Fuck meant to make new thread.
