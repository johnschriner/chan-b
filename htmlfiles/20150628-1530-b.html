But you know what I like a lot more than materialistic things?<br>Knowledge. In fact, I'm alot more proud of these 7 new bookshelves that I had to get installed to hold 2000 new books that I bought. Its like the billionaire Warren Buffett says "the more you learn, the more you earn".<br>Now maybe you've seen my Tedx talk where I talk about how I read a book a day, you know I read a book day not to show off, it's again it's about the knowledge.<br>In fact the real reason I keep this Lamborghini here is that it's a reminder, a reminder that dreams are still possible because it wasn't that long ago that I was in a little town in a little town across the country sleeping on a couch in a mobile home with only $47 in my bank account. I didn't have a college degree, I had no opportunities. But you know what? something happened that changed my life, I bumped into a mentor and another mentor and a few more mentors. I found 5 mentors and they showed me what they did to become multi-millionaires.<br>Again, its not just about money, its about the good life, health, wealth, love and happiness. And so i record a little video it's actually on my website, you can click here on this video and it will take you to my website where i share 3 things that they taught me. 3 things that you can implement today no matter where you are. Now this isn't a get rich quick scheme. You know, if they say things sound too good to be true, they are too good to be true. I'm not promising you that tomorrow you're going to be able to go out and buy a Lamborghini, but what I am telling you is that it can happen faster than you think if you know the proven steps.</br></br></br></br>  Dumping tai lopezes            <br><br>Did you type it from what you heard or you got the lyrics somewhere?</br></br>  ITT: ONLY SERIOUS WEBM COLLECTORS<br><br>These are the rules.<br>1.
