You can count on me to be there to bring your fucking life to a hellish end. I’ll put you in so much fucking pain that it’ll make Jesus being nailed to a cross in the desert look like a fucking back massage on a tropical island. I don’t give a fuck how many reps you have or how tough you are IRL, how well you can fight, or how many fucking guns you own to protect yourself. I’ll fucking show up at your house when you aren’t home. I’ll turn all the lights on in your house, leave all the water running, open your fridge door and not close it, and turn your gas stove burners on and let them waste gas. You’re going to start stressing the fuck out, your blood pressure will triple, and you’ll have a fucking heart attack. You’ll go to the hospital for a heart operation, and the last thing you’ll see when you’re being put under in the operating room is me hovering above you, dressed like a doctor. When you wake up after being operated on, wondering what ticking time bomb is in your chest waiting to go off. You’ll recover fully from your heart surgery. And when you walk out the front door of the hospital to go home I’ll run you over with my fucking car out of no where and kill you. I just want you to know how easily I could fucking destroy your pathetic excuse of a life, but how I’d rather go to a great fuckng length to make sure your last remaining days are spent in a living, breathing fucking hell. It’s too late to save yourself, but don’t bother committing suicide either… I’ll fucking resuscitate you and kill you again myself you bitch-faced phaggot.

Like the Zombie mod. Those were genuinely terrifying back then. Those modders had some serious talent. But overall, the most hours I had played were in MW2. Something like 592 hours. And then I was randomly banned for no reason. Which is a shame because I loved that game almost as much as COD4. <br><br>In comparison, I had only played 92 hours of Black Ops. Absolutely hated it. And then MW3.. Less than 30 hours.

She's been running a slut campaign to get attention to gain viewership and fans - her Milk Milk Lemonade music video and her slutty Star Wars shoot, the Comedy Central adverts for her show highlighting her conversation about masturbation... It's all a test to see if a mediocre attempt at comedy can be sold as long as there's enough sex tied into it. The only reason they are even trying this is because women just aren't funny as comedians - because they aren't funny in general. Women fret over stupid and inane shit, mostly oriented around their appearance whether it's hair style, make up, or fashion. They are the materialistic part of society. They get together in their little herds and go on a shopping spree because their sense of "fun" and excitement is either buying useless, stupid shit to enhance their appearance, or going out to some dance floor to slut it up and be looked at so they can feel good about how they look. They are incredibly superficial. Because of this, if they aren't treated like a princess in this shitty society, they end up with no self-esteem, get depressed, and hate on pretty girls who get what they want and men for not "appreciating" them more. They literally cannot gain pleasure from anything other than being treated like a princess to vindicate their tired efforts of trying to look like the best trophy around. That's why whenever they ever are out partying, they scream "WOO!" to try and brainwash themselves into thinking they are having fun, when really they are miserable about not being worshiped as some trophy wife in a marriage where she has the power because she has the coveted vagina. Women are constantly comparing themselves to each other. They gossip about idiotic stuff and tear each other down behind their backs. They aren't a pleasurable creature outside of their physiology for sex. Thus, there is a wild abundance of male comics.<br>cont.</br></br></br>    <br>holy shit fresh pasta 2015 my eyes</br>  <br>calm your shit nerd</br>  <br>she has the expression of a talentless dick who cant act and isnt very intelligent waiting to get outed for it but that outing never comes because america is now officially over.</br>  One arm, don't care, would violate every hole.        <br>Think of all of the comedic actors in hollywood. Think of how they are all men. Women aren't fucking funny because they can't just have a good time doing simple things like hanging out. They can't handle jokes or faux insults about themselves. Guys find pleasure in simple, stupid activities in everyday life. We can insult our friends all day all in good humor with the understanding that none of it is true, but you'll never find that in a group of women. They suffer too greatly from groupthink and because of this any inkling of verbal assault is taken personally, again because of how superficial they are. Just like how whites don't find black comedy funny because of some sort of hidden culture we aren't apart of - women are incapable of humor because they simply don't get the simple pleasures in life because they can't back out of their inward focus of trying to micro-analyse and compare their assets to others. <br><br>They can't do comedy because they can't share the right concerns and experiences and complaints with the audience. They can't partake in any degree of comedic storytelling style because their stories, wherein there must be a dilemma, revolve around meaningless things. <br><br>So, now we have comedy central, trying to find a way to build up a female comic because they believe there's this untapped viewership for female comedians, but they inherently know that because of how unfunny and incapable Amy Schumer is as comedian because she's a woman, they have to slut it up for interest to men.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>She thinks wearing a nice dress and a wig makes her pretty.</br>  <br><br><br>Good analysis/ post. <br>However, this is /b/ so it's all wasted time.</br></br></br></br>    What a fat, unfunny, ugly cunt of a twat  <br>Amy Schumer is a skank, the only reason she is famous is because she is 'proud and out' about being a skank. Judd Aptow tries to make a movie that makes her look 'cute', 'lovable', 'adorable', but she has none of those features, she is just an obnoxious skank, will always be an obnoxious skank.<br><br>she has 'daddy issues' because her mom bailed on her rich jewish dad as soon as he lost his forture. she is the poster child for whores who will fuck anybody for attention</br></br></br>  <br>I agree with you OP. Except I think Kristin Wiig is hilarious.<br>And I'm a guy. I never find women funny.</br></br>  shannyn sossamon  <br>Well if I were to post it on social media I'd be immediately ostracized by everyone and labeled as a supreme sexist, even though while sounding sexist, if you actually think about it, it's true. That's also why loads of comics rip on women. It's because of how they inherently behave, think, and react to everything. They are great material to rip on because they are a constant source of conflict between themselves and against men.</br>  wanna eat her sweaty pussy  <br>too bad she lost a bunch of weight and deflated her titties. they probably look much worse now that she had a kid.</br>  <br><br>Sounds like the perfect match for the average faggot on this website.</br></br>      <br>Dianna Agron man</br>  <br>Lol I called you op because the actual original post was such shit I thought yours was the actual point</br>  <br>She'll hold a special place in my heart because of things I've done to pics of her</br>  <br>She is perfection</br>    <br>Is she best marvel grill?</br>    <br>Had them reduced</br>  <br>I haven't heard her. I've pretty much given up watching female comic stand up. I've heard Whitney Cummings is hilarious, so I'll check her out when her special hits Netflix, but from my experience I always end up turning it off and walking away from the TV because of how much of a failure each attempt is I see from females in comedy.</br>  <br>or new. cant tell</br>    I would fuck the shit out of Amy Schumer no questions asked  <br><br>Man fap sessions of my childhood were to this vixen.</br></br>    <br> garterbelt <br><br>Now I want to fuck her man</br></br></br>  <br>He nude scene was the biggest let down ever. <br>It's not unheard of for a 9/10 in close to be a 7/10 nude but she went from a 10/10 to a 4/10</br></br>  <br>She doesn't really do stand-up.
