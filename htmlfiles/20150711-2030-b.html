[ What are y'all doing?  fighting a skellington with a pizza. you?  <br>Listening to music. Thinking about jerking it. Not much at the moment</br>  waiting for my food to be cooked and sitting here thinking "damn i like my battlestation"  Diarrhea. On the toilet as we speak.  Thinking something very naughty.  checking out intellicast.com to see if I have good hiking weather for tomorrow (it's good, sunny and about 84 deg.).  <br>Pics</br>  <br>Like what?</br>  Eating breakfast  <br>That's nice. Wish it would rain.</br>  <br>Can't say. That's how naughty it is.</br>  <br><br>Are you in Cali?</br></br>  <br>Morning somewhere I guess.</br>  <br>Listening the Jefferson Airplane</br>  03xx hours here in Minnesota.

Sounds like a good time.</br>  <br>Southern MN. Perch catfish pike. Muddy prairie pothole lakes.

But they don't take fafsa. <br>But all of that was spent on books. Books ran me about 2,000 a semester. And we had 3 semesters.. So nothing really lasted very long. One "semester" was only 3 weeks long but they require all freshmen to take it and you have to take a 8 hours.</br></br></br>  Oh my god you guys drive shit boxes  what is the whitest car ever ?  <br>What do you drive then, all mighty automotive judge</br>  <br>Sorry forgot to add you to my post, </br>  My car  <br>he's probably going to pretend to have some fancy car, but even if he does i guarantee there is a "my mom/dad's" that needs to go before it that he won't include.</br>  <br> mah nigga <br>is it type s?<br>pic of dat frosty ass for you</br></br></br>  <br>I already posted my car.</br>  <br> chrome ebay tails <br>Cant get any worse</br></br>  <br><br>Thanks!<br><br><br>wutt?</br></br></br></br></br>  Ey  My bae  <br>I've not seen anything spectacular enough to not be a "shit box" compared to the other cars</br>  <br>yeah, barn storage tends to do that. my grandfather had a Ford Granada stored in his barn, interior was ripped and chewed until there was almost nothing left</br>  <br>I got a B7 S4.

This piece of shit's name is Ryan Snowden. He lives in Martinsville, IN and he is a goddamn pederass, cocksucking, piece of shit. He is 20 years old, and the girl you see in his pictures is my 13 year old cousin. He has repeatedly hit her, has her hooked on heroin, and she's too fucked up and young to realize that she's fucking her world up. I've told him to stay away from her, but the motherfucking piece of shit will not stop. Her parent are piece of shit druggies too, and I don't want her to go down the same road. He is supposedly a very well connected drug dealer, so I am afraid to do anything to him directly. He's fucking dumb enough that he would fuck with my family. I know you're not my personal army, that is why I'm requesting assistance.
