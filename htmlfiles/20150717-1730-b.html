Dick ring is from circumcision I had 4 weeks ago, swelling still persists (had really bad phimosis). Also chubby but I lost 40 pounds and gained some muscle in last 6 months so making progress.</br>  <br>TERRIFYINGLYGROSS/10</br>  <br>Weird balls. Get that checked out. <br><br><br>Scars, skin bridges. Still 7.5/10. <br><br><br>With a little cleanup 8/10<br><br><br>Uncut, nice. 8/10.<br><br><br>Very nice 7.5/10<br><br><br>Please and thank you<br><br><br>Aesthetically it is very pleasing. 7/10. Fuck the haters about size. Most of the big dicks out there look all fucked up. You've got a pretty dick, despite it's short comings. <br><br><br>Anorexic. But from what I see of the dick 7/10. <br><br><br>Stop trying to steal votes with body shots and shit. Dick looks good though. <br><br><br>Oh man. Good ol' thick and veiny. Uncut too. 8.5/10. Highest so far!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You do realize you didn't need circumcision dude just warm baths every and slowly pulling on the skin every night</br>  Would you ride it? <br>Would you suck it? <br>Rate it /b/</br></br>  <br>Is that what happens with adult circumcision? I almost got one a few months ago, but opted to try self-treatment first. Great success so far. I've gone from a pea sized opening to almost a quarter sized opening. I can see the entire front of my head now, after just a couple months of stretching on and off. I'll be a normie in no time at all.</br>  <br>I'd suck it with a woodchipper</br>  <br>You're a sweetheart.</br>  <br>I tried and doctor even prescribed some cream to loosen it. After 2 months it never worked, with erection my dick's head would just swell really badly if try to pull foreskin behind head. When I saw a urologist, he said I should get a partial (opted for a full) because my frenulum is attached way too close and directly under my urethrae (pee hole).<br><br>So do most people's penis look similar to mine or most white people actually monsters? I don't look at other men's penises often...so I have no clue.</br></br></br>  <br>I may as well just dump that last few webms I have.</br>    <br>Yup, when stitches were in it was living hell (first 2 weeks). They say all swelling should go away from 4-8 weeks. I opted for the circumcision because having phimosis gave me emotional problems during college, so I just wanted to fix it asap and have no regrets.</br>  <br>9/10 Would ride and suck</br>  Nothing spectacular  moar like this    Shenron has been summoned.

Why did you retire Hoshi if you weren't gonna let other people use him Starman?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Get back to hosting!</br>  <br>Using my character is impersonating my character. It's not cool.

I appreciate it. <br>(Do you have any new on Ab?)</br></br>  <br> doesn't play Hoshi <br> doesn't let others play Hoshi <br> muh Hoshi </br></br></br>  <br><br>do it</br></br>  Nine ded this time.

We can't let every idiot come by and take people's avas. It doesn't matter if YOU know it's not me, that's not the point. The character is taken he should pick another one.<br><br><br><br>That's better.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>...</br>  <br>i will.</br>  <br>Kill yourself<br>I want asuka back</br></br>  I'm not sure what you guys want.  <br> remember when I said I was retiring? <br><br>Never said that. Only "I won't be here that much" as before.</br></br></br>  It's the avatar choice depending if they want another version of themselves running around, for example Aikawa and Ryuko both have someone else being them, and we can easily identify them and the originals allow it. Hoshi has all right not to have another copy because he's the orginal. Case closed.  <br>What the fuck do you think I'm doing right now, faggot?</br>  <br>Thanks Raven, I'll pay you later<br> Gold </br></br>  <br>Twice now? You can't really get mad when people took you seriously and wanted the character, nor can you really claim it's yours after retiring.</br>  <br>Quit complaining about impersonation and join the club. At least your impersonator isn't trying to ERP in the thread... yet.</br>  <br>Don't worry. I'll make it right by skipping Spike's death. He got caught in a trap.<br><br>But once again, my impatience is rewarded...this time with the Feast!</br></br></br>  <br>Right, I get that. Although, we have Aikawa's Imposter, who's actually well-liked and is even going to prom.<br>It's not entirely bad, it could even be fun.<br>Although I do agree with Erica.</br></br></br>  <br>i have to agree with the starman,theres millions of other characters. and you choose whats already here, bullshit</br>  <br>That's fair. RIP Spiegel.</br>  <br>Abs? wha-<br><br>...oh...<br><br>...I probably should explain something to you kid... I'm not the same snake that you know.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The thing with them is we all accept it. aikawa is ok with another one. We all think ryuko is hilarious.</br>  <br>I'm full. I really don't need to go to the feast. <br> Gold </br></br>  <br>Be Hoshi.</br>  <br>go suck hoshi's dick</br>  <br>And just like that, a winner were declared! Who do you think it is?</br>  <br>Shit, sorry.

One more day of work n' it's the weekend. Gym time, drinking, n' some time drawing. How was your week?  bored mostly! hello, everyone  Lately, been feeling trapped. I gave up one lifestyle for another, things didn't pan out after I moved, now I'm all on my own.<br><br>I could stay here, build a new life for myself, or go back home and not. I've been debating this with myself for 6 months now and the time is drawing close to actually make a decision on it and I'm still as baffled about it as I was before.<br><br>Maybe I'll just flip a coin on it. They say you know what you really want when it's in the air. Not so sure that will hold true.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Didn't roll to ask her out, so i'm not crushed, but I feel like a pussy</br>  need help with geometry<br><br>khanacademy is so easy compared to my tests pls help /b/</br></br>  <br>I know... i just.. had a traumatic experience when i was a kid and it fucked my head up, now i cringe just by thinking about dentists, couldn't sleep at all.<br>but it will be over soon, gotta face my fears.<br>Thanks for the thread OP, i needed to talk about it.</br></br></br>  <br>beeng thinking about texting my ex a couple of weeks now<br><br>did it yesterday, saw that she didnt even read the things i wrote to her half a year ago<br><br>fuck that</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shitty. I have a very special friend. She makes me feel really good. We cuddle a lot and rarely do sexual things. I just want to go see her but I can't. Her dad is very strict, and she can never go anywhere without exact details. She got her computer and phone taken away again for asking her dad to let me go over. We got caught sending nudies to eachother. I just really want to see her pretty green-blue eyes and her curly blonde hair. Stroking her hair is my favorite thing to do, and I haven't heard from her since she got yelled at.</br>  I'm feeling needy tonight.<br>I miss my ex.</br>  <br>Hey OP. What's up?</br>  <br>find someone else to fuck while you're waiting on that one<br><br><br>only way to solve that is to find a new ex</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hello</br>  I've posted in a thread just like this before but<br>I had to break up with my girlfriend because I had overwhelming urges to hurt her even though I loved her. I'd never get mad at her I'd just want to hurt her for no reason.<br>We were gonna move somewhere nice and I was gonna propose and have a bunch of kids with her flaming red hair<br>But it never happened<br>I feel like dying /b/</br></br></br></br>  Terrible. I hate the state of this world, and, particularly, our country (the USA). Overwhelmed by religion in almost every aspect. Stupidity. Politics, too, are grossly influenced by retards who think virgins can have children. Poor people are punished. Children are lied too. Women don't know what they want because they operate on emotions, which is logically fallacious. I hate living in this world.  I failed my drivers test and I have to take the test that decides if I pass highschool or not in 9 hours, I want to die  <br>Feeling fucking shitty. Me and my ex are still in love, but we can't be together because of her controlling parents. Broke up months ago only to find the jacket I gave her on my porch today. Texted her to say thanks which perpetuated a fuckin ton of emotion and now I'm crying about her again even though I'm already with another girl.</br>  <br>Recently been looking at some grad schools. I did meet with some firms but nothing panned out and everything is slow for hiring as they all have their end of years (consulting).So it sucks because I got the job I needed to get, my gf used to make more, then when I had to travel she couldn't tolerate it. Thinking about working out, I try to step up but I'm just confused and desperate</br>  <br>Thanks for the support, i fucked up a tooth and that's what I'm worried about... dunno what they'll do.</br>  <br>The location is quite good. It's near to where I have to go every morning starting September. Also there's a pub right in front of the house. I'm more concerned if I will be able to do 2 years of school again. I've been a NEET for the last year and I've very much become a failure of a human being. If I would stay in my hometown with all the depressing memories everywhere I look I wouldn't be able to pull another 2 years of school but I guess moving into another town where I have friends that I don't see that often and having a change of scenery might help with that. Also if I would stay here I would have to get up very early to get in a train full of people to get to that town every morning.</br>  <br>Being hung up on the old ex isn't fair to the new ex</br>  new to DnD, going to be DMing for the first time soon and writing the story now. Very excited.  Trying my best not to gain any weight after losing 25kg (55 pounds). And I should probably lose some more weight as well or start working out.  <br>same here man<br><br>how long were you guys together</br></br></br>  <br>not OP but can i ask why you got with another girl if you're still in love with your ex?</br>  <br>I don't want to have sex. I want to see her.</br>  I'm in love and it feels good  lonely. gf claims to want to hangout but is making no effort to do so. I work at home and have nothing to do all day when im done.  <br>Hey man. I'm just slowly sinking into my chair. What is up with you</br>  <br>Almost 3 years.<br>Shacked up for 1.5</br></br>  <br>Are you alice? Will you give me a hug?</br>  <br>Because I can't stand to be alone. I'm trying to move on from my ex, and I am slowly. Honestly I'll probably always love her, but will never be allowed to be with her.

We need you around.</br>  <br>try something else then, don't just give up the one chance you have at living<br><br>fuck what are you like 20 something? that's the furthest you could make it before deciding "welp, i'm done"<br><br>fucking pussy nigger</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Im doing fine but really tired of being a wage slave.</br>  <br>Hate my family.<br>Wife is a slut. Kid can't behave<br>Kind of wish a plane would crash into our building while I'm at work</br></br></br>  <br>exactly.<br>that mightve been the only fault i guess.<br><br>after nearly 2 years i tried to contact her again, in the end i guess it was a dumb idea.<br><br>didnt have a gf during that time, no idea if ill ever open myself to someone else that much.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If I get rich? Can't I just be an intellectually honest individual and make change that way? Why do I have to have money in order to change retarded people? Accepting the state of affairs changes nothing.</br>  <br>you have cute gifs, I like you</br>  <br>Hey man I've seen you around in these threads a lot. I'm glad you've found something that you really enjoy doing.<br><br><br>I aint about that drama stuff. These threads are purely the helping people part.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Checked. <br><br>And feeling pretty damn good actually. I got fired from my last job due to "New Managment". But I sent out my resume and got some good offers today. <br><br>So I am stoked.</br></br></br></br></br>  Feeling good. I am recovering.  <br>Thanks. But you don't. <br><br><br>&lt;3</br></br></br></br>  <br>I can't run at my current weight, I'd wreck my knees. Also, exercising would be basically meaningless if I fell back to my old eating habits.</br>  <br>congrats!!</br>  <br>You will. Don't be afraid of it. The more people you meet, the better chance you have of finding a connection like that again.<br><br>I've found it 4 times. It's possible.</br></br></br>  <br>if you want to make mass chance to the politically corrupt system then money will help significantly<br><br>being an intellectually honest individual will chance lives, but not in mass quantity. but i personally thank you for doing so.</br></br></br>  <br>The one thing you need (besides some behavioral therapy) is a new bitch. Fuck her, forget her. She has this emotional impact on you - let time break that bond and then converge with another girl, a new, better girl, of which there are many. Go out there, man.</br>  <br>Glad to hear it.</br>  <br>maybe, who knows.</br>  <br>&lt;3</br></blockquote>]
