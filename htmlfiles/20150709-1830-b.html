I don't normally believe in suicide, but I don't see myself ever getting over this girl I have been in love with for 2 years.<br><br>We had a beautiful relationship that I fucking threw away for some chick I didn't even want to date.

I knew a guy that killed himself over a girl and he was only 19. Motherfucker got a scholarship to go to college the week after. Not saying that you'll get a scholarship or something, but there will be good times ahead. More opportunities. Better experiences. You shouldn't throw it away  OP here...<br>I only consider suicide my only option because I don't see anything else in my future.
