I am a female and I am chubby.<br>Not morbidly-obese, mind you, but not a size 2, either. <br>I am fairly active, intense police-academy physical training twice a week, and I eat fairly healthy which means only fast food once a week. I've always been chubby, since I was a child, and I have no quarrels with that. I wear bikinis to the beach, I wear shorts and tank tops. My (slight) excess fat and the fact that my thighs jiggle when I run the mile and a half under 12 minutes doesn't bother me. I have large breasts and a decent personality--not to toot my own horn. I can carry on a conversation and I look damn fine in an evening gown and the lingerie that is worn beneath it. I don't have a flat stomach, but I am perfectly healthy. I have a large ribcage and wide hips, which means I literally am big-boned and I sit at a comfortable weight of 163 to 166 at 5'8<br><br> My question is why do you think I'm fat? Why do you call me a landwhale/ham planet? <br><br> Pic related, very similar to my body type. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  Because you are<br>/thread</br>  Breeding material.

Not tremendously so, but you say so yourself.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There is absolutely no way, that you are running 1.5 in under 12 minutes with that body type. <br>If you realy were in intense police training combined with a healthy diet, your pounds would melt like ice in the sun ...</br></br>  <br>If u were confident and wore bikinis and and shit, u wouldn't have posted a pic u got off google and say its relatable u dumb bitch.

I like chubby girls because I'm attracted to that. You're fine op, just keep working on yourself and worry about making you happy and forget the rest.</br>  <br> I eat fairly healthy which means only fast food once a week <br>This better be bait, fatty.

I know it's hard to understand for a music noob, I've been practicing/writing music for 13 years. The "growls" are similar to a percussive instrument. Singing is nice, but growls add a new aspect to a normal band. It matches the distortion of the guitars and the percussiveness of the drums, throwing in a new rhythmic pattern over the rest of the song.</br>  <br>Yeah I need to get a couple hard cases.

Enjoy your garageband and your mid tier guitars.</br>  <br> poorfag <br><br>not sure that was implied but clearly you are a bit defensive about it<br><br>and you do talk like a 12 year old</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yeh. lol His best work is his cover of the final fantasy soundtrack. he's overrated.</br>  <br>He took Meshuggahs shitty style of riffing and made it listenable, so at least he did it successfully.</br>  Why don't you own any decent guitars?  <br>no im just referring to the fact that you used the phrase "a million times" you're obviously autistic if you arent 12</br>  <br>hah good job !</br>  <br>only 15 year olds call other people 12.<br>top kek you poor edgy kid.</br></br>  How's that Yamaha Bass? Thinking about getting one of those.  <br>as a metal fan (probably more than you) you sound like a moron</br>  <br>Yes. The woods they used in the 70's cant be legally used these days, the hardware is better made, and the finishes were better. You might have to clean/upgrade the pots and tuning heads.</br>  <br>use your hands and try fingerpicking<br>try to use that experience aquired with the classical</br></br>  I have been playing for 16.<br><br>Nice to see you have a BB Bass though, they're sweet.</br></br>  <br> edgy <br><br>predictable insecure pleb response</br></br></br>  <br>Listenable? His production is absolute garbage and noob tier compared to Meshuggah.</br>  <br>Why can't guitarists define a good guitar?</br>  <br>is that you anon? what shampoo do you use??</br>  <br> makes fun of another anon for saying edgy <br> calls him pleb instead <br><br>well done anon</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's okay. I've been where you're at. You just got one guitar and it's falling apart. You want to make it big, at least for a guitarist, and do some good work, but the other musicians in your life, as well as your lack of decent gear is holding you back. You're a big fish in a small pond and all you need is some professional help with your career. It's okay bro, you can stop projecting.</br>  <br>where is your solo faggot</br>  <br>because what makes a "good" guitar is subjective<br><br>also you're a massive faggot<br><br>2/8 b8 m8 since you made me reply</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I've been playing for ten years, and while I have a very good "instinctive" understanding of musical scales and tonalities, I wish I had invested more in learning scales instead of random stuff. I don't play much anymore, due to busyness/lack of inspiration, but I feel like if I ever do get back into it, practicing more core stuff will help a lot.</br>  <br>we both know how you're feeling right now anon. Stop projecting your insecurities as a musician on others.</br>  Guitar virtuoso here, waiting for my Vimeo to upload. You'll be able to audibly determine why I get so much pussy.  <br>very beatiful very dead ...yay</br>  <br>Did they (Gibson) make any guitars with the "fat 50's" neck in the 70's or 80's?</br>  <br>im a drummer.</br>  <br> Meshuggah's production is good <br>There's no sense in lying on the internet, anon.</br></br>  <br>kinda true. I mean say I want to play prog, I need less distortion and more clarity, say I'm moving to brutal death and grind, I don't need all that fancy shit and the clarity. It's all dependant on what you want to do as a musician. You use the right tools for the right job, it's not one size fits all.</br>  <br>Interesting theory. mid 70s - early 80s is pretty well understood to be the shittiest era for gibson. I have a 79 LPC. fine instrument, but I'd like to spend some time with a LP from the heyday</br>  <br><br>well this guy seemed to like my playing<br/></br></br>  <br>same shit. just swap all the guitar shit for drums, you sad story...It's okay man... You got my support! Best of luck to you, /b/rother.</br>  <br><br> samfagging this hard </br></br>  <br>"Jessie, Jessie, Jessie... Ya got no sense of humor..."</br>  <br> Meshuggah <br> angry teenage kid music </br></br>  <br>They get more attention, but you're paying thousands of dollars for them to scratch and abuse them. They're rip offs, in my opinion. Eddie VH's replica is okay, i guess, in that they replicated a unique guitar, but sanding down a LP to match what another musician did to his? I'd rather wear out my own, thanks. <br><br>The custom shop "history" guitars are aimed at wall street types and .com millionaires with more money than sense. <br><br>Find a guitar you like, that you like the sound of, that helps you be a better player, and play the shit out of it. If you want something road or studio worthy, look into vintage stuff, or the better makers, like PRS or Ibenez or some of the boutique guys. A custom built copy of a popular guitar, to your specifications, can cost as much as a brand new one, by independant, small time luthiers all over the world. <br><br>You know Slash? His "Appetite" LP was a replica. The same quality can be had for $2-3k. There are thousands of guys building guitars in their basements and garages that are better than what Gibson is pumping out.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> trying this hard to be funny <br> mfw you're a massive faggot </br></br></br>  <br> https://soundcloud.com/gilgafrank/<wbr>tubular</wbr> <br>you play like those old fucks that walk into sam ash, grab a gibson, and turn their goddamn tube amps up super high....<br><br>Jokes aside, you're alright. You're not a virtuoso, but you have decent skills at composition. Stop projecting your insecurities on others. Everyone has doubts sometimes.</br></br></br></br>  <br> edgy plebbing this hard </br>  <br>If you're going to play classical music, find good pieces. Dont pick some shitty baroque shit.</br>  <br>I don't care what you think about the riffs we're talking production<br><br>You probably think all metal is like that so your opinion is naturally discarded. Have you ever looked at their lyrics for instance?</br></br></br>  <br>It's okay if you're mad, bro. I get it. Stop tripping out man. I'm just trying to enjoy my coffee before I go to the studio, m80.</br>  <br>nice shop m80</br>  <br>If your a guitar player, why would the question have to be based on the picture? Surely, being a guitar player, you play guitar, not pictures. So why can't the question be about music? Or say, what was the last song you played on someone else's guitar, as none of those things are shown in the picture?</br>  <br>no. he realy play it good my friendo</br>  <br>Kek, i am 33, been playing since i was 8. That's 25 years. WTF can you tell me i don't already know?</br>  Why is your ceiling so low?  <br>Okay OP, legit question. What genre of music did you learn first? Did you learn that genre fully (including all scales and chords in all keys?) Also, what are some gig etiquette and experiences you can share (how to not be a fuck up for sound crew/other bands during gigs)</br>  <br>Drums</br>  <br>baroque is still cool bro. Those fucks have been dead for a long time. Better than the jonas brothers or the shit fag beatles.</br>  <br>I literally said the word production in my reply, where the fuck did I comment on the riffs?</br>  <br>Dunno, offhand. Go here:<br><br>http://www.lespaulforum.com/finalfr<wbr>ames/frameset.htm<br><br>And read - those guys know everything about LPs.</br></br></wbr></br></br></br>   not learning drums <br>It's like you hate fun</br>  <br>One that isn't a shitty Ibanez or Yamaha acoustic that sounds like garbage and plays like a hunk of shit. A nice Eastman, Lakewood, overpriced but maybe a used Taylor or Martin depending on his style of muisc. There is no definition of a "Good" guitar beyond materials, playability and construction.</br>  <br>guitarists are dime a dozen and most of them suck. probably like most of you ITT</br>  <br>ok then, there's this<br><br>https://vimeo.com/78045680<br><br>now tell me you can string bend half as well as me</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I've kinda wanted to build a high end Les Paul kit, but the staining and finishing intimidates me. I like tweaking the mechanics of guitars though.</br>  <br>Because it varies from player to player. Not even something as simple as a Les Paul is as simple as a Les Paul. Make sense?</br>  <br>kek, not even close. hahahaha</br>  <br>You're out of a job bro.</br>  <br>where should i start to learn to play guitar?</br>  <br> being this wrong <br> being this desperate to be right </br></br>  <br>average/10</br>  <br>Why do you feel that playing for 7 years is a special thing?</br>  <br>Practice more. Sweep picking can go from beginning to proficient in three months of daily practice for just a few minutes. Play for no less than 15 minutes daily. Longer is always better, but focus on three things each for five minutes. Always warm up before that 15 minute practice.</br>  <br>Because you first said "shitty style of riffing and made it listenable" and that's what you meant with production. The riffs aren't as complicated as you think anyway, almost all of it is in 4/4. Monotonic maybe but it's all the same method, exploring the 4/4 bar.</br>  <br>I just hate baroque because it reminds me of the fucking rich fag douchebag tyrants. "oooh yyess I love my powdered wig and drinking my teeaa yeesss. Ha ha ha stupid peasants. "</br>  <br>so you know all those bends and you're going to demonstrate them on vocaroo now, cool<br><br>I'll wait here shall I</br></br></br>  <br>Not OP, but I can help. Start with your basic open chords and minors and what not. If you can't make it through that, it's not for you. Take it from a guy who has tried to teach several ex gf to play but they all thought it was too difficult</br>  <br> https://vimeo.com/78045680 <br>please tell me you're joking.<br>l2 play this, if you're so gud.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=cBf<wbr>-w53ByqQ</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br>  Oh god im in /b/ <br>Hey three year old guitar fag here.<br>Have you tried any exoctic pics or sizes?
