But right now I'm not in the mood for it</br>  <br>Because i love a clean toilette to do a propper shit.</br>  Because I have ADHD and Social Anxiety Disorder.<br>Either that, or I'm just a complete sociopathic with misanthropic tendencies.<br><br>I'd rather fuck a hooker and get 'er done,<br>Then go for a long walk on a beach with my dog and a spliff...</br></br></br></br>  Music is for niggers and children. I watch film like an adult.  <br>You might just die from a brainfart.</br>  <br>They're ok but you have to be on drugs and with female friends and that costs a lot of money.</br>  I do, going to Oppikoppi in two weeks time.  <br><br>careful with that edge bro</br></br>  <br>I do. But they never look like that one.</br>  Live music usually sounds like crap.<br><br>Douchebags everywhere.<br><br>Portapotties.<br><br>Everything is expensive.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I don't like the music.<br><br>Get some good instrumental music festivals going and maybe I would.</br></br>  <br>kuz sleeping in a tent sucks more balls then OP</br>  <br>too young :(</br>  Cant bc of religious reasons  <br><br> good instrumental <br><br>you really don't music at all do you..<br><br>try 'Live Artists'</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Live in small town, probably wouldn't travel just for some music festival, only reason to go is to possibly grab a crowd surfing bitches ass. I could pretend to care about the music temporarily, but I won't be trying to get with a dumb ass music obsessed bitch long term</br>  because the music sucks<br>also<br> sweden </br></br>  <br><br><br>Pretty much this also.<br>I don't get the appeal of live music.<br>OK, maybe chilling in a bar to something in the background, but fuck live music pumped out of huge speakers and sound systems.<br>It still sounds better on an ipod.<br><br>Dumb teen girls love this shit or rockers and punks and druggies who just wanna jump around all night like idiots.<br>And the rest follow them. <br>You know why they like the distraction of repetitive music? Because it's like a drug in itself. <br>Also, it avoids them having to have a real conversation about anything, just a distraction...<br><br>I'm not saying you have to be dumb to go to clubs and concerts and festivals, but ask the dumbest fucks you know and guaranteed they are excited about an upcoming one...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>pic related, I'm pretty amped</br>  <br><br>I'm not aesthetic as Jeff Seid yet, but soon<br><br>pic related for people who say no legs</br></br></br></br>  Music festivals are full of fuckheads that treat it like a social outing to get drunk, rather than going for the music. I'd rather a small intimate gig at a pub anyday.  <br><br><br>I mean instrumental music, as in large orchestras with actual music. Some faggot smashing on drums like a 2001 monkey with a bone and his butt buddy screaming into a mic while strumming on a few chords isn't what I consider good music.</br></br></br>  <br>This. Live music has been nothing but a letdown for me.</br>  <br>CAUSE I DONT DRIVE AND I DONT HAVE FRIENDS</br>  Heres a shitload:<br> have to leave house <br> have to talk with other people <br> have to be outside <br> I'm 28 <br> have to dick around 90% of time waiting for the 2 artists you like <br> $8 beer <br> $7 water <br> the public in general <br> no vidya for duration <br>Fuck music festivals</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>when I see shit like this on fb, I wonder why I don't go either!</br></br>  <br>This guy only lifted with his fucking left pec.</br>  <br>I'll give you a few reasons actually<br><br>1. I live in Nebraska and I used to love EDM when I spun at house parties and Greek life functions in college at UNL. However, the EDM fad has finally hit here in the Midwest and every music festival is some bullshit camping wilderness wannabe-hippie douchefest. Everyone thinks they're a fucking hippie (even referring to themselves as such) because they take boomers and molly and feel "enlightened". Also, people talk non-stop about about their gay-ass road trips to Colorado (nothing against that state or anything).<br><br>2. Every idiot at these festivals claims to be a rave/concert/fest promoter, when really they just belong to some Facebook group that posts local tour dates.<br><br>3. Everyone is overly-nice, reinforcing how shitty and fake they are when not at these events.<br><br>4. the influx of plastic shades, tye-dye, and poor-grooming has ruined the culture<br><br>5. I just want to mention one more time how much I love these loathe these fake hippie-types</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Go to outdoors music festivals / doofs around NSW Australia<br>Around mid north coast<br>Hear awesome artists all the time<br>Always try to hang with trippers even tho I dint trip much anymore<br>Spend most of the time trying to help people and spread love<br>God I love doofs</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Way too expensive, a single party exhausts me and makes me hate humanity for a while. I couldnt do it for a week or so without hurting myself or others</br>  <br>This is now a justify why the fuck you would go to a music festival thread.<br>How is this even something guys do? You barely hear any decent music, it's mostly rubbish, it's expensive as fuck, uncomfortable, the toilets get destroyed within seconds, if I wanted to hang out with my friends while we stink like shit and look disgusting I could just do that at home for free.<br>Is it this vague prospect of getting laid? Is that the driving force? Cos you know that won't happen enough to make the whole experience worth it right?<br>Why not just go travelling, spend the same money, see great things and have great experiences, and you'll end up getting the same amount of sex out of it too.<br>Fuck music festivals...</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dubs of truth.</br>  <br>5. how much I loathe*</br>  <br>I'm 28, go to festivals where there are no artists I like, byo booze (fuckthepolice.jpg), survive somehow without vidya (it's actually nice for short periods). I have so much fun. Because drugs.<br><br>Your other reasons are legit.</br></br></br>  <br>What edge?<br>I clearly have psychological problems, yet function very well in many areas, and even excel in some.<br><br>Social life has never been one area I could really manage.<br><br>Even when I did, I get bored with people real quick, disappointed with them easily and have pretty high standards.<br><br>I probably wouldn't associate with me either though to be fair. <br>So now I tend to push people away to save us both time and trouble.<br><br>You've got to be pretty stubborn to get to know me...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The toilets.</br></br>  <br>ive outgrown them. maybe one day you will too.</br>  don't like the music<br>don't do drugs<br>can't drink cause lol born chronic liver disease</br></br>  only one good festival in this country, westfest and i go every year.. the rest of the music festivals in my shitty country are either dirty hippies rolling in mud spreading free love and chlamydia, or a bunch of white people on xtc listening to fat niggers rap bandy over some shitty drum track.  <br> $7 beer  <br> $8 water </br></br>  <br>That's the only reason to go is to see some simple minded music bitch flashing tits or something, only a man raised by a single woman whos obsessed with music would go following around a bunch of guys who play music</br>  <br>I go to them because I love music.</br>  <br><br><br>Strip clubs are cheaper plus they pretend to like you for a hot second.</br></br></br>  <br>I honestly don't understand why clubs are that popular. How and when did this shit happen?<br>How have people not gone "oh hey you know what? this shit is garbage, why do we go here?" and why is it that when this revelation comes to them they've been clubbing for years?<br>It took me all of 20 minutes to figure out clubbing was a pathetic waste of time. And yet people still drag me out there and act like its great fun. All they do is get drunk and wiggle around like retards...</br></br></br>  <br>fags like you are a big reason why I don't go<br><br>people like you are so full of shit, but hey, at least you're "enlightened" and stuff, right?</br></br></br>  <br><br>*tips<br><br>how's school going?</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, dipshit, I'm having a good time with my girlfriend and friends.</br>  go to t in the park and you will know why.  <br>Is this a picture of a festival strictly for dick heads?</br>  <br><br>Wait, that's a girl?</br></br>  <br>Unless you're a closet lesbian I see no appeal there.<br>If you're going just to get laid, you're essentially no better than someone paying a prostitute for sex, the only difference is they're less pathetic.</br></br>  <br>it is fun<br>you look like that grumpy guy sitting in the corner and drinking cola</br></br>  <br>As amusing as that is, I'm not sure if you're being serious so, it's because his arm is raised.<br>You're welcome</br></br>  <br> muh death grips! </br>  <br>because they're full of faggots</br>  <br>Dubs speak</br>  <br>Tents suck and hotels are too costly</br>  <br>that's one ugly bitch, man<br><br>kudos</br></br></br>  <br><br>kek<br><br>Are you roleplaying as the most predictable 13 year old /b/tard?<br><br>  in b4 muh darkside </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>stay mad bra</br>  I might meet CWC  Too many gays and niggers, and all the girls have stds  <br><br>Please say you are at least european so that the fact you look like a faggot is slightly negated.</br></br>  <br>are you fucking kidding me.<br>don't listen to him man, i would totally do your gf</br></br>  <br><br> &gt; pic related </br></br>  Because festivals are fucking expensive, none really have lineups I like, you have to usually buy tickets now before the lineups are announced.<br><br>Also because living in a tent, no showers, hangover and with no proper food doesn't appeal.</br></br>  <br>nothing like abit of organised expensive fun</br>  <br> you look like <br>Yeah I can tell you like clubs.<br> lol he duznt like clubs, hav sum drink and dance is fun lyfe!!!!111one <br>I prefer actual socialising, not repetitive bad music, drunken morons and time wasting. Also the fact that you said its fun leads me to believe you're a girl.

If it's too expensive for your budget that's understandable seeing as they go from 200-? for tickets, but who cares if it's a sausage fest? I couldn't tell to be honest because I'm there for the music, not to look at the guy to girl ratio the whole time and judge accordingly. I do agree though l it's spawned a generation of degenerate teenagers doing drugs and whatnot but fuck them I like the music, youll never agree with everyones views in the world  <br>This, I've got Vitiligo.</br>  <br><br>durban or someplace that sounds like that</br></br>  <br>I'm over the age of 20 and haven't completely failed at my life.</br>  <br>eh, as bad I suppose.</br>  <br>What are you?<br>A first year grad?<br>I am not qualified, I just read a lot.<br>Diagnosed with what?<br>What part are you disagreeing with?<br>I told you only facts.<br>And with didn't say I couldn't be dangerous,,or violent...it's more complex than that.<br>From what I have read,sychopaths can be socially engaged, and are often charming.<br>They wear a mask well, and can put up a front forever.<br>Example - Ted Bundy was a loving father and husband.<br>He was also a serial killer who enjoyed fucking the decomposing corpses of some of his mutilated victims. He was also charming and deluded enough to skip planning and improvised victim attacks, and charmed his way into escaping from custody. He also got confident enough to represent himself in court.<br><br>That is not 'disengaged', more 'disassociative'.<br>A sociopath would likely give him himself away,<br>They can't usually sustain that kind of front.<br>A sociopath would go on the run or avoid interrogation or cross-examination.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Nigger holds up swedish flag.

We have a hotel room because festival is far.<br><br>Festival ends and trains are packed so we decide to look for a taxi. Brother sees a girl hes talking to/ wanted to fuck. Finally a taxi comes and what do you know... he and one of his friends take the taxi with this girl and her friend back to hotel. Meanwhile im stranded waiting and feeling cut.<br><br>I thought "ok hes gonna get pussy" so i let it slide. I eventually get to hotel about 1hr later and i ask "where is thia bitch you ditched me for" and he says "oh she never came up, just wanted to split a cab"<br><br>I raged so hard...</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Because standing around in a muddy field where going for a piss is an epic quest on its own so I can see the one band I'd actually consider it worth it isn't my idea of a good time. Neither is sleeping in a hot tent in the summer, with the sun burning me out of it when I don't really feel quite ready.<br><br>And why? So I can maybe meet a few people who enjoy the same shit I do? For the iffy promise of sex, which won't materialize because I'm still the same fat, autistic piece of shit I already am?<br><br>Nigger, I don't even like drugs. As for the music, I can listen to that fine and in higher quality at home. Sure, the live show is probably pretty cool. But standing around with a bunch of filthy tryhards to enjoy it? No thanks. I don't belong there, and I know it. No sense in denying reality.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He sounds like a massive beta. Goes out of his way to get girl, she uses him for cash, says bye and probably goes to fuck a real guy.</br></br>  <br>Sleeping in a tent sucks. Also it smells like shit 24/7 since people rarely are bothered to visit the restrooms.<br><br>Also drinking several days in a row makes me more dead then alive.</br></br></br>    <br> At a festival once with my older brother and his two friends <br>there's the problem. my reatrded parents once tried to force me to take my kid brother with me.

I want you to look at this picture of me. Now I want you to look at your body. Look down at your stomach, look are your skinny arms, and look back to me. Now I want you to fat shame yourself and accept that even if you started right now it would take you years to change your body to mine and you don't have the discipline or commitment to do that. So I will continue to steal 10/10 women that you will never have a chance with. Beta's, betas, betas.  Aus fag here, 2 coons tried to break into my house today and i have a feeling they will try to come back. What kind of force can i legally use to fuck them up. We have a shotgun but i know you can't legally kill them in self defence.  <br>The police force.</br>  If they're armed, go for knee shots. <br><br>If they're unarmed like the niggers they are, get a fucking baseball bat and go for knees. Break some shit.</br></br>  You don't have to kill them. Shoot at their feet.  Shoot in knees<br>my pop shot an ice addict in the knee cap and went to court<br>he said that it was self defence and he won</br></br>  <br>I feel better now. Cheers man.</br>  The law states any force necaserry to subdue or protect yourself, I don't recommend using said shotgun on spooks because thay have the favour of the law in this backwards country, if you don't state you have a weapon and fire a warning shot it's manslaughter  <br>self defence is not a valid defence against murder in Victoria. What state are you in OP?</br>   inb4 this is why 'merica is better cuz self defense <br><br>if this is try OP you should contact your local police station, advise the police of your fears and seek advice on how to protect yourself from them. they will be able to provide you with more accurate information than any fags here. also, if you do happen to hurt them and get charged, you can quote what the police told you</br></br>  <br>I agree.</br>  <br>A voice of reason? in my 4chan?<br><br><br>Ask  man. They're knowledgeable of laws.</br></br></br></br>  mother fucker im in aus no one has guns here, i doubt youre going to shoot them even if you do.. just get a dog  <br>if this is legit*<br><br>dunno what the fuck i said try for</br></br></br>  <br>are you, by any chance, not from a country area where everyone has a gun?</br>  Coons? Coons come on our porch, momma just chase 'em off with a broom. <br><br>Alabamafag btw.</br></br>  <br>White mans force</br>  Buy a base ball bat and beat those niggers like the US marines did in Somalia when they couldn't kill them  <br>Not racoons you idiot, niggas!</br>   In the US <br><br>Shoot with intent to incapacitate. Family freaks out on TV. You win.<br><br> Anywhere else <br><br>Take nigger dick up the ass</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 2015 <br> Falling for that <br>FFS he said Alabama.</br></br></br>  <br>U srs?<br>b8 if'n i eva'h saw's it</br></br>  <br>cricket bat mate, cricket bat.</br>  Shotgun butt to the rib cage. They have weaker ribs in general. Pyshiology is slightly different from humans  <br>*sigh* leave it to an American to come to your aide just like everything else. What you need is a weapon of opportunity. You go swinging a bat or shooting a gun and it looks like you intentionally possessed and used a weapon. That's why I always recommend having a can of Easy-Off oven cleaner in your home. This shit is better than any pepper spray and it's toxic as shit. If they don't die of poison or toxic shit it's likely to make them horribly sick, blind them, and give them respiratory problems the rest of their life. Best part is you can say that you were just sitting in your kitchen when they broke in and you grabbed the can because it was nearby and convenient. Nobody can claim that you intended to use it to harm anybody. Oh and I know everybody thinks in America we can just shoot and kill people all willy nilly and nobody cares but that isnt true. You still have to convince somebody that you were in very real danger and you had to respond accordingly. After all, fight or flight is a natural responss to threat. So if they return and you are forced to use violence i would recommend pissing your pants. when the police take the report make sure they note that you pissed your pants and if you have to talk to a judge at some point mention that you were so afraid for your life that you lost bladder control. That's usually your ticket to justifiable self defense.</br>  I'd recommend a big fucking dog, i had one and he always scared off the gypsies in my area  ask /k/  <br>I don't know if I agree with you because tldr.</br>  <br> 2015 <br> can't link board properly <br/></br></br>  <br>tl;dr is "i'm a yank faggot with no knowledge of laws in australia so i'm giving you shitty advice about oven spray"</br>  <br>Pretty much sums it up. <br>Makes me think of those rednecks on youtube that give weapons and legal advice and then suddenly one of them isn't in the videos anymore. He's "away on bussiness".</br></br>  <br>like FPS Russian's friend who was found with his brains blown all over his kitchen table</br>  <br>Didn't know that. I usually watch a few vids for the "tactical mall ninja" elements when I need a few laughs. I especially like the AR15 accessories reviews.</br>  <br>i honestly haven't watched his stuff since he went on hiatus due to that and after he almost killed himself from shrapnel off an exploding car.</br>  <br>Didn't know that either.</br>  <br>youtube the footage. dare you not to cringe</br>  <br>Nah. Maybe later. As I said, I only watch those types for a few quick laughs. Like paying to see the crab boy. No matter how low you feel, there's always someone you can laugh at.</br>  <br>obviously didn't mean now, but now that you know, you can at some stage</br>  <br>I see no fault in your statement.</br>  Advice I got from a cop, shoot the intruders, then fire a shot at the roof. Tell the cops that you fired a warning shot first, and they didn't back off  <br>This is QLD though, idk about that states</br>  <br><br>They could come back with guns themselves OP. A friend of mine died by getting shot by one. Please just tell the authorities the situation and tell them a gang are planning to attack your children or something so that they come quick and take it seriously.</br></br>  <br>agreed but also forewarn the police</br>  <br><br>Ah bro out of the major cities you would be surprised how many people have guns.. In the country most houses have a shotgun or a 303 or something similar.</br></br>  What town you in OP?    <br>Australia being the fucked up place it is. Pretty much open the door and let them in. If you kill them you go to gaol. if you hurt them the abos will sue you and WIN regardless they are in your house with your property under their arms. Call the cops let them know. At least they will arrest them if they are there and you will get your property back. <br> protip: Leave Australia </br></br>  <br> protip: leave abbo infested parts of Australia  <br><br>fixed that for you</br></br></br>  <br>You could leave your thongs and cat on the porch to try and entice them to not break in. They only want your thongs and to fuck your cat anyway</br>  <br>Well, actually. You are able to kill in self-defense, depending on the circumstances. Like if they are carrying a dangerous weapon, or if they are able to outnumber you. You can retaliate, but you must prove that it was a reasonable amount of force in the court.</br>  <br>with the mix of Abo's and Arabs..... Leave Australia</br>  <br>and go where? NZ? not a bad idea. where else? Australia is a pretty fucking good country.</br>  <br>America China Ukraine Russia Brazil. <br>No abo's in any of these countries!</br></br>  anyone know where i can download a windows 7 keygen ? need home premium  <br><br>have you ever heard about the pirate bay?</br></br>  search w7loader, works fin  Look up daz loader.
