But for me, the ending isn't even the most important thing about a series.<br><br>I think the original was much more mature, full of extremely loaded political messages (probably part of why it's less popular), and didn't overrely on fight scenes and silly humor as much as Brotherhood.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You dont comment in these kind of threads without fucking contributing faggot</br>  <br>rly?</br>  This shit is still amazing till this day, in my eyes its god-tier, watch it if you haven't  BLACK CAT! <br><br>OH AND TRIGUN <br><br><br>BITCH</br></br></br></br></br>  Tell me /b/, why does anime suck now?  <br> TOP 10 OF ALL TIME <br><br>srsly?</br></br></br>  Brotherhood has a better ending but the rest of it is shit <br>The protagonist is generic and almost omnipotent <br>It adds that whole ching bs that didn't needed to be added <br>It jumps from plotline to plotline with zero focus</br></br></br>  Psycho pass  <br>You're probably younger than the target demographic.

OK! Ich werde zu sprechen! In der dritten Klasse , betrog ich auf meiner Geschichte Pr√ºfung. In der vierten Klasse , stahl ich mein Onkel Max Toupet und ich verklebt es auf mein Gesicht , als ich in meinem Moses Hebrew School play . In der f√ºnften Klasse , klopfte ich meine Schwester Edie die Treppe hinunter , und ich schob es auf den Hund ... Als meine Mutter schickte mich zum Sommerlager f√ºr fette Kinder und dann dienten sie dem Mittagessen habe ich N√ºsse und ich gemolcht out , und sie hat mich rausgeschmissen ... aber das Schlimmste, was ich je getan - ich gemischt einen Topf mit gef√§lschten kotzen zu Hause und dann ging ich in diesem Kino, versteckte die Kotze in meine Jacke , kletterte auf den Balkon und dann , tt - dann machte ich ein Ger√§usch wie dies : hua -hua -hua - huaaaaaaa - und dann abgeladen ich es √ºber die Seite , die alle √ºber die Leute im Publikum . Und dann war dieser schreckliche , alles Volk begann , krank und werfen alle √ºber einander . Ich f√ºhlte mich nie so schlecht in meinem ganzen Leben .

Ich sehe die Menschen rastlos bestrebt und bem√ºht, die F√§higkeiten ihres Geistes zum Nutzen ihrer Leiblichkeit anzuwenden; ich aber m√∂chte diese F√§higkeiten ‚Äì was nicht weniger m√ºhevoll ist ‚Äì f√ºr meine Ideenwelt verwerten, in der sicheren √úberzeugung, da√ü es √ºber den Bed√ºrfnissen des K√∂rpers und unabh√§ngig von ihm ein geistiges Leben gibt. Oft wird der K√∂rper erw√§rmt, w√§hrend die Phantasie erstarrt bleibt; der K√∂rper ist wohlgen√§hrt, aber die Phantasie ist d√ºrr und verschrumpft. Was helfen alle anderen G√ºter, wenn dieses eine fehlt? ¬ªDie Phantasie ist f√ºr den Geist die Luft¬´, in der er lebt und atmet. Alle Dinge sind so wie ich bin; wozu brauche ich die Wechselstube? Die Vergangenheit ist nur in dem Grade heroisch, in dem wir sie heroisch sehen. Sie ist die Leinwand, auf die unsere Vorstellung von Heroismus gemalt wird; daher ist sie auch in gewissem Sinne der d√§mmerige Ausblick in unsere Zukunft. Die Verh√§ltnisse, in denen wir stehen, entsprechen den Erwartungen, die wir hegen, und den Forderungen unserer Natur.  <br><br>schauen nicht an dieser schwachen Sache , wir sind nur Staub auf einem Besen ; um hinweggefegt werden .

You've just given up on your 70s haven't you?</br>  What is going on with America? They look more like soldiers than police.  <br>The problem's not what they look like. it's how they act.</br>  Germanfag here: I would like to have these badass cops here  <br>But how they look can definitely influence their psyche. If they go into a situation thinking they're badass soldiers, people are going to get hurt when they shouldn't.</br>  Criminal should be all shot on sight. No exceptions, no questions asked.  because all their criminals act like terrorists.<br> but muh 2nd amendment </br>  <br>All criminals? What if the cops find you in your parents basement smoking pot? Should they shoot you on site?</br>  <br>Stop projecting. When police enter a dangerous situation then they're supposed to be intimidating. The problem is what they think is a "dangerous situation". Problem's with the people at the top. cops at the bottom are just like everyone else; some bad, some good, but most just in between.</br>  are you dumb? these guys are clearly only geared up for some sort of drug raid or something else that requires such measures. it's not like cops ride around in their cruisers decked out like this<br><br>you're either stupid or nice b8</br></br>  they are teh lerrrggghhh<br><br>deal with it or fuck off back to the third world</br></br>  <br> speaking in absolutes <br> mfw your opinion </br></br>  <br>Take them.

Clinton completely ramped up the War on Drugs to insane levels. The police use this excuse to ramp up their hardware.  <br>niggers</br>  <br> average Joes can become scout snipers <br>This is what Americans actually believe.</br></br>  <br>trips don't lie</br>  Standard issue SWAT gear?  <br>No, it's more like saying, "fuck off or we will fight back."</br>  <br>thanks</br>  <br> This is what Americans actually believe. <br>Millions of combat veterans in the US. Also millions of hunters.<br><br>The police are generally terrible marksmen and terrible cowards. They are used to pushing around an unarmed and non organized population that will follow their commands rather than stand up to them.</br></br></br></br>  <br> but muh 2nd amendment <br>Even if the 2nd amendment was repealed and all guns were removed from the streets, the cops would never surrender their power. Some new "threat" will emerge which will allow them to continue their ways.<br><br><br>I agree. Just the threat of fighting back may be a deterrent.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> we will fight back <br>That's just as delusional. In these Hollywood fantasies these "patriots" see a common enemy uniting the front<br> protip: the opponent is infinitely smarter than that <br>They already have the upper hand (control of the mass-media) and they'll stop at nothing to prevent these alliances ever from forming. This is conflict avoidance tactics 101. Thanks to the ignorance of the average American, they'll never even question what they're told. <br><br> tl;dr there is no need for the gubberment to go all out, and as long as they don't, they can call the militants terrorists or lone gunmen or w/e they want </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's probably a fucking Vice squad or an HRT unit.<br><br>You people</br></br></br>  <br> Millions of combat veterans in the US. <br>Yeah, the chair force/navy guys will be really useful. <br> Also millions of hunters. <br>I've spent two days in military training, and even I know that's a major insult to scout snipers.<br><br> The police are generally terrible marksmen and terrible cowards. <br> because they'd put cops against an organized militia <br>u wot m8</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  This man was a hero. A Naval officer, college graduate with a Political Science degree and a minor in Psychology, and an LAPD officer. He witnessed his partner beating a man in handcuffs. Dorner was fired for reporting his partner.<br><br>But the media did not report this. All they reported was how crazy he was. The corruption goes all the way up to the top.</br></br>  <br> OC </br>  <br>This picture.<br>What happened to protect and serve?<br>Now it's just intimidate and collect money.</br></br></br>    <br> &gt;Millions of combat veterans in the US. <br> Yeah, the chair force/navy guys will be really useful. <br>Not everyone in the air force or navy is a useless nob in land combat, just like not everyone in the army was trained to be infantry. But they are all military members and everyone from a cook to a radar tech has a huge step up in training and mental conditioning than your average citizen. <br><br> &gt;Also millions of hunters. <br> I've spent two days in military training, and even I know that's a major insult to scout snipers. <br>The difficult job of a scout isn't the waiting, concealment or shooting. It's the walking into a location and walking out. In a few hours you can build your own concealment that will blend you into the background well enough to be as effectively invisible. <br><br> because they'd put cops against an organized militia <br> u wot m8 <br>I guess you missed the Bundy ranch standoff when that's exactly what happened. <br><br>The police are terrible marksmen for a number of reasons. Lack of practice, panic and fear, improper training and so on.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> This picture. <br> What happened to protect and serve? <br> Now it's just intimidate and collect money. <br><br>It's an institutional corruption. New officers come in expecting to be good officers but are exposed to the current belief structure and mentality of the police that has rotted over time. As they learn the job they pick up on those police cultural changes and change their own views. Those that don't are passed over for advancement and are made to suffer. <br><br>The only way to fix the system is to build a second police force without any former police to poison the beliefs and attitudes and then replace the current police wholesale. <br><br>It's the same reason the military spends so much time and effort trying to set the culture of the force to one way of thinking. The 70s and 80s US military was so bad that it was effectively an uncontrolled mass of gangs and drug users. The forces pulled out of that thinking by flooding the ranks with new members and cleaning out the trouble makers in a wave of non renewed contracts.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>With that many violent niggers in their land the police have to act as a military.</br>  <br> But they are all military members and everyone from a cook to a radar tech has a huge step up in training and mental conditioning than your average citizen.  <br>Boot camp does not a soldier make.<br><br> The difficult job of a scout isn't the waiting, concealment or shooting. It's the walking into a location and walking out.  <br>I'm pretty sure it's about having training vis-a-vis physique, mental stamina and real-life tactical understanding of the environment you're in. These aren't things your average tard can just pick up or be taught. Quite frankly I'm not sure you understand what a scout sniper really does.<br><br> I guess you missed the Bundy ranch standoff when that's exactly what happened. <br>Not a single fire was shot. It was all for show.<br><br> Lack of practice, panic and fear, improper training and so on. <br>Unlike civilians, right?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   &gt; <br> bitches about shit getting seized <br> Police only seize if they know you have something on you against the law. <br><br>It simple fucking plebs don't break the law, weed is legal now what else do you need to have on you?</br></br></br></br>  <br> *Not a single shot was fired. <br>I've been up for 18 hours, and English is my second language. Sue me.</br></br>    <br>Civil forfeiture I think???<br>Several cases of police taking larg sums of money from people because they had a suspicion of drug dealing. When in reality these people were just going to buy a car or something.</br></br>  <br>Look at pic</br>  <br>I'm self trained with a Springfield XD .45. I'm far more accurate than that. And I do athletic shooting.</br>  <br>The only thing "wrong" with this country is the fact that people are so fucking stupid and will believe anything they see on TV. There is no racism in the police force, people die by police all the time, not just blacks.<br><br>People are delusional, there is no real problem with our police.</br></br></br>  <br>Worked out well last time didn't it?</br>  <br>Yeah, and if anyone were to post that on social media, half of our friends would label us racist.</br>  There is a reason the police and the military are separated. The police protects the people from criminals, the military protects them from enemy of the state.<br><br>But when police and military become one, the people tend to become the enemy of the state</br></br>  2.0 GPAs from high school who got their asses beat on a regular basis by their asshole fathers, fathers who also treated the mothers like shit. 80% are overweight. only job in the country that imposes a max iq of 120. suicide rates 2-3 times the national average. family violence rates at 45%. fucking losers  <br>Lulz. Any of these faggots heard of leg day? Looks like a bunch of Vs.</br>  <br> Boot camp does not a soldier make. <br>Clearly not but trades training, years of service, workup training and deployments to wars does. <br><br> I'm pretty sure it's about having training vis-a-vis physique, mental stamina and real-life tactical understanding of the environment you're in. These aren't things your average tard can just pick up or be taught.  <br>No a retarded person wouldn't be able to understand a tactical situation or use of the land, but most people are not retarded.<br><br> &gt;I guess you missed the Bundy ranch standoff when that's exactly what happened. <br> Not a single fire was shot. It was all for show. <br>It was a police force sent against a militia the exact situation that was implied wouldn't happen.<br><br> &gt;Lack of practice, panic and fear, improper training and so on. <br> Unlike civilians, right? <br>Correct, most people shooting at a range are non law enforcement. <br><br> Quite frankly I'm not sure you understand what a scout sniper really does. <br>I'm dying over here. Pic related, sorry for the low quality.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That is a swat team you dumb fuck</br>  <br>Good idea. Let's send them in with pointed sticks and sheer force of will.</br>  Then there's this bullshit called civil asset forfeiture.

You're technically a criminal after that.</br>  <br>can't corner the dorner</br>  <br>I would be 100% behind Dorner if he didn't kill those innocent people.</br>  <br>i agree, these people should be shot. also the people that use their phone in the car should be shot no expections.</br>  <br>Is that moot?!</br>  <br>Nixon started the war, Reagan ramped it up, and Clinton poured over a billion into it.</br>  <br> When you need a swat team to rescue hostages or take down armed thugs. <br><br>But they spend most of their time kicking down doors doing no knock warrants on non violent suspects. <br><br>The FBI's HRT has killed more innocent people than they have rescued. What's more the HRT is used for fucking combat operations and has deployed as a military force to Iraq.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You've never heard of the "billy badass" example. It's something becoming-policemen hear a lot of before they become actual police officers.</br>  <br>whats hrt? googled it and all i got was hormone replacement therapy</br>  <br>Can I see proof of that statistic?</br>  <br>All cops can go through SWAT training, even partial training, if they want. Then they're not automatically in SWAT for good. And all members of SWAT aren't full-time, 24/7 SWAT members. They are police officers first.</br>  <br>except that how they look tends to lead towards escalating situations instead of defusing them</br>  <br> bam </br>  <br>Worked for the Romans.</br>  <br> But they spend most of their time kicking down doors doing no knock warrants on non violent suspects. <br>Sure buddy. Sure! As if its police protocol to knock down doors on non-violent suspects place of residence.</br></br>  <br>why do people keep living in the us? theres so much against the common man. or is that just the distorted idea im getting?</br>  <br>Probably something like hostage rescue team</br>  <br>actually, it applies in an absolutist fashion<br><br>let's say there are "good" cops and "bad" cops<br><br>the "good" ones arent busy bringing charges against the "bad" ones, so they are guilty through inaction, aka: bad</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I agree fully. He needed to do something else. Get an outside source to audit the LAPD, one that in unbiased.</br>    <br><br>#YesAllCriminals<br><br>The best way to do this would be to just to take all the weapons by force. It should be illegal to own a weapon anyway.</br></br></br></br>  <br>oh, could've figured that out myself but dindt think about it.</br>  <br>Mabye because it's not their job to prosecute other cops. That's for internal affairs dumbass.</br>  <br>i love that you can fuck with cops in germany with impunity, how can you say that???</br>  <br>Biggest gang in america.</br>  <br>Lived in West TX my whole life where law enforcement is more enforced here than in most of the states and I can tell you by experience that as long as you're not doing anything wrong, and are cooperative member of society, you have nothing to worry about.</br>  <br>yep i agree, i think that people should now not be allowed to use a knife and fork and all other kitchen knifes and scissors becuase they are dangerous weapons.</br>  <br>and if you are white i guess?</br>  <br> prosecute <br><br>they can still arrest them you dumb shit<br><br> but muh blue line </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yup. Like I said. No exceptions.</br>  <br>They do it on drug suspects, even on those who have no criminal record.</br>  <br>You clearly don't know what protocol means. If it ever escalates to swatting people's doors, there MUST be an escalation of the suspect first.</br>  They're just badass. Quit bitching and don't break the fucking law. Pretty simple, innit?  <br>only cure is gas chambor</br>  <br>Also, totes not bait fags</br>  <br>checked<br>also second this</br></br>  <br>I'm Hispanic. Descendent from Mexico.</br>  <br>you dont even have the recources to enforce all there laws, its just stupid. without weapons we are just retarded herd animals.</br>  <br><br>This could easily be solved by just searching all homes to make sure there is nothing potentially dangerous in them. Guns, knives, etc.<br><br>People just need to realize there is no reason for them to have weapons anymore, we are in 2015 if you need help just dial 911.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Show me where they do it on people who have no criminal record please.</br>  I remember a story where the cops were asked to do a wellness check on an old man, and were informed he was hard of hearing. The police waited several hours, and went in around midnight. When he didn't respond, they broke down the door and shot him when they saw him holding a shotgun.<br><br>Who the fuck performs a wellness check after midnight?</br></br>  ITT: copblockers circlejerk  <br>look at all the escalation in the video</br>  <br> niggers <br><br>That's why</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah I think the first couple of murders he did were cowardly bullshit. He got his revenge, though. Aside from those, I think much of the nation was happy to see the cops so terrified of one man. For once, the shoe was on the other foot and a lot of people like to see villains get a taste of their own medicine. For too long the US police force has been terrorizing the citizens with no repercussions. The only thing they protect and serve is each other. I don't condone murder, but I was cheering for Dorner.</br>  <br> implying the first one didn't help cause the second </br>  <br>Are you a nigger?</br>  <br> I'm not convinced a person who's been deployed but never actually seen combat is that much more prepared for war than a civilian. <br>Not everyone, but the massive majority are much better than your average person that's never heard a gun shot. <br><br>Think of it like this two women; <br>One: Is a former army health and wellness trade (rat catchers by nickname but the people that try to prevent everyone else from getting sick). She has 1 tour to Iraq but saw no combat, but did have to do guard shifts and camp security. Trained with pistol, rifle, MG and grenades, radio, map and compass. <br><br>Two: Is a mother of one that has never had a full time job. Thinks that guns are evil and kill people, and that we just need some common sense laws and all the crime will stop. Has never held a firearm of any kind, her total experience with firearms is from TV and movies. <br><br>Your statement is that those two are about equal if they took up arms against an out of control police force. <br><br> Obviously by an average tard I mean and average Joe. <br>Guess what the military draws it's ranks from? The average person can not only learn to do the job of forward recon they can (dependent on each person) in theory excel at it.<br><br> Threats do not equal actions. They did nothing, therefore they were not a militia. <br>Do you do fence posts as well? Because I'd like to hire you given how fast you are moving those goal posts around.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>thats an invasion of privacy. also people would just leave your country. and what are you gonna do about that? keep them from leaving?</br>  <br>what do you call those scarfs that half of them are wearing?</br>  If you believe the change in the police force in America has anything to do with something other than making money than you are an idiot that needs to be shot.  If the police state kills all the niggers ill be happy  <br><br> thats an invasion of privacy. <br><br>It's for your protection. Leave if you must, doesn't hurt my paycheck.</br></br></br></br>  <br>shemaghs</br>  <br>Cops do.what if the old man fell andwas slowly bleeding out? What if he was being restrained while nignogs raped him and stole his dentures?<br>You dont know fag.</br></br>  <br>When you do your job so bad its time to arm up cuz the public don't trust you.</br>  <br>Yep this da truth.</br>  <br>Back to bed, Tyrone, we know you dont have work anyway</br>  <br> They are police officers first. <br><br>Not any more. They are government enforcers first. <br>They are only on pay roll of the police because it's illegal for the military to take on policing duties (in the US).</br></br></br></br>  <br>They don't arrest unless they see them commuting a crime or are ordered to by internal affairs.</br>  <br>You....you wot? Thats not actually used by any U.S Police Department right?</br>  <br>There are so many laws in America that the average American commits three felonies a day without realizing it.</br>  <br>Sure I don't. The police does though.</br>  <br>So I take you're not a believer in empirical values which has much to do with how civilization functions.</br>  <br>thanks :3</br>  <br><br> unless they see them committing a crime <br>FTFY<br><br>That's the problem, the "good" cops turn their heads when they see shit, which makes them just as guilty<br><br><br> we need more serpicos </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Cops wouldn't have to militarize if they just shot all the fucking gangs to death. This is what happens when we're soft on criminals.  <br>if there is nobody in your country whos gonna pay your paycheck?<br><br> It's for your protection <br>like people cant take care of their own personal protection. thats degrading. you are just making a retarded gerd animal from humans, like a sheep or cows. nobody would want to live in a country where protection becomes opression. <br><br>also why would protection be enforced by a therefore assigned institution? this would just be yet another retarded industry. i say autonomy and keep the government away out of my life, self governance to the maximum. you dont have to act like you have the man power to enforce all the laws, and ensure everybodies protection, because you dont.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>and I agree with you if you can pay for a 24/7 hour security guars for us :D</br>  <br>This nigga dumb</br>  <br>here look at this. this is one of many ways to use it.</br>  <br><br> searching all homes <br><br>It would fix a lot of problems too. We could fix the druggie problem tomorrow. Not to mention the possibility of finding all kinds of criminal activity. These losers think they can hide behind closed doors - we'll see how long that lasts.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This</br>  <br>Like I said, as long as you're a cooperative member of society, you have nothing to worry about. And the same can be said about businesses, I once worked at a place that didn't have adequate AC which is against the law, but these laws aren't enforced until something crime of great value comes into fruition. Businesses break far more laws than citizens, but by being cooperative and productive members of society, they have nothing to worry about.</br>  <br>yeah keep believing that, the very institutions sworn to protect you are just managing you like livestock that has to produce a quota of taxes every now and then or otherwise gtfo. <br><br>you disgust me with your lies and ignorance</br></br></br>  <br> Think of it like this two women <br> women <br>Let's not be silly. You're cherry-picking a fringe population to make your point.<br><br> Thinks that guns are evil and kill people, and that we just need some common sense laws and all the crime will stop.  <br>That is not the kind of person who'd join a militia.<br><br> The average person can not only learn to do the job of forward recon they can (dependent on each person) in theory excel at it. <br>That is blatantly false. You're allegedly a military man, don't make me throw the stats at you. You ought be embarrassed if you don't already know what I'm referring to. Statistically speaking, the average Joe can NOT pass scout sniper training, physically or mentally.<br><br> Do you do fence posts as well?  <br>I'm sorry, by your logic anyone waving a gun is a mass-murderer.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Not everybody would leave, obviously.<br><br>You people are just too dangerous. The "public" doesn't understand how the real world works. You are a threat to yourself, I am trying to help you.</br></br></br></br>  <br> You clearly don't know what protocol means. If it ever escalates to swatting people's doors, there MUST be an escalation of the suspect first. <br><br>The escalation is we suspect the person is a drug criminal, so they are defacto treated as armed and dangerous. Even 10 year old girls watching cartoons. Or people at the wrong address. Or unarmed people with mental health problems. Or are behind on child support payments. Or are just in their own homes going about their day to day lives.</br></br></br>  <br>I bet you have proof of purchase for everything you own right? I bet everything in your home is exactly up to code and there is not a single thing that would not adhere to the governmental standards.</br>  <br>Have you ever heard of a drug raid? You fucking serious?<br><br>How delusional are you man?</br></br></br>  <br>underrated post, totally true and succintly put</br>  <br><br>I have nothing to hide, you sound like you do?<br><br>Why are you so scared of the big bad police?</br></br></br></br>  <br>So it was ok for them to wait hours until most people are asleep to do the wellness check? And shot him dead?</br>  <br> You are a threat to yourself <br>so is traffic and everything else, this very earth is a threat to our protection. dont you understand that life comes with risk and danger? nobody cant protect you from.</br></br>  <br>This</br>  <br>And people who involve themselves in drugs deserve exactly what's coming to them.</br>  <br><br>That looks like an intervention force, and some doesn't even meet optimal standards. Intervention forces, are usually proportional to the threat they're facing. In some areas of Mexico, they are indistinguishable from the army.</br></br>  <br>abuse of power thats why.</br>  <br><br>That's our job though, to protect you. Including from yourselves. Sorry if you can't comprehend that.</br></br>  <br>Edge lord faggot<br><br>Your parents should be shot for giving birth to such an idiotic bait fag like you</br></br></br>  <br><br>Must be a scary world that you live in, what with you living according to hypotheticals. <br><br>Grow the fuck up and think logically you fucking pansy.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It says SWAT right on the side. Look it up. The military is selling many military vehicles that they brought back from Iraq and Afghanistan to police.</br>  <br><br> implying every cop is a bad cop <br><br>Just stop.</br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah its called a fucking swat team. most countries have them</br>  <br><br>I wonder how you would define a gang. Because the police are in fact the biggest gang in America. <br><br>If you can disprove it then by all means do so.</br></br></br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=WH0<wbr>z00t8OlM</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>So swat officers shouldn't be aggressive and or physically fit? It's not a tickle, dude.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Fucking word.<br><br>If anyone can disprove this then please try to.</br></br></br></br>  <br>they're on steroids.<br>thats also why they act all fucked up and panic in every situation. <br>It is a secret gov program tested on stupid cops because they're running out of soldiers for such tests .</br></br></br>  <br>dude, you dont understand. Governments influence people by symbolic gestures. How they look reflects how they have been ordered to act</br>  <br>unless its legal drugs amirite? there are people getting high from drugs prescribed from the doctor. what are you gonna do about that? create a law and do random raids to see if people are taking the right amount of drugs? bitch please.</br>  <br>I'm not scared of the big bad police. <br>I just don't like strangers looting through my home, the same reason I always locked my door as a teenager. I didn't want my parents to go through my stuff. <br>It's called privacy and some people value it. Especially if we consider that the same people looking through your stuff will later on share your pictures and information with the public and their colleagues. <br><br><br>But every citizen is a bad citizen? <br>  therefore we must search his home </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because we're militarizing police in American and idiots don't give a fuck because they think that makes us safer. <br><br>And they wonder why cops can kill with impunity</br></br></br>  <br>Newfag illuminati shit</br>  <br>Legal drugs are legal, they're in no way dangerous unlike cannabis or cocaine. <br>  Yeah, right. </br></br>  https://<span>youtu.be/IlY9C6pzxKc  [ ]  <br><br>Your privacy comes at a price and it isn't granted. These are just the facts. If searching homes becomes a necessity (which it isn't), then it will happen.</br></br>  <br> unless its legal drugs amirite? <br>Absolutely.<br>The laws that we have in place are fine as they are on drugs. Nothing needs changing on that part.</br></br></br>    <br>Lol this guy</br>  <br><br>If the police can behave and act with impunity on the American population whenever they want, even without reason or warrants, then everyone is subject to what is essentially a military state. A martial law.<br><br>If this doesn't upset you or make you worried just because you "don't have anything to hide" it means that you don't think that much about the environment you grow in.<br><br>You live your life in fear of committing acts that the state finds reprehensible. It's sad really.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You are a fucking child. Think for yourself PLEASE. Or kill yourself.</br></br>  <br><br> You live your life in fear of committing acts that the state finds reprehensible. It's sad really. <br><br> implying you live any differently. <br><br>Stop with this nonsense. I'm just stating the facts.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>but who is protecting me from you? if i need to be protected from myself, because im a treat to myself you are a threat to me, and you are a threat to yourself. and what is protecting you from yourself? nothing. your logic is flawed. you may have legal authority to protect me but that doest take away the fact that you are also a threat to me and yourself. you are not better than me to protect me or you or anybody else. sure you have training. but why dont give every citizen training like you and authorization to protect themself. if you can protect me i can protect me with the same amount of training. your logic is flawed.</br>  <br>they are defend our nashun from freedom</br>  <br><br>Because when the academy gives you a gun and badge that automatically makes you smarter than the general populace?<br><br>Fucking bullshit. Fuck off.</br></br></br></br>  <br>His manifesto was crazy. Plus he didn't mention Stanhope</br>  <br>abuse of power has nothing to do with being good or evil. and btw, im not going to take any chances. im not going to trust somebody with weapons, even if they are authorized to protect me. that would be foolish</br>  <br>Okay, instead making any rebuttals, you're just going to insult and make demands from the other person. That'll win any civil debate for sure!</br>  OP, your post is ridiculous. <br><br>You show a picture of the SWAT team, the division of the police department that is for advanced operations only, and say all police are looking more like soldiers?</br></br>  <br>take a shit ton of painkillers then see what happens man.</br>  <br><br>You in the prescription biz?<br><br>Fucking idiot. You fucking numb piece of shit.<br><br>Just because you live your life a certain way doesn't mean that others living their lives in different ways are inferior. Your capacity for tolerance must be damaged or just not there, because you sound like a fucking cult member.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> implying anyone is doing anything other than following orders and guidelines </br></br>  <br>Are you familiar with a little set of rights called "The human rights", it's basically a set of rights you get with being human, so everyone has them. <br>One of those rights guarantees you the right to privacy dipshit. <br>  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right<wbr>_to_privacy</wbr> <br><br>It's why the police can not just break down your door and check out your CD collection.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>I know right! It's like holding a picture of Obama and saying all Americans look and act just like that.</br>    <br> HRT kills innocenet peoples <br>trannies aren't people<br><br>thank fuck the FBI decided to do something about reducing their numbers</br></br></br></br>  <br>You should be shot for falling for the bait m8</br>  <br><br> It's why the police can not just break down your door and check out your CD collection. <br><br>You might need to follow the news a big closer, friend. They've been doing this and much more for a long time now.</br></br></br></br>  <br> That is blatantly false. You're allegedly a military man, don't make me throw the stats at you. You ought be embarrassed if you don't already know what I'm referring to. Statistically speaking, the average Joe can NOT pass scout sniper training, physically or mentally. <br><br>The average soldier can't either, and for that matter not all of the top tier SF troops could pass either. But that's not what we are talking about. The picture was a civilian with a rifle and a ghillie suit. The claim to be a marine SS was not made my me or even implied.<br><br>Furthermore, their is a lot more to the world of dismounted combat than scout snipers. Infantry wear ghillie suits, so do normal recon troops at times. As a citizen with access to my selection of rifles I'd select my longest ranged hardest hitting hunting rifle and a ghillie suit for rural combat.<br><br>Suit plus rifle = what was shown in the picture. <br><br>The police need to dial it back, start putting officers that kill people in jail at the same standard as everyone else. If they don't they will find that they are not welcome in some areas of the nation. Effective no go zones for the police could become a thing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gee, I wonder if someone googles "militarization of police" if they might figure out why.</br>  <br>if police can follow these guidelines to protect me i can follow them too to protect me, no need for fancy police</br>  <br>And yo should be shot for responding to a bait responder</br>  <br>Those people have the door option. And acting childish by insulting people isn't going to assume victory, but if that's what you want to believe, have at it hoss.</br>  <br>good point</br>  <br>the girl in the video tripped, hit her head and died on the way out - the second half of the video was censored by the US government</br>  <br>Because as the liberal media uses cops as cannon fodder for ratings more and more niggers are chimping out on them so they need to be dressed this way.</br>  <br><br>  dipshit myself <br>I read not guaranteed and went awol. Yeah, if the premise for a search is existent you can search it. But police shouldn't be able to do it without a reason. <br><br><br>Yeah, it's called America where the police just has to scream search warrant to break down your door, without you being capable to even confirm that they have one. <br>And everyone is a potential terrorist and as such is stripped of any and all rights.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I actually don't. I live my life according to logic and based on what I believe to be right and wrong. Sure there is some overlap with the law, but things like drug laws and any sort of law made with the intention of furthering big buisnesses agendas in spite of the common mans rights, I disavow with enthusiasm. Fuck your blind willingness to just accept what people tell you. THINK FOR YOURSELF YOU TWAT.</br></br>  Fucking retards in this thread man.  <br>6 out if the 7 people in that picture are upstanding good people trying to do their job and make sure everyone goes home okay. 7th one is a raging cunt who the media will brand all the others as.<br><br>This is old news too Obama recently set into motion limitations that restrict how much mil spec gear police can get and set the bar to a much more reasonable standard.<br><br>Lastly regarding body armor if you are aware that your profession is hated and despised by people who regularly carry guns and use them on a whim you'd wear that shit too and encourage your fellow officers to do the fucking same</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You didn't say anything of value.<br><br>You didn't even back up what you said with any sort of substantial evidence. You just stated an innane opinion. It's like if you said "I think that bread is only ingestible when it's soaking wet."<br><br>It doesn't make sense to me. I don't understand why you would believe such an idiotic thing...<br><br>If you can maybe back up your statements with reasons that make sense I would put in the effort to discuss with you why I disagree with you, but you only proved to me how little you consider things you talk about.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> the girl in the video tripped, hit her head and died on the way out <br><br>no she flew away on a flying apple to magic land. <br><br>make claims post proof.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The focus on the distinction between liberal and republican is so close minded it hurts.</br>  <br>...and the biggest one is OP.</br>  <br>I'm not sure if you can read but it says POLICE on them, not swat</br>  <br>Therefore all laws and rules are wrong. Including those set by your parents when you are young.</br>  <br>Yeah those aren't highway patrol or pedestrian cops. We still use regular police to do drug busts and stuff, and they go in groups and wear that shit cause they're probably gonna get shot at. Or maybe doing security for a person of influence. That's not everyday attire for all of them.</br>  <br>They are soldiers. You got a problem with that?</br>  <br>Pretty sure that's a swat team anyway not beat cops</br>  <br> You didn't say anything of value. <br>As if anything of what you said did. And if all you're going to do is insult people and their beliefs, then I'll be the mature one to walk away. You can have the last word and we'll both pretend I'm reading it. Whatever lets you sleep at night.</br></br>  <br>I'm not clear on what you mean by those people have the door option?</br>  <br>I knew they were dishing out Mil. Grade vehicles and equipment to whatever PD asked nicely but am I going full retard or is that an LAV-25 that had the Bushmaster removed?</br>  <br>Lol<br> they are soldiers </br></br>  <br>He also wanted guns banned from civilian ownership.</br>  <br> The picture was a civilian with a rifle and a ghillie suit.  <br>Sure, if taken out of context. By similar logic the above pictures are of actors in police and swat uniforms, and not cops at all. But now we're quibbling, which is not constructive at all.<br><br> Infantry wear ghillie suits, so do normal recon troops at times. <br>Is that true? Then I see I have made an unreasonable generalization.<br><br> As a citizen with access to my selection of rifles I'd select my longest ranged hardest hitting hunting rifle and a ghillie suit for rural combat. <br>Point taken, but let's face it, you're not the average Joe.<br><br> The police need to dial it back, start putting officers that kill people in jail at the same standard as everyone else.  <br>I agree with you, 100%.<br><br> If they don't they will find that they are not welcome in some areas of the nation. Effective no go zones for the police could become a thing. <br>I'm convinced the mass-media is far too effective propaganda platform for that to happen. But we'll see, I guess.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>yeah, they're still police officers. To be in a swat unit there's a selection process. physical fitness practical and theoretical exams, that kind of stuff. Not all cops are wearing gucci kit. and they obviously wouldn't wear it for a traffic stop. A swat unit is just a tool that the police have for particular situations.</br>  <br>if YOU are doing something which violates other peoples rights, e.g. theft, murder etc. then they (or the establishment) has a right to stop you. If you are doing something which DOES NOT violate anyone elses rights e.g. consuming drugs, then how is it acceptable for someone to threaten and coerce you into folowing their rules?</br>  <br><br>Alright buddy, go on with your delusional thought process. <br><br>I'm not trying to say the concept of the police is unwarrented or unneeded. Just taht the system setup in place in America is setup for the benefit of the few, where as the majority of the population are used as a means of that benefit. <br><br>Police uphold laws in America. It's very clear that laws are made with the intent of protecting the interests of big business (like energy, farming, weapons manufacturing, big pharma). The police uphold the laws that protect the interests of huge corporate entities instead of focusing on protecting the general populace. In fact the police terrorize the general populace under the guis of protecting the rights of others. It's bullshit. It's insane and it's bullshit and when people don't acknowledge that there is a schism between what we WANT the system to be and what the system really is, then my jimmies get rustled. I'm just saying.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah but they want to make money of off you while you take drugs, because we are just products in an industry. so you can only get with what the establishment gives you. <br><br>i also am against this, if people wanna take drugs let them.</br></br></br>  <br><br>To be investigated in order to fund a valid standpoint to counter this opinion:<br><br>Legal<br>Legitimate<br>Spirit of the Law<br>Ethical Behavior</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> If you are doing something which DOES NOT violate anyone else's rights e.g. consuming drugs, then how is it acceptable for someone to threaten and coerce you into following their rules? <br>Because when you do hard drugs you will end up in a state where you are no longer in control of your actions and threaten the security of others. Therefore the act of doing said drugs itself is a threat to others.</br></br>  <br><br>NICE USE OF FALLACY! IT"S INCREDIBLY INEFFECTIVE!</br></br>  <br> only religion mentioned is Islam <br>Yup, no confirmation bias there. Nosiree.</br></br>    <br> Because when you do hard drugs you will end up in a state where you are no longer in control of your actions and threaten the security of others. Therefore the act of doing said drugs itself is a threat to others <br><br>then we should make all pain killers illegal. because people mix them up with other medication or alcohol and and get high as shit legally, and they are also not capable of controlling themselves.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I would have to disagree with you.<br><br>Nobody is required to do a damn thing about a drug addict. If the person is a danger to himself then what's it to you that he does what he does?<br><br>It's bullshit. You don't know the right way to live and neither does anyone else. Let people live how they want, as long as they don't fuck with others. It's that simple. If the fuck with others in a malicious manner it's an entirely different scenario, but person who uses drugs (OF ANY VARIETY OR COMBINATION) is not destined to become a husk of a human. They are just as human as you are and deserve as many rights and privileges as you have.<br><br>To say otherwise isn't just elitist, it's fucking fascist.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this is simply not true. The vast majority of drugs will not make you violent or aggressive, nor out-of-control assuming the dose is reasonable. If you do do something to hurt someone else while under the influence, you should still be punished. This is how we deal with alcohol and while not perfect, its a hell of a lot better than the alternatives</br>  <br>  mixing meds with alc <br>You're not supposed to do that, just like you're not supposed to do illegal drugs.</br></br>  <br><br>HA as if anyone employing obvious fallacy would know what a confirmation bias is.</br></br>  <br><br><br>I don't think an operative is allowed to use any psychoactive, or depressive drugs at all, and is probably encouraged to take nootropics.<br><br>But then again, I am pretty sure there's somewhere, where someone doesn't give a shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yet there is no law, so its legal. who are you to say what i am supposed to do? for all that we know are supposed to take it with alcohol.</br>  <br> allowed <br>theres no laws about it, and if there would be laws about it they are not enforced.</br></br>  <br><br>Yet people do it. People still do it. The system is punishing people who DO NOT DESERVE such punishment, and you are here trying to justify it. <br><br>You have any real argument or are you just going to continue to spout illogical nonsense?</br></br></br></br>  <br>the difference being, you aren't threatened with imprisonment for not following the instructions on your prescription medicines, you'd just be called an idiot</br>  <br>Thats because the citizens are armed better than most countries army</br>  <br>These are obviously SWAT members, which are only used in situations where soldiers might be more appropriate. Such as drug raids, suicide/hostage situations, and when high value people/targets are involved.<br><br>Cops here are ridiculous, but educate your self, poorfag.<br> you are not glorious USA master race so your are obviously a 3rd world poorcuck </br></br></br></br>  <br>if you would do illegal drugs you would also be called an idiot.</br>  <br><br>Yeaaaah... but there is no law about that.<br><br>What do we do? How do I live my life? Please tell me what to do so I don't hurt myself!!! PLEASE HELP ME I DON"T KNOW WHAT TO DOOOOOOOOO HELP ME GOVT!</br></br></br></br>  <br>and thats ok. You don't have to agree with the choices of others, but you do have to accept them up until the point where they directly harm you</br>  <br>you cant deny the fact that regular, local police forces are becoming more and more militarized. which means that they use the weapons and tools used and created for warfare. using such means to protect and serve implies that you are out on doing more than protecting and serving.</br>  <br>Or harm others who are not directly involved in the situation other than the way they're being harmed.</br>  <br>thats true, stay away from them then. or call child protective services.</br>  <br>Because we have too many niggers so cops act accordingly</br>  <br><br>This.<br><br>The disparity in their uniformity, might indicate that these are not actual SWATS, but gun aficionados, or maybe even contractors, dressed as them.<br><br>The "" in the title of the picture, might indicate that this was a clue given by OP, and the general comments, an attempt to influence and orientate the answers, to further scrutiny the rest of the comments.<br><br>Like in a game where 90% of the players know what's going on, except for a 10% whose answers are scrutinized.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dumbasses here can more easily go pick up a rifle and criminals use that to their advantage. Police are more militarized because organized crime looks like more like a militia than a gook with a gun.</br>  <br>This has to be bait. Just google the amount of no knock warrants issued for drug crimes and compare it to the number of swat raids in 1980</br>  <br>Isn't the guy in the middle the one busted for synthol abuse?</br>  <br>Those aren't police faggot</br>  <br><br> then we should make all pain killers illegal <br>Nope. That is not the primary use of pain killers. What you're describing is comparable to outlawing power tools because they can be used for nefarious purposes. The whole point of hard drugs on the other hand is to get fucked up at any cost.</br></br></br>  It's a beautiful day for QUINTS.  close  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;627122222   <br>Close but no vicar nigga big ups though even though youre a cuckold ho who got no cigar smoke<br><br> rap for you, you tried </br></br></br>  Combination is 20.
