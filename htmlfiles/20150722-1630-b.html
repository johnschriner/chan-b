You have to be really bored to dye your hair.</br>    Why don't you own an AR-15 for self-defense and to protect your family, home and country?  <br>Because im not a fucking idiot who needs to compensate my small penis with a large and unnecessary gun when a pistol will do the trick.</br>  <br>because I already have an illegally modified P90 that i will never get to use because when i was an edgy teenager i had a weird obsession with the P90 after playing too much MW</br>  <br><br>try saying that when the person or persons trying to kill you are using something better than a pistol, like an AR-15</br></br>  <br>Anders Behring Breivik did. We all know how that went.</br>  <br>That really, really depends on the "trick."</br>  Because I own an AK.<br><br>Cover for 5.56 is just concealment for 7.62.</br></br>  <br>Pistols are only good for fighting your way to a rifle. <br><br>In a firefight, anyone who knows their shit would pick a 10/22 over any handgun.</br></br></br>  Dont have the money and personally i think a shotgun makes a better home defense weapon  <br>Mossberg master race for home defense.</br>  <br>If im in a warzone then sure, but if its a home invasion and I need to protect my family, I would rather use a pistol so I can actually move around and not have to think about my barrel getting caught on something if I have to turn around fast.</br>  <br>Because shotguns are more powerful, and this isnt K/ newfag</br>  <br> In a firefight <br><br><br>this isn't vietnam granddad, you don't need anti-gook grenades under the bed in this country</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because we are not allowed semi-auto Rifles in Australia</br>  <br>Because no one is threatening my family, my home, or my country, you paranoid, trigger-happy cunt.</br>  <br> Self defense <br>I can defend myself just fine with a boomerang and my kangaroo<br> protect your family <br>They have boomerangs and kangaroos, too <br> Your country <br>That's what a defense force is for.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Something in .308 or 7.62 would be just as acceptable.<br>I'm personally going to add a .50 to my armament by year's end.<br> Why can't you penetrate light armor at half mile distances to defend your nation? <br>I asked myself that question a while back and the only reason I could find was that I was being a cheap ass.</br></br></br></br>   assault rifle <br> self-defense </br>  <br>i do.</br>  Because my revolver is more than enough. If you shoot a robber with just about anything stronger than a BB gun they're going to run the fuck away. Is your TV worth more than getting shot twice? I think not.  Because a 91/30 Mosin Nagant has way more historical significance and is also cheap  <br>Can't afford and actively looking yet still can't afford..... :(</br>  Have a .308 AR sniper rifle to reach out and touch someone if shit hits the fan. <br>An AK pistol, .45, and shotgun for the house.</br>  <br>How many enemies do you have that you think everyone wants to kill you?</br>  <br>You're this guy right?</br>  Because i have an AK-47 instead  <br> not being able to navigate close quarters with a rifle <br>It's called practice.</br></br>  <br>Because I think it's overkill. If you wake me up and have even a pistol, I'm probably dead already.</br>  <br>Anyone that calls themselves a man should have the means to defend themselves and their families.</br>  <br>Get this:<br> all states' have just about the same marriage laws <br> the states' laws on guns vary wildly </br></br></br>  <br>.300 Blackout. Get on my level pleb.</br>  I used to have an AK (saiga 7.62 converted myself)<br><br>I traded it for a .45-70 Marlin lever gat SBL version<br><br>I'm joining the US Navy so I don't really care about "the happening" I just wanted a cool gun until I leave for basic.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Respect to this guy, he gets it. I had a home break in once, either had to use my dad's deer hunting rifle or a butcher's knife. My house has skinny ass hallways and lots of corners to move around, so I got the knife. Got the drop on the guy, cut his arm before he fled, cops used the blood on my knife to i.d. him as the same guy who had a crime spree (break-ins, amateur left prints and hair) in the subarbs outside my city.</br>  /k/ get the fuck back to your containment board and check em  <br>no, you need anti-nigger grenades.</br>  Was actually looking around for my first firearm today, anyone here have a Tavor SAR 16inch?  <br>Pray to Murder Cube for salvation</br>  <br>Underrated post</br>  <br> what are bullpups? </br>  <br>I think a better question is, with no family, no home and no country, what am I doing with this AR-15?</br>  <br>They could get blood off the bullet or fabric that came off where the bullet went through</br>  <br>Well played. Don't hesitate to max out all five credit cards buying the rifle and twenty rounds to feed it.</br>  <br>Just.. don't. A Tavor is a terrible option for a first firearm on so many levels. If you want a full sized rifle get an AR-15, they are easy as piss to get used to, parts are cheap, and they are very user friendly.</br>  <br>Shooting up schools</br>  <br>Same response as every time this comes up:<br><br>Learn something, better yourself, get a good job, make money, and move where there isn't street crime you fucking poorfags.<br><br>"I can defend my family! Except from the bank and the crippling poverty I put them through..."</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why would you make a Tavor your first gun?</br>  Because I don't live in Mexico.  <br>Cuz due to budget cute my M16 is considered a "side arm" now and I have to drag it AND my grenade launcher everywhere.</br>  Because I own an m16 instead. And some other Russian Assault rifles that I don't legally own...  <br>Why should any state be allowed to violate the 2nd Amendment? Isn't that the same logic used to enforce gay marriage?</br>  <br>You know what happens when you shoot someone at close range with a handgun? The attack you, and if you're lucky, bleed out in the process.<br><br>You know what happens when you shoot someone with a 12 gauge at close range?

They're fun to shoot, but a bitch to do so because they are high maintenance. <br>My rifle I will use for HD if needed will be my Zastava M70 OPAP. <br>Not picky about ammo, and pretty much works every time.</br></br></br>  <br>this</br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br>why not?</br>  <br><br>cuz i have a saiga 12k</br></br>  <br>allahu akbar</br>  <br> not a fucking idiot <br> claims owning a firearm is "compensating" <br>Did you just blow in from tumblr?</br></br></br>  ar10 &gt; ar15  <br><br>I tried out an FN model AR not too long ago. Quality firearm, but not my cup of tea. Also, the layout of my house makes service rifles impractical to use, even carbine models.</br></br>    <br>What makes them terrible for a first time gun?</br>  <br>What is SBR? Don't be fucking retarded.</br>  <br>Where were you able to move that doesn't have Niggers? What do you do for a living? Do you now if there are good jobs in your town?</br>  <br>Where is "fun" on that list?</br>  <br><br><br>A Tavor is grossly expensive for being what it is and it is your first gun. You could buy like 4 or 5 guns for the price of a tavor. You could have a fucking arsenal off the bat and still have a AR-15 or another semi auto rifle.</br></br></br>  <br>Sup devil</br>  <br>Absolutely nothing. It's just fudds being fudds.</br>  <br>Because i prefer AR-10's</br>  My family is not under any threat, I live in a safe neighborhood (no niggers) and my country fucks every other country in the ass constantly...I doubt a four eyed fat fuck with an assault riffle is really a welcomed addition to the U.S arsenal.  <br>A shotgun is better than a knife for home defense. A knife will be better than a hunting rifle that fires a singular charge which will then go through the next house.</br>  <br>because i'm poor<br>...and fuck the cuntry, and the shitty red, white and blue dick that comes with it.</br></br>  <br>The triggers in them are garbage to start with. Any kind of replacement parts or aftermarket parts are hard to find and will cost you a premium. Listen to the guy who mentioned the AR-15. A S&amp;W M&amp;P-15 is a good AR to start with that you can find cheap and customize to your liking just like any other AR out there. The upper and lower receiver only matter so much when everything else on the gun is changed.<br><br>The big question is why do you need it? That should determine the kind of firearm you get.</br></br></br>  <br>job applications?</br>  <br>Where you based at? I'm at Lejeune</br>  <br>Price isn't an issue. I'd rather have the expensive gun I want then a bunch that are just okay. Any other disadvantages?</br>  I don't own any gun.<br>If there ever was a situation where I would have to defend myself with a gun, I'd rather just get killed. My life is swallow and meaningless anyway.</br>  <br><br>Except he didn't. He had a mini 14.<br><br><br><br>Everyone says that until it happens to them, and then what? You're a defenseless little slave. Also why are you so salty?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wrong answer. People don't get up after playing with any .45, much less a 9mm, or .40 with proper ammo. The .45 is ideal as it doesn't over-penetrate walls as easily as easily as the others. <br>A shotgun is good to have around for people that don't shoot often, as they can just point and shoot, but a handgun in skilled hands is the best weapon of choice for home defense.</br></br>  <br> Can't tell if euro cuck or fedora lord. <br>Charge? It's a round, cartridge, bullet not a charge. Are you using a type IV phaser?</br></br>  <br>Mine would be my trusty M1A/M14</br>  <br>das it mane</br>  <br>0311 spotted</br>  <br>Because I'm not an retarded</br>  <br>Look at it this way. Would you buy your kid a ferrari or bugati for thier first car? Hell no! They cant maintain it, have no idea how to use it, and dont need that level of performance for any logical reason anyways. <br>Is the ar all hi speed low drag like a tavor or SCAR? About as much as comparing a ford focus to a lambo. But in the grand scheme of things it fits the role for a first timer much better. Frankly if you really want to be a true marksman I reccomend starting out with a bolt action .22 for a first timwithGet good with that, progress to better guns like say, a ruger 10/22. Then maybe a .270 or 30.06. Eventually get an AR when you are confident enough to operate it safely and accurately. Then maybe buy an over-engineered bullpup style tacticool piece of crap if the notion still strikes you as valid now that you have a real understanding of firearms.</br></br>  Joke's on you, I own 2. Fuckin 'merica.  <br> not an retarded <br>Contradiction, retard.</br></br>  <br>Because I don't live in a horrible country where you need a gun to take care of yourself.</br>  <br>i do. wanna see</br>  <br>Chillin in the stumps with a rifle that turned purple circa 1988. Gettin ready for a pump to iraq.</br>  <br> Needing a gun <br>Just leave the shit tier country you live in Amerifat</br></br>  <br>The stumps.</br>  <br><br> grenade launcher <br> infrared laser <br> acog <br> full auto <br><br>Some sweet equipment you get to use there.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rah? Seriously. How many devil dogs we got lurkin on here. Roger up.</br>  <br>I agree completely, that's why you start em' young. I was taught to be safe and comfortable with guns from when I could walk.</br>  <br>I do have an AR-15.</br>  <br>Simply put, the AR-15 is more user friendly, especially if you intend to shoot left handed. It has a bigger selection of mods and attachments. They are more reliable than the Tavor (though thats debatable.) It also have a huge fanbase so if you have any question what-so-ever, its already been asked and someone already made a solution and has the kit on sale. Plus the ergonomics of the Tavor fucking suck bro.</br>  <br>Yeah you are right, but I only had those two things at my disposal, next weapon would have been my hammer. I only have the one gun.<br><br>Well said, couldn't agree more, I just wish I had a shotgun or something of the sorts, but there are more important things for me to pay for right now.</br></br></br>  <br>This is me<br><br><br><br>Oldfag - Semper Fi 90-96</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Spotted the Devildog, not in the Corps but appreciate what your doing bro</br>  The whole "muh 45 acp stopping power" concept is bullshit, as is the idea that pistol rounds don't over penetrate. A .45 ACP will go through more walls than a 5.56 will. <br><br>Also, shotguns are more difficult for a novice to use effectively than a semi-auto pistol; but when you can use them effectively, you own anything inside 50 yards hands down.</br></br>  <br> being stupid enough to think that the AR in AR-15 stands for assault rifle </br>  <br>Bro Twentynine Palms is absolute shit from what I hear. Lejeune is just always humid, hot, sandy, swampy and smelly. But I'm from a town 2 hours away so I was raised here.</br>  <br>was meant for<br/></br>  <br>Literally never used the laser outside of a range and the launcher required CO or higher level approval to fire so far its been a paper weight. Also real fun to carry around on 20k desert hikes. The ACOG would be cooler if it wasnt so wore out it cant hold a zero. Seriously last confirmation shoot it was 120 clicks low and 98 left at 25 yards.</br>  <br>Um i do, I keep it in the kitchen under the sink in case people try to raid my sandwiches</br>  <br>Or you can not be a total bitch and encourage the no gunz by telling him it's s fine rifle (like it is) and enjoy the fact that has gunz is now +1. Don't shit on a perfectly fine choice.</br>  <br>It's not even that, they aren't even that great of guns. I would take a LaRue PredatAR over a Tavor any day.</br>  <br> being this new </br>  <br>You are a moron, please turn your airsoft weapons over immediately.</br>  <br>Ps. Semi auto. It has burst but i have never met anyone who has actually fired it on that setting.</br>  <br>thats an AR-10</br>  <br> .45 fag detected </br>  <br><br>really? an acog that busted and they wont fix it? sorry bro<br><br>my acog is fine, but then again i'm a civilian and only have had it for a year</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yup confirmed for LaRuefudd<br><br>Arfcom</br></br></br>  <br>Desert storm? <br>Enduring freedom and soon to be.... idk. Whatever the fuck iraq part 3 is gonna get called.</br></br>  <br><br>looks like an AR-15 to me. Look at the magazine.</br></br>  <br>To prone to jams. I don't want to have to clean my weapon every god damned day and pray it actually fires when I want it to. <br><br>To slow to ready/aim. By the time you need it it's already to late to use it and if you sleep with it next to you chances are you're going to shoot a family member (or accidentally shoot yourself in your sleep).</br></br></br>  <br> Reply </br>  <br>Can't you "accidentally" smack it in a frame and bust it?</br>  <br>For the price the Tavor is an awful choice unless you have to have the bullpup look. ARs for that price are sub MOA, the Tavor is not.</br>  <br>  Call of duty detected - pic related </br>  I do  <br>Because they make me use an M4A1. And since I'm not a GM I don't care what they give me as long as it kills people and does not jam.</br>  <br>.45 ACP is like say, a fist hitting you going 900 fps as opposed to a 9mm being a single knuckle. The .45 is going to have more energy because it weighs more, but the 9mm is going to have better permanent cavities and ballistics.</br>  <br>Yeah. Especially since my last deployment was helmand afgan. Was supposed to get a float but they changed it to iraq. Looks like this enlistment is gonna be just bouncing back and forth between shitty deserts around the world.</br>  <br>I do.</br>  <br>I want to zuck ya dick anon, 10/10</br>  <br>Yeah you know dick about modern AR platform.</br>  <br>Please heavenly father guide this boot.....</br>  <br>Yes. Served under Norman Schwarzkopf</br>  Fuck my country.<br><br>Only family I live with is my brother and nobodies breaking into a second story condo with three mid-20's guys in it.<br><br>My home could burn for all I care, insurance up in dis bitch, I'd live with my parents for a few months then roll out with $25k more than I currently have.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Dats a perdy revolver</br>  <br>Rah, I think we should name it American Crusade</br>  <br>This guy knows his shit. I own A tavor, amongst various other AR styled rifles. While it is one of my favorites, it is also the least practical from a beginners standpoint, being a bullpup and all.</br>  <br>Did you get deployed or were you a pog.<br> please don't be a pog </br></br>  <br><br>Im just sayin, does it work? Yes. Is it accurate? Yes. Is it worth the retarded price tag for something that just does what my AR already does but looks cooler? In my mind no.</br></br>  <br>SBR handling with full length accuracy. Bullpup is great for a lot of implementations. Also STANAG magazines are everywhere.</br>  <br>Yeah, I often find that fat people have more energy because they weigh more</br>  <br>Eh. Im getting a new M4 in a few weeks anyways.</br>  Cause I'm in Canada. What's a robber gonna attack me with pamphlets on gun safety?  I have a SOCOM 16. I'm picking up a Springfield XDM .45 tomorrow.  Because I have an M60E4  <br>If they were to gain the same speed as fit people and hit you they would. Don't be retarded.<br><br>Oh yeah,<br> dubs gets </br></br></br></br>  <br>They also have shit tier ergonomics of the dude is left handed or ever intends to try out his gun left handed.</br>  <br>Im a corporal bro.</br>  <br>AR<br> protect home... yes clearing a room with a AR is totally the best option <br> self defense.. get mugged in street quickly pull out my concealed AR send that nigger to Valhalla <br> country only reasonable one up there but still doesn't make a whole lot of sense use a fucking long range rifle a .308 guerrilla warfare  <br>or you can die like every other retard who muh AR is superior to every weapon a foreign nation has cuz I have a 4 X optics and tac light so I can blind them if dey get to close <br> OP is faggot  <br> OP is either gun retarded or tactically retarded  <br>  OP is still confirmed faggot </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 9mm is .355 caliber <br> .45acp is .45 caliber <br> less than .1 inch difference in diameter <br> average projectile weight difference is around 120gr <br> a first compared to a single knuckle <br><br>full god damned retard. .45acp is a clown caliber, the end.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sweet. My dad was over there. As an airwing pog, but hey, atleast hes one of those cool pogs that dont try to sound like rambo everytime they talk about thier service. (We give eachother a lot of crap)</br>  <br>Really? Personally I think that if a fat person went the same speed as a fit person he'd be out of energy<br><br>  8^&gt; </br></br></br>  <br>So buy a lefty. Ergos are dependant on body type. AR was shit for me until I got a new tube and stock that didn't put me five feet behind the barrel.</br>  <br>Yeah my last deployment was Kandahar or however you spell that shit province. Should name it the world's anus or something more charming. It's full of old soviet mines and farmers with AK's taking pot shots at bypassing Americans. Bunch of fucking cowards. But I'll probably go back cause it's fun sometimes.</br>  <br>We should be saying that about you.</br>   tfw want to get into firearms but all friends are pacifist sheep   Because assault rifles should be illegal  roll  <br>I was in helmand. Fuck that goddamned shit hole.</br>  <br>They are super accurate but they can be difficult to load. That's just my experience with then.</br>  <br>you dont need friends to get in to firearms. I haven't had friends in years and i own tons of guns!</br>  <br>OP you must be retarded or handicapped in some way to make such a stupid statement I was in Iraq in 07 and Afghanistan in 08 and I can assure you the fighting wasn't done from sitting on my ass please don't open you're mouth about things you don't even have the slightest clue about you sound so ignorant ww2 being the only real or true war you FUCKING idiot until you your self fight in a war stay silent because the truth is you don't even have clue on what any of it is about but I bet you only have the balls to talk like that on the internet and not in person</br>  <br>So fuck them and go make new friends at the range</br>  <br>You're taking it into terms of fat people v skinny people. He'd run out of energy but if he hit you the transfer of energy would be greater due to mass.</br>  <br>Be their shepherd, anon.</br>  <br>He is brand new to guns, a semi auto rifle is a terrible choice from the start. But if he absolutely wants one, an AR-15 is better for a starter because ergos and literally every small gun store in America has atleast one or two lying around.</br>  <br>But my point is that it isn't as accurate as a full length rifle, and I doubt that it is as mobile as a dedicated CQB weapon. I'm not saying that it doesn't have its uses, but the person needs to tailor the weapon to what they are using it for.<br><br>If they guy who wants the Tavor is just going to take it plinking at the range he could have done that for way less money. Sure he may not have the people at the next bench gawking at his rifle, but is it really worth paying that much extra for?<br><br>You tailor the gear towards the mission, not the other way around.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope you you die in an industrial microwave accident.</br>  <br>You know what the fuck I mean then, rah.<br>I stared death in the eyes and he had a beard, ak, and fucked little boys.</br></br>  <br>Which cartel is after you?</br>  <br>Deployed pog, Comm/small systems<br>Was lucky enough to get into CENTCOM, worked from a building in Riyadh which one of the operational sites for the war. <br>Got out, got a job with a major cooperation doing IT. Still there. Huge house, nice cars, still hardcore. Profit.</br></br></br>  <br> difficult to load <br>Stripper clip it, that's what it was designed for.</br></br>  <br>As someone who's not even gun toting American, even I know .45 ACP is only useful against human targets. When hitting something hard or solid i.e a wall, .45 falls flat, a 9mm 115 gr. Ball penetrates better than .45.<br><br>lrn2murican</br></br></br>  <br>Technically they would if they could move the same speed.<br>Two important physics calculations:<br><br>Kinetic energy = 1/2 mass x velocity^2<br><br>Momentum = mass x velocity (and so the rate of change of kinetic energy).<br><br>The former calculation, with velocity being squared means that the speed of a punch is more important than the mass - if you double the mass you'll double the kinetic energy, but if you double the speed, you'll quadruple it. <br><br>However, it's not just the energy of the punch which counts but how you transfer that energy - and that's where momentum comes in. If you have a very fast punch but it bounces off your opponent, you won't transfer much energy - when you punch you have to learn to punch through the target else a fast punch will just bounce back against a heavier opponent.<br>Hence, fatter people with the same amount of speed do more damage.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He said he owns a pistol, shitlord.</br>  <br>Too much penetration. All you need is a tactical shotgun or a 9mm if you're a good shot.</br>  <br>agreed unless the nigga is wearing lvl 2 and above plates which I highly doubt in a home defense situation .45 is literally just a conversation piece</br>  <br>At least you're honest about being a pog.</br>  <br>  Transfer of energy <br>No anon, he doesn't have any keft remember? He's fat. Fucking idiot.</br></br>  <br>Why recommend a 10/22 if semi is so terrible.<br><br>Also body type. If he's got short arms, or some strange situation a bullpup would be comfortable.<br><br>The rifle is fine. A shorter overall package is also better for interiors.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The one they gave me at Quantico wouldn't zero at all.<br>When we did qual they told me to use iron sights and then scored it as though I had used the ACOG. Meaning they reduced my score.</br></br>    I don't live in a shithole.  <br>  Transfer of energy <br>No anon, he is out of energy remember? Because he's fat? Fucking moron.</br></br>  <br>Due to high velocity projectile fragmentation, a .45 will still out penetrate most 5.56 rounds through walls and whatnot.</br>  <br>Yeah. Had a few close calls. Sniper put one 3 inches past my ear and our MRAP took a 40 pounder to the front tire courtesy of army route clearance being so up on thier "sleeping instead of checking thier $200k ground penetrating radar scanner" game. Gunners harnes kept me from bein ejected. Got a pretty sweet concussion tho. Got to sleep in the BLS complex hospital and stare at all the hot british lady doctors tits.</br>  because I own an AK-47  <br>Quantico? Your an officer?</br>  <br>I didn't say semi auto was terrible, but an AR-15 for a first gun isn't the worst or best option. But if he does get a semi auto rifle, it might as well be an AR-15 because its the most common and ergonomic.</br>  but I do  <br>It's a rage toy/HD setup I assume. Not going to bumfuckiststain. It's totally worth whatever he's willing to pay to be a hasgunz. I wouldn't dissuade anyone from buying a snubby .357 as a first. There's no reason to.</br>  <br> this </br>   mfw in Canada <br> can get silly weapons if I want <br> dont need them because no niggers <br><br>hows it feel living in a perpetual state of fear and false comfort provided by MUH SECOND UHMENDMANT, amerishoots?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Can I borrow $20?</br>  <br> mosin nagant <br> super accurate <br><br>That's one of the funniest things I've read all night. <br>Thanks for a good laugh.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>because my vz 58 does the job</br>  <br>Damn dude, I had a few myself.<br>I got some whizzes and burns from a PKM laying into me, I'm still convinced Pulp Fiction style divine intervention kept me from dying because he was only 20 meters away. Too bad the tard got 40 mike miked and I lit his ass up. I feel no remorse whatsoever for him, it was him or me.</br></br>  <br>Are you the same retard who said this earlier? Please go away before you influence someone to make the wrong decision. There is no way in hell a .45 will penetrate anywhere near a 5.56. Honestly, have you ever even shot before?</br>  <br>I don't care much for the jewgun, but that FNX is sexy as hell.</br>  <br>yeah but you basically have to be our hat.<br><br>Our nerdy, pussy hat<br><br>lol oh Canada</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Where im from in montana wed call a first time gun owner buying an ar or a tavor "hollywood." Usually meaning "hey guys, I cant shoot for shit, know nothing about guns, ammo, ballistics, or any one of the hundreds of bits of info that go into being a marksman, so im gonna compensate by buying a $3,000 rifle and $2 a round molybdium coated bullets!"</br>  <br>You answered your own question canadaqueer<br> no niggers </br></br>  <br>You're fucking retarded - 900 FPS vs 2500 FPS isn't even in the same league codfucker.<br>Fuck off to /k/, we need a good laugh, kid.</br></br>  <br>An AR15 is not better for defending yourself. A handgun is much more mobile, the accuracy of a rifle is not needed for simple protection.<br><br>Why do you think that the most restrictive gun laws are on handguns?</br></br></br>  Would you donate a couple ARs to these two?  <br>Ergos on AR suck for me. Bullpup is way more comfortable. Dream of owning an AUG for this reason.<br><br> semi for beginner <br> no semi for beginner <br>Pick one please!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>AR's are for protection from government who are wearing body armor.</br>  <br> Handguns aren't good for shooting someone at close range <br> Use a handgun for personal defense <br><br>Handguns are ideal for use in close quarters (Home defense, retard). Plus they have a higher rate of fire than pretty much any twelve gauge.<br><br>People don't break into houses because they want to be war heroes. They break in to steal some shit and make a bit of cash. Even a .22 would scare off most criminals, and I guarantee if you fire a .38 indoors the motherfucker is gonna leave. You don't need any bigger than that unless your primary intention is to kill them (which I'm not saying is bad, I'm just saying you don't need to do it to stop a burglary). Shotguns for home defense is an idea put forward by people who have no fucking clue about actual weapons.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>dinner plate sized groupings at 100 yards op</br></br>  <br>It's nice for not having to fuck with a tax stamp. Too much of that shit with supressors already. And yeah, The Fnx is my favorite hands down. I even CCW it from time to time.</br>  <br>In my opinion a bolt action/semi auto .22 is the best gun for a beginner. But he doesn't want a .22. He wants a rifle chambered in 5.56, so in my opinion if he is going to do that he should get an AR-15.</br>  <br>But they're not the fags that will bitch about your AR . CHRIST FUCK I would rather Hollywood's than noggins nogunz</br>  <br>Yeah. Dumped a belt through a 240ainto a tree line. Smoked some guy right in the throat. He kicked and flopped around reaaaal nice like. When you first get there you feel bad for em. Then you see how they live, treat thier kids, and what they do to eachother and quit that sympathy bullshit real quick. Smelly drug junkie rapist mother fuckers.</br>  <br>When was the last sometime in the last century that someone legitimately needed to "protect themselves from the government"<br><br>Get out of your fantasy world, this isn't an Orwell novel we are living in</br></br></br>  <br>Why would I get an assault rifle to defend myself, idiot. A defence rifle is a much better choice for that kind of thing.</br>  <br> debt <br> crime <br> no exports <br> hilarious infighting stalling any positive progress <br><br>how's it feel being Canada's toilet, buddy?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You would be correct<br>Large caliber handgun &gt; AR for home defense. <br>Now, with that said, an m4(shortened AR) would be better in urban combat, where you don't give a fuck when rounds go through walls into other buildings.</br></br></br>  <br>Damn straight, too bad the liberals won't let us turn that litterbox into fucking glass.<br><br> I got a lot more stories but too many non-grunts here to tell. They don't understand. </br></br></br>  <br>Smash yourself in the face with a hammer please. That shit was painful.</br>  <br>Which a handgun does. Because you aren't going to get in a fucking firefight in Montana or Ohio, so you don't need a weapon designed for sustained combat in those places. Unless MS13 is out to get you a handgun is more than adequate.</br>  <br>Lol i do own one. but, this is canada so its not much protection locked up in a seperate safe then the ammo.</br>  <br>Some guy with a Nugget is going to penetrate your AR500 plate with his century old $80 antique.</br>  Taylor Swift is a pretentious, self absorbed phony attention whore hipster feminist dyke who has one, maybe two good songs and don't think for a minute she actually did anything other than sing them (into an expensive microphone and the recording was then highly altered digitally). She thinks she's just the cutest most adorable thing in the world and acts all innocent, but she goes through about 20 men in a year and dresses like every other slutty female "artist" out there with her short shorts that make her ass cheeks hang out, or with shirts that show her belly button, and with that retarded red lipstick. Taylor is one of the worst role models for little girls out there and her music videos are awful too. To top it all off I'm convinced she's sleeping with Lena Dunham. Think about that for a minute. Think about the person Lena Dunham is and who we know to be just based off of her book alone where she bragged about putting pebbles in the pussies of little girls and treating her younger sister as sexual property and also making false rape claims. This is the type of person Taylor Swift is. And before you say "she's a musician why are you focused on all that other stuff" I'm focusing on all that other stuff because she shoves it down our throats, not just herself but her PR team and record company and everything else. Trust me "her" music is secondary to her ultimate goal and I put "her" in quotes because again, the idea that she actually writes any of her songs at least within the past 5 years or so is total bullshit, it's all created by the machine that's designed to keep you lame faggots following her every move and buying all her shitty music and attending her shitty shows with your little daughters so Taylor can teach them to be whores too. I'm fucking sick of it, of Taylor and Ariana and Iggy and Katy and Nikki, they're all the same and they're all ugly on the inside and'd be ugly on the outside if they didn't have surgery wear all that fucking makeup.  I don't care about my country, so not interested in defending it, and I don't have a family that I care about anymore, so nothing really worth defending.<br><br>Though even if I did want to defend things, I wouldnt buy that piece of garbage to do so.</br></br>  <br>You need to practice more. Russian Tula M44 of a friends I was doing 6" groups at 200 yards, iron sights.</br>  <br>Ruby ridge, Waco tx, Bundy Ranch.</br>  I do.  <br>I have an upper that costs more than two rifles. Why the fuck do you think I run steel plates?</br>  <br>Yeah, if you aren't hitting all black at 100 yards you're doing something wrong.</br>  <br><br>True. Regardless, buying a tavor as literally your first gun is stupid. You dont even know if you will like it, or be any good at it. Buy a shitty pawn shop bolt or lever action rifle. Make friends who shoot. Try out thier shit. Gain a skill set and a preference for what you like. Progress from there. Would your first motorcycle be a ducati nitro boosted racing replica? Fuck no. You dont know how to ride, or if you EVEN LIKE MOTORBIKE RIDING. You buy a used harley sportster. Same with guns. You dont just dive headfirst into a expensive investment of a rifle when you dont even know how to shoot yet.</br></br>  <br> Mein negger <br><br>Please get a bayonet, if you dont already own one</br></br></br>  ;D  <br> waco <br><br>lost all credibility</br></br></br>  <br> 2015 <br> not knowing about high velocity projectile fragmentation <br>kek<br><br><br>Your primary intention should be to stop them. Assuming they'd flee because of a gun is to also assume they're rational, which is immediately discounted by the fact they're breaking into someone's house. That's no different than the retards that say "just goin rack muh 12 gauge n that'll skur em off". Someone high on PCP, intent on eating your face doesn't give a shit about your pistol calibers.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Bundy Ranch <br>You really going with that as an example?</br></br>    <br>Totes.

Get good with it, then maybe progress to a real AR. Get good with that, then maybe try out a hi-speed bullpup type tacticool gun.
