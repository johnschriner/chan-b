They don't even sell manuals in America so fuck you! Porsche, well they are pretty nice but not worth the price for the ones you actually want to drive. Do you fags even know how to off road? Land Rover is the only thing you cunts have built that come close to a Jeep and they were jacked from jeeps anyway.

The only reason we even cared about space is because of our fear of things like incredibly advanced kinetic rods being dropped from orbit, or orbital ICBM ballistic shields that would leave our nuclear arsenal as completely useless - and our fear that the Soviets would get it first.<br><br>Plus, at the time the Soviets had a military budget greater than the United States and was already shaking up their economy pretty bad. The space race might have been a drop in the economic bucket compared to that, but drops like that are what helped overflow the Soviet economy and cause it to break down by 1991, thus "winning" the Cold War.<br><br>Plus... Though it may not seem important and it's still not, it's the first step to mastering space. That's the final frontier. Even if we'll never colonize another planet, all the things we can learn and discover and use out there is unimaginable.<br><br>Not to mention a ridiculous amount of technology produced during the space race trickled down into common usage.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> said by someone who can't spell.  <br><br>LOL</br></br></br></br>    <br>It's not actually cheaper though, it's because they're lazy and stupid so they buy McD's instead of actual food.</br>  <br>You proud of that?</br>  <br>dude, the netherlands are just under fucking israel</br>  <br>So egdy.

Wow.<br><br>If you didn't know: Mercedes, as a company, is trying to make as much money as possible.<br><br>How do you achieve that?<br>A: Offer products your customers want and are capable of using.<br>B: Offer products your customers want, but CAN'T use.<br><br>Protip: It's A.<br>You're basically saying fuck Mercedes (they still make better cars than American manufacturers) because they offer what the majority of the customers want. GG.<br><br>AND on top of that: I'm 200% sure that other companys do the same shit. How many manual vs automatic Fords are being sold over there? Chevys?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> 1980s interiors and underpowered motors <br><br>I think you're talking about American cars here. 250HK from a 2.0 liter petrol engine? Isn't that about what you manage to get out of a 6.0 liter V8? Seriously, if you don't know that BMW make the best engines in the world, you know nothing about cars.<br><br> Mercedes? They don't even sell manuals in America so fuck you! <br><br>That's because Americans can't drive with sticks so there isn't a demand. That's hardly Mercedes' fault.<br><br> Porsche, well they are pretty nice but not worth the price for the ones you actually want to drive. <br><br>I understand that you can't afford the mortgage from your trailer. Expensive yes, but obviously for people who like to drive. Also, one of the most profitable car companies while American car manufacturers have to be bailed out because they make so crappy cars.<br><br> Jeeps <br><br>You must be joking! The first Jeep is a classic, but Jeep is shit tier SUVs like all other American cars. I'd rather buy a German, Japanese or Swedish SUV over a Jeep.<br><br>Seriously, is Jeep supposed to be the superior American car? What other car would be superior in their class? Of course there is none. American cars are being passed by Korean cars for fucks sake.

Why java? it's a mess!  <br>its easy to learn since its a subset of C++ with some objective thrown in. Community college all spaghetti over java since they can hire a currynigger to teach it for minimum wage and free curry.</br>  No one is going to hire a 41 year old programmer with no experience. <br><br>No one.</br></br>  <br>I'd do a couple of freelance projects before applying for anything</br>  <br>Try to build up a portfolio. Even with modern day working and hiring laws you will get a LOT of discrimination. Never at your face of course. The degree should secure you an interview but you need to bring a strong resume and proof that you really mean a career change. Other than social work age is nearly always going to be a big, if taboo, subject when changing careers and you trying to justify it.</br>  <br>You're wasting your time and money with College. <br><br>If you have money to blow like that, study with materials online at home and make friends in the industry. <br><br>That piece of paper you're trying to buy will only bankrupt you.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's $2,000 a semester including books and it's all completely covered by a $5,800 annual Pell grant award. <br><br>It's not costing me anything. I even get ~$1,300 refund at the end of each semester.</br></br></br>  Happy 14th Birthday Claire!<br><br>Hartley Hooligans</br></br>    <br>can that thing even see or does it just react to light. the mother said on the blog it did a normal test so is she implying it can read</br>  <br>I think the mother is delusional and just thought she looked cute in glasses. How can something that doesn't respond take an eye exam.</br>  <br> Shut the fuck up you grotesque neanderthal</br>  Happy birthday you vegetable  Happy Birthday Sis!  It's lived 14 years too long    &lt;3      <br>It's amazing to think how fragile the mind is. If you look at that comparison, while her head/brain certainly looks smaller, I wouldn't guess the result would be a barely functioning collection of organs with no cognitive abilities whatsoever. <br><br>Also, I'm surprised her condition didn't show up on a sonogram?</br></br></br>  I..    DRINK  YOUR  MILKSHAKE  <br>it did when they checked the second child for it</br>    <br>...and then they made a choice not to abort that second child. fucking freaks.</br>  Does Claire get her periods? Also, time to spam happy bday Claire threads.      <br>It just seems like even without looking for it, they should have noticed her head was so much smaller. <br><br>Does Lola have a more severe case or does it just look that way since she's much younger and smaller? <br><br>Fuck, I can't believe I know these potatoes by name now.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>what a lame ass birthday cake. 5/10 at least it's cake.</br>  <br>I WILL WAIT THE FOUR MORE YEARS</br>    <br>Probably, a friend had a sister who was a potato and he said she did. She had cerebral palsy and just giggled all the time.</br>    <br>the mother writes on the block it showed at 22 weeks pregnant and was confirmed a month later, so both to late to abort</br>  <br>These two are significantly more damaged than cerebral palsy. I doubt their pituitary glands are developed enough for them to go through puberty.</br>  those two are way more interesting than they deserve to. The sheer idea of these things living amuses me for some reason.<br><br>that being said, they should without a doubt be fucking euthanized into oblivion</br></br>  <br>Mother likes the potato kids for attention. She plasters them all over the internet social sites with multiple hash tags.</br>    <br>they only feed her goat milk and baby food while the big one get her nutrients through the tube, maybe that has something to do with it</br>  This made my heart cry omg :'(    <br>well, down to mexico is always an option, but the woman also wants her tlc show</br>  <br>I know, man. She's a fucked up individual even by my standards, and that is saying some shit.</br>  <br> yfw the goat has higher IQ </br>  TLC would be a great match. That channel is nothing but midgets and retards.  <br>it's obvious that most fucked up sickest cunt on the internet is the mom......<br>it's time to deface all her websites</br></br>      <br>Holy shot, just imagine the work to care for these two. <br>No amount of attention received by her mother can outshadow the fact that she is actually taking care of them.</br></br>  <br>for what, it not like the kids benefit from that</br>  tits or gtfo  Her last birthday.  <br>wow dont they normally die at like three or four?</br>  <br>oh great its her birthday lets take her out of the closet to take some birthday related pictures and videos for twitter moniez</br>  <br>I don't think it's actually that much work. Have you ever taken care of a newborn? All they do is eat, shit and sleep, its pretty easy. It gets much harder when they get to be active 2-3 year olds. <br><br>These girls can't even move. You could probably lay them on a table with a bed of knives below and not even have to worry about them falling off. <br><br>Also, its not like trying to raise a real child were you have to worry about not giving them attention or exposing them to bad influences. Hell you could probably put a sack over these girl's heads and they wouldn't know the difference, might even be more peaceful for them.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>oh well, if that's actually considerable 'living' good for them I guess? I still think they'll both be dead in a few years. I will savour every single moment of when the mother will break down and start ranting about haters and such right after one of them die</br>  <br>if i was the doc i would have also kept that possibility open for the husband, kill the shit machine within one year and there most likely wont be an investigation</br>  <br>Fair point</br>  <br><br>"lived"</br></br>  <br>Just lay them down in one of the dog's bed and go about your day.</br>  Soon  Seriously, I'm not making a joke or anything like that, but she looks like she is like constantly suffering. What an awful fate, if that were me, I'd want my parents to kill me.  <br>think of the other medical problems, dwarfism, feeding tube all that shit</br>  <br>looks like she's listening to some serious heavy metal. Rock on little genetic failure!</br>  This shit is lame even of this place. The sad part is the OP probably isn't some 15 year old edge lord, more probably a fat fucking boomer.<br><br>Am I right OP?</br></br>    <br>dude i scrolled down and at first i only saw one you almost gave me a heart attack</br>  <br><br>That's what really annoys me about these parents. They probably get all this sympathy b/c of how fucked up these girls are but its infinitely more difficult to try and raise a normal or slightly retarded kid than these two potatoes.</br></br>  <br>Whatever you say Mrs. Hartley.</br>  <br>she almost has no capability to think</br>  <br>Infections are probably the hardest part to deal with but honestly the feeding tube probably makes it easier than trying to feed a normal toddler.</br>  i still don't understand why they didn't put them in a trash bin after seeing them come out<br>i mean, these things are not LIVING. They simply exist, with no concious mind and no basic reflexes. They have to be force fed since they don't understand the concept of swallowing.<br>what's the fucking point</br></br>  <br> almost </br>  <br>well im not op, but i am a fat fucking boomer and this is my third hartley hooligans thread today</br>    <br> normal <br>those rigid teeth are for sawing flesh when it bites and shakes it head side to side.</br></br>  <br>because you can meet your pets in heaven</br>  <br>I think shes strangely cute as fuck!</br>  <br>get sympathy, compassion, donations, a bit of fame and such.

What a bitch.  Im in love with this bitch  Ok b, here's the problem. I'm an autist, not medically, but you get the idea. I'm in high school. I don't really talk to a lot of people, but somehow I got into a largish friend group, who is all meeting tomorrow for a beach party. I know I won't be comfortable, and I will probably just sit awkwardly listening to people. I'm forcing my self to go because I don't have anything better to do. But I don't think that it will be fun. So, Ive learned from my limited experience that alcohol can make me talk more. But how do I get it b? Where do I get drink from?  <br>And what do you talk about instead?<br><br><br> everything something something artistic works of fiction something something. </br></br></br></br>  Im 19 and moved to america and this shithole wont let me buy alcohol till 21. What i do is just get an older friend or my weed dealer to get me some &amp; i slip him a few bucks. Or ur last guess is standing outside the store &amp; asking someone. Although it is a beach party so there should be alcohol.  <br> Implying a high school fag wouldn't be dumb or impulsive enough to do that </br>  With Skyrim on sale I thought I'd be generous. Roll trips with steam id URL and I'll gift you.  <br>Lol</br>  Motherfucker.<br>http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/<wbr>76561198133957646/edit</wbr></br>  http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/<wbr>76561198042604006</wbr></blockquote>]
