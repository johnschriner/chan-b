[ DON'T DO IT NIGGA<br>Hey /b/, I lost my virginity today. I swear to god, I never want to have sex again. Porn makes it look like something amazing, but it is really not.<br> She had a beef roastie (She was a virgin too, so don't give me that slut bullshit) <br> She came a shit ton. I didn't come once. <br> I can still taste that disgusting pussy of hers in my mouth. <br> I ended up walking home (using coke as mouthwash) fucking miserable and feeling like shit. <br><br>I have decided that I think I might just stick to masturbation for the rest of my life.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>anyone that falls for this bait is a summerfag</br>  <br>Maybe you're a faggot?</br>  OP here, what I'm trying to get at is, for those of you that are still virgins, keep it that way.  <br> She came a shit ton. <br>Not every moan is an orgasm.<br><br>Yeah sex is definitely not for autists, it is a social function.</br></br></br></br>  Nice  <br>why would you eat out a gross pussy</br>  <br> She was a virgin too, so don't give me that slut bullshi </br>  <br>This</br>  You didn't eat it right you faggot  <br>Not bait. <br><br>She told me she came.<br><br>Too late to turn back.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sniff test that shit. Test bellybutton on the way down first.</br>  <br>Listen to me anon.. It is is much better with men. Join us.</br>  <br>So sticking with my virginity to eventually become a wizard is the right choice??? AWESOME! XD</br>  <br>You can claim not bait all you want, all I see is a thread full of summerfags.</br>  <br>OP is obviously a faggot. That aside, she was faking her orgasms, if you didn't cum it's because you are a faggot, and omg...like you really couldn't have described a faggot realizing he's gay any more.</br>  <br>dumb frogposter</br>  <br>OP here. I'm bisexual, so I think I might actually do that.</br>  <br>she lie about cumming. women do that when you are bad at sex</br>  <br>I'm bi, but I think I might just turn gay after that experience.<br><br>Dude, I left on my accord. She wanted me to stay.</br></br></br>  <br>OP is totally right<br>all homosexuals have to live through this horrific and disgusting experience of having sex with a woman<br>it's like a rite of passage thing<br>you can't fully apreciate a cock in your mouth until you know what kind of bullet you dodged</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh wow anon I came hundreds of times, even though it is my first time and you are also an awkward virgin.<br>Lol women are not orgasm machines, it is not easy to have one let alone "tons".</br></br>  I'm not sure if I believe this or not.<br>But truth be told, you might not have had sexual chemistry. <br>Besides the fact that it sounds like her hygiene might be bad if her pussy tastes bad, I do feel bad for her for having meat curtains though.<br>Just find another girl, or maaaaaaaybe you're gay?<br>Losing your virginity with another virgin really isn't the best idea, since neither of you know what you're doing anyhow. So, good luck, faggot.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit, that's actually good advice</br>  <br>If you think a vagina is gross wait untill you smell anal sex.</br>  <br>Implying two virgins are gonna have good sex....</br>    <br>Next time just watch Netflix and chill</br>  <br>kek</br>  Her pussy taste like fish and chips?  If this pic turns you on, you're a sexist, pervert and a paedophile.<br><br>Agree?<br>Disagree?</br></br></br>  is this dumb bitch breast feeding in public? i see people's feet.  <br>Call it whatever you want, but those look like some damn fine titties.</br>  <br><br>Most likely not a pedo. The rest though for sure.<br><br>Either way, keep your tits to yourself.<br><br>And that kid looks way too old to be doing that....hello social services?</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>I don't know why people care. It's like coming up with an argument for why incest is wrong. The only conclusion people can come up with is "it's gross" give me a fucking break.</br>  <br><br>sauce Mother fucker RIGHT GODAMN NOW!</br></br>  <br><br>Incest is only gross when a baby is made. otherwise....

As long as nobody's getting hurt they should all chill the fuck out.</br>  <br>does it have sound?</br>  <br>If the pic turns you on because a woman is servicing a boy because reproducing is her job or the boy sucking a boobie is hot, I agree.<br>If the pic turns you on because you see a boobie and are attracted to women, I disagree.</br></br>  <br>yep.</br>  <br> http://www.megafileupload.com/dc9T<wbr>/merryginn-mfc-201506161711.mp4</wbr> <br>its obviously an mp4 file, whats it gonna magically fuck up your pc?</br></br>  <br>Why are you calling people perverts when YOU are sharing the tits?<br><br>Why call people sexists when in fact you may be the biggest sexist around?<br><br>And lastly why call people pedos?

Personally i think this is sexy, but I'm also, kinda, a pedo. Just thinking about a cute little boy like that suckling me.. but i think for most men getting turned on by this it's only because they are viewing themselves as the boy.

The key is being discreet. Now I love seeing a nice pair of titties as much as the next straight guy but if you are in public and don't have a heated bottle whipping out a tittiy is the only choice you have. Not really pedo material unless you are turned on by the child and not the titty. Which I know is the case with you creepers on /b/  <br>I can't tell if you're trolling or not</br>  <br>lol dat pic</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;628731200 <br>see what you did there?<br><br>because THERE IS NO PROBLEM!<br><br>nakedness is the most natural thing ever. and you did nothing wrong.<br>only then the stupid adults began telling you, that you did something wrong, because of their fucked up moral code<br><br> inb4 pedo and all that other shit.i'mtalking about seeing naked people. this has nothing to do with cp, you fucked up morons </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This</br>  Isn't it just tits or gtfo? Because I can just go back to lurking no prob. I already feel guilty for posting bra pic and now y'all are calling me a hoe and sayin I ain't loyal. Damn. I know I shouldn't have posted even that, But I thought, I'm turned on, this thread might die soon, and I want to see little boys with women.. but now.. now I feel bad so I should stop now before I think I might actually deserve to be called a hoe.  <br> hurr durr we r lejun </br>  <br>I'm not. Cunts like her piss me off.</br>  <br>yeah, i'm hanging around in this thread looking to hear more about this pedo chick's fantasies and beating off to shota because i'm a moralfag. <br><br>you're taking a perfectly good time and ruining it with some selective application of a "rule set" that i'm sure you break all the time. just be chill</br></br></br>  <br> My wife <br><br>How many times do we have to tell you drawing a face on your hand doesn't count?</br></br></br>  <br>story on image?</br>    <br><br>I still love you</br></br>  <br>this.</br>  <br>Leejun would be white knighting.<br><br><br>She's ruining the good time.</br></br></br></br>    <br>nobody cares</br>  More plz  <br>Of course you deserve it</br>  <br><br>More</br></br>  <br>do you dream of your boyfriend fucking a cute, rosy cheeked little boy?

But yeah, and also I love the idea of me laying back and my bf teaching a cute little boy how to have sex. One other fantasy is of me fingering a little boy while he sucks off my bf.</br>  <br>mmm</br>  <br>they could use a binky to shut them the fuck up instead of their tits</br>  <br>dude, just admit it: you thought you'd look hardcore and have everyone cheering you on, but no one is into it and you're blowing up a good time. get fucked.</br>  <br>+1</br>  <br>Any more of her???</br>  <br>what is your ideal little boy be if you could have one?

I just think I'm too good to be posting nudes of myself. Sorry I backed out, don't get butthurt.<br><br><br>I've never really done anything but when I was 15 I babysat for a 9 year old girl and she used to get naked and sit in my lap, I remember thinking the only reason I didn't do anything was because I wasn't attracted to her. I wasn't thinking about her age.<br>Biggest fantasies just involve me with a boy or Just a girl, but I think me, a little girl, and my bf is hot.</br></br></br></br></br>  welp. OP is and always will be a faggot. gonna go fap else where.  <br> I just think I'm too good to be posting nudes of myself <br><br>You're not.</br></br></br>  <br>dang, dude, how about some specifics tho?</br>  more breastfeeding pics? preferably 18+ sucking tho  <br>What about teaching a little girl to blow your boyfriend?</br>  <br>are you a redhead?</br>  <br> too good <br>this is /b/, and the internet, do you think anyone cares about anything other than their horndog dicks and clits?</br></br>  <br>Put the gif you dumb cum dumpster shit</br>  <br>Yes this is 100% truth.<br><br>All men can lactate, but unlike women it's not easy and the quantity varies from men to men. Also men have to do a routine for a certain period of time to "move" the mile in thief body, think of it as a warmup exercise.<br><br>The main difference however is that women use their breasts to lactate whereas men use their penis.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Idk, we've talked about it, but I don't think we could. Paranoia and general love for children makes us feel sickened by lust. But we do love role-playing.</br>  <br> The main difference however is that women use their breasts to lactate whereas men use their penis. <br><br>Well white milky liquid DOES come out of penises.</br></br></br>  <br>Omg yes. Yes I would.</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>Starting at what age (in your fantasy)?</br>  <br>Would you have him try to fuck her little pussy too? Would it make you squirm in delight seeing him cum in her?</br>  <br>Specifics on bf and me with loli? Love the idea of loli laying on me and having bf grind himself between us.</br>  <br>The youngest for girls, I like around 2 or 3, they're way cuter at that age. For boys around 5.</br>  <br> Love the idea of loli laying on me and having bf grind himself between us <br><br>Err how?</br></br></br>  <br><br>If I send you a throwaway email can you send some nudes of your tits?

Op left a while ago</br>  Post stuff!!! MODS ARE ASLEEP GET ONE WITH IT MATE  ill be posting Ranma 1/2 comics<br><br> fun things you like thread <br> me - i like media with interesting ideas </br></br></br>    wait for it, it gets better after no 10, but you gotta have a backstory    Skinwalker general! If you have any questions about skinwalkers or lore in general, ask them here and they'll - for the most part - be answered.  bumping away  Question: why is this not on /x/?  <br>because its /b/<br>/b/ accepts all</br></br>  How exactly do they function and What are the best ways to avoid them  Who do they generally target and why?  <br>Other native here. I'll watch for the most part and occasionally give my tribes 2 cents when and where i can.</br>  <br>they attack people far from civilization normally, groups in woods, hiking ect. if you are the type to do that, theres no trick or talisman or anything like that to avoid them</br>  Sup from last thread. just hanging out i suppose.  <br>Yeah I do, how full of shit do you have to be to believe in them?<br><br>Because I'm pretty gullible, and also full of shit..<br>I could really do with some nonsense in my life because this whole "witch" thing is really falling out of fashion these days</br></br></br></br>  How do you become one?  <br>I second this. I'm sure some /b/tards have a better imagination than I do, so they'll ask questions I've never even thought about.</br>  <br>Why is talking about skin walkers taboo?</br>  <br>What are these "skinwalkers" you speak of, and should I expect to sleep tonight after reading your response?</br>  What do skinwalkers actually want to do to you? Why do they want to do that to you? How can you avoid them, and what is best to do when encountering one? Is it possible to make peace with them? Is being with other people safer? Is being in daylight or any light safer?  <br>all i have to say is you dont have to believe in something for it to hurt you.</br>  <br>/x/ has a completely and backwards ass view of what skinwalkers are and its complete saturation of that view makes it hard to have actual decent conversations on it.</br>  <br>If you manage to skin 2 victims in a day, would you call your tribe to check the dubs ?</br>  How do they breed? Do the live/hunt in packs? Also if they do breed, what is their life expectancy?  what do they want?<br>why do they do stuff?<br>what do you do to attract their attention?<br>what do you do to NOT attract their attention?<br>what do you do to get them to go the fuck away?<br>how do you kill it?<br>how do you eat it?<br>How do you do, sir?<br>how do stop yourself from eating it?<br>How can you tell what is what about them?<br>What exactly do they do and how are they menacing?<br>What are their general actions against people?<br>Can they be stopped? <br>Can they be killed?<br>Can I go to the bathroom?<br>May I go to the bathroom?<br>What should one do if face to face with one?<br>What should one do if they know about them(who they really are)<br>Can you at least depower them?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>if you talk about them to outsiders, it can anger them, they may attack you, the outside you spoke too, or even your familly</br>  <br>Not the guys answering questions, but this is what convinced me. Not to mention it's a huge staple of Native American lore and lore the world over - just different names.</br>  <br>And im assuming theyre also browsing 4chan and tracing my ip address as we speak?</br>  <br>Propriety tribal knowledge and talking in depth makes you a target.</br>  Can they mimic human speech? Can they somehow be tamed? What can a person or a group pf people do to fight them? Also how do they hide their tracks/existence/shit?  <br>so are you malevolent? Seeing as you are talking about them over the internet which is seen by not only posters but just plane old noncontributing lurkers as well? Or is internet ok and you are a pretty cool guy?<br>also this </br></br>  <br>Also, I'm going up to geogia with my family to a cabin we rented for a week. Shouldnt really be here lol. Luckily we are visiting family afterwards so if we go missing they will look.<br><br><br>talking about it can make you shunned by your friends and family on native American land. Because by speaking about it, especially with outsiders, its believed you can bring the wrath of the skin walker on yourself, the one you talked about it with, and even sometimes your close family. Talking about it with an outsider is like talking about the Jewish family hiding in your basement to an SS officer...<br><br>What a anon in last thread said.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you /navajo/?</br>  <br>this!</br>  <br>they are magic.</br>  <br>Now I'm not OP or one of the Lore Experts, but I believe in the last thread they said they were humans and became them by practicing evil or something, think of " a witch doctor gone bad" ( or if you are old enough, the "bad medicine" episode from kolchak)</br>  <br>honestly i doubt any of you are in danger, i may be, but honestly i dont care anymore<br><br><br>thanks for copy pasting it for me, saves me the trouble haha</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>falling out of fashion...<br>"...Maps used to say there'd be dragons here..."<br><br>not everything that sounds like a fairytail is bullshit, and now you need to look for the dragons yourself</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do they just know or are they lurking this thread?</br>  <br>thx for response.</br>  <br>skin walkers are evil beings, they kill because the can, or they take over your body. avoiding them is as simple as not straying too far from large amounts of people, if you encounter one then leave, they normally dont go far from there chosen homes. daytime they are normally less active, but be wary of animals who attack without warning, it may be a skinwalker</br>  <br>Fair enough<br>Can you answer me this?<br>Who was the first skin walker?</br></br></br>  I'm going to try my hand at a simple greentext here.<br><br> be me in 2004 <br> Going to boarding school for various reasons <br> behind my dorm there's a creepy ass forest that goes on for a long while <br> at least 70 miles of trees and shit <br> No one owns the land but the Appalachian trail is nearby so there's plenty of small foot trails <br> boring saturday afternoon <br> tired of sitting around in my room all day <br> don't feel like trying to make friends with the faggoty rich kids that also go to school <br> decide in my naivety to go for a walk in the woods <br> Whatcouldpossiblygowrong.png <br> Put on boots and coat, grab a water bottle and a cliff bar <br> There's a small gravel road that I follow for some time before diverging on one of the trails <br> just keep going for some time and enjoy the mood <br> Hike for what feels like half an hour <br> Suddenly getting a little foggy. nothing serious but enough to be a little spooky <br> twenty minutes later I hear the weirdest sound ever <br> Like silent hill or some shit a siren in the distance goes off <br> very faint and hard to hear <br> Sets me on edge <br> decide that I've gone deep enough and turn back </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>well, I can see you've clearly done your research anon</br>  <br> sun it getting blocked by clouds and setting at the same time <br> didn't bring a flashlight, wasn't thinking that I would be out that long <br> take a while to trace my steps backward <br> getting pretty dark and everything is getting grey <br> I guess I'm about ten minutes of hiking away from my dorms <br> finally stop daydreaming about shit to notice that everything is very quiet <br> just the leaves crunching under my boots and my breathing <br> start to pick up my pace, fear clenching at my stomach <br> its farily dark around this time combination of fog and clouds has made it hard to see <br> On the gravel road back to the dorms <br> Some part of me just seems to know that something is behind me <br>  its matching my footsteps or some shit so I can't hear it but I know its there <br> Don't turn around because that when the pounce atleast to my knowledge <br> See the dorms through the trees <br> Nearly piss my pants in growing terror <br> Instincts take over and I bolt <br>  I can hear something behind me <br>  I sprint all the way to the dorms and throw myself inside <br>  Look outside and see a faint shadow of something outside running away <br><br>Thats all I got.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> What do skinwalkers actually want to do to you? <br>Kill you. <br> Why do they want to do that to you? <br>Why does a serial killer kill?<br> How can you avoid them, and what is best to do when encountering one? <br>Stay away from areas that aren't populated heavily. When encountering one run away as fast as possible and shout something like "i know who you are"<br> Is it possible to make peace with them? <br>No. <br> Is being with other people safer? <br>Might make you less likely to be targeted but other than that no. <br> Is being in daylight or any light safer? <br>No.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the first skin walkers were witches who preformed a twisted evil "sing". "sings" are a way medicine men used to heal, the twisted "sing" is a way to curse and harm</br>  <br>You don't gotta believe in knives for them to cut you.</br>  <br>This made me decide to post my shit from last thread. cause why not. for new ppl. Not too scary</br>  <br>i wasn't the expert either, but i read his last post stating they were once healers turned corrupted. Sounds like Naguals or Mexican Brujer√≠as whos counter parts are called Curanderos.</br>      <br>They are solitary humans with possibly someone who taught them the bad ways or they were taught the right way and pervered it.</br>    <br>They tend to just know. Like it marks you somehow.</br>  What the fuck is a skinwalker??  <br>Does reading this information make us prone to their attacks? Are we in danger for merely knowing?</br>  why is taking a shit so enjoyable?  Can anyone post more spooky greentext?  <br>Because toilets are wizardry</br>  Someone left a debit card at my work. What's the best way to use it for myself?  Bump  <br><br>Amazon</br></br>  <br>Not be a piece of shit.<br>destroy it, don't be an asshole man</br></br>  <br>Not an option</br>  <br>How do i use the card without the billing address?</br>  Use it on an atm that doesnt have cameras and fast, dont want them to call it in missing ;)  <br>how do i use a credit card without it being traced back? what if i only have the numbers? buy bitcoin with it?</br>  <br>I don't have their pin</br>  Basically OP is a massive faggot who can't do anything  <br>Then you're fucked. It will be traced, and the store will do everything to identify you because they will have to eat the loss. The credit card companies don't care and always make the store pay for it if they can't find out who did it,</br>  <br>If it's a visa, you just get the expiry and last digits on the card and you can buy whatever you want. I'd set up an amazon account to sell yourself something worth the amount of money you want from the card. Then you get cash without leaving your address.</br>  Why the fuck did u ruin Dave Grand?!!! He was one of the best Nirvana vocalist!!!  If it doesn't have a pay wave kind of thing you'd probably be just as well off returning it. Otherwise it's useless.  <br>Crack it in half longways, insert into anus.</br>  <br> go to strip club <br> use card to slide in slut butts <br> ???? <br> profit </br></br></br></br>  <br> no pin <br>Nothing. Not trying to be a moralfag but without the pin you might as well destroy it.</br></br>  If one had a credit rather than a debit card, what, theoretically, would be the best way to extract cash?  <br>go anywhere that will give you cash back</br>  <br> get cash <br>get feds...idiot</br></br>  How come Americans prefer Credit Card over debit? Not trying to be racist here but it seems like nobody even has debit cards over there. <br><br>Except OP but he's a fag.</br></br>  <br>because you dont actually need to have money available to use a credit card. debit cards must have some type of funds in the bank account to use</br>  <br> 2 things <br><br>1 I meant money or something that would easily translate into money.<br><br>2 I think only debit cards give cash back at register, no?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes i am aware but how come you guys dont' use them? <br><br>I use Europe as comparison; Basically, 99.99999999% of the people have debit cards and only a very small dragondildo buying minority owns credit cards. I really wonder why there is such a difference. D o you guys get more ads or something?</br></br></br>  <br>i honestly think its just the fact that people dont wanna have to load their card/account to use it. with the credit card you just use it and pay what you owe at the end of the month, we americunts are lazy niggers, you should know that</br>  <br>Are you a nigger because you're sure acting like one.</br>  <br>at walmart the machines ask if you want cash back even if you use a credit card</br>  <br>the best?</br>  <br>You are on the wrong site then if something like this offends you.<br>Do you scream mods for every thread?</br></br>  <br>Yes i know but holy shit credit card companies shouldn't be able to take advantage of Americans like that.</br>  <br>THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST</br>  <br>Think your figures are slightly off, from UK here, think about 30% have cc, dunno about europoors tho</br>  <br> take advantage of americans <br>thats literally the primary objective of every company in america</br></br>  <br> Not knowing the difference between a debit and a credit card </br>  <br>I don't think offend is quite the correct word also just because I'm on /b/ doesn't mean I can have an opinion or suddenly forget my morals.</br>  Reaction thread        how many inches would you say this cock is?<br>and would you suck it?</br>  I need minxy nudes /b/ros. I need it.  Bumo  she is kill i can conform      What do atheists live for?  well atleast you decided to use a new pic this time  THE LAW  <br>What do christians die for?</br>  dank<br><br>memes</br></br>  The new season of Rick and Morty.  <br>CRIME AND HATRED AND THE BLOOD OF WHITE BABIES</br>  <br>dank wubs</br>  When will this gay shit end?  <br><br><br>What we choose to live for. It's very different from your sad circular theology logic. <br><br>We don't paint the world up in imaginary colors/stories, we just see it for what it is, accept it, and live for what we choose is important to us. That could mean family, careers, friends, hobbies, interests, whatever the fuck we choose. When we kick the bucket, we kick the bucket. We you die, its no different then looking at a dead bird or dog on the side of the road, when you're dead, you're dead. No use wishing for more. In fact, acceptance to "what is" makes life more enjoyable, like taking a fresh breath of air everyday. It has its own rewards that aren't made in fantasy.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>either when christians stop being so butthurt at being on the wrong side of history or when atheists stop wearing fedoras and being so easily trolled</br>  <br>so... never</br>  <br>Every Crusade after the first one</br>  laughing at how hard people try to troll us like this  <br><br>Exactly. Nobody ever falls for it.</br></br>  I feel that the meaning of life is found in the great moments that we have on a day to day basis. You know, like a great meal, the warmth of a summer day or the way the woods look after it has snowed....the feeling of when youre in someones arms. Out of the billions of people, our experiences are meaningless. To ourselves they are priceless. Its these thoughts that keep me from being depressed!  pussy  Dopamine. I do a lot of drugs.  <br>They live for that question</br>  <br>That and that there is no heaven or god</br>  <br>To become Christians</br>  <br>That's actually pretty deep, anon.</br>  <br>Grounded anon</br>  Answer: Desire<br><br><br>Keep it in your religious support groups, coward</br></br></br>  <br>i live for my self</br>  <br>Black cock</br>  It doesn't mean anything faggots. You're all just star stuff. As infinitesimally probable collection of cosmic shit that got ripped out of nonexistence into this body and mind.

To witness the death and suffering of religious people.  <br>I find living as a slave, prostrated and groveling for mercy before some vile and vengeful desert-kike war-godhead, to be the sadder of the existences my good anon. I prefer a life of dignity. Dignity doesn't come cheap, and living without a rulebook is difficult and wracked with uncertainty. You are forced to stand up and decide for yourself what is right and wrong in the ugly gray area that is life, and it can be hard sometimes. But it is an authentic existence.</br>  <br>For the glory of Satan</br>  Anything but God  <br>of course.</br>  <br>Suck black cock</br>  To be honest, would a creator not accept his children for not believing in him? And if you flip that.. Would you want to join someone who did?  <br>That's fucking gay dude.<br>Enjoy getting assfucked by demons while I'm chilling with Jesus in my mansion. Think about it! Does it not stagger the imagination? No builder on earth can concieve any structure to compare to the mansions above. Won't that be something when you go to live in your own mansion? There'll be no concern about paying for it, it's already taken care of. There'll be no worry about being moved out of it. It will be yours forever."</br></br>  <br>Suck big black cock</br>  <br>The odds are almost very statistically impossible.

Could also be a complete anomaly. <br> Common life sure that seems like it would just take the right chemical composition and the right environment. <br> Advanced intelligent life past that of the common animal. Now that is strange and unusual. </br></br></br>    Dick.  <br>Why would I recognize that kind of shit, I'm White, but I'm not white trash.</br>  <br>/b/ is dead. It died years ago.<br>Now that I think of it was around the time of boxxy...</br></br>  <br>you are contributing to it</br>  <br> implying I've ever listened to their music </br>  Why do atheists always answer with a question or insult?<br>They're probably lashing out here because they can't when their teacher gets mad at them for being retarded.</br>  <br>Sex and drugs</br>  <br>see <br> , <br>you tremendous faggotface</br></br></br>  <br>It is a complete anomaly. But so is a light on Ceres, or a mound of dust on the moon, or a storm on Jupiter. They're all anomalies, and equally radical when you look at them through a cosmic lens.</br>  If there is a god, he's probably gonna let all the atheists in and not the religious people. Think about it.. if you were god, would you invite the butt lickers or the honest people?  <br>Being able to have sex before marriage</br>  <br>see</br>  <br>Nothing. They just live.</br>  They dont' know, every atheist philosopher wonders about the meaning of life.<br>We christians instead believe that the meaning of life is to live with a meaning, to take consciousness of our role in the God's Creation.</br>  <br>What is our role?</br>  <br>Didnt know about ceres. That is interesting.<br>Also would have to be a pretty big cosmic lens to look it that way instead of an individual basis. Pretty fascinating point of view.</br></br>  <br>Life</br>  <br>No, you fucking faggot. Try not to ad-hom and put up an actual fucking argument for once.<br><br>Fucking. See. </br></br></br>  <br><br>Also the way you mentioned that simply implies that every piece or atom in this universe and every configuration is an anomaly. Which is absolutely true but I was saying that the more advanced configurations seem even more unlikely than the first. Than again if almost everything is unlikely than it throws any statistics or probabilities out the window.</br></br>  Why you need to live for something ? Or Somebody ? Is it an obligation ? Something written on very old book ? Personally I live to build something with my life. I'm married and I have a 6 months old baby, 2 cats... I want to build a family, and I'm happy doing so. I don't know if god exist and I don't care, the only thing I care about is my own code of living which is respect other people, respect the nature and all living things, be strong, be kind, help as much as you can the one in need. Be brave and be there for your family, provide for them...  <br>the text really doesn't make it justice, find a video of it. shit's cash</br>  <br>Trips confirm.<br><br>I, personally, live to experience things and gain information and insight. I love meeting different people and acquiring different skills.</br></br></br>  <br>the destruction of the church, the demolishment of all their buildings and the torture and execution of all religious people as a sacrifice to our atheist god</br>  <br>You're just answering my question with insults.</br>  A reading from the books of Bokonon:<br><br>In the beginning, God created the earth, and he looked upon it in His cosmic loneliness.<br><br>And God said, "Let Us make living creatures out of mud, so the mud can see what We have done." And God created every living creature that now moveth, and one was man. Mud as man alone could speak. God leaned close as mud as man sat up, looked around, and spoke. Man blinked. "What is the purpose of all this?" he asked politely.<br><br>"Everything must have a purpose?" asked God.<br><br>"Certainly," said man.<br><br>"Then I leave it to you to think of one for all this," said God.<br><br>And He went away.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I dont think anyone fully grasps what any of this is about. Those who have doubts believe there is no purpose those who hope believe there is a purpose. Those who are wise simply admit they dont know. Hey at least its a good starting point?</br>  bump  <br>No, there are those who are weak and must have a purpose somebody else made up to guide them and there are those who are willing to walk the difficult path of the autonomous individual and find their own purpose, if any, along the way.</br>  I'd kill myself but I don't want my grandma to be sad.  <br> implying you didn't blatant ad-hom and i called you out on it <br><br>I'm going to be slightly ironic for a second and tell you to fucking kill yourself. You are worthless.</br></br></br>  <br>you have truly transcended</br>  <br>Sex, drugs, rock &amp; roll; all the good shit.</br>  <br>Totally agree with you !</br>  <br>Pride and ego is a double edged sword. You are right in the fact that it gives you strength but also for the fact that it gives a false sense of superiority over those who hope for something greater. What you are saying is both right and wrong as some people are weak and need the help and some people are already strong and it makes them stronger. How is this any different from a mighty sword on the battle field? All I was saying those who are wise dont hope nor doubt they just simply are.</br>  <br>No I agree, some require it and that's the result of a mixture of biology and social dysfunction/anachronism than any implicit failing in the individual who needs it to get by. I'd rather an alcoholic have AA than endanger themselves and others by being an alcoholic all the time, even if AA is a cult. At least a third of the population is extremely susceptible to hypnosis and probably more exhibit latent authoritarian tendencies (the follower variety.)

It's changing frequency and volume because of the changes in air pressure, temperature, etc. Or it could be a loose piece of wood that's being knocked around by the A/C or whatever. Or maybe it's a demon that's tapping from inside your walls, waiting for you to open the walls and release it. No biggie.</br>  <br>Oh and this was just some weird thing I saw as a kid.</br>  <br>Fuck wild boars, those things are the meanest motherfuckers you'll ever meet, at least in Texas<br>They'll charge you for looking at them the wrong way</br></br>  <br>This image has been around for year, and you expect me to believe you were the one that took it?</br>  <br>I'm on /b/ why would I lie?</br>  <br>Damn</br>  While reading these skinwalker stories, some animal made a creepy fucking shrieking bark noise outside my window several times just now. Fuck that.  <br>Oh anon I have something for you</br>  <br>God I hate these stories but I told a friend about them and want to show him so I'm reading them now. Fuck sleep, im gonna be up all night now man.</br>  <br><br>FUCK this gave me chills</br></br>  I love innawoods stories  Bump  Bamp  Wait, so are skinwalkers actually real then? I feel as though this is some huge /k/onspiracy to fuck with the minds of idiots like me.  <br>There's some weird shit out there</br>  <br>there have been legends of them for a very long time in different native american tribes, its not something made up by /k/, its been here alot longer then that</br>  <br>what are they even supposed to be?</br>  <br>I believe it was originally a Navajo tale. Maybe another tribe. But its been around forever. Whatever the case it's fucking creepy.</br>  <br>One book I read said they were old gods that got greedy and stayed on earth when the other gods left. Altered over time into pure evil. But the story was a work of fiction and I haven't dug much into them.</br>  <br>Originally it was a Native American legend of a creature that could shapeshift into humans or other creatures</br>  <br>the navajo believed them to be evil spirits who could take the form of man or beast, attacking those who trespassed on there land, they could mimic noises and voices, but they couldnt take a form perfectly, in an animal form there eyes would be black and non-reflective, in human form they couldnt move fluidly like us and there eyes would be animialistic</br>  <br>skinwalker stories come from Windigo lore i think</br>  <br><br>Going off what I said, the book also said the tribes didnt talk about them much because they never knew whether the person they talked to was a skinwalker itself.</br></br>  <br><br><br>I saw a thread on Reddit(inb4 hurr durr reddit fag; someone here linked it) that was an AMA with a true Native American, and he attested wholeheartedly to skinwalkers being a thing. He said that they were technically humans, but he couldn't get into the specifics and lore and shit because it was a tribe secret of some sort passed down exclusively in the tribe, and also it was kind of taboo to speak of it. So there I still was kind of skeptical, but after seeing all these /k/ threads of perfectly rational people talking about this stuff, well, I don't want to be anywhere near the Mojave or California any time in my life.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>holy shit. Good thing I live in mid-western texas</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>By the way, does anyone think my stories are worth reposting? I probably will anyways, but I would like an opinion. I can't tell them as well as my old scoutmaster, havent heard them in a long time.<br><br><br><br>Yea no kidding.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>in native american tribes it is one of the most taboo things you can do, to speak of them to outsiders, because it could bring the wrath of the evil spirits to you and to those you spoke too. My tribe is no different, we are not support to speak about it<br><br><br>also, its not just the Navajo who know of them, multable tribes across America have stories about them or being just like them</br></br></br></br>   The stories and information posted here are artistic works of fiction and falsehood. <br>Only a fool would take anything posted here as fact.<br>This is true.. R-right guys?</br></br>  <br>If what you say it true, I completely understand your position. I know a few older native americans, they are serious about their culture and secrecy. <br><br>And, I don't know why I feel like saying this or if it appropriate, but, May the stars watch over and guide you from about, the ground stay firm and steady beneath you, and your path be ever strait and clear. <br><br>I feel like a nerd.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>if you dont believe whats written here, google it, skinwalker stories are not just on 4chan or reddit</br>  <br>I dunno, the one with the couple on the street in the middle of satan-ville is pretty damn convincing</br>  <br>Just out of curiosity, what tribe are you in? I always find authentic Native American culture fascinating. Would have loved to see it naturally develop without us having fucked everything up centuries ago.</br>  <br><br>So much truth can be found if you dig on 4chan <br>  is it true <br>  or fake </br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, as we said, the skinwalker stories have been around for hundreds of years. They may not be real but I will not lie to you. These people believed in these beings.</br>  <br>nerdiness is ok in context haha<br><br><br>id rather not go into too much detail, and i agree to a degree about our culture, but at the same time it would be hypocritical to say i dont like the world as it is, sitting in my house with ac and internet, talking to you /b/ros...</br></br></br></br>  <br>what actually are skinwalker stories? a specific set or kind or...</br>  Not as creepy, but it's a story.<br><br> be me <br> around a few months ago <br> watching some YouTube at night <br> neighbor's dogs start barking <br> notice the light is on in my front yard (imagine those lights that turn on when you get near) <br> see a cat just sitting there <br> think nothing of it, but check on it every few minutes or so <br> on third check the cat just starts looking at me <br> it wouldn't stop staring at me no matter what <br> look away for a second and it vanishes <br> what the fuck <br> hear a meow next to my window <br> it's standing right next to the fucking window on the roof (i live upstairs) <br> scream like a bitch and fall over <br> cat is gone when I look back <br> don't sleep for the rest of the night <br><br>It's still creeps me out because of the cat's stare.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You might as well post them about. Might not be the best but they add to the atmosphere</br>  <br>Yea well luckily I can change what I think before I talk. That is how my thoughts grow. Along that line, but I don't alter my speech as much on here.</br>  <br>nah agar.io is the actual game site, agor.io is just for anyone who misspells it or gets tricked into typing it just cause it's so similar</br>  <br> Would you go first? <br>better than getting shot and dying like a lil bitch</br></br>  <br>i just meant stories involving skinwalkers in general. The idea behind them has been around for centuries, long before 4chan or reddit got ahold of them and made them more well known</br>  <br>I don't mean culture as in reverting back 600 years and dealing with old technology. Embracing current tech is great lol. It's just that here we had an entire sect of people who grew, adapted, and evolved separately from the East and had their own beliefs, lore, religions, societal structures, language, technology, values, etc. and we completely stopped its development. It's akin to meeting an emerging intelligent species on another planet - one that is beginning to form societies and whatnot - and just annihilating them for our own development. It's stupid. It would be incredible to see what it would be today if it stayed entirely intact.</br>  By the way, any of you try explaining this shit to friends? I tried to tell one of my friends about skinwalkers while we were walking around a park at night, but I am pretty sure I just sounded like a wimp. I'm typically not good at retelling stories that are not mine, get too stuck on details that I get wrong.  <br>Cats can jump incredibly high.</br>  <br>fuck off</br>  <br>in that aspect i agree with you, yes it would have been interesting to see how the native americans grew and matured as a separate civilization from others.</br>  <br>I got that, but what stories are skinwalkers? The stories about people that aren't really "them" like a thing that takes their form?</br>  <br>What I thought of.</br>  <br>nice try satan</br>  <br>Basic premise is<br> X enters woods or secluded area alone or with Y friends <br> creepy shit goes down. <br> unnatural shit <br> shit that makes primal, animalistic, fight or flight "I'm going to be killed if I don't act" fear surface <br> either X has contact with weird not-quite-human but human acting humanoid or <br> Y gets lost and comes back. Y is acting strange, not quite fitting in or being themselves, and wants to get someone alone with them <br> fucking skinwalkers, man. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>more or less what he said yeah</br>  <br>Part of the mystery of skinwalkers(to an outsider), is not knowing what it is. So you have to think for yourself about what the story had in it.<br><br>Actually im not sure what your asking. What are the characterizations of skinwalker stories?<br><br>What are skinwalkers like? <br><br>How to tell whether a story has one in it? can you explain more?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck yeah love it</br>  <br>had a similar experience back in high school<br> mom forced me to take this week long sailing trip from one tip of the US coast to the other <br> different groups take turns watching over the ship every day, on this day I got stuck with the shitty midnight-4am night shift <br> me and some chick are sitting in the middle of the deck, chatting and looking at the stars <br> notice one star moving around in the sky, while all the rest around it are perfectly still <br> almost as if it's on a path, it will go forward and then change directions and keep going <br> ask the chick and she says she sees it too so pretty sure I didn't imagine it <br>at the time I was 100% sure it was some kinda UFO but thinking back maybe that star was much closer than the others so it was affected by the ship's movement or something, if that's even possible</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Naw nigga fuck that shit.</br>  <br>I'm new to spooky things and such. I didn't know how to tell a skinwalker story from a different kind of spooky story. But I think I do now.</br>  <br><br>Didn't mention the distance.<br>My house holds a long-ish driveway with the house being a meter or two away. It was around the start of it. It would've had to run, jump onto the roof, and then zigzag all the way to my window, which is to the far left of the window I mentioned, in 3 seconds before meowing. Must be a fast cat. The only reason I mentioned the story was because the fucking stare it gave me was eerie. It felt like eye contact instantly. Still probably nothing, it gave me a spook.</br></br></br>  Does anyone else feel safer when touchin their cat or dog?  <br>Yea that sounds similar. But I wasn't moving. I would say yours was a satellite but it changed course. I dunno.</br>    <br>sleep tight kitter.</br>  <br>basically <br>there are examples on this thread like : /k/ dude goes inna woods with sks and glock, hears screaming, goes to investigate, comes back, (ohshititsraining.jpg), sees dude over his smoldering fire acting weird, tries to talk with him, runs, thing chases him and screams like what he heard a while ago, gets to road, sees a humanoid figure in the woods, car comes, it goes away. <br>Shit like this, but this thread scared me shitless so I'm not going to read through them and link you to the exact one</br></br></br>  <br>My dog died around a month ago. :( gotta bring u down...<br><br>But I always did. I miss her.</br></br></br>  &lt;-- is the native American who was answering questions before<br>i myself have never seen or experienced a skin walker, but i have spoken to some elders who say they have, when they speak about it they always have a look of genuine fear in there eyes. It is because of that fear that i genuinely believe in there existence and why i started to study the lore of not only my own tribe, but most of the native American tribes and other cultures around the world. One of the more troubling things i found is how many cultures around the world have evil spirits or demons who act and are described in a VERY close way to skin walkers.</br>  <br>It's always freaky to talk to someone who legitimately gets afraid by mentioning something.</br>  <br>it was pretty bizarre, seemed to be making deliberate movements in various directions. plus with how far away it appeared and how fast it was moving across the sky I imagine it would have had to been going at enormous speeds</br>  <br>Malignant sorcerers with the ability to take the form of other people or animals.</br>    <br> decide to head in the direction I heard the scream <br>fucking hell why do this</br></br>  <br>one example is the irish believe in "witches" who could shape shift into hares and other animals, but itself it doesnt sound so similler, except that the original native american stories say the first skin walkers were witches who preformed "wicked sing" a perversion of a good "sing" used to heal, a "wicked sing" was to hurt or kill. and doing so would eventually turn the witch into a skin walker</br>  <br>I would have noped the fuck out of there. White people....</br>  <br>Yea. I may have written my experience off, except like what you said it was moving deliberately, and kept dissapearing and reappearing lower in a pattern.<br><br>like so<br><br> ----------- ----------&gt;* <br><br> --------------------------&gt;* <br><br> ------------- ----------&gt;* <br><br> ----------------------------&gt;* <br><br> -----------------------------&gt;* <br>(Asterisk is where it dissapeared, first arrow is where it started again.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Breaks were supposed to be longer, 4chan shortened them. Oh well, you get the idea.</br>  <br> Does anyone else feel safer when touchin their cat or dog? <br><br>sicko</br></br></br>  <br>fucking aliens man, stars are the perfect disguise too when you think about it</br>  <br>What is highlighted in the pic?</br>  <br>Mmmm...I don't believe that. Probably some scientific thing. Too tired. Didn't even consider that your post may be a joke, I dont know too out of it.</br>  <br><br>This is actually a lot more information than I've ever gotten about the subject, and you're not the first Native American I've talked to about it. Thank you so much man.<br><br>Just how taboo IS this subject? The holocaust was discussed more freely than this.</br></br></br></br>  <br>From what i heard, incredibly. Not a NA, but its supposed to be bad luck and dangerous to talk about it.</br>  <br>talking about it can make you shunned by your friends and family on native American land. Because by speaking about it, especially with outsiders, its believed you can bring the wrath of the skin walker on yourself, the one you talked about it with, and even sometimes your close family. Talking about it with an outsider is like talking about the Jewish family hiding in your basement to an SS officer...</br>    <br><br>That's ridiculous. As I've seen mentioned many times in this thread:<br> fucking skinwalkers </br></br></br>  <br> storys </br>  <br>All of my skinwalker knowledge comes from /x/ and /k/, but they intrigue the fuck out of me. When you really think about it, skinwalkers combine a few things that fuck with people. Betrayal, as in you never know who might actually be a skinwalker until it's too late. Paranoia, given than any one person could be one. The unknown, since they may or may not be out there. The random victim selection of a psycho killer, given that skinwalkers don't pick you out of a group for any real reason. From all the stories I've read, hardly anyone ever kills one, they just force it away. By far the scariest part is putting yourself into the shoes of a victim that a skinwalker impersonates, though. You just up and disappear, and once it starts interacting as you, people just assume you're being weird.<br><br>In short, better load up on white ash and nugget food.</br></br></br>  <br>It's what they believe.<br><br>If you were told this since birth, or had thought you saw one for yourself, would you go around talking about them?</br></br></br>  <br>damn that's crazy.</br>  <br>I don't mean literally ridiculous, as in worthy of ridicule. I meant more the colloquial "profound" or "incredible."<br>After seeing all this stuff, I believe them.</br></br>  too prove my point about how serious native Americans normally are about talking about this...  <br>holy fuck</br>  &lt;-- native American guy<br>also, theres a storm coming down pretty hard at my house, i may vanish due to power/internet cutting out</br>  <br>Should we round up all the /k/ommandos and /x/enophobes and go on a skinwalker hunt in the Mojave desert?</br>  <br>Brave guy. communicating with that man.<br><br><br>Where do you live? Generally, like what state?</br></br></br></br>  <br> grandma was on a date <br>grandma gettin the D</br></br>  <br>I would read what happens.</br>  <br>they are not just in that area, they are far more wide spread then that</br>  <br>I'd imagine the thread will probably be dead pretty soon anyway. But thanks for your input and knowledge and everything man. It's been very helpful. Also for even speaking about it with us, given the nature of the taboo of discussing it with outsiders.</br>  <br>oh jesus thats creepy...<br><br>anon is gon get nabbed by a skin walker for ratting out on it</br></br></br>  https://<span>youtu.be/wBQVXfVjBtk  [ ]  <br>it wasnt me who wrote that, i just found it while researching skin walkers. I currently live in NY (didn't always) and i dont live on native American lands, which is one of the main reasons i feel coftable enough to speak about these things</br>  <br> nice try skinwalker </br>  <br>if anyone wants too make a new thread about it il continue to talk about it as much as i can. These beings are real, and a threat to everyone, not just native Americans.</br>  <br>I didnt say it was you. just given the nature of the legends it seems risky to do that.</br>  <br>Something along the lines of "400 mutilated corpses discovered in desert. One survivor. Likely suffering from PTSD due to the event, as they barely speak and seem a bit off. They were taken into police custody and will be treated at the local hospital before being questioned."<br>*another story 2 days later*<br>"Hospital staff murdered. Culprit unknown."</br></br></br>  <br>god thats freaky. I want to but I dont.</br>  <br>didnt think through my words choices, i wasnt implying you had said it was me, just clarifying in case anyone thought it was. My bad</br>  <br><br>I agree with that guy, thanks, its an interesting and creepy topic that isn't usually discussed. Also checked and sure.</br></br>  <br>You forgot. "Approximately 1400 weapons were found and whole trucks full of ammunition. Bullets covered the area."</br>  <br>*Squinty eyes gif*</br>  <br>(|_|)<br>not good at emots haha</br></br>  <br>Evil evil things that take various forms. Native here. Can't say much as they brings them about. Each tribe has its own legends but the scary bit is other than ways of killing them its all pretty much the same stories across the board which isn't found in many other stories. Navajo take that shit deathly seriously and even had a major trial related to them which lead to a life sentence of one. They don't take the form of others like the pasta's say. They take and wear the skins of animals for there strength. They can wear many skins at the same time making weird and crude amalgamations. Best bet is to act surprised and shout "i know who you are!" Or something similar. Won't kill them but it could either buy time or make them run. If you legit want to know more try a native that was raised traditionally and is off rez. Rez natives will NEVER talk fully about it cause its considered sacred and proprietary knowledge just like most bits of our culture and even mentioning it will get you run off cause you will either bring them down OR you possibly could be one yourself.</br>  <br>nice to see another native whos willing to speak about it, even a little.<br>&lt;-- is first native American who was talking</br></br>  <br>Navajo/hopi... if you ever want to know if their a real rez native bring up skinwalkers and if they have a look of fear on thier face then you have genuine rez native</br>  I'm gonna be up the entire night now.  <br>Im the guy whos talking about skin walkers and breaking taboos by doing so while a large thunderstorm rages outside -_-</br>  <br>Its 4:17 here, didn't expect to have a no sleep thread to actually make me not sleep. Shit.</br>  <br>its coming for you.</br>  <br> ways of killing them <br>HOW? This seems like knowledge of the utmost importance.</br></br>  <br>3:19 here. I have yet to be that scared.</br>  I'm terrified, I live in Oregon and go camping a lot. I've never experienced one but I suffer extreme anxiety and parinoia so now I'm very scared.  Good thread. Gonna go fap now so I can sleep.  <br>sadly this world really has things that go bump in the night...sorry to be the one to break that news too you</br>  <br>5:19 for me.<br><br><br>damn man. I dont know what to say. be safe i guess.</br></br></br></br>  Moar stories<br>So are skin walkers literally just indians with animal pelts on their back?<br>What dictates what they can turn into and what keeps them from constantly attacking people?<br><br>Also on a related note<br>Who or what is the goatman?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>what do you know about skin walker ranch?</br>  The skinwalkers can't get me if I don't go to sleep, right anons?  <br>This is the goatman.<br/></br>  <br>As both, I'm totally in support of this. I'd be down for innadesert.</br>  What do skin walkers want to do to you? Do they just wanna kill you? Why? What is the best way to defend yourself or get the fuck out? Is being with more people better? Is being in daylight better?  <br>6:22 here. The sun is up.</br>  <br>thats my plan</br>  the storm is quieting for now, if someone makes a new thread il continue to answer questions as best as i can, i dont know everything, but i know a bit more then most<br><br>skin walkers were originally witches who practiced the "witchery way" using corrupted versions of a "sing" which normally was used to cure, there version was used to curse, they turned into skin walkers eventually</br></br>  <br>Did you check the possible aftermath?<br><br/></br></br>  <br>Yea thats where i read about it<br>But what is it?</br></br>  <br>You are still fucked either way. I'd say if you went to sleep, atlleast you wouldn't have died scared shitless.</br>  <br>sure smells like summer around here.</br>  the smell of bullshit is strong in this thread<br><br>I know this becuse I am a psychic, jeffrey</br></br>  <br>not too much actually, other then the basics you can learn through wikipedia</br>  <br>First time on this kind of thread<br>Im usually asleep by 12 but for obvious reasons im on here now</br></br>  <br>cool thx. Just heard odd things about it from, yes go ahead an laugh, Ground Zero with Clyde Lewis and maybe Art Bell. George is too accepting of everything though.</br>  <br>Seems like another skinwalker story, but with different twists.</br>  <br> put happy songs on repeat <br> put comedian stand up on repeat <br> never be afraid again </br></br></br>  When you see it....  <br>i miss when 4chan use to be good...</br>  <br>for a moment i had forgotton this was /b/ board, thanks for reminding me anon</br>  <br>I think it'd be more along the lines of all the /k/omrades killing the /x/philes after one too many propositions of tarot readings or divinations. Afterwards, they'd all get hammered and end up shooting each other. No survivors, just a Jonestown-esque level of bodies.</br>  <br>Good Idea.<br><br>Then i got fuzzy street signs captcha. fuck.</br></br></br>  <br>get out newfag</br>  <br>Aw thats sort of a bummer...<br>Does anyone know of any particularly evil walkers?<br>Past or present?</br></br></br>    <br>Smaller communities are always better. Lets a tradition and personality form. Reddit and tumblr fags ruined it. Also things like dub threads are just a waste of time.<br><br>I'm listening to A thousnad miles right now, it helps.</br></br></br>  <br>Medicine practitioners that perverted the ways for power. Strength and form from skins. Not pelts.</br>  <br>I wouldn't worry about it, anon.</br>  <br>It's impossible to be scared with this playing. I have discovered that tonight. It's too calming.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=HoS<wbr>ldkF9M2E</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>      <br>Its not what you think it is.</br>      <br>That gave me goosebumps. I do not like that.</br>  <br>listening to Bo burnham.

Pelts are treated like leather. SKIN is fresh.</br>  <br>Off topic, seen any native american dances? Used to be in the Order of the Arrow in BSA. Saw some dances there.<br><br>Also, FUCKING STREET SIGNS AGAIN?</br></br></br>  <br>also, there are no wards for skin walkers, and i wonder which culture is more backward assed</br>  <br>Very true. But I enjoy every genre of music, so I typically don't have that problem. I actually listen to classical quite often, if that gives you any indication as to the true magnitude of my faggotry.</br>  <br>Wow, sure nice of slender to solve the captcha and submit your post before raping you.<br><br><br>We could use a new thread but what this one needs is some more greentext screenshots.

Don't know how many people will participate though.<br><br/></br></br>  <br>it happens to us all. Have some soft guro to wake you up.</br>  <br>For some reason my brain just kept reading that as the rotisserie guy.</br>  <br>Oh I know. But we had some native americans who made it closer to the real thing. But I know it would not be the real thing. They sometimes did chants too.</br>  <br>yeah I do<br><br>you know how scottish people take the piss out of foreigners by saying that haggis is a real animal, but they don't like to talk about it because it's a secret...</br></br></br>  <br>Literally 'hey man gimme some tuna'</br>  <br> A bunch of others gays met us there <br> There are some hot ass girls too oh lord <br><br>Too bad they're gay.</br></br></br></br>  <br>spoopy/8</br>  <br>OK I might be stupid but this story doesn't make sense. First of all, i thought they were staying in trailers/campers, but later in the story he mentions a cabin? Also when "Tan" sees the thing come out of the bathroom, he counts 9 people in the cabin. Weren't there 12, including his older cousin?</br>  <br>That's not a fucking joke. It's not like he said Candlejack or anythi</br>  <br>Could have been a wolverine.</br>  Play this fucking game  <br>Most of these stories, except the ones about things changing into peoples friends, sound more like wendigos than skinwalkers. <br>Theyre totally different from each other.</br></br>  <br>what a fucking beast</br>  <br>u cant anymore</br>  <br>I'm still so fucking upset this got cancelled.</br>  <br>too bad it'll never actually come out, and they took the Demo off of the PS store.</br>  <br> M'shadow</br>  <br>sleep tight kitter</br>  <br>hurr durr im so creepy</br>  <br> sauce?</br>  <br>Sleep tight kitter</br>  Think about all these skinwalker threads.<br>These were all people who got away or avoided death from straying away from the pack and getting picked off.<br>How many weren't so lucky?</br></br>  <br>Meat man missed the train v.v</br>  anyone got some more skin walker stories to post, ive just been staying up reading this thread, pretty interesting stuff  <br>there is a reason the native americans fear them so much that just talking about them can get you expelled from the tribe and your familly<br><br>theres another thread<br/></br></br></br>  <br>holy shit , brutal</br>  <br>oh sweet thanks</br>  <br>there's someone living in your walls...</br>  can we have a hot/slutty cosplay thread?              <br>The hover hand is real</br>  <br>"Rape" is in nature of all humans and related mammals.<br>You know its true when you have to put out a public sign.</br></br>    <br>The fuck</br>  <br><br>I see hes cosplaying Beta Dandy</br></br>  RAID TIME /misskittiekat  whos next  <br>Yup. searching</br>  <br>Your mom we're all gonna run a train on her after the raids</br>  New loli bread  <br>It's the first im seeing these, would you happen to have the full set a photos of them?</br>  <br>you can literally find all of this serious via google</br>    /b/, help me.<br><br> be 14 <br> friends with this pretty hot chick <br> start to form a really strong friendship <br> gain feelings for her <br> fuck <br> tell her over the summer <br> shes surprised <br> we talk, i tell her romantic shit <br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/628748616#p628748616">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  ah kids these days...<br><br>Romantic, what are you retarded?
