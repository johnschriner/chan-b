[ Want to know the Truth? Meaning of life? Lost? Want to give up? Do it and humble yourself! Find Jesus our Lord and Savior.  42  <br>Christian here. Nice to know everyone here isnt an edgy atheist. God bless you brother! Remember, faith starts with you.</br>  <br>Sorry, Mithras proselytized me first.</br>  check 'em kike  <br><br>Love is the way. Jesus, our Lord, will never abandon us even in our damned death beds.</br></br>  <br>Illogical athiest believing that just because they cant see it doesn't exist. I guess they dont exist since I cant see what they're really thinking</br>  OP IS AN OP  <br>If he never abandons us, why is hell a thing? You fucking idiot</br>  <br>I'm an atheist, not because I can't see God, but because I see that if this is a world that is ruled by a Creator, then he's a pretty shitty one that allows pain, evil, and suffering to endure. <br><br>What's the point in having an all-powerful God who does not use his power to help those who suffer?<br><br>Whether God does not exist or chooses not to interfere are de facto equivalent conditions under which to live. Having a God who will not help you is more painful to endure than there not being a God at all.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hell is a thing if we abandon Him.</br>  <br>No brother read the Bible it entirely explains everything. If you seek the Truth and righteousness you will find it!<br><br>Understand that following Christ is being selfless and humble. Truly if everyone was a follower there would be no suffering. But the devil is at work and is king of earth.<br><br>He is all powerful and has commanded and proclaimed how to be saved. He is far from the wicked but close to the faithful. <br><br>How can a good president fix a country so to say, but not be elected by its people?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I have read the Bible. That's why I'm an atheist.</br>  <br><br><br>Allow me to share with you my favorite Bible quote.<br><br>"There she lusted after her lovers, whose genitals were like those of donkeys and whose emission was like that of horses." -Ezekiel 23:20</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Truly you have looked at it in self-righteousness. You read it for your own cause. You need to give up your wicked ways essentially. You read it with pride, with discontent and self-concern. Read it humbly and accept Jesus to know what I mean.</br>  <br>It has significance, how about you think about it. Stop reading Bible quotes and read it as a whole. For the Truth with without the complete Truth is a lie.</br>  <br>How do you know how I read it? Were you there you judgmental prick?<br><br>I read it when I was a believer. I grew up being a believer. Reading the Bible and seeing God depicted as a terrible parent, who, if He were human, would have his children taken away from him by Child Protective Services, made me realize that I don't have time for this shit.<br><br>If God exists and is omniscent and omnipresent, then He created me knowing that I would go to Hell. And that's fine with me. I'd rather not spend eternity with a narcissist, especially since I never asked to play this game of life in the first place.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I have read it as a whole.<br><br>Conclusion: I don't believe.</br></br></br>  <br><br> 666 <br><br>Get the behind me, Satan.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The Word says anyone trying to help someone else find Jesus is not judging. Youve been swayed by the devil. Listen to your self. Your god has always been yourself. Want a sign? look at your damn trips</br>  <br>Why don't you pray for me.</br>  <br>You have read it verse by verse. Singling out each once as an individual. Read it with entirety with humility. You need to do what it says to understand it buddy.</br>  <br>Surely I will. But only Jesus can save you.</br>  <br>I did that when I was younger, and a believer, but my 2nd grade education was sufficient to help me see that it was all bullshit.</br>     see<br/>  <br>Best of luck to your and your second grade logic.</br>  <br>You didn't answer me, fuckwit.</br>  <br><br>Yes I did. You just want an answer that is prideful and fulfilling to yourself.</br></br>  <br>No, hell is a real thing, according to your faith. You just said that it isn't as long as people believe in god.</br>  <br>Ok I see. I said it wrong. Hell is a thing for those who abandon Him. Either way its a thing, for whom is what I forgot to include.</br>  <br>I want to get into like Eastern Orthodoxy or something tbh</br>  <br>Why did God give me a brain capable of seeing that He can't exist?<br><br>The simple paradox of, "can God create a stone so large that even He cannot shift it" answers the question sufficiently for me.</br></br></br>  <br>That's quite difficult in these days. You just need to accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior.</br>  <br>What do you mean about difficult? I mean I want to like start reading and getting into it.</br>  <br>Truly you see nothing but the abyss. How can you create a scenario where He exists and doesnt at the same time?<br><br>You cant test God and his Will. Your arguments are all evil anyways your just indulging in lies unknowingly.</br></br></br>  <br>I'll do it in return for getting to fuck Ariel Winter for the rest of my life. If Jesus can arrange it so that I get to suck on her soiled panties every day, I'll worship him.</br>  <br>To live exactly as the disciples and apostles is hard because they werent being swayed by non-believers but merely by abiding by the Lord who they saw in the flesh. It made it easier to believe but harder to live.</br>  <br>You cant test the Lord. Especially with sin...</br>  <br>So then he does abandon us to be tortured for all of eternity.</br>    <br>To be honest, I've just been feeling like ass lately and needed something like that to turn to. I just want to read their stuff and see if it's something I can look into. Sometimes just learning about that stuff makes me feel some kind of comfort</br>  <br>It's not sin if we're married.</br>    <br>http://exposingchristianity.com/</br>  Don't misunderstand me, I'd wife her hard.  <br>The eternal sin, blasphemy of the Holy Spirit or dying and being an unbeliever together, is what get one into hell.<br><br>Youre talking to yourself truly. I have told you. Hell is for those who commit the eternal sin. To believe is to not commit it and not suffer for eternity. He doesnt abandon you because the wage of sin is death. Youre not dead right? He forgave you for your sins. So the next thing is to not commit the eternal sin by believing in Hm. Then you can rest in paradise for eternity with Him.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd wife her in all her holes.</br>    <br>There you go. Seek love and faith and youll find it. God doesnt abandon anyone. Remember though eventually youll need to learn that it isnt about you. Its about everyone else. Find joy in love and humility and the Lord will reward you with more than you can imagine. To find happiness is to not seek it but seek the Lord.</br>  <br>Its a sin to use sex as pleasure.</br>  <br>That isn't the point I'm arguing, sheepherder. You said he never abandons us.</br>  <br>Thanks man</br>  <br>Not according to the Songs of Solomon.</br>  <br>Dubs for truth</br>  <br>Dubs again. The true true.</br>  I have a simple question. Why were religions invented? You say the Bible has all the answers, well if you think about it, it was written thousands of years ago when we had no other way to explain the world around us. In my opinion people only continue to believe today because 1. They were raised into it and 2. Because it's hard to accept the fact that we are no different than any other animal and nothing happens when you die. It's easier to be tucked in at night with your sweet bedtime story about how there is an eternal life in the sky after this.  <br>Religions were invented to facilitate social control and wealth redistribution.</br>  <br>What are you arguing then? I have answered you with entirety. You seek personal sanctity and I cannot fulfill that for you.</br>  I'll still suck Jesus' cock in return for Ariel Winter. If Jesus won't make me that deal for my soul, then maybe the Devil will.  <br>Hell yur halleluyur! Im tared of dem blacks n satanics like Obama tryin ta take muh freedoms! jesus in america 2016!</br>  <br>Its called he can so he will. Lets not try to fit god in a wooden box man. He is infinate and he is all.</br>  <br> infinate <br><br>I'll not trust my eternal soul to someone who can't spell. I bet Charles Stanley could spell that word.</br></br></br>  <br>I wonder how much more advanced as a species we would be<br> if we had not wasted so much time arguing about how my Santa Claus is more real than yours</br></br>  <br>Big deal someone spelled something right. You peck at honest mistakes to avoid the Truth.</br>  <br>Yet Christianity isnt a religion.</br>  <br>I hold you to the same standard as I hold others. Spell correctly or you don't get my business.</br>  <br>Wat</br>  <br>Pride is blinding. So if someone uttered to you the complete truth you would not read it if it were mispelled slightly?</br>  <br>Yup. Want to know why?</br>  <br>I'd read it, but I'd question their credibility then correct their paper with my red pen.</br>  <br>Please, enlighten me with your holy wisdom</br>  <br>You said that he never abandons humans, but if that were true, hell wouldn't be a thing. I'm saying you're a liar and trying to get you to see that.</br>  <br>haha ok</br>  <br>Not mine wisdom sorry. A Christian is unable to label themselves. They are the norm so to say. To be Christian means you follow the Way. The only Way to be saved. Anything but the True Way is a religion. Technically it cant be considered a religion because of its principles. Everything else is a religion. Atheism having the self be god.</br>  <br>Im lying? its not my Will. I didnt believe this ever until I found the Truth. You are refusing to understand bud</br>  <br>You have to understand the religiously-minded person's perspective.<br><br>God created a Universe and populated it with people who didn't have a choice as to whether they wanted to play this game of life or not. God makes all the rules. He doesn't have to prove Himself. He doesn't have to be logical. He can be full of contradictions. And if you question it and reject it as being unfair, as you would do if this were any other relationship, then YOU are the one who abandoned Him.<br><br>It's the typical sort of reaction that you see with someone who has Borderline Personality Disorder. They treat you like shit and then when you walk away, YOU abandoned them.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hmm, must be nice to have everything fit in a nice little wrapped up package like that hug?</br>  <br>Please read what you just said and come up with a new statement.</br>  Isn't my going to Hell all part of God's plan?  <br>Your lack of understanding is not of my fault but of your pride. Quit blaming others for not getting something very simple.</br>  <br>I can say the Truth to an unbeliever a million times and still he will not understand truly!</br>  <br>So it's unfair to call him on his actions, but being limited by him and punished by him for not following his own rules, that is worth following him and basing your life around. If you don't agree with him, you're doomed for eternity to insufferable pain. Even if christianity was a real thing, a loving god wouldn't do that to his most loved creations.</br>  <br>You literally lied. You said first that humans are never abandoned, then that they are abandoned for not believing. Therefore, you are a liar and not worthy of preaching the good word.</br>  Being open-minded for the moment, can you offer one compelling reason for believing in God other than it's what a book told me to do?  <br>God Bless.</br>  <br>Youve got to get that He is giving us the choice and the command. Why wouldnt you follow your Creators rules? Because of the devil who creates lies, tricks, and is the father of destruction. Its for our own sake He tells us what to do. So that we do not die but gain eternal life through Jesus.</br>  <br>Everyones a follower sounds like some Orwell shit</br>  <br>No you just refused to listen. You want me to lie. I dont give a shit what you do or dont get bud. Get out if youre going to resist a simple understanding. Sorry if I can fucking explain the most simple concepts to you.<br><br>Just cause you cant understand something because of a lack of faith, doesnt mean Im a liar. Find Jesus bro but honestly fuck your shit dude. I can only help you so much</br></br></br>  <br>Replace Christian with Muslim. That's the way too, right?<br><br> fuck off </br></br></br>  Ecclesiastes 3:1<br><br>"Everything that happens in this world happens at the time God chooses."<br><br>God has not chosen for me to believe in Him at this time.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well no, He isn't full of contradictions at all. God gave Adam and Eve the gift of life. It would have been a blessing to be in the Garden of Eden with the Father. We turned our shoulders on the Creator when we called Truth a liar.</br>  <br>Yeah but thats backwards, its like we have two Orwell options. Once leading to eternal suffering (hell) or one that leads to our salvation and eternal joy (heaven and God)</br>  <br>Sounds like a convenient excuse</br>  <br>No because then one wouldnt be following Christ.</br>  <br>Living life in chains so that we can live in paradise. Seems legit. If he cared for us and was a supreme being, why give us a choice that would doom us for eternity to unimaginable pain and suffering? One mistake and you're done? Are there exceptions? Do soldiers fighting for freedom get pardoned for killing? What makes you think you are even worthy of telling anyone how to live? Are you a sacred vessel chosen by your god that knows all of the facts and exactly what he means?</br>  <br>Says who? A bunch of old Jewish goat herders? <br><br> Pic not related </br></br></br>  <br>Faith has nothing to do with this. You said one thing, then said the opposite. You lose.</br>  <br>Maybe you don't understand it</br>  <br>You cant take one verse and make it your life. The Bible is the Truth in its entirety not what someone picks and chooses of it.</br>  <br>Maybe I do understand it and reject it.<br><br>I do reject it. Get over it.</br></br></br>  <br><br>The bible! The bible? There are literally thousands of churches that use the bible. They're all true? But they're all different. <br><br>Bunch of bullshit. If it was one truth, there'd be one church.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Jesus gave two commandments, love thy God and love thy neighbor. You see, loving or indulging in the things of this world will send you to damnation. We have a choice to love God, and be with him, or to love the world, and stay with it. But remember, the world is Satan's domain and will become Hell.</br>  shut the fuck up you stupid fucking faggot, fucking kill yourself  <br><br>Here comes the circular logic.... Or true Scotsman argument.</br></br>  <br>Believers are all disciples who have been told to preach the Word. We live life in chains yes because of sin. But the Truth sets us free. You actually took words out of the Bible with that comment.<br><br>Your asking questions that are the most basic fundamentals of the Bible. You dont need my word you need the Lords Word.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Where do you live anon?</br></br>  <br>Says He the Lord. A bunch of Jewish goat herders dont give a fuck about us. They wrote it for the Lord as He had them write.</br>  <br>All you need to focus on is what Jesus taught, and it really doesn't seem to differ too wildly depending on the versions.</br>  <br>There is one church. But many of lies. Yes there are many deciets but one real Church what many fail to find because they dont even look.</br>  <br>And here comes the prideful human logic that satisfies the self.</br>  <br>If you think about it, religion helped to bolster us into civilization. It created a control system for the masses and let our species develope. Its like could you imagine if all the violent niggers in Chicago suddenly became Christian?</br>  <br>Australia</br>  <br><br>But god had Mohammad write for him. <br><br>Every religion say the same thing, this is gods will and his way.</br></br></br></br>  If god is so great, why don't you die now and go meet him? Suicide is a sin, though. Well, go visit a country that has a different belief and have one of them kill you. They're damned anyway, so they're actually helping.<br><br>So; go get yourself killed.</br></br>  <br>And the Bible says there are false prophets.</br>  <br>Eh. The paradox, in its simplest form, is basically "God can do anything; does that include imposing limits on himself?"<br><br>Yes, it would be possible, by giving himself human form, and only using human strength to try and push the rock.</br></br></br>  be honest faggots,...... how many of you queers though the earth was perfectly round?  <br>I didn't. We have mountains and valleys, for fuck sake, no one would think it was perfectly round.</br>  <br>It is</br>  sdf  <br>i knew it couldnt be perfectly round but that lumpy? really?</br>  <br>well, if you add water to the ocean it's kinda round</br>  <br>sauce on pic<br><br> perfectly round <br>Wat. I thought it was flat ...</br></br></br></br>  <br>well when we picture it as round, we're picturing the atmosphere uniformly surrounding the planet</br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br>None, It's not. But it doesn't look like it does in your pic. <br><br>The hills and slopes are exaggerated to make it easier to see the high and lows.</br></br></br>  <br>thats not an accurate gif</br>  <br>So water isn't part of the earth?</br>  <br><br>Its flat.</br></br>  <br>That has to be an exaggeration. For the most part, from afar, looks like iirc it's called an eliptical sphere? Anyways it bulges near the equator because of how fast it moves. But it's not that lumpy.</br>  THE EARTH IS FLAT YOU FAGGOTS  the day i believed the earth was potato  <br>the fuck is this shit?<br>I can't comprehend this.</br></br>  The Earth absolutely does not look like the OP pic. Gravity tends to make very round balls. They aren't perfect spheres, but they aren't deformed as fuck like that image. <br><br>Fuck you OP.</br></br>  perfectly round  <br><br>your mom is perfectly round.</br></br>  <br>how many of you faggots type "though" thinking it means "thought"?<br>cause OP does.</br></br>  EARTH IS FLAT! EARTH IS FLAT! EARTH IS FLAT! EARTH IS FLAT! EARTH IS FLAT! EARTH IS FLAT! EARTH IS FLAT! EARTH IS FLAT! EARTH IS FLAT! EARTH IS FLAT! EARTH IS FLAT! EARTH IS FLAT! EARTH IS FLAT! EARTH IS FLAT! EARTH IS FLAT! EARTH IS FLAT! EARTH IS FLAT! EARTH IS FLAT! EARTH IS FLAT! EARTH IS FLAT! EARTH IS FLAT!  <br><br><br><br>Either quite stupid or trolls.<br>Read the legend, faggots.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this yeah fuck you OP trying to mess with our minds and shit fuck you there is a special place in hell for people like you.</br>  you dumb fuckers look at the scale on the side ITS IN FUCKING METERS  looks cool<br>thats very interessting, i know that its not perfectly round but that it looks so hard.... xD</br>  <br>same fag thinks jet fuel can't melt steel beams..</br>  <br>geoid<br><br>shit man, i learned this in high school</br></br></br>  <br>Ofc it is. Look at the scales of it. the earth is 40000km in diameter. How fucking high up would south america be if this was accurate? Like 1000km over sealevel? nigga please</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>It's a geoid, essentially a graphical representation of varying gravitational effects around the earth as it isn't of perfectly uniform density.</br></br></br></br></br>  All these poor retarded people who couldn't take the five seconds to google the image and figure out that its a 3d representation of the earth without water, smh  <br>The fuck is wrong with her face</br>    I just wanna say, Fuck you!  ;(  Why the hate OP? Barely made trips?  <br>soon the time will come<br><br>:)</br></br></br>  <br>Are you okay OP?</br>  Fucking airplanes.<br>I get the whole lift and push shit, but the idea that a metal tube is flying at 35 thousand feet, for multiple hours, with over 200 people on board is just too much for me to fucking understand.</br>  magnets.  that .gif of orbital bodies in our solar system leading up to how they compare to the largest known star. what. the. fuck.

As you start going down, the bottle will start to crumple, due to the pressure the water exerts over the bottle.<br><br>Now, take the same plastic bottle, fill it whit air, and take it underwater, without closing it. As you start going down, water will rush into the bottle. Since the water inside the bottle will have the same pressure inside and outside, it will not crumple.<br><br>It is rather easy to make the experiment yourself, as long as you have access to a large body of water.<br><br>Then again, theres always youtube. <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=cHf<wbr>9eWRd_bc</wbr>  [ ] (simple video, shows only the effects of pressure on a closed bottle?<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Cyq<wbr>GODM_o5s</wbr>  [ ] (shows the effects of filling a bottle when already underwater)<br><br>Cant seem to find someone who recorded putting a bottle without the cap underwater, but I guess recording a bottle do nothing isnt quite as exciting....</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just an old guy who has bugs feeding him, don't think about it too much.</br>  <br>Just think of the car as an extension of yourself.<br>you control everything except other drivers, so always be aware.<br>when you walk, you avoid hitting people, driving is the same thing.<br>also, drive at night when the streets are empty to get used to it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>female facebook teen pls</br>  <br>Too much I'm sorry</br>  <br>You have to just keep practicing.

Yah, it is fucking insanely huge. I had the same reaction as you when I first heard about it and saw the examples.<br><br>Thing is, they've discovered one larger than it. Not much larger, but still.</br></br></br>  <br>But no, that's a good point when you think of the three chicks he had in his castle..I was only thinking of Lucy whatever that they killed in her tomb/grave thing..</br>  <br> galaxy so big it contradicts our laws of physics <br><br>We don't know shit do we? We're all ignorant sons of bitches aren't we?<br><br>....Shit</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>god fucking dammit. imagine a planet that size that somehow had the gravity and general geography of earth, all the space we'd have to explore and cool shit to see.</br>  <br>(-x)*(-y) = x*e^iπ*y*e^iπ = x*y*e^2iπ = x*y</br>  <br>You'd never see all of it. Or even close to all of it. It's that large.</br>  <br>Computers. like how did somebody even think it would be possible to create a machine that computes.</br>  <br>I'm not sure if a planet that size is capable of existing, but it would be amazing. The problem is the gravitational pull on that thing would be fucking insane. I you somehow got on that planet fine, as soon as you were on it you'd be crushed instantly.<br><br>But yah, it would be amazing. It'd take YEARS before overpopulation became an issue.</br></br></br>  Fucking radio, it's like magic  <br>I think so. It's just insane to look at that and think that it was just a tiny space that looked completely black. Imagine if we could see all that with out naked eye here on Earth?</br>  <br>or shit man, even being able to transport to all the earth like planets in a given galaxy. I just want to see all the cool geographical shit we can't even imagine</br>  <br>CMOS Gate Circuitry</br>  <br>And it was a fag who accomplished it.</br>  <br>Or even the ones that aren't completely like Earth. Planets made completely of diamond, or that rain liquid iron. Planets with ice volcanoes. Planets orbiting a binary star system. <br><br>That's why the one unattainable dream of mine would be to have the capabilities to explore the universe. There would be no end to the amazing things you would see.</br></br></br>   I would just like to say this is an interesting thread. A real good discussion. Thanks, OP. <br><br>As for what is way over my head, lots of things but one in particular, drugs. hallucinogens mainly. how does something you consume cause your perspective to alter in such a way?</br></br>  <br>my nigga<br>when i first heard this in middle school i didnt believe it... still hard to believe</br></br>  How propulsion works in space<br><br>I mean, there's nothing for the thrust to push against. If a rocket can move through space then why can't you "swim" in space?</br></br>  <br>This. And rain. That water will just fall from the sky still amazes me.</br>  <br>There's a really interesting explanation on Radiolab about it. Check it out if you're interested:<br>http://www.radiolab.org/story/91539<wbr>-placebo/<br><br>How do pheromones work? Like, smells that are brains are hardwired to recognize? What the fuck is that shit</br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>Euler's identity. Fun stuff, where are you schooling?</br>  <br>cheers to that man, cheers to that</br>  <br>Conservation of momentum</br>  <br>It works the same way as a full balloon flies when you let it go. The thrust comes from within the system, except in the space shuttle, it's solids or liquids converted to gasses instead of compressed gasses (though those are also used).</br>  How minorities want more representation, nigga you're a minority, your representation should be equal to your minority levels.  <br>I am not totally sure how this works but if I had to guess, I would say it had something to do with the gravity of the moon tugging on the water on earth. And doing it as it spins and orbits the earth. But I could be wrong cuz wouldnt the sun's gravity be effecting it too? or is the sun too far away? yet the sun is really huge. im sure theres an algorithym or formula in which explains the distance and size ratio which determines if the gravity of an object is able to effect the other object or not. <br>which leads me to start thinking about the tension of space. i mean after all, gravity is just tension being pulled on space being pulled by the objects in it. so how much tension or elasticity does space have? and why? and how?</br></br>  time  <br>Gravity and light. I took physics and those two concepts still rattle my brain.<br>Even more so... quantum physics and string theory.</br></br>  <br>Or why the majority tries to appease not only the minorities but the useless least productive minorities.<br><br>What are they going to say "Take down that rebel flag or we'll stop getting welfare and medicaid"?</br></br></br>  <br>YOU are the thing the thrust is pushing against, if that helps you visualize it. <br><br>As a very basic example, propulsion in space is like the recoil on a gun. You throw mass at a high speed, and that imparts force on you.<br><br>You cant swim in space because you are not throwing any mass away. When you swim underwater, you are launching water behind you to get the "recoil" we used in the example before. In space, since there is only a vacuum, no matter how fast you "swim", you are not moving any mass.<br><br>Both of these examples are rather simplistic for a number of reasons, but work as a very basic explanation.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>time could be an illusion and not exist. i mean time on earth is different than in space so is it really real?</br>  The brain, powerful and capable of so much shit, yet again I have no fucking idea what I had for lunch 5 days ago  <br>What if I put a glass of water on the edge of the water when the gravity level pulls the water back, will the water in my cup be sucked out too?</br>  <br>Grumpy cookie would like a word with you.</br>  <br>Wow that explained it perfectly</br>  <br>Think of it like this, when an explosion happens, it expels things outwards with the resulting wave of force coming from it. That's what happens with rockets, it's just directed.<br><br>This is probably wrong, but this is how I kind of like to think of it.</br></br></br>  <br>Talking about Voyager...<br><br>...vinyl records. How the fuck do they do what they do? Voyager's golden record (not vinyl but same principle) contains not only sound but also images! Freakin images somehow can be stored between crevices on a fuckin copper plate! And all that in 1977!</br></br></br>  <br>Selective memories, man. Our brain is the biggest scumbag we know.</br>  <br>what makes you say that time is different in space?</br>  <br>How could time be real if our watches aren't real</br>  <br><br>The international space station. I understand how they built it, and all that but the fact that there are people miles above the Earth fucking floating around in 0 gravity boggles my mind.</br></br>  <br>so youre saying we must first build up momentum? and after that, once we have come to a complete stop, we can no longer propel ourselves further? even with a rocket? so then we are stuck? or at least until we come into orbit of something? stuck in space. thats a hell all in its own.</br>  <br>i cant understand how files start to execute one after the other when i press the "on" button in my computer.<br>How the fuck a very first file executes for itself...</br></br>  <br>haha nice man</br>  <br>Well, it is the most expensive thing ever built by man. Think of it as a very large, very improvised sattelite.</br>  <br>You're only perceiving it to be a constant occurrence. Your brain is tricking you. The house edge isn't terribly high, in reality.</br>  <br>the way it gets turned to a radio signal and back is pretty neat, and I love being the one with an answer when someone asks "what does AM and FM stand for"</br>  <br>I understand that, but then why evolve into such powerful creature if we can't even use our abilities to their max?</br>  How could everything have been compressed into a point the size of a pinhead when we can't even compress a gallon of water into 3/4 of a gallon of space?  <br>its been proven. i forget everything exactly but it was something about taking two atomic clocks. one in space and one left on earth. then another experiment similar with twins.</br>  lirally dunno  <br>holy fuck. nothing explains that. i smell a conspiracy. QUICK! Lets all tweet about this until it blows up in the governments face and all anarchy unleashes.</br>  Brains, man. Brains fuck me up <br>Like, we're self aware, but are we? I dunno. I cant put it into words</br>  <br>We actually don't know anything about them, they are more theoretical than actual fact.<br>We just see spots where gravity and light is bent.<br>Still blows my mind though.</br></br></br>  <br>The rocket would provide you whit "recoil" (thrust, from now on).<br><br>What I mean when I say that you cant "swim" in space is that you cannot get any momentum in space without losing mass. So, for example, if you where out in space by yourself, even if you started making the movements you need to do swim, you would not move, the same way you would not expect to move by walking on air while dangling from a rope.</br></br></br>  <br>Religion.</br>  <br><br> implying we wouldn't isolate ourselves to one corner of it and fight over money until we die out <br><br>humans are the only thing I don't understand, and they are far from logical</br></br></br></br>  Magnets. How the fuck do they work?  <br>That's like a soccer mom arguing that she's educated when her degree is in women's studies and creative writing.</br>  <br>Women 'logic'.</br>  <br>gravity bends light tho.<br>light bends around the earth man.<br>so same thing. just a lot more.</br></br></br>  <br>Water is different. Shit's got mass, yo.<br><br>And we haven't been "compressing everything". If you're thinking about nano technology, all that has been made with tiny tweezers and OCD interns.</br></br></br>     Life <br>I don't understand 'life', why we exists, or how we are sustained. I guess life isn't very "logical" to begin with, but it's on the top of my list of shit I can't fathom.</br>  <br>Its only the supermassive boiling body of supercharged heated gas that we circle. Its only that anon</br>  <br>I meant the big bang. We can't compress a few pounds of liquid but all the mass in the universe was one point</br>  <br>the very essence of the brain is consciousness, and the characteristic aspect of the consciousness is ineffable<br>ineffable means "it cannot be put into words"</br></br>  <br>Now, he's saying that if you throw something away from you, it will throw you in the oposite direction.</br>  American Conservatives and the Republican Party.<br><br>How does it function?</br></br>  <br>good post</br>  <br><br>That's exactly why it blew up<br>At some point it went "wait shit this is wrong"</br></br></br>  <br>generally, the gravity would be greater unless the density of the planet evened it out</br>  <br>there are 2 tides, one from the moon and one from the sun, the lunar tide is larger than the solar tide because it is closer so its relative gravitational pull on the oceans is greater. the two tides can coincide, causing a (i forgot the word) super tide, or they can cancel each other out causing a neap tide. i think the super tide is called spring tide but i'm too lazy to look it up.<br><br>the oceans are made of water, which are obviously matter (having mass) and fluid (able to be manipulated in terms of shape). the gravitational pull of the sun and the moon pull on the earth in total, but the fluid of the oceans is transformed because of those pulls. it's pretty simple if you think about it for a while but mindbending in its scale</br></br></br>    <br> magents <br>how do the even fucking work?</br></br>  <br>You should play No Man's Sky when it comes out.</br>  Conservation of mass energy<br> nigga how can mass defect into energy </br>  how the fuck we get aroused by an ass since its designed to be sth unhealthy<br>Why sht unhealthy moves our inner to sth that requires full hygiene like a baby</br>  <br>Let me elaborate on what I just said.<br><br>A rockets function, in space, is to take mass, accelerate it, and launch it away.<br><br>Because it is launching mass away, it can produce thrust. The higher the speed of the mass, the more thrust it produces for the same ammount of mass.<br><br>Or going back to the "recoil" example: The bigger (more weight) a bullet is, and the more speed it has, the more recoil it will have aswell.<br><br><br>You cannot swim in space because moving your arms will not accelerate any mass, or produce any thrust (It will not shoot any bullets, or make any recoil)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>time is a function of gravity; in space gravity is less than that on earth so it moves differently. we know from the theory of relativity that gravity is a function of speed (or maybe velocity), so that going faster creates more gravity which will, in turn, affect time.</br></br>  <br>It's called "pulling yourself up by your bootstraps" which is where "booting a computer" comes from.<br><br>The thing is, your CPU will excute the program at a specific address when it is turned on. By default, that address is mapped to ROM (EEPROM these days). That small program in ROM is erroneously called the BIOS and it's job is to config the chips set, then load a very very small program from somewhere (disk, CDROM, USB key, ROM on your ethernet card). This program is 512 bytes or less and is called the boot loader. It, in turn That next program is loads a smaller, more intelligent boot loader, which then loads the entire OS.<br><br>Note that EFI changes the above slightly.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>because vagina</br>  <br>so why arent lakes affected? or a glass of water? less water should be easier to manipulate.</br>  <br>We don't know what came before the Bang, or what caused that single "point".<br><br>I'm guessing that a lot of supercharged, dense particles with a metric shit-ton of energy were packed into a very small space for a small amount of time. And when it expanded outward into our universe, it was because "the valve was released" so to speak.</br></br></br>  <br>Amen dood, the universe is fucking amazing</br>  <br>Time is what we perceive it to be. In the sense that time always moving, or simply put: we perceive time to be moving. That said, time and life are relevant to one another, but only to the mortality of life. After life ceases, time does not stop, and in that sense life and death are the links to time; one that shares time and one that separates itself from time. If that makes sense. I could be rambling right now. I'm high as fudge, son.</br>    <br>You CAN compress water, but it requires a tremendous amount of pressure. It will actually turn into a slightly different kind of crystal than ice, but there isn't really any practical use for it.</br>  <br>I prefer this one, but sorry for the bad quality</br>  <br>But it moves slower in less gravity and then slower during hypervelocity travel</br>  <br>Yes.<br><br>But the self aware you from 1 second ago, who just had your previous thought, are dead. You, your consciousness, are just "alive" for the period of a thought, and the you of now will die in the next moment.<br><br>It's all a ilusion that it was you all the time.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Only one correction, BIOS is short of Basic input output system, and has evolved in very specific ways since the 1980's. Mostly it's initializing the VRAM and RAM now, as well as assigning IRQ numbers to the system components to be passed off to the bootloader, which of course passes off to whatever OS kernel begins loading.</br>  <br> your CPU will excute the program at a specific address when it is turned on. <br>why, how is there a connection between the pressure of my finger and the first 0 and 1 that start in the cpu?<br>i thnk of a first very little program (0 for example) that never shuts down and the push is the 1 left<br>those first two digits start the fire...</br></br></br></br>  Why do we build castles in the sky, all the castles way up high?  <br>Just think that we can will get crushed under the huge pressure of their environment but they will literally explode with the tiny pressure of our environment</br>  <br>BECAUSE NIGGERS</br>  <br><br>Why aren't we all flying into the sun? It's gravity is greater and humans should be easier to manipulate</br></br>  <br>The secret to understanding all human behaviour : what you call "logical behavour" is in fact you giving certain weights to certain options. Different people give different weights to those options. Most people will change the weights the assign at different times.</br>  Thinking about the actual "beginning" of the universe. Like pre big bang.<br><br>It is impossible for an infinite amount of time to have passed already so there must have been a beginning.<br><br>Knowing we will never know and perhaps can't fathom is upsetting</br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy jesus christ that looks amazing</br>  <br> born to soon to explore galaxy <br> born too late to explore earth <br> born just in time for Facebook and persuing a meaningless life of provision.  <br><br>I dream every night that I'm rocketing through the cosmos, seeing instance so small and so fast that they shouldn't exist, sitting on a comet watching the stars at it hurdles through the endless oceans of space and time. <br><br>We are on the cosmic shores, and so far we have only dipped a toe. <br>But the water seems inviting.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's because you're fat and autistic.</br>  <br>Modern BIOS also configures the chipsets.</br>  <br><br>But could I expel gas and move in space then?</br></br>  <br>The ARE affected. The larger they are, the more noticeable the effect because they are shifted by a percentage. If say 1% of the water in a glass changes sides, it would be hardly noticeable, but 1% of the entire planet's water is easy to see because we are much smaller than the earth.</br>  <br>You deserve to be made fun of for typoing this reference.</br>  <br>actually we are<br>in spiral as a matter of fact</br></br>  <br>lakes and glasses of water are affected, but there's less mass so the change is less noticeable, and also the surface area is so much smaller. the oceans are spread across basically the globe, so the gravitational pull from the sun and moon is different in different places, causing the ocean to swell where the pull is greatest. in a glass of water, the pull from the sun and moon is relatively uniform because it occupies such a small space compared to the forces involved.</br>  <br>yeah, this thread needed an ass</br>  That we will all see every night, places you'll never reach in all your life.  <br>yeah that's fine, it doesn't dispute what i'm saying. i just said it behaves differently. time is a function of gravity, what that function actually is is unknown to me</br>  <br>/pol/ plz go</br>  <br>It's just weird that both more and less gravity would make it go slower</br>  <br>Poetic AF.

You become faster with every discharge (or should I say farter?).</br>  i remember the good ol' napster times.<br>the first time i listened to a song just downloaded, was like WTFFFF ,wtffff, wait a minute WTFFFF<br><br>how could i be listening to a song i didnt have in my hard disk???<br><br>i miss that amazement</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>excactly, the universe as we know it isnt even "everything." there has to be more to reality than a bunch of galaxies and stars and shit otherwise there is no point in it even existing. sure the universe as we know it is X years old, but its age is meaningless without context, which we will never know</br>  <br>you know, after i picked the food items, i thought that's maybe what you were getting at.<br><br>that idea almost proves that the entirety of the universe is a construct of something that doesn't actually exist. it's like time only exists when there's mass (or something traveling) existing within the time but the mass (or traveling object) can only exist within time.<br><br>i hope i explained that paradox properly, my mind is kind of fucked thinking about it</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Everything males ever do in their lifetime is just so we can squeeze our cocks in between those cheeks and spurt reproductive fluid into that sweet tight suction hole.</br>  <br>how one kilogramme of feathers weights the same as one kilogramme of steel</br>  <br><br>It's only inviting to those that can properly navigate it's depths and seas.

So the chipset sees this and is hardcoded to go into power on mode. So it sends a signal to the PSU to go into power on mode. This means the CPU gets the 3.3 volts (and 12 volts?) that CPUs run on. The CPU has a small program on board that tells it how to init itself, then to jump to the BIOS.<br><br>Modern computers are insanely complicated. It's layers upon layers upon layers. But it all comes down to if you apply volts to a transistor, the output does something. Set up all the transistors you need and they end up doing very complex things.</br></br></br>  <br>Um, I don't think earth's gravitational pull is strong enough to diverge photons.</br>  [sweating intensifies]  <br>exactly<br>we'll never know the appropiate context to conceptually dissolve the mystery because our minds cannot think but in a "mystery" way...</br></br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>Don't forget dat ass our brains are programmed to obsess over.</br>  <br>the experiment is true, but what I meant was that...<br><br>Time doesn't change "in space". Time changes due to differences on velocity and gravity, like you pointed out. I was just asking because I felt like there was a possible misinterpretation somewhere on your first comment.<br><br><br><br>Yes, of course. The gas is what provides the mass. In fact, space suits use what basically amounts to a glorified propane tank to give astronauts the ability to manoeuvre in space. Pic related (that was used on the gemini 4, 1965.

She did some great stuff with this Karen chick (who later ruined herself with fake tits).  <br><br>So much nostalgia hitting me all at once right now.</br></br></br>   For a few minutes longer, you take in the ambient landscape. Trying hard to etch its image into your mind, so you have something to describe to the painter when you commission that painting you wanted. <br> And it looks like it has worked... A small, yellow dagger flower just has sprouted before your very eyes.  <br> An equally small smile spreads on your lips and you jump off the boulder. Landing more or less elegantly on your hooves.  <br> Luckily, the rubble here is not big enough to severely hurt you, and so you just scrape your ankle a bit.  <br> A thin gush escapes of the multichromatic haze escapes from the injury and engulfs the newly born flower. Giving it an eery, yet fascinating sheen when it settles on it. <br> You raise your hindleg and immediately lower it again, once you see that the wound already stopped leaking... whatever this mist is. <br> What a shame... You kinda looked forward to lick it clean and see how it tastes. <br> For some reason its appearance gives you the impression that it would taste fruity... Or at least sweet and sour. <br> Just like a particular kind of rock candy, one of your friends makes. They look like the brume when it would take a solid form. <br> Well... Maybe later. The way before you is full of those razor-sharp figments and splintery rocks. <br> So the chance for another injury lies somewhere between ninety and one hundred percent. Yay~  <br> Speaking of the way before you... You think its time to get going again. <br>“Good bye, memory of my mind. May you grow big and strong. I really want this painting for my potential fireplace.” <br> You shoot it a nod and then start making your way up the slope. <br> More than once, you almost slipped on the loose stones and barely managed to save yourself from the fate of tumbling down and starting all over again. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>“Celestia be damned... Stupid imaginary slopes...”<br> But with a bit of blood, toil, tears and sweat you eventually make it up to the top and sigh in delight once your last hoof makes contact with the level ground. <br>“Finally.”<br> Twilight Sparkle prevails once more!  <br> Now you just have to hope there aren't more ascents like this. That would be a real pain the flank. <br> Taking a deep breath, you stretch each of your appendages real quick before you continue trotting towards the mountain. <br>“Sometimes I was so messed up and didn't have a clue~”<br> Doesn't look all too far any more. You can already make out the colours of individual wisps.  <br> Blue... Green... Purple... You think that one is turquoise and a few red ones.  <br> And by the looks of it, your pink friend from before is there too! Flying circles around the mountain peak. <br>“I ain't winning no one over~”<br> Almost seems like it wants to give it a halo with its trail. How cute. <br> Maybe ten to fifteen more minutes of walking through this treacherous scenery and then you should be there.  <br> Provided that your mind decides to play along, of course. But you have a feeling that it will. <br>“I wear it just for you~”<br> Meh... Kinda boring here. The riverbed was way more exciting. Nothing here but shimmering shards and grey rocks.  <br> Which you have to give a wide berth every few steps, since they now tend to appear in dangerous clusters. Prolonging your journey and making it more tedious than it already is. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> Sometimes you wish you could fly... This ability would make it so much easier to traverse all this. <br> A nice and large pair of purple wings. Yeah. <br> Would have the added benefit of giving ponies winghugs. Which you particularly enjoy, since they are so nice and warm. <br> At least you think you do. Nevertheless, its a lovely thought. <br>“I've got your name written here~”<br> You pass a especially nasty and deadly looking clump of figments and see something dark in its centre out of the corner of your eye, that catches your attention. <br>“Huh?”<br> Backing out a bit, you try to get a good look at it. But the lustre that surrounds your current object of interest, effectively prevents you from doing so. <br> Too flashy and distracting for your pony eyes... Hmm... What to do? <br> Those things are kinda brittle, aren't they? The ones that stuck in your hooves always broke off when you stepped on them... So... <br> Why not throw a large rock at them? <br> You look around and find soon enough a rock that suits your purposes.  <br> Picking it up, you let your real and your imaginary front hooves accustom to its weight and then lunge out. <br> It leaves your appendages with quite some speed and collides with the shard cluster. Producing a satisfying shattering noise, not unlike breaking glass, in the process.  <br> Oh my... What a rare find. <br> A black pearl, roughly the size of an apple, rolls out of it and stops right before you. <br> They belong to your subconscious and hold your deepest personality traits, fears and beliefs about yourself. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> Things that unconsciously have a bearing on you... <br> Also they store everything you seemingly forgot or have no memory of. Like your birth or your early years as a foal. <br> One could think of them as permanent and undying version of the flowers, only that you don't have direct access to them. <br> But a simple spell could activate and reveal whatever secrets it holds... All it needs is a little push. <br> However... You already caused enough damage. And maybe it isn't even worth the effort. <br> It could just be you crawling around the floor and soiling your diapers.  <br>“Eww...”<br> And you certainly don't need a reminder of that.  <br> So you carefully put it down again, making sure that it can't roll away by steadying it with a few rocks and resume with your travels. <br> You already lost enough time as it is.  <br> So... Where did you left off..?  <br>“I've got your name written here...”<br> There... But what is the next line? <br> Something with a Rose... But how exactly did it go? <br> While you ponder about this, you dodge another bundle of shards and jump over a round boulder. Driving a green wisp out of its hiding place behind it, when you land. <br>“Sorry, little guy.”<br> It angrily flickers at you and spits out a massive cloud of green powder, before flying off into the endless sky. <br>“Hey! * cough * I said that I was * cough * sorry, didn't I?”<br> Coughing and choking, you run out of the mischievous sprite's miasma and look after it once you can breath again. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>          <br> With watery eyes, you have to assess that it is already too far away to fear any retributions from your side.  <br> And it seemingly celebrates this fact by drawing figures on the black canvas that is your mind's void.  <br> Mocking and taunting you... The nerves this thing has! <br>“Grr...”<br> Green... Jealousy... What else?! It was most likely just jealous of your good looks and tried to ruin them with its stupid dust. <br> You shake the remainders of the wisp's powder off and leave this nuisance behind your flanks <br> Of which it is probably jealous too. And with good reason! <br> They might be illusionary and not your real one, but they are still a nice exemplar of their kind!  <br> Shall it have a good look at them while you increase your distance to it with your muzzle in the air and a hastened pace.  <br> And luckily, it leaves you be and minds its own business. <br> The rest of the way to the mountain happens without any other special occurrences. <br> No further injuries, no interesting parts of your minds and certainly no additional angry wisps. Thank Celestia for that. <br> The dust they emit is kinda itchy... And you don't particularly want to scratch those itches on the rocks here. <br> It still took you longer than you calculated beforehand and the rest of the lyrics to your song continued to be missing, but you finally made it. <br> Only maybe fifty metres now separate you from your goal. <br>“At last.”<br> You sit down on your haunches and take a look at your surroundings.  <br> Before you lies the mountain... Well, more of a high hill than a mountain, now that you have a closer look at it. But... <br> It is still easily a quarter mile high, yet not particularly steep.  <br> Ascending it would be exhausting and time consuming, but by all means not impossible. <br> You hope nevertheless, that you don't have to climb this mass of sharp rocks... <br> Maybe there is something else of interest around it? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br>Srsly this.</br></br>  i guess she's too poor to afford proper bras by the way her tits hang  spoiler: nigger shows up halfway through    <br>hahaha yep..</br>      <br> With your new companion by your side, you continue trotting towards the foot of the mountain. Dodging a few more figment clusters along the way. <br> Luckily they are far easier to see now with the light it provides. Even the smaller ones that gave your hooves troubles before pose no problems any more. <br> Very convenient~ But very inconsistent too... <br> It doesn't stop whirring around your head and thus shifts the area it illuminates non stop from side to side. <br> Slowly but steadily making you feel sea-sick... And there isn't even a drop of water anywhere nearby! <br> Urgh... <br>“Say?” you beckon the wisp down to you.<br> ”Brrzzssh?” <br>“Could you maybe keep a straight course? I'm starting to feel... Well, queasy.”<br> It bumbles quietly and apparently stops its swaying to think for a bit, before blinking once and then heading straight for you at a murderous speed. <br>“Whoa! No! What are you -?”<br> You close your eyes to brace yourself for the impact... But it never happens. No fuzzy feeling on your face, no warm sensation... Nothing. <br> Yet your horn feels funny... Did it? <br>“What now? Where are youuooohhhh!”<br> ”Bsssh~” <br> It did! Somehow it attached itself to your horn. Sticking to it like one of these horn lights that unicorns put on them for Nightmare Night and similar festivals. <br> Looks like you are a channeling a spell... Cool...  <br>“Uhh~”<br> You shake your head to see how securely it sits there. But no amount of shaking seems to even make it budge an inch.  <br> Even cooler!  <br> Now you have your own personal headlight! And one with that you can communicate too! <br> That is nearly the epitome of coolness! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>        She kind of looks like vin diesel when she's getting it from behind  Mexithread<br>Version, valiendo verga en sabado.</br>  Alguién de Juárez?

It's like she was speaking right to our souls.<br><br>What did you guys think of brotherhood?</br></br></br>  <br>I think you're a filthy weaboo and should kill yourself.</br>  <br>I'd fuck Winry up the butt, is what I think.</br>  <br>I second this.</br>  The original FMA is the better than Brotherhood.<br><br>I tried to care about Brotherhood, but my god the character development was so boring. In the original FMA I cared about Ed and Al, their struggles, their childhood etc... Deaths had more impact, the loss of innocence was more profound, also I liked that Mustang killed Winry's parents because it became understandable why he did what he did, why he wanted to become furher, why he cared so much for Ed and Al etc...</br></br>  <br>I think you're a massive faggot and that you need to play the John Cena dating sim.</br>  <br> original </br>  <br>wrong board, but it was a god-tier series. Miles ahead of the predecessor. <br><br>And it's true, women (young women more specifically) need excitement in their lives. They need danger, or at least feeling like they're taking a risk. <br><br>Obviously there are exceptions, but for the most part, women want to escape themselves in your masculinity. They don't want to constantly be dealing with their own irrationality and moodiness along with yours. <br><br>It's all a balancing act. The right amount of thrill and excitement with the right level of gentleness and compassion to fit each girls individual needs.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, the original Anime. Obviously the manga was first, and HURR BROTHERHOOD WAS JUST LIEK DA MANGA, but of the two anime series Brotherhood was made 6 years later.</br>  <br> The original FMA is the better than Brotherhood. <br><br>MY NIGGER<br><br>Brotherhood is much more watered down and kid friendly, without the heavy political messages from the original.<br><br>Also, what the fuck is up with everyone's chins in Brotherhood?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I like Nina.</br>  <br> wrong board <br>Smells like newb spirit.<br><br><br>Brotherhood held together better as a coherent story, and dealt with characterization with a more practiced subtlety than the 2003 run did. I can see why some would connect more with the Elrics in the 2003 run, but ultimately they were very ham-fisted with the way they engaged the viewer.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>:)</br>  <br>kek</br>  <br>is it maybe because you watched the series once already and were used to it conforming to certain expectations it didn't meet? <br>I understand what you meant about character development, but maybe (and maybe not) it was glossed over a little more because they didn't want to tell the same story twice? <br>I liked brotherhood a lot less because the plot was much thicker and on a much more grand scale.</br></br></br>  <br> anime thread <br> not /a/ <br> newfig <br>okay bud</br></br></br></br>  <br>wow. that was so awful and so good at the same time.</br>  <br>Hahaha, no.<br><br>Nostalgiafags are the worst. First<br> FMA anime had shit writing and shit character development<br><br> Wrong board <br><br>I hate summer</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A lot more* fucking hell</br>  <br>How is this the wrong board?<br>Its random.<br>Its literally fuckin everything you fuckin autist</br></br></br>  <br>Seriously stop being so new.<br>Let me guess, you came last year with fappening? Or just a couple days ago since it's summer?</br></br>  <br>In theory, yes. In practice, no.</br>  <br>4chin is a weeb forum made by a weeb (who?) for weebs to talk about weeb things<br><br>If you don't like it i'm sure you can go to reddit or something</br></br></br>  <br>Alright whatever, got me on a technicality. Just figured a discussion about anime might be better received where anime is usually discussed. <br>If thinking that makes me a summerfag newfag then okay<br><br> thinking summerfaggotry is even a thing <br> being this autistic </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kill yourself</br>  <br>Both stories were shit, let's be honest, outside of the brothers' attempt at becoming human again it devolved into many idiotic subplots and deus ex machina plot holes. <br><br>It ain't nostalgia, I'll openly admit that the original FMA had a lot of shit it in, and that Brotherhood did have better things about it.<br>But like I said, the original had more impact with it's main characters. Brotherhood was emotionless. And the original FMA had better character development than the nonexistent character development in Brotherhood.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Just figured a discussion about anime might be better received where anime is usually discussed. <br><br>Holy fucking shit, you don't seriously believe /a/ isn't exclusively about shitposting and moeblobs, do you?</br></br></br>  <br>it's the best anime currenly in existence.<br>also fuck these new captchas</br></br>  <br> Thinking summerfaggotry is even a thing <br>But it is. Shitposters go crazy in summer it's like there's no end to them.<br>I mean i'm not counting shitty boards like /v/ that should be banned from 4chan because they reek of reddit and tumblr but other boards too</br></br></br>  <br>idk its been a while, I stopped watching anime a couple of years ago.</br>  <br>I don't notice any more or less shitposting, considering a decent thread is the exception not the rule.</br>  <br>the original was more mysterious especially their father Hoenheim.</br>  <br> Both stories were shit <br><br>From a technical standpoint? Sure, yeah, once you descend into the ancient mysteries trope, it gets rocky, but for the most part the 2009 run was much better cobbled together than the 2003 run -- of course, that has to do with keeping tighter to the source material.<br><br>I do agree the manga and Brotherhood would have been better, had there been more concentration simply on the quest to regain innocence and humanity, rather than a Lovecraftian conspiracy; even if the latter did keep me hanging on through some of the sillier moments.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying /b/ is prohibited from having anime threads  <br>Go back to Raddish and commit Sudoku.</br></br>  <br>Pretty much how I feel, and, at least to me, the original did the humanity aspect better. The brothers were more human, Mustang was more tragic, also Hughes' death was more impactful because Hughes had more presence. Even if it was a bit more ham-fisted at parts</br>  <br>Replied to wrong guy. I meant that /b/ was theoretically supposed to cover stuff that didn't fit in other boards, but in reality has threads about everything.</br>  <br>Prohibited? No.<br>Recommended? Also no. <br>Just because you CAN post something doesn't me you SHOULD post. <br>Why is this so hard of an idea to wrap your heads around? <br><br>/a/&gt;/b/ for animu thread <br>/b/&gt;/a/ for cancer</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's also something much sexier about the original.</br>  <br>I crie evry tiem</br>  <br>Here, let me help you.<br><br>You're welcome.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't know about the whole, "quest for innocence" thing. It kind of seemed to me like they were growing up beyond their innocence. They understood that innocence was a beautiful lie, and after a certain point moved on from their selfish desire to go back to a simpler time to living in the moment and fighting for the future. <br><br>Or maybe not it's been 5 years.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br> complains thread shouldn't be here <br> bumps thread </br></br></br></br></br></br>  Hunter X Hunter is better  <br>i felt this way for hellsing, but i think brotherhood brought more to the table than hellsing ultimate, i dont want to feel this way but sadly i do</br>  <br>no don't tell them where there can and can't post they'll get mad<br><br>meh I just crave human interaction so much I'm willing to take it in the form of arguing with strangers on the internet.</br></br></br>  I found this at the top of Big Ben...it doesn't weigh much, what is it?  <br>It's one of the buttons required to be pressed in unison to fire off their nuclear warheads</br>  <br>i've seen some timestamps in my day and that is definitely no timestamp</br>  <br>Whatever you do, don't drop it.
