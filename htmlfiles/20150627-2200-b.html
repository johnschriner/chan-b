He was a medicine student. He was cool, quiet, kept to himself and always had amazing tobacco for hookah.<br><br>Not to say that most muslims worldwide aren't worthless sacks of shit, even though there are nearly no muslims here and the ones that do get here are self-filtered nice and polite people, there indeed are anti-islam groups here. They don't really care about the ideological defence of europe or anything like that, they are just trying to bank on the political capital handed to them by extremism happening in the western europe.<br><br>Basically, what they are saying that muslims are gypsies with guns. That scares the shit out of a lot of people.</br></br></br></br></br>  Serious question:<br><br>Why do people with legitimate goals in stopping radical Islam instead kill themselves with emotional drama, Tumblr-level, and fight themselves more than actual Muslim extremists?<br><br>And why do these groups end up failing badly when they talk about all kinds of shit that don't relate to Muslims?</br></br></br></br>  <br>If u read the quran, there are so many verses about hate and killing.</br>  I just got a new slave / puppy!

People are less likely to get pissed off and you are less likely to get banned that way  <br>pic related</br>              <br>Not that bad actually. Not "keep advertising it for what to me feels like more than a year" good, but also not that bad. Seems rather unfinished and somewhat autistic, but I like it. Post again when all routes are set in stone. Until then, fuck off.<br><br><br> weeks <br>ha<br><br>picture unrelated</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>      <br>Just a couple. Still working on it.<br><br><br>Yeah, probably.</br></br></br></br>  <br> and somewhat autistic <br><br>In what way? Help a brother out.</br></br></br>    <br>The whole concept of a smut-sprinkled Teen Titans CYOA in itself. Wasn't even meant in a bad way I guess.<br><br> no hate on the premise <br> have done my own, albeit less detailed and with other themes </br></br></br></br>  <br>i kek errytime. bravo</br>  <br> The whole concept of a smut-sprinkled Teen Titans CYOA in itself. <br><br>Oh lol. I guess that's fair.<br><br> have done my own, albeit less detailed and with other themes <br><br>Feel free to link them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuckin hell I won't, not gonna give these faggots the pleasure of bashing it into next tuesday, they're pretty subpar I guess.</br>  <br>My e-mails in the story, so feel free to send a link there.</br>  <br>Nah I'll pass, thanks though. Just wanted to underline I don't hate idea per se, just your theme is not my cup of tea.</br>  <br>So what is your preferred theme. At least leave us with that.</br>  <br>There are two major ones. The first is elaborate medieval fantasy (think of the whole D&amp;D shtick with less stats and no dice rolling) and another is slice of life smut/gore of a young girl dealing with the fact she has been raped into a writhing mess by her boss and wants now revenge. While both would fit perfectly into /b/'s tastes I guess, they're pretty shit and clumsily done, so nope, not gonna post.</br>  <br> inb4 doesn't sound any less autistic <br><br>YES IT DOES</br></br></br>  <br>So what are the problems you face when it comes to a CYOA?<br><br>Obviously for me when I want to add new spins on the story based on a choice, causing even more stuff to pile on and I have to write.</br></br></br>  <br>Due to the nature of CYOA, anything has to connect to the other choices and story progression in some way, as else you would get the same few endings with vastly different actions during the "game". If I had time and effort to manage all of that coherently, I'd write a novel or go into videogame lore scripting instead.</br>                  Back Hammer?    <br>yeah i was playing chivalry</br>    <br>allow me to steal this. no contribution to actual thread though heh</br>  <br>Speaking of games, I've played some recently on Steam<br><br>Funfact: Hotline 2 sucks</br></br></br>  <br>profligate</br>  metal gear solid: operation hunger games 3<br><br>post 48 images of characters and their names.<br>no duplicates<br><br>go</br></br></br></br></br>  space dandy  Yukiteru Amano  Nonon Jakuzure!
