It’s a scene run by a mysterious gangbang crew known as The Florida Mandingos.<br><br>Our guide is Art Hammer, the founder of the Florida Mandingos, a group of “discreet, professional, educated, intelligent, physically fit, drug and disease free, well-hung black gentlemen, age 24-45, that specialize in hot, intense, nasty gangbangs for couples/females who love big black dicks and black dick fantasies!”<br><br>VICE follows Art on a road trip leading up to a ‘Hot Chocolate’ party he’s hosting at a purpose built sex bungalow called the Shangri Lust. Along the way we meet the key players who make up the lifestyle: the insatiable wives and their cuckolded white husbands obsessed with sex with black men, and Art’s A-team, the crème de la crème of the Mandingos.<br><br>As the clothes come off, their strange world unfolds before us.

Why the fuck does ten matter? Are they saying you don't need to know what you are solving for you just need to know how to make ten by pulling shit out of the made up problem?</br>  <br><br>Saved. Thank you. This is the kind of sly shit they pull in school that so many people claim doesn't happen.

It's clear that his parents gave him a head start in this class by helping him study, which isn't fair.<br><br>It's fortunate for the non-white students in the class that their teacher isn't tolerating this privilege.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Sure, public school is likely better, but none of this Common Core bullshit was around when I was in school.</br></br>  <br> to private schools. <br> Fuck you guys and your shitty public education. <br>You ended up on /b/, congratulation.</br></br></br>  <br><br>quite the opposite</br></br>  <br>Yes, in fact that is how most people do it. You can of course learn these things by heart by memorization, but most just practices simple small additions in their mind. It might seem like it is instant but it's not.<br><br>You see the human brain has not evolved to conceptually understand numbers higher than about 7. <br><br>You can make a simple thought experiment.<br><br>Visualize one peanut in your mind. No problems. Two peanuts? No problems.<br>How far can you go before you start grouping the peanuts?<br><br>Most people end up at 7, where they start thinking of it as groups of 4 and 3. <br><br>So for 8+5, the calculation is often 8+2+3 or 5+5+3, but seeing as we are so good at doing these through practice it feels like it is instant. Or you have just memorized the answers.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think it means friendly to work with by rounding which is perfectly fine</br>  <br>so, you dont unterstand algebra? cause that shit will never be homework.</br>  <br>just put the peanuts in a circle fagit</br>  <br>infinity answers as long as the stickers are multiples of four or six</br>  <br>you have no idea how badly you have been brainwashed by Jews. I loathe your existence.</br>  <br><br>better question is why she's wasting money on stickers for her cunt friends</br></br>  <br>this reminds me so much of my time in elementary schoole<br>oh i hated these dumb teachers that dindt even realized how to math<br><br>every fucking time we wrote a math test i got a bad grade, after that i showed the test to my mom(she is engineer so she knows how to math freaking well) and my mom goes to my stupid as fuck math teacher and tells him to stop the shit, every answer that i gave is right and his prescribed procedure of solution is stupid as fuck</br></br></br></br>  <br>oic</br>  <br> congratulation <br>Fuck you, I deserve at least 3 congratulation, not just 1</br></br>  <br>Still wondering where the 3 is coming from</br>  <br>Modern education in the US is done by the standard of what is called the 'common core'. In essence, actual intelligence or critical thinking is forgone for ability to be essentially a human calculator. Kids are taught how to do the jobs they're expected to do, not how to do mathematics.</br>  <br>it's the invisible (-x)</br>  <br>What the actual fuck?<br><br>(Out of curiosity - is the answer supposed to be 2? There is this very vague hint that she's considering multiples of two, so maybe she has two friends. It's underdetermined.)</br></br></br>  <br>Really? 'Cause when I was in school, it started out with 2+2 = X. After that it got more complicated...<br><br>This is a false math puzzle. You can't change an equation like that. How would you even write it out? 8+(5-3)+3? That is not how math or algebra works. This is closer to a logic word puzzle than a math problem.</br></br></br>  <br><br> friendly numbers <br><br> What the fuck is that cuckoo crap supposed to be?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>What the fuck? Am I just being retarded?</br></br>  <br>congratulation</br>  <br><br>  be in elemntary school <br>  parents poor as shit so I had to sit quietly after school with my dad in his community college math class <br>  learn negative numbers n shit <br>  next day in math teacher says you can't subtract a bigger number from a smaller one <br>  say you can its called a negative number  <br>  no silly anon there's no such thing <br>  they teach it in college tho <br>  get sent to principal's office and have to sit in recess at recess for a week <br><br>Some teachers have always been shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>congratulation<br><br>now happy?</br></br></br>  <br>2-5=3<br>somehow the same two again? 2+8=10+3=13??<br>where the fuck does the second 2 come from? Why can i use the same two twice to subtract from five and add to 8?!?

I'm nothing like a fanatic of "old-school" unfair relation of humiliating kids and stuff but something was different in those days. Kids were not brainwashed 12h/day buy TV commercial, stupid TV shows and pseudo-hedonist propaganda. Clearly our societies send a wrong message to children : "Be stupid, be happy." and you can not expect schools to fix that.  <br>know this feel so well, exept im not poor and my mom is an engineer so she fucked up the stupid teachers</br>  <br><br>I feel I can relate to your struggle. I did the majority of the calculations in my head and then gave the answer. But my teachers would complain. Sometimes lower my score because I didn't "show my work". Bullshit. Fuck that. My one teacher gave up and just started accepting my answers only because she realized I wasn't going to comply and it wasn't fair because the answers were often right.</br></br>  <br>If you people think this shit is new you don't remember 90% of the busy work you were fed as a child.</br>  <br>LIIIIVE IN IGNORANCE AND PURRRRCHASE YOUR HAPPYNESS</br>  <br>I don't really understands wheres the problem to be honest.<br>what the fuck is a friendly number and why someone had to find it?</br></br>  <br>Jesus Christ.

If there are 2 friend, both 4 and 6 would work. However, if there are 3 friends, only 6 would work. Thus, the answer is 6. (NOTE: There cannot be any more than 3 friends, as that would equate to an unsolvable problem with the choices given, and the question doesn't allow for than answer.)</br></br></br>  <br>wat</br>  <br>Twelve, duh.<br><br>Assume n stickers per bag where n is a positive integer, and [4,6] friends will be showing up.<br><br>4 = 2x2<br>6 = 3x2<br><br>3x2x2 = 12<br><br>4 friends get 3n stickers each; 6 friends get 2n stickers.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shut up EU next thing you know we will be called numberist for implying Numbers dont have feelings or identities</br>  <br><br>Is this real?<br><br>This is like Idiocracy;<br><br> If I have two buckets and one bucket holds 2 liters of water and the other bucket holds 1 liter of water, how many buckets do I have <br><br>Also;<br><br> Make 10 <br><br> Make 10 <br><br>Meine sides are in orbit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>but you dont need to be able to calculate in your head<br>you need to know what you are doing and how thinks work together so you can let the computer do the generic stuff</br></br>  <br>you fool! <br>you were supposed to write 20 without counting to exercise your blind obedience to the machine. thats why you got it wrong retard.</br></br>  <br>But anon...where is the friendly ten at...The friends dont matter only finding a way to make ten matters... F-</br>  <br>What if she has five friends? Or seven? Or thirteen? I'm upset.</br>  <br>the question is how many stickers she should buy, not how many bags of stickers she needs.</br>  <br>Do the pupils get it, though? They should have written "either 4 or 6 friends will show up".

Common core education, folks.  <br>took me ages to figure out that the answer is C, after reading other anons say it's C.<br><br>Why would this ever be helpful?</br></br></br>  Common Core is a list of standards, nothing more. It does not dictate how it is to be taught. The bad worksheets here are at fault of the textbook companies who made them, not of the Common Core Standards.  <br>Because the question is to have a 10 in the process of adding 8+5. <br><br>The final answer is 13, obviously. <br><br>The question wants kids to break down addition into 8+2+3.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>also german here<br>they cant do it in gymnasium<br><br>but i had this teacher in elementary school<br><br>mrs. schmitt<br>this fucking bitch did exactly the same thing</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sadly, yes. It's not important to get to the right result as long as you did it with the unnecessary long und wrong way</br>  <br>Actually the answer could vary.<br>What is the domian of x, is x real?</br></br>  Your kid is a dumb cunt  <br>Computers and cash registers already do math for us. Where the hell is this math applicable?</br>  <br>But..why ?<br>What is the pedagogical interest in this ?</br></br>  <br>this is exactly what happened to me up until about halfway through highschool and every single math teacher I had up until then despised me because I never put down any work on paper, I did it all in my head. And it was bullsiht that I had to write out 6 extra steps just because the teacher asked me to when I already know the answer in my head</br>  <br><br>If this is true, then explain some of the standards and also please explain why no one I've yet met has seen these horrible methods before Common Core?</br></br>  <br><br>Yea I tried to fight it but the school admins said there was 'no evidence' and that 'we can't change a teachers final grade'</br></br>  <br><br>Nope, C. Which you should know without knowing this method, because 15 - 7 is 8.<br><br>The core idea of this method is to break down questions that normally require memorization (I just remember that 15 - 7 = 8, because I've done it a million times in my life) into mutiple questions that also require memorization but which a young student can master quickly (any second grader can be taught all 0 through 10 subtraction combinations in a week). <br><br>I don't know if it's a better way to teach it, but I recognize that me intuitively thinking it's worse doesn't mean it nevessarily is.<br><br>Nevertheless, I want to see test scores and compare effectiveness.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks for taking the time to explain that, I didn't realize it but yeah I totally do that all the time to finish off the last couple digits in big numbers.<br>Given 17 + 26 I would totally rather think of half of 6 being 3 and 3 +7 being 10,,, plus the remainder of 3 is 13 which when added to the other 30 is just 43. Guess it's simple, the "Make 10" problem just seems way too basic, maybe we can think of more than just 7 peanuts?</br></br>  <br>just in case you want to aim higher than working in a supermarket.</br>  <br>China being so great...<br><br><br> Why would this ever be helpful? <br>It is not. It dumbs down smart kids and makes them more suitable to become drones in the future. Free thinking is the worst enemy for any regime.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you fucking idiot, it's not being "used twice"<br>they're splitting 5 into two seperate numbers<br>2 and 3<br>then adding them seperately<br>you get 3 from 5 by subtracting 2, and you get 2 from 5 by subtracting 3.<br>It's not being "used", that's just how they split it</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Im a french fag and what the hell is a common core. Is it a commonly found core?</br>  <br><br>0/10</br></br>  <br>Smart kid, you were. I never got along with the stupid teachers, either. However, there were some great teachers that loved to teach and they pushed me.</br>                <br><br>It is trying to teach kids how to add by breaking up numbers to make it quicker and easier.<br><br>If you want to add two numbers it is easy to get to the nearest factor of 10 then add the rest.<br><br>ex: 8+57 57+3 = 60 60+5 = 65<br><br>Sorry you dumbfucks were never taught efficient ways to do things</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can't be the only one who has the teacher pictured as a woman</br>  <br>top kek</br>  <br> Johnson we need you to do these accounting numbers! <br> uhh boss this computer is not set for commoncore math... <br> the fuck just type it in dipshit! </br></br></br>  <br>The answer is C. You people act like breaking down numbers into pieces for calculations is unheard of. I do it really frequently when adding large numbers or large groups of small numbers. I was never taught how to do it, it just makes managing normally unwieldy problems easier. They're just teaching the young uns this now instead of making them figure that shit out themselves.</br>  <br>The Common Core Standard associated with the worksheet in the original post () simply requires that one "Know number names and the count sequence." The way that the worksheet writer chose to teach this was incredibly bad, and it could've been taught in any way that the teacher wanted. This time, it seems, the teacher decided to choose a shitty workbook instead of simply teaching the students to count to 20.</br>  <br>OR I COULD NOT BE A FUCKING RETARD AND DO 7+8 = 15 IN MY HEAD AND ADD THAT TO 50 GOD DAMN I'M FUCKING 12 AND I GET THIS SHIT, TEACHERS ARE RETARDED</br>  <br><br>Exactly. I paid attention in class and successfully learned what the teachers were teaching me. I demonstrated this by correct answers on tests/quizzes. Why would I show the teacher their own shit? How the fuck do they think I know the answers? They fucking taught me it. Either I paid attention and will get the answers right or I did not pay attention and will get them wrong.<br><br>Also, my handwriting is fucking atrocious.

I still have correspondence with a few via facebook. There are people out there doing some great work.<br><br>Funny how every single on of them loathes the new common core though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Mostly because your way of doing this is not necessary.</br>  <br>was thinking a little higher than that...</br>  <br>Why not use this old variation that does basically the same without looking fully retarded to anyone beyond the age of 16?</br>  <br> mfw /pol/ was right </br>  <br>Answer is 2<br>How many stickers can she buy so they booth get the same amount. Actually, any even number would do. Just depends on Juanita's budget.</br></br>  <br>yep</br>  <br><br>But that was hardly a bad example compared to most in this thread (and others I have seen in other threads).<br><br>I went to a few different schools due to poorfag and had to move a bunch. None of the schools I went to had convoluted bullshit problems and methodology that I see in these problems. It is only since Common Core was adopted. I'm thinking you're mistaken.</br></br></br></br>  <br>8+5 = 13. dont worry about this shit.<br><br>(if you're still worryng, its the 2 you took from 5 in the first step)</br></br></br>   year 8 <br> teacher teaching decimals (shit we were taught years ago) <br> 123.456 for example, she said it was 1 hundredths, 2 tenths, 3 ones, (decimal), 4 oneths, 5 tenths, 6 hundredths <br> tell her oneths doesn't exist, decimals start at tenths <br> get told to shut up and that I'm wrong <br>Some teachers are just retarded.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because that is not what common core is about. Common core is about doing what you are told.</br>  <br> forcing white privilege down the superior common core educated throats of children </br>  <br>Don't have a clue, but at least I understand now. <br><br>From what I've heard, common core focuses on the actual process of problem solving than just getting the right answer</br></br></br>  <br>It's one of these "new methods" that claims the original way to do math is "too complex" and tries to dumb down everything, adding new dysfunctional features in the process<br><br>The idea behind this is that "hard is bad". One can not be a good teacher if one takes children for retards, because doing so will actually make them retarded.</br></br></br>  <br>die arbeiten in der oberstufe musst du nach spätestens 2 oder 3 wochen zurückbekommen und die abiturprüfung an sich bekommst du erst nach 10 jahren wieder, allerdings kannst du schon einige monate nach erhalt der hzb einsicht verlangen, die dir dan gewährt werden muss</br>  <br>10^0 = 1</br>  <br>kek'd and check'd<br>goddamn jews</br></br>  <br><br>Dunno.

So many schools out there are really shitty and make it very hard too fail. In high school, you honestly couldn't fail 7th or 8th grade. I failed 3 classes in 7th and 4 classes in 8th, I still got too pass. My parents tried too get me too repeat but the principal said it was a bad idea and got my parents too let me pass.<br><br>I did nothing all year, I hardly took down any notes, wrote random shit on my tests, I didn't hand in any projects, and I got too pass, what the fuck is wrong with our education system</br></br>  <br><br>Seeing this brought a smile to my face. Simple, effective methods that work. If you cannot do it in your head (and you should learn to), this method works fantastically.</br></br>  <br>they basically have people write out what you do kinda subconsciously in your brain.typically you cant look at 15-7 and know 8 instantly like you would know 2+2. you first subtract 5 from 15 because thats an even number you can do in your head. then you subtract the remainder 2 from the 10 that you got from subtracting 5 from 15. its a long drawn out process thats teaching kids to not think in their head, but rather outloud.</br>  <br>In most countries it is ALREADY the case<br>Who never got a math teacher scolding them for not "developping" the answer to a problem enough ?</br></br>  <br>I understand what they want.What i fail to see is the make up the logic as you go with a set problem.<br>8+5 cannot make ten that is correct. There is no point to problems you can just take apart and make them work however you want.</br></br>  <br><br>But why are you adding the 3?<br><br>The 3 is completely redundant.<br><br>You've already "made 10" with 8+2.<br><br>No need to go any further.<br><br>If you add the 3, you then need to deduct it. So adding it in the first place is pointless.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's 12 bags you fucking idiots. If she has six friends, they each get 2 bags. If she has 4 friends,they each get 3....</br>  <br>i may think wrong but the problem is how to make 10 when adding 8+5 and the response is to add 8+5 to -3. They don't talk about subtraction or division, the problem said adding.</br>  or<br>5=3+2<br>8+2+3=15<br>im your teacher</br></br></br>  <br>You're not seeing the whole picture, anon. If it's a copyrighted, for-profit product, they'll be able to file a DMCA against any small blogger or Youtuber who uses real examples of their tests to criticize their product.</br>  <br>Sorry, I work in the education field. I'm definitely not wrong. The reason why there is more emphasis on this type of work is because nowadays the importance of the number sense is being emphasized. Activities like these help enhance your number sense by teaching you how to deal with numbers in different ways, and simplify them, without affecting the final result. As a whole, it is beneficial to developing a student's number sense. Furthermore, if one were to read the FAQ in plain sight at http://www.corestandards.org/about-<wbr>the-standards/myths-vs-facts/, they would clearly see that this is not the case, and I quote: "Teachers know best about what works in the classroom. That is why these standards establish what students need to learn but do not dictate how teachers should teach. Instead, schools and teachers will decide how best to help students reach the standards."</wbr></br>  <br>x © (your full name, credit card information, address, size of sister's tits)</br>  <br><br>My brain sadly does this automatically.
