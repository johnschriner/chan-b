It's guaranteed money. Hollywood has been shit for quite some time. Indie/foreign films are where it's at.</br>  <br>All our (America's) best films have been rip-offs of ideas from foreign films. We flooded the world with our knockoff shit and caused other nations to lower their standards. Now we're out of things to rip off, so we're just remaking shit and pumping out sequels, prequels, and adaptations of teen angst books and every obscure comic out there.<br><br>The United States is culturally and creatively bankrupt. This is just another sad example.</br></br></br>  <br>not really, im sure it will be funny. The chick on the far left is actually really good in most if not all movies i have seen her in<br><br>They are having an all male ghostbusters as well, so it should be chill</br></br></br>  <br>please have proof pic.</br>   Remember, don't cross the beams! <br> And I said don't clash orange and brown, but you didn't listen to me! </br>  <br>It's not Hollywood, it's made by Bavaria studios, the same guys who produced the original</br>  <br>wow.....</br>  <br>Mad Yuropoor detected.<br><br>Keep gulping down our semen.</br></br></br>  <br>houston, we have a newfag.</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>whos that?<br> there was never a female ninja turtle so cant be anything like that<br>you must be cosplaying a a rule 63 leonardo</br></br></br>  <br>it won't and we all know it.<br> inb4 it wins the oscar for best feminism. <br> internal sadness. </br></br></br>  <br>I'm from the U.S., duder. Look at the ten highest grossing American films last year. Transformers 4 ripped the world a new asshole, and the only movie that wasn't a prequel, sequel, or otherwise franchise affiliated was Interstellar.</br>  This is what PC faggotry gets you /b/.

Ha ha nice.</br>  <br>and somehow that makes it not hollywood?<br>its still a fucking movestudio working in the industry anon whats your fucking point?</br></br>  <br>Bad news is that the franchise is being raped and murdered like a two dollar hooker<br>the good news is that we can generate enough electricity from Harold Ramis' spinning corpse to power the eastern seaboard</br></br>  <br>Bollocks m8, you'll be torrenting it like the rest of us.</br>  <br>Have you seen it?</br>  <br> Dan Aykroyd </br>  <br> apologize for being white <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=6Cm<wbr>zT4OV-w0</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>you are fucking retarded and only see what you want to see (im guessing you are a closet cuck)</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you do realize most of the white cuck bullshit is a meme right?<br>ive checked out his stuff and so far ninety percent of it is him complaining that kids and society in general are fucking stupid</br></br>  <br>So why don't you? Think of the money.<br><br>She's called Venus.</br></br></br>  <br>So they are remaking Das Boot? I bet they will have a transgender captain and a black hero in it.</br>  <br>Hollywood is nothing but creatively bankrupt and predictable.<br><br>Even GOOD basis/settings that get turned into films are ruined.<br><br>I mean, World of Warcraft film is out next year, you know as well as I do how shit that will be, even with a decent director onboard.</br></br></br></br></br>  i wouldnt even be that mad if they made a cast of actually funny women like amy poehler tina fey maybe lena dunham etc. but these 4 are not funny in any circumstances   Movie crashes and burns <br> Studio gets to blame female cast for not attracting enough interest <br> Get to shut up feminists about "muh stronk female characters in movies!" for at least a year or two <br> SUCCESS.jpg </br></br></br>  <br>same company, different shot-callers?</br>  Why a fat black niggress? Why not Halle Berry? Wtf  <br>  </br>  <br>Cause getting into Hollywood is less about talent and more about contacts.<br><br>Furthermore, lots of shit I'd want to write would end up being discarded anyway. Not to mention that writers never get any credit for a films success, it's the director.<br><br>I'd love to do it, but, I'd want to put a lot more nudity and sex in it and that's automatically bad cause it doesn't sell.<br><br>That's why kid films have lots of adult jokes thrown in, it's for the adults to laugh at something only they get cause they're forced to be there with the kids.<br><br>Also, I suck at writing.

She'll probably be the only thing good about this. <br><br> Leslie Jones <br>She's not funny. Her stand up is pure shite. Her SNL performances are lazy and unfunny. <br><br> Melissa McCarthy <br>Don't like her, I don't know why. She's not totally unfunny, I just hate her face.<br><br> Kate McKinnon <br>Terrible on SNL, but again, not totally unfunny. <br><br>Not going to waste my time with this shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>dude are you talking shit about Mars Attacks? cuz if you are, I'm going to kick your ass irl.</br>  <br><br>You don't have to like what I like<br><br>Just asking</br></br></br></br>  <br>Still dont get what's so wrong about it</br>  <br>Are you really this stupid because you just WANT to believe that?<br><br>Look bro, that shit is Louis C.K. literally saying white people are going to get it for oppressing blacks, and that we deserve it. He's literally saying being white is awesome because we all oppress niggers. There is no wiggling room, there.<br><br>Of course, this shit makes it absolutely hilarious that feminists still want to take this cuck down. Dude exposes himself to interns, and no amount of cucking is going to get feminists to ignore a middle-aged white comedian committing sexual assault.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mars Attacks was not a sci-fi movie it was a comedy movie (a damn good one) it was a 'taking the piss' movie. It was not a clever movie, but it didn't have to be, it was good anyway. Because it succeeded at what it needed to succeed at.</br>  &lt; the receptionist for the ghostbusters  <br> nobody has noticed Kate looks like Justin Bieber dressed up like that </br>  <br>I hope this movie flops, I can't stand that fucking whale --- how is she funny? then again I don't think ellen is funny either.</br>  <br><br>Nah, I love that movie.<br><br>I'm just saying, Interstellar is a smart sci-fi movie for people who've only ever seen pew-pew shoot the aliens movies.

Get it? Get it? It's funny, right? Right?</br>  <br> I hope this movie flops <br>Jurassic World - arguably one of the shittiest films released in years - made a killing and is still kicking ass at the box office.<br><br>The American people have spoken, and they want hot shit funneled down their gullets. <br><br>You'd better believe this GB remake is going to break some fucking records.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Theyre hair pieces that bald women named Kristen use.</br>  <br>really? So like, in a universe where Harold Ramis is still alive, Bill Murray is all about reprising his role, original writing staff, and using all four original GB's - you wouldn't be interested in that?</br>  <br>So u telling me that the only reason u liked the original was that it was about white guys?</br>  <br>███╗░░░██╗██╗░██████╗░░██████╗░████<wbr>███╗██████╗░███████╗ ████╗░░██║██║██╔════╝░██╔════╝░██╔═<wbr>═══╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝ ██╔██╗░██║██║██║░░███╗██║░░███╗████<wbr>█╗░░██████╔╝███████╗ ██║╚██╗██║██║██║░░░██║██║░░░██║██╔═<wbr>═╝░░██╔══██╗╚════██║ ██║░╚████║██║╚██████╔╝╚██████╔╝████<wbr>███╗██║░░██║███████║ ╚═╝░░╚═══╝╚═╝░╚═════╝░░╚═════╝░╚═══<wbr>═══╝╚═╝░░╚═╝╚══════╝</wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>fucking fail</br>  <br>maybe 10 years ago, but they are just too old now.

Bam, cut print, wait for money tsunami.</br>  <br>Women.<br>Aren't.<br>Funny.</br></br></br>  <br>only found out about mexican spidey a few weeks ago because im a Marvel Cinematic Universe fag and cant be asked to buy and read comics. Got so fucking mad</br>  <br>That's like saying men can't be smarter than girls. Fucking ignorant plain and simple.</br>    <br>The reason people liked the originals is because they are fucking good, funny, and have talented people in them.</br>  You're Goddamn right I am. The fuck were they thinking?  <br>Tell that to Roseanne...Tina Fey, Joan Rivers etc...</br>  Ghostbusters 2016<br> Aka Orange is the New Black gets haunted </br>  <br> implying so much </br>  <br>Cuz GB2 was epic? That baby was a rockstar</br>  As long as they include a humorous cameo with the remaining former stars I could care less.  <br>fuck it this is a Mars Attacks thread now<br><br> woah, they just made the international symbol of the donut! </br></br></br>  This movie will be shit like all unoriginal hollywood remakes.  <br>Only Murray was funny the rest were a yawn...imo!</br>  <br>dude there you go, that sounds waay better than the piece of shit they're actually making</br>  <br>Joss Whedon pls go back to tumblr</br>  <br>p<br>e<br>a<br>s<br>a<br>n<br>t</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>That movie legitimately gave me nightmares for years.</br>  <br>looks like a fun movie</br>  <br>Wow what an amazing fucking story. School sure is out.</br>  <br><br>I liked Interstellar a lot, and some (probably bogus) Official Certifying Institutions, administering SATs and PhDs, provide some support for the inference that I am not totally stupid... but I agree with you - the "love" thread in that movie was a major detractor from the cool wormhole and black hole visuals. But I kind of liked the bit where Capt. Matt criticized the gooey love bullshit - Nolans having it both ways, I guess.<br><br>I love Europe, by the way.</br></br></br></br>  <br>LOL, people thinking tina fey, Roseanne and joan rivers are funny is the only thing funny about them</br>  childhood ruined    <br>Also Wiig's character is a brilliant author who writes about ghosts being real but then gets laughed out of a professorship because she wrote a book about ghosts. Fortunately she's right all along and she can take revenge on the people who wronged her by taking care of all the ghosts that invade manhatten.<br><br>Fuck this atrocious movie.</br></br></br>  <br>Feminist version of Misfits?</br>  ew feminism  <br>all that did was make me feel like shit... i need implants</br>  <br>I came here from the pic and Twitter... What is this u speak of?</br>  <br>agreed</br>  <br>Pffft, nigga please, these washed up hollywood bozos cant touch my childhood memories.</br>  <br>....well Im gonna go jerk off</br>  <br>Summertime</br>  <br><br>word...</br></br>  Anons who give you shit about speaking out against feminist/black agenda are more than likely shill trying to scrape the shit off of the walls of the Internets toilet so don`t fall for it and continue to rage over this bullshit.  <br>Tina Fey was awesome as Palin, admit it u lol'd!</br>  <br>Nothing you just typed makes any sense whatsoever. Congratulations.</br>  <br>Tina Fey can be funny, but I'm pretty biased because she's the sort of hot I like. Also, she looks a little like Sarah Palin / Lisa Ann, who also do something for that part of me that likes MILFS. <br><br>Otherwise yeah.</br></br></br>  <br>And the living is eeeeaasssyyyyy.....</br>  <br>this really cheered me up, thanks anon</br>  <br> i will wait to downloading ilegally. so, not mad.</br>  <br> We come in peace </br>  <br>Have u seen him now???</br>  <br>mfw women and minorities are hoping to become relevant by appropriating white male properties</br>  <br>3 of them are. Wiig just isn't on it anymore.</br>  <br>that is more or less a carbon copy of the original plot, where they get kicked out of their university for saying ghosts are real, but then they are right and take revenge by getting rid of ghosts in manhatten.<br>Carbon. Fucking. Copy. might as well just re-release the original on blu-ray or something.</br></br>  <br>If it's funny and well written I couldn't honestly give a shit about the casting.</br>  <br>B is changing u don't like it do u?</br>  Tina Fey is only funny when doing impersonations or spitting out lines written by men.<br><br>The people behind her are the funny ones, and her looks do half the work for her.</br></br>  <br>This. Don't care if she's gay.</br>  <br>Not understanding that Jurassic World made a fortune because big dumb movies with unimportant dialogue sell better to foreign markets</br>  <br>that's called a remake and yes, it'll suck.</br>  <br>hahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahhahah<wbr>ah<br>looks like an tumblr meetup</br></wbr></br>  <br> a white shaft <br>that'll be the day</br></br>  <br>the original starts off with them already being at a university, though Murray gets kicked out because he actually is incompetent and just likes to fuck his students.<br><br>The new version has her rise to the position of professor. Also, after getting kicked out, Murray didn't give two shits about losing his job.

I said that a few posts back, dicklord.<br>See<br/></br></br>  <br>He's cracked the code! Get him!</br>    <br>Wait.. they're all women? That doesn't even make any sense. How can you only trap ghosts in the kitchen?</br>  <br>remake is made by an german studio so there is still hope</br>  <br>Many comedians have writers...</br>  I heard they are doing a remake of What's Eating Gilbert Grape, starring Jayden Smith as the retard.  <br>you are a faggot to be territorial about your shitposting, sperglord</br>  <br>pics? Im sure they're great.</br>  <br>An German studio.......you heard it here first boys</br>  There are literally hundreds of ArianaGrande fans on b now...I kid u not.  <br>yea, but tina fey's expression and overall delivery is just bland and boring</br>  <br><br>In my opinion Kristen Wiig is fucking hot.</br></br>  <br> Taking bait <br> 2015 </br></br>  <br>It doesn't even fucking matter at this point.<br><br>From the way I see it, it's just Dan Akroyd attaching life support to a dying dream. Let's just hope this isn't as bad as Blues Brothers 2000.</br></br></br>  <br>Sorry I hurt your feelers, anon.</br>  <br>None of those could handle a ghostnigger</br>  <br>Also, I should add what my point was because I see that might not have been clear: <br><br>Because the movie now stars an all female cast, the focus of the movie shifts to how we should admire them for the intellectual success and the careers that (should) represent that.

We go on teamspeak a lot and play games together and have a really fun time and all that fun stuff that people in their early 20's do. We have some friends from another country that like to join us, and we've met them several times before and hung out and stuff. It was all good fun.<br><br>Turns out those friends came over to our country for a week today to meet us, and not a single one of them told me about it. I questioned the one guy out of our little group that I knew was a true friend, and he says he brought it up with them but they apparently shrugged it off and basically said "who cares about him."<br><br>So here I am, crying on the internet to people I don't even know about the people who I thought were great guys and good friends that don't actually give two shits about me. The hangover at work tomorrow is gunna be a bitch.
