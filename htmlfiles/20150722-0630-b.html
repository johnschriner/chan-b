If you're going to do eugenics, at least think of the big picture. Imagine you're ruling from your genetically superior superfortress, getting the "lower class" ubermensch to do all the manual labour. If they're smart, they'll be able to overthrow you and give themselves rights.<br>That's not good at all, now is it, Mr. Smartypants?<br><br>What you want is create different breeds of humans. The workers would be weak willed, slow-witted hulks who can follow orders. The smartest workers/best leaders would be put into positions of management over the other workers. <br>The hyperintelligent "uber-ubermensch" would be the ruling class. They wouldn't do physical work, and they'd be smart enough to keep the workers in check, while at the same time maintaining the social order that they have worked so hard to create. They would be the benevolent oligarchs of this genetic paradise, the scientists and great thinkers.<br><br>The Workers provide for the Thinkers and the Thinkers provide the Workers with technology and innovation.<br><br>You could have other breeds as well, specially bred for different tasks. Perhaps amphibious ultra-mexicans that can perform underwater construction work for minimum wage. <br><br>Git gud, scrub.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>But if you're not a Christian, why care what they consider sin?</br></br>  <br> Ugly fat nerds think if a girl talks to him, it's love. Then he smothers her with creepy attention until she has to set him straight. He then proclaims he is a nice guy and she is a cunt. <br><br>I've never seen it explained so well and in so few words. Good job, anon<br><br>I have an ex-friend who would systematically do this to every girl who spoke to him. It was astonishing. He would also get so fucking buttmad if you told him to chill. One time we were out, and there was this lesbian couple with us, and he started trying it with one of them. I could not fucking believe it. She said "Jacob, in case it wasn't obvious enough, I'm gay. And you just made me gayer." From then on she was a "harpy bitch". Later on another girl in our friendship group didn't respond well to his groping, so she was an "ice queen residing in her ivory tower and looking down on us mere mortals. Bitch"<br><br>I'm not friends with him anymore. Fuck that guy</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> ice queen residing in her ivory tower and looking down on us mere mortals </br>  <br> cont. <br><br>I should also add he's fat and ugly.

Why wouldn't you hang with him?<br><br>The lesbian part made me laugh.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I totally nailed it!</br>    <br><br>Seriously, I can never understand how bronies are even a thing and how new people decide to join the movement. It's the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen and they all show it off proudly.</br></br>  <br>All that aside, he was generally unbearable. Like I said, he was easily butthurt. Any time you disagreed with him about anything he'd ragequit the social event and write on his blog about how the world is fucked up and he's an unappreciated genius. If I hadn't met him when I was like 12 but as an adult instead I never would have gotten close to him. Such a difficult human being</br>  <br>Those skinny jeans tho</br>  <br> I think the whole friendzone thing is a fat desperate nerd thing <br>yeah it pretty much is</br></br>  <br>Interestingly enough this is the same "It's not my skill that's holding me back, it's my team" mentality. It's just blatant delusion at this point.</br>  <br>kek</br>  <br> alpha as fuck <br>apparently having a girlfriend makes you 'alpha as fuck'. well maybe it does to a kissless virgin like anon here</br></br>  <br>This. Fucking this, we're all raised at some point believing that manners and politeness will win us everything, me included. Thing is once you go into real life you realize that's bullshit, I assume those "nice guys" are people whose parents overprotected them.<br><br>Bronies per se are uncommon here (Mexico) although I know a guy who likes it, so I guess it has to do with the US being the main audience.
