I wouldnt if I had to pay for it, but it's free and that's pretty cool. Hopefully it's not a cluster fuck and all my shit will run on the new OS.  <br>Not yet, because I'm a pirate, waiting for pirate version!</br>  Yes because Windows 8 is fucking awful unless you have a tablet.  <br> 7 ate 9 <br>that`s the most cancerous shit pun i have ever heard</br></br>  <br><br>That's retarded.</br></br>  <br>jesus christ anon, its fucking free...</br>  <br>implying some one cares</br>  yes of course. im also waiting to upgrade my phone until the next gen windows 10 mobile devices come out because im a raging faggot. i really enjoyed my lumia 920 before i broke it a year or two ago. . im looking forward to the 950  <br> jealous he didn't say it </br>  <br>No you fucking nigger, its not free!</br>  <br>windows 8 is ruining my life. can't wait for 10</br>  <br>Admit it, you laughed.</br>  <br>me as well. i will skip 8 and 9.</br>  <br>download windows activator tool<br><br>download windows 10</br></br></br>  I'm already running it. It's the Windows that has converted me from a Linux user. I really like it. Would definitely recommend. Especially to anyone running xp/7/8<br><br><br>The final release is already on torrent sites. See pic.</br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you proprietary slave? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class at Harvard, and I’ve been involved in numerous free software projects, and I have contributed to over 300 core-utils for GNU. I am skilled in Lisp and I’m St. IGNU-cius, saint of the Church of Emacs. You are nothing to me but just another unethical non-free software advocate. I will distribute the fuck out of your source code with freedom the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit about me and the GPL on the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my colleagues at FSF and your binaries are being reversed engineered right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your copyright. You're fucking dead, kid. Free software can be anywhere, anytime, and it can ensure your freedom in over four ways, and that’s just with the GPLv2. Not only am I extensively skilled at C hacking, but I have access to the source of the entire GNU userland and core-utils and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable proprietary code off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what ethical retribution your little “clever” program was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have ensured your users' freedom. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit free as in freedom all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.</br>  <br> implying it will be any better </br>  <br>It is in fact free</br>  <br>nigger your computer is a toaster and you play runescape<br><br>you are a fucking cuck if i've ever seen one<br>probably a strict console only gamer<br><br>go fuck yourself retard<br><br>tell me one reason why 8 or 10 beats 7<br>besides 7 8 9</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>only if you have genuine 7 or 8<br><br><br>I will be upgrading for many reasons:<br>league fag but it microstutters on linux<br>received free win8 key<br>win8 is shit</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>like if that worked.</br>  <br> no icon but recycle bin <br>Kill yourself</br></br>  <br>I'm gonna test it on my laptop first. If I like it I'll upgrade my rig as well.</br>  <br>GNU?</br>  <br>lol same. im staying on 7 forev</br>  <br>Your jimmies seem to be rustled my friend</br>  What if Windows 10 is meant to kill US, like in this movie, Kingsman?<br>Maybe that's Why it's free?</br>  <br>I'm not sure if this is how it works. I mean, they even said that upgrading to windows 10 won't make false licenes into real licenses. They're only giving it out free if your licence can be authenticated.<br><br>In other words: You'll need to re-authenticate when W10 has been released with a new activator tool.</br></br></br>  <br>nah<br>waiting for 15.10</br></br>  <br>Stay with 7, if you are a gamer, they are supporting it untill 2019 anyway, 8 is shit, especially for games, seems to be a trend with windows, 1 good OS then one bad, 10 will be good and gamers should get it, but it will have no use untill games start using hyper threading more and DX12 becomes the thing.</br>  <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU</br>  I don't typically think it's a good idea to be an early adopter on any OS. There's ALWAYS hiccups, and you're pretty much an unpaid tester for the developers.<br>Also, mandatory updates that I can't skip or Download when I choose?<br>No thanks.</br></br>  Windows is just an old fading dream in the back of my memory. Rather use linux or buy a mac,, I remember Microsoft, and I remember who they are. Crooks. Indifferenxe to anything they release or trying to cram down the throats of the public.  <br>Yes. Anyone who stays with 7 is retarded. Especially if you're a gamer (DX12). It's free and it's better.</br>  <br>Still on 7</br>  <br>dont have wikipedia, sorry. How can i buy it.</br>  <br>Have fun with all of that great compatible software................. ha</br>  Dear Windows 10-tards,<br>Enjoy your subscription-based OS.</br>    <br><br> 2015 <br> Never hearing that joke <br><br>Shit, son... it's been around since the 20s.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Only if you fucking have a windows 7 or 8 nigga!</br>  <br> Your computer is a toaster <br><br>This is my laptop. I obviously have a desktop, but couldn't be asked to migrate over to Win10 yet with all that shit on it. Gotta wait til I have time next weekend to do that. Also<br><br> Knowing that random R is Runescape when it can be anything <br><br>:^) caught u in a snafu my friend.<br><br>It's better than 7 because it seems better optimized (On my laptop's shit hardware), and has a lot of neat features. Also it looks much better. I can't speak for 8, because I've never used it, but 10 doesn't have that metro shit so there you go. Settle down anyway you neckbearded fuck.<br><br><br>Why would I have those when I can just open the start menu?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yea, whatever, now get the fuck out</br>  <br>Exactly what I'm doing</br>  <br>subscriptition?</br>  <br>I never tried to sort out why they skipped 9 but...<br>Jesus this joke is fucking bad</br></br>  there's no good games coming out on dx12 though, so why would i switch? i'm on win7 atm but i may go to win98 soon  <br>Install gentoo</br>  <br>kinda like mac os, free upgrades, the license just kinda serves as your subscription ticket i guess</br>  Windows look like shit  <br> still believing a rumor that was debunked a year ago </br>  <br>can somebody hack it?</br>  <br><br>it can't be worse. it looks like someone in their 20's works there now</br></br>  <br>You made me kek and I hate you for that</br>  what happens if i download w10? will my applications on 8 still run? and other files etc.  <br>is this virus?</br>  <br>It's not subscription based retard.</br>  <br>nothing will change except the OS</br>  only if she's walking around on the desktop  <br><br>Microsoft's bullshit reason is "Windows 10 is the best and last, a solid 10", but I think they skipped 9 for compatibility issues. A lot of software that has 9x compatibility mode will see windows 9 as 95 or 98 and fuck up compatibility.</br></br>  <br>It's to avoid a lot of old programs which use the 9 digit to check 9x or xp compatibility.<br>Eg.<br>if $windowsversion = 9* then<br>A while ago someone did a global github search and found hundreds of projects using similar code.<br><br><br>And not yet and as i have win7 home i won't be upgrading, i'll be getting win10 pro instead as automatic updates installation without the ability to disable it is too fucking risky.<br>I wait at least 1 week after each batch of windows updates and then google each KB number before installing them. These days it's too risky to simply trust them not to fuck it up; see the recent kernal updates which borked machines up as a prime example.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>kek, well i suppose you're right, It's only uphill from windows 8</br>  Fair warning for all gamers: your games will not fucking work, my games keep having GRAPHICAL DRIVES STOPED WORKING and it does so too alot of fucking games dota, dying light, smite, etc so wait untill it fucking works, about too downgrade back too 7 in 10 minutes wish me luck boys  <br> 2007+8 <br> still using this spyshit of a distro <br>kill yourself</br></br></br>  <br>So everything should still be compatible?</br>  <br>What games are dx12 right now nigga?</br>  <br>9 is nein 'no'</br>  <br>But they upgraded 8 to 8.1</br>  <br>no, most will not be</br>  <br>Maybe cause you aren't using the finished product genius</br>  <br>DirectX is dying, the future is Vulkan.</br>  <br>yea when i was trying the snapshot it felt allot like a bunch of linux features were added to windows very well</br>  <br>aw fuk bye</br>  I already have windows 10 :P  <br>just fixubuntu.com and uninstall some crap apps and it's a great os</br>  <br><br>I have the same issue on windows 7, just do a clean driver install and it'll work. I'm just to lazy to fix it right now since i'm upgrading to W10 in a few days</br></br>  <br>Now doesn't matter, its about a year or two down the road.<br><br><br>Yes</br></br></br></br>  Yeah, I don't really care. I also have Lubuntu on my PC.  <br>yeahright</br>  I'm pretty sure they went to 10 and skipped 9 because the consumer base is a bunch of ignorant fucks. Ultimately it comes down to product support, over any sort of firmware compatibility.  <br>Yes, it's a pretty nice OS in my opinion. I wish that Microsoft would take note from many Linux Desktop Environments though, and let the music player controls integrate with the sound menu.</br>  <br>Yes, it's like a wild african cow sort of thing. Another name for it is "Wildebeest".</br>  <br>already have the tech preview from before it got taken down, it's pretty fucking good, gets rid of the shit from windows 8 and is new and flashy and has a lottttttttttttttt of features that I definitely don't take advantage of. 9/10</br>  <br>My God!!!!</br>  <br> I also have Lubuntu on my PC. <br>How hard was it to install that. I need to do it tomorrow and am undecied about partions (dual boot with xp)</br></br>  <br>pirate it already you fuckin idiots... kickasstorrents has a ton of awesome .isos for you to download..</br>  <br>Have fun with the botware if you choose the free upgrade</br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br><br>There doesn't seem to be an upgrade path from Mint 17.2.</br></br>  <br>please tell me it has an actual start button bar instead of whatever the fuck that full screen tablet looking motherfucker is.</br>  <br>Nope, sticking to 7 until they force me to change</br>  <br>Oh look its this kind of thread. <br>Pleb gathering again.<br>Get on my level.</br></br></br>   using anything else then windows 7   Was going to upgrade regadless.<br>But I'm getting the upgrade for free so obviously I will be updating asap.</br>  Hey guyz, I'm having issues with my technical preview. I'm still stuck on build 9926 or something and the piece of shit won't update. I've tried fast/slow ring, removing the download cache, rebooting 5 quadragintillion times, but no avail. Of course I can just wait for wednesday.  <br>Please stop telling the mouthbreathing idiots who inhabit /b/ that my favorite torrent site exists. These unwashed rejects will just ruin the community with their forced an unfunny meme regurgitation bullshit. Thanks.</br>  <br>check em</br>  <br>Your level looks homosexual and designed for the ignorant.</br>  <br>I'm gonna probably re upgrade back over to linux.<br><br>I put winblows 7 on my home server to use can software(that I don't even use) and the stupid thing crashes every couple hours give or take.<br><br>I ran linux on the same machine and it never crashed. I had it running for months on end with no interruptions.<br><br>Windows is a sorry piece of shit os</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>quite a beautiful operating system</br>  <br>Prove it faggot. And I mean from technical point of view not just because you are poorfag.</br>  <br>Take that cock out of your mouth before posting</br>  <br>Cam software****<br><br>I want to dig up steve jobs and shove this iphone up his ass.<br><br>The damn thing changes what I fucking write. I'm on a have to turn auto correct off cause it's to stupid to do any good.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> let me hate those fags bcs i dont have money </br>  <br>It's a system designed for people who are to stupid to be trusted with maintaining or repairing their own property. It's a system designed for people who don't mind if they get over charged for hardware as long as their software doesn't make them think too hard or remember things. They're for ignorant people like you who need everything explained to them.</br>  NO. None of my products I have are compatible with Windows 10, and they are still barely even compatible with Windows 8.1! Biggest mistake of my life updating from 7.  <br>*too</br>  <br>Kek my 250 dollar Acer laptop can run more games than that shit box</br>  <br>yeah thats why i guess every serious software and programming company has macs in their offices.</br>  <br>Correct<br><br>10 point awarded to gryffindor</br></br></br>  i'll upgrade after a few months when the kinks have been worked out, ad i know that it's as user-friendly as win7 (my current OS).<br><br>when they removed the start bar and made windows touch-friendly even on desk/laptops, i was just like fuck microsoft and their bullshit.<br><br>we'll see.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>it really is thats what i did<br><br>i got sad when they said pirates get a lesser license (and i had pirated windows 7 because my key didnt work on regular windows 7 only a toshiba brand windows 7 or something)<br><br>so i downloaded windows activation tool, certified my windows 7. restarted it and updated 500 updates<br><br>restarted<br><br>1 upate pending for windows 10<br><br>now i have professional windows 10, like i paid toshiba for but toshiba said fuck you</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You realize they only have those in their offices so they can test code on them for when they port their applications from normal computers over to OSX.

I'm pretty sure games are going to be having a major update to support DX12 and new drivers are gonna come with DX12 support. Oh well, we're just beginning. Like you said, we just have to wait until DX12 becomes popular.</br>  <br>In games like osu, running in windowed mode on 8 and 10 gives input lag with tablets because you can't disable aero.</br>  I would upgrade to Win10, used the preview for a while, but I have to wait till 29th to get proper drivers for my gfx card.  <br> tablets <br>kekd</br></br>  Been using Windows 10 since last September.

I'm all out!</br></br></br></br>  Not me, but some guy before election said this:<br><br>I live in Rochdale. Rochdale has 20,000 Pakistanis. I want to vote, but here's a little explanation of my feelings first:<br><br>I cannot open a newspaper or turn on the TV without hearing about how Rochdale Pakistanis have either raped some schoolgirls or gone to join ISIS. I cannot eat fast food without it being Halal in any of the restaurants in the town. When I was at school the only meat option at dinner time was and remains Halal. They are everywhere, and in to everything. My neighbours on either side are Pakistanis. They throw shitty nappies and rubbish out of their open windows in to the garden to rot. They have devalued my house by about L30,000 with their filth. They do nothing but cook curry and flood the drains repeatedly by pouring rice down it, causing damage to my property.<br><br>I go to Tesco, and I see them shoplifting relentlessly. EVERY time I go. From a woman in a black sheet rolling individual eggs down her sleeves from the box, to a man pretending to use the self checkout and essentially just packing his bags full of whatever he wants. Women doing the same. Everyone is afraid to confront them because "racism!" and it's not like the security guards care because surprise - every security guard is a bearded Muslim who allows them to pass without question.<br><br>I want to vote.<br><br>The 2015 election candidates are:<br><br>Azi Ahmed - Conservative Party<br>Farooq Ahmed - Rochdale First Party<br>Simon Danczuk - Labour Party<br>Mohammed Salim - Islam Zinda Baad Platform<br>and Masud Mohammed - UK Independence Party (UKIP)<br><br>Yes, the UKIP candidate is a Pakistani Muslim. Even if I want to vote against them I have to vote for them.<br><br>Oh, and Danczuk may sound like a white name but he frequently raises the Pakistani flag outside the town hall and has nothing but blessings for Islam and grovels to Pakistanis daily. Pic related, it's him leading thousands of them in protest against Israel and the West in general.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I just started collecting this gold</br>  <br><br>Keep posting the ones you got.<br><br>This are awsum.</br></br></br></br>  <br>holy fuck i really hope this isn't 100% truth</br>  <br><br> Google ''who won in rochdale election 2015''. <br> click first link <br> win </br></br></br></br>  <br>oh boi you should just google how women live in muslim countries, my dog lives better and have far more rights</br>  not OP but....bump  think about this ;)      Not exactly islam hate....but it should do.  anyone?  <br><br><br>kek'd quite hard</br></br></br>  <br>checked, tnx Satan</br>    <br><br>the trips have spoken</br></br>  <br>yeah but muh Crusade Wars ammaright? muh jews did this?!</br>  <br> don't make advances  <br> unless your advances are reciprocated <br>Are Satanists really this stupid?</br></br></br>    wouldwatch/10  <br><br>I guess it doesn't say exactly that, but you get the point.</br></br>  <br>Episode 1 season 1.<br>Omar lights Mariya on fire after Marwa refuses to produce another son.</br></br>    <br>ahahah</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Pzu<wbr>sSqcotDw&amp;index=3&amp;list=FLa33qgv1uD6P<wbr>A1Wc0isSirQ</wbr></wbr>  [ ]<br>you guys are welcome</br>  <br>the caveats make the "law" pointless. <br><br>A : mohammedans can murder in "retaliation" for musselmen killed in the crusades for shit's sake, so jihadji murder is always justified<br><br>B : "spreading mischeif" is durka durka code for "saying anything not approved by the imama of your particular sect"<br><br>in conclusion, all prohibitions on barbarism in the koran and hadith are easily overcome with a little sandnigger logic.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  How would you spend $5000?
