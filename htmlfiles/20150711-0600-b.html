She's got no ass, but man I fucking love skin-tight jeans like that</br>  Hey /b/<br><br>You know the drill - send your girlfriend's Kik OR Snapchat name, and I'll test to see if they're faithful.<br><br>Send their names to my Kik (name: rulesapply) and I'll update you privately (or I can post updates in this thread if you ask me to). I won't be testing any names left in the thread due to whiteknights and spammers.<br><br> I've done this quite a few times and people have asked me questions, so I thought I'd take the time out here to give you a brief FAQ. <br><br> "What is your success rate?" <br> Between 60% &amp; 70% on average. <br><br> "Does it have to be my girlfriend?" <br> Nope, friends are fine, or maybe your friend has a girlfriend you think might cheat. <br><br> "What is your method?" <br> It varies from girl to girl, some like beta-as-fuck-sweet-talk, some like hardcore sexting. <br><br> "How big is your dick?" <br> 8 inches when fully hard. It's not the biggest dick in the world, but it's big enough to get unfaithful girls wanting more. <br><br> "Do you always get tits?" <br> No. Some girls simply just don't like sending tits. Once they've started "cheating" though, about 90% of girls WILL. <br><br> "Why won't you take names from the thread, fag?" <br> Well, as I've already said, whiteknights and spammers. WhiteKnights tell the girl that she's on /b/, and spammers will, you guessed it, spam her - meaning that she'll get a massive influx of dicks and sexts, which will mean no results, as she'll just block them all. <br><br> "You haven't responded to me in ages, what gives, asshole?" <br> Either your girlfriend hasn't yet responded/seen the message I sent her yet, or I'm informing others of their girlfriend's loyalty or lack thereof. <br><br> "Why don't you bump the thread more often?" <br> It can be tricky to hold up a thread, talk to 20 different girls AND the guys who requested me to check them, all at once. I do try my best to keep the thread alive, but it can be tricky when I get a large influx of chat messages. If you want to keep it going longer, please bump, it helps. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  bumping!

I was losing my fuckin mind, I thought my friend laced it with something. Ended up calling my parents and my dad was laughing his ass off at me the whole time. Yeah, it takes large amount of an awesome strain, but first timers can get FUCKED</br></br></br></br>  <br>What kind of papers?</br>  I'm smoking on some of that Personal Responsibility. <br><br>You should try it sometime.</br></br>  <br><br>They'll probably have pre-rolled joints, but it'll be a bog standard generic weed. If you want anything decent you'll have to roll your own.<br><br>Off to Amsterdam this time next Friday for the start of a trip round Europe so looking forward to seeing what new varieties are about. Not the biggest fan of cheese or any of those kinda skunks so hoping there's some nice fresh citrusy ones. <br><br>I recommend going to the Greenhouse Effect cafe at the edge of the red light district, its got a nice relaxed atmosphere, they always have a good selection of weed and they do awesome milkshakes</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>check'd and had you been smoking anything else because you either need to be immune to pain or have already gotten lungs of steel to go through 5 blunts in 10 breaths</br>  <br>First time you have to inject it into your anus or you won't get high.</br>  UK Cheese  <br>No he meant there were five taped to eachother and he ashed them to the filte in two puffs, weak ass motherfucker</br>  <br>I just don't get what it is with all you faggots and putting filters in a joint. Fucking bitch ass pussies. I would beat you up and steal your weed if you came at me with anything like that.</br>  <br>Just because you had a panic attack doesn't mean that weed makes you unable to control your fucking self.</br>  Half an ounce of AK47  <br>Sorry for not going tweak mode</br>  <br> filter </br>    <br>Spyder here.<br>Getting pretty danky atm.</br></br>  <br>You are sorry......that's what I was saying. Faggot.</br>  <br>Retard, you can hold it to the very end without needing a pinch like a fucking middle schooler.</br>  <br>really wanna smoke some hash because its way cheaper than weed in UK, what's the difference?</br>  <br>nothing because im not a faggot</br>  Shishkaberry, pretty nice strain. Why smoke flavoured? Totally ruins the taste.  <br><br>4real? sheeeit</br></br>  <br><br>Its not a filter, its a roach. It just holds the end open so the smoke flows better than if it was just the paper. Putting a filter in is bad as it increases the ratio of tar to thc, wasting your weed and making it worse for your lungs</br></br>  <br>Go to Balou, ask for the Cali Mist. Also ask if they have a bong you can use. Thank me later.</br>  <br>Oh you mean because you are a pussy.<br><br><br>That's not a roach you fucking summerfag. I swear, a bunch of bitch niggers smoking weed.,</br></br></br></br>  You people make me sick  <br><br>what sort of jewish faggot smokes flavoured papers?</br></br>  <br>kek</br>  <br>4 times stronger, tastes great.<br><br>Much more enjoyable than bud except you can't roll a joint alone with it.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Hash is the compressed crystals, cannabis oil and dust from the outside of the plant. Good hash can be stronger than some weeds as its concentrated, but it can have other crap added to it to bulk it out. <br><br>Ice hash and polm are good hashes to try, but good old British soapbar can be a good smoke too</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hash is 90% worn out tyres, old vinyl records, tramps boot soles and Chinese men's hair in it if you are smoking UK soapbar. Only Glaswegians smoke that fucking dirt. With their Spesh</br>    <br><br>have trainwreck, wondering how weird things will get after 2 hits of straight keef</br></br>  <br> Smoking all of your weed without having to unroll it like a fucking faggot makes you a pussy <br><br>If I fucking met you I would beat you senseless.</br></br></br>    Guy said it was Pineapple x Grapefruit, tastes delicious.  <br>Jamaican here...stop blazing, its bad for your health and leaves you with no money. Dont be a follower,m and you will be on your way to leaership.</br>  <br><br>Its rolled up piece of card, not a filter.

Don't you think it's bad?</br>  But if I blaze some weed I'm worried I'll hallucinate and freak out and call my mum so not going to smoke some.  <br>You're the pussy faggot for thinking that you roll Weed the same way you roll Tobacco. Fucking tenth grader.</br>        <br><br>Is dat purple haze m8?</br></br>  Selfmade pipes are the best  Help me b<br>I was discussing with my gf about wether or not, in some cases, the girl is at fault in a sense. She said the victim is never at fault.<br>So i used an analogy comparing a girl getting drunk, black out and raped in a party with a guy waving stacks of money in a bad neighbourhood and getting robbed.<br>Copy pasted what i said: <br>You said he was at fault in sense.<br>And i mean, i would even help him find the robber so he can go to prison because i mean his stupidity of going around waving money is not an excuse for the guy that commited a crime. And im in no way blaming him at all. I do, however, think (as you said you think too) what he did is stupid and he should know better.<br>And yea he didnt deserve it at all nor he was asking for it because no one wants to be robbed. <br>But yea he better doesnt go around waving money again cause i wont help him again.<br>Same if it was rape. She is at fault in a sense for doing something stupid(because getting drunk and black out in place full of strangers is stupid, we agreed on this).<br>But again, her stupidity doesnt mean the rapist doesnt deserve to go to prison. And i would even help find the guy and whatnot. And again, not blaming her, because that wouldnt help her at all. She didnt deserve that nor she was asking for it.<br><br>Tell me im wrong guys cause i want to be wrong, dont wanna keep arguing with her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Please guys dont fail me. This is important</br>  <br>bumping so thread doesn't 404 while I type my respone</br>  <br>Thanks bro. <br>Hopefully you can prove me wrong so i can just say how i realized i was wrong all along and it doesnt seem as if im just agreeing with her.</br></br>  I'm on my phone, but I'll try to reply.  Na that logic is pretty sound. It's a very moderate viewpoint that recognizes everyone must share some of the blame  <br>Saying she's sometimes at fault (even with adding "in a sense") is saying she's responsible for what happened.<br>By getting drunk and passing out at a party, it's her fault she got raped.<br>That's wrong.<br>If a person gets drunk and passes out at a party, it's not an invitation to have sex. Sure it's stupid and reckless and irresponsible, but the bottom line is if a guy fucks her while she's asleep, it's rape and it's his fault.<br><br>I'm no feminist, but this is just basic humanity.<br><br>You don't fuck passed out chicks. It's not cool.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Say that to a feminist</br>  <br>if you can get a feminist to shut the fuck up for a minute and stop blaming everyone without a cunt for all the evils if the world , then yes maybe you might want to try telling that to a feminist. But she will not listen to you . ever.<br>Having a cunt means you can be right even when you are wrong and it is all the fault of the dick bearing oppressors.</br></br>  Just don't fucking rape people dumbass. The guy deserves dick in his butt if he rapes.  It's not your logic that's wrong, it's your phrasing.<br><br>In both cases-- a man walking through a bad neighborhood and getting robbed, a woman passing out and getting raped-- the problem is not the victim but the environment. Until the environment can be fixed, people are wise to avoid the environment in order to avoid becoming a victim.<br><br>It's like if you're walking on a public sidewalk and you get attacked by some jerk's dog. You're not at fault, even though you could have taken a different route home to avoid becoming a victim. The guy needs to fucking lock up his dog.</br></br></br></br>  "victim never at fault" is an outdated argument. <br><br> be 21, not been driving long <br> dont like driving in the dark because im still getting used to it <br> have to make an emergency run to the pharmacy <br> some drunk bitch is walking down the street wobbling and shouting at cars <br> go really slowly just in case <br> her friends grabs her, okitscool.jpg <br> just as i speed up she fucking wobbles into the road <br> hit the bitch, she breaks her ankle and wrist, spend all night dealing with this shit <br> pretty much get totally away with it because her friends told people that she was being an obnoxious cunt that night and drank far too much for her own good <br><br>Victim. At fault.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   here.<br><br><br>Although it maybe unwise to dress a particular way and go into a particular neighborhood or area where one is at risk of sexual assault or rape, the victim is under no circumstance culpable for the crime. Regardless of the circumstances, the decision is solely on the rapist to rape. It doesn't matter how "tempting" someone may look; that person is not "asking" to be raped. That person may be seeking to have sex, but unless one is given valid consent, sexual activity should not occur. To assume that the victim has anything to do with this affair is to assume that the rapist is not capable of free will. The rapist is capable of deciding whether to rape; the dress or attire or situation of the victim is irrelevant and often used as tenuous rationalizations for rape or sexual assault.<br><br>In your hypothetical, it is her fault that she for drunk and went to the location. That much is true. This does not translate into being guilty of being raped. The decision to rape is solely the decision of the rapist; he or she decides, not the victim.<br><br>You are essentially blaming the victim for a crime she did not commit. Of course she could have dressed differently, or been elsewhere, or what have you. None of these, however, place her in a position of culpability for being the victim of rape.<br><br>For comparison, the rich man walking around in a neighborhood known for robbery and theft does not render him culpable for the crime of the robber or thief. You would be blaming the victim, which is absurd and inappropriate because the victim does not share culpability for the crime. Their decisions may gave been unwise, but those poor decisions do not translate into blame anymore than does being hit by a speeding car while legally crossing the street means the victim has to pay damages.<br><br> &gt;CONTINUED&lt;&lt; </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Contrary to what you may believe, you are implicitly blaming the victim by associating the victim's actions or decisions with that of the malicious actor. Everyone possesses autonomy and agency; it is solely the rapist's decision to rape, the robber's decision to rob, and the speeding driver's decision to drive speedily. The victim does not share this blame because the victim did not partake in their decisions, nor were they complicit in their action. They are VICTIMS and described as such for a reason.<br><br>For frame of reference, place yourself in the position of the victim: regardless of what you wear, who you are, where you go, or why you're there, does any of the aforementioned ever cause you to be complicit in your rape? In other words, under what conditions should you he blamed for the decision of another to rape you? If the answer is "never" for you, it is "never" for everyone else.<br><br>Hopefully, I helped you with this matter. Good luck.<br><br>P.S. – Don't ever expect sense or rational input from /b/, or even on 4chan. This is the shithole of the Internet. Any good advice or thought you receive are sheer luck.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sounds like reddit in here.</br>  <br><br> Sometimes the girl is just saying...<br> "I'll just leave this here...."<br><br> it is not how mature people get what they want...but take the census of mature people at such places where these things happen.<br><br> so much misunderstaning is due to people reasoning as if this girl came into a courtroom, stumbling drunk, and passed out on the witness stand. of course no officer of the court would ravage her there.<br><br> however when she does it at a frat party, or an intimmate soiree....well the context is different.<br><br> the medium is the message, and the medium was her drunken state saying Fuck My Life! Fuck Me !!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I'm like 95% sure that's tori black in op's gif, anyone else?<br>tldr</br>  <br> Drinking means it's your fault for getting raped <br>Do you faggots really have this much of a hate boner for females? So if I go out and get drunk and black out and someone comes and stomps my face into the ground is that my fault?</br></br>  <br>Well you're 95% wrong. It's Remy</br>  <br>yup you're a dumbass get blackout drunk at home dipshit</br>  <br><br>I concur with both of these anons.<br><br><br>This anon should stop visiting /pol/ and educate himself on feminism.<br><br><br>If she is jaywalking, which is a crime, she is culpable for that. Failure to follow proper procedures of crossing the street redness one culpable to some extent. If you failed in your duties and was negligent, you could also be indicted for involuntary manslaughter.<br><br>Your analogy is not apt because it is not a victim/victor, oppressed/oppressor situation. That is a case of negligence and misconduct, and a very unfortunate accident.<br><br><br>Refer to this anon: . Context does not give one a license to rape under any circumstance. The blame remains solely on the rapist(s).</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Thanks a lot bro. I would get you a drink but..yea have some booty</br></br>  <br>That is if we're talking about "real" rape sorta speak. What is your opinion on girls that have sex with a guy while drunk, regret that decision later on and go claiming rape. Not OP by the way</br>  <br><br> there is an explicit or implicit communication that takes place when many 'victims' present themselves in a vulnerable state.<br> i agree that not all such 'victims' consciously speak the invitation..but some do.<br><br> if the 'perpetrator' is stone cold sober, your logic should hold in a majority of cases.<br><br> but there are times when the message of permission or even demand is presented implicitly, or even explicitly, before the blackout.<br><br> after all, guys wake up and fuck their sleeping wives and girlfriends, who do not complain, or even say thank you, upon learning what happened.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>redness = renders<br><br>Autocorrect, sorry. Still on my phone.</br></br></br>  <br> gif from tumblr <br> 5 fps and about half a second long <br><br>It checks out</br></br></br></br>  <br>You are wrong, dude. The rapist knows in any case that he doesn't have consent, so he is 100% in the wrong. Ideally it should not matter what the girl does if she does not give consent, it's not okay to have sex with her, period. The rapist is responsible for his actions 100% and therefore is 100% at fault.</br>  <br> Same if it was rape. She is at fault in a sense for doing something stupid(because getting drunk and black out in place full of strangers is stupid, we agreed on this). <br>But again, her stupidity doesnt mean the rapist doesnt deserve to go to prison. And i would even help find the guy and whatnot. And again, not blaming her, because that wouldnt help her at all. She didnt deserve that nor she was asking for it.<br><br>I agree. That's the only correct answer.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Context does not give one a license to rape under any circumstance. The blame remains solely on the rapist(s). <br>So you guys are saying that the rapist wont be influenced in any way. <br>If the girl passes out in the bathroom toilet with her ass up. You are saying this does not influence the rapist</br></br></br>  <br> Context does not give one a license to rape under any circumstance <br> context changes the interpretation of the body language, and spoken language. therefore it may not always be rape.<br><br> i agree it frequently is...but there is room for doubt.<br><br> do you seriously think people are going to get with 'affirmative consent' ? that would be the end of the best of sex....which arch feminists might not mind...but some of us would.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  U Mad yet?  <br>I dont know what im suppose to be angry at</br>  <br>Nope.</br>  <br>New ghostbusters film</br>  Look at that big ass gorilla  They're filming up the street from me  <br>Why are they all tied up?</br>  I wouldn't want to fuck the original Ghostbusters either... well, maybe Bill Murray  <br>You know what has to be done anon...<br>Put an end.</br></br>  niga wat da FUK is THAT shit?!  how many race jokes will the gorilla say in this movie? my guess is 6<br>she'll also probably be a "horny" fat black woman too</br>  <br>also, check 'em.</br>  <br>hollywood has been shitty on top of franchises for years now.<br>hardly worth getting butthurt over it.</br></br>  <br>I can't.
