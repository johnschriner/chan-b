I'm usually more the white knight than anything. <br> friend gave me the girls number says "you should talk to her" <br><br>I already regretted opening my mouth but to be perfectly honest I'm just glad she isn't physically hurt. He broke up with her about it but if this guy goes on the internet and lies about who he is just to dig up some bullshit, I probably did her a favor. either way, advice<br><br>tl;dr gabbing on 4chan has caught up with me for the first time, what do?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  self bump  <br>Posting it on /b/ which you know people from your town that you know browse, seems like a good way to go.</br>  <br><br>yeah needless to say, i'm done with this website</br></br>  <br>good riddance</br>  Screencap a movie at 00:30:04, others have to guess the name of the flick.

This was only part of a nationwide child sex web and has since moved on to other locations, but the FBI invested considerable amounts of money to cover up pedophilia in this community, even to the point of bribing journalists to attack the stories of children who claimed to have been raped at the center. The FBI likely did this because of the high profile clientele that used the child sex rings, including apparently orgies with underage children and politicians in Washington DC. I honestly didn't want to believe this one but the kids who were discredited in the early 1990s in the criminal case eventually won a civil judgment in the late 1990s against the man who ran Boys Town <br><br>TWA Flight 800 was shot down by the US Navy by an accidental missile firing during a battleship training exercise and the Navy will never admit it</br></br>  <br>Ever heard of the Finders?</br>  <br>no but googling now</br>  HEY FUCK YOU FAGGOTS<br>My 11 y/o son started secretly going on 4chan a while back and besides the extent use of the word FAGGOT at every single fucking family dinner (grandma was involved and she's just turned 100) HE WOULDN'T STOP ASKING FOR THESE FUCKING FINGERBOXES IN EVERY GODDAMN CORNERSHOP HE COULD FIND. He told grammy that he wants one for christmas and if she wouldn't get one for him then she's a BIG FAGGOT THAT LIKES NIGGER DICKS. She almost fucking died on us. That's because she had a black lover back in the day and i suspect she was getting it up the ass from him cause that shit's prolly tighter so she was in shock because she thought WE TOLD OUR 11 Y/O SON HOW HIS GRANDMA WAS GETTING FUCKED IN THE ASS BY NIGGER DICK WHEN SHE WAS LIKE 67..<br><br>So then i had to explain to my 11 y/o that no he can't get in a sexshop to buy a fingerbox, no he can't get a credit card to order one online, no he can't just go around asking grandma if she's a TRAP, AND HE JUST SAT THERE AND KEPT ASKING ME IF HE'S A CHILD OF THE TROUGH CAUSE HE THINKS HE IS.<br><br>SO FUCK YOU FAGGOTS AND THIS SHITTY WEBSITE</br></br></br></br></br>      <br>Your son's a piece of shit that was raised poorly if this isn't bait. Now go beat him for being an asshole and wanting an electronic finger box</br>   The matrix is real and you've been forced to live inside a game location/environment for the rest of your life. <br><br>Which game do you pick and how do you spend you days?</br></br>  <br>Leisure Suit Larry, having sex all the time</br>  <br>Carry on, Hunter</br>  <br>carry on, Hunter</br>  Busta. Straight busta.  <br>Women leads in a COMEDY is red flags immediately, there are lots of decent actresses but chicks are usually not that funny. Also, there is no reason to remake ghost-busters at all, and remaking it with four women pretty much guarentees that it will be a very different movie from the original, and it also looks like it will be very shitty. Given that I grew up watching and loving the original, I am pretty pissed that some fuckwit decided to not only remake it, but fuck with the casting so that it is almost guaranteed to be unfunny and shit</br>  <br>I like attractive women who don't try to be funny</br>  <br>Fuckin untrustworthy skeleton.
