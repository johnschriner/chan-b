Let yourself get old enough to die of liver failure or some shit. That'll show everyone</br>  if you truly believe that another humas influence can turn the tide of your life, im sorry theres no hope. look at it this way, youre flesh and bone, so are we, by we i mean the entrety of our species. why kill yourself, whn you can kill others more deemed to deserve a rushed fate, besides. youre too cute, dont spill thy blood  I've tried. Many times and 'technically' succeeded more than once. But I'm still here and I'm glad I am because Im in a vastly different place in my life now and I couldn't imagine missing out on all of this... <br><br>If you want the most painless and efficient way buy 1/2 gram of heroin ($40 where I live) a pack of insulin syringes ($5 at rite aid or Walmart) mix up the heroin with water, draw it into the syringe... Touch up with a YouTube course on phlebotomy, then do the deed. It will feel really good for 3 seconds. Then your face will tingle. Then there is nothing. Absolute nothingness... You don't even know it happens unless you are found and revived like I was... Then you only realize what happened after you regain consciousness. <br>How it works is that contrary to popular belief an overdose of diacetylmorphine will not damage the body in any way, so therefore cannot cause death. It does, however, slow heart rate and breathing. In an opiate naive subject 500mg of street heroin will be enough to slow those both enough so they stop functioning altogether. At which point you are clinically deceased. You have to manage to remain this way for a period of time to allow your brain to completely die from lack of oxygen. A quick injection of narcan shortly after the overdose will reverse the CNS depressant effects of the drug and your body will begin functioning again and you will wake up. Depending on how long it was you may have severe permanent brain damage. <br>With those risks stated, I will assure you of the absolute painlessness of this method. (Unless you hate needles, then the injection part might suck). <br><br>But please don't kill yourself.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  https://<span>youtu.be/vxmyNiovJzc  [ ]<br>This honestly helped with my depression</br>    <br>I don't live in a basement and I have a swimming pool right outside my door</br>    <br>Heres the thing.

Several other terrible things too, and she's works a good job and is only two years from her masters degree. what I'm getting at is that you can live well with shit like that in your past. You have to find the things in life that bring you happiness and pursue them. If you're old enough to want to kill yourself, you're old enough to leave home and find meaning in your life. Friends will be able to support you until you can get enough together to leave, or hell, pay rent to a friend and crash with them until you find a real place on your own, it may be for the best you don't live alone for a while anyway.</br>  https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.co<wbr>m/736x/87/5e/84/875e841bae6bb0c704e<wbr>fb14cff24fd7c.jpg</wbr></wbr>  http://lostallhope.com/suicide-meth<wbr>ods/statistics-most-lethal-methods<br><br>has a list of the most lethal and less painfull methods, if you're actually serious. <br><br>Shotgun to the head seems to be the most devastating and nearly guarantees rapid evacuation of your brain.<br><br>Setting yourself on fire is listed as the most painful.</br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr>  put rat poison in his food  <br>And your fedora collection.<br>Don't forget that</br></br>  <br> implying she didn't like free dick </br>  <br>It's something i would have done.

Since you did not receive unconditional love you suffer from low self esteem. To build self esteem start offering unconditional love to others. Volunteer at a soup kitchen, a charity thrift store, make small donations to street panhandlers. Love in this world the way you WANT to be loved. This will give you self esteem and may even attract someone to your life who WILL love you unconditionally . Even if it does not you will learn at first to LIKE yourself and then maybe LOVE yourself.

Focus on the positive aspects of your life, and compare yourself to someone who can't do those things: there are probably a lot of people who can't even browse the internet. Find things that you enjoy doing which you can do when you get depressed to distract yourself from thinking pessimistically. Depression is just a temporary emotion but death is permanent. Even if you don't believe in hell you could still be much worse off in an afterlife than you are now. Find something special you can do for yourself like getting ice cream to have something nice to do. The two most important things to do are to think positive and distract yourself from thinking negatively.</br>  <br>What time also make sure your nipples are out so i can cum</br>  <br>How will fucking her dad help at all?</br>    <br>I second this take 4 grams of cubes and see if it doesnt change your perspective on life</br>  That was the best orgasm of my life  <br><br>why did i laugh so hard with this</br></br>  <br>JOIN ISIS THAT'LL BE FUN</br>  <br>Find a rich ugly guy to marry, problem solved.</br>  <br>You have to want help.

Webm that shit or fuck off</br>    <br>Thanks, fellow anon. I'm pretty good with everything you say too. And honestly, at the end I was just trolling. I don't think there's any chance of the world giving a shit about what some anon posted on 4chan years ago. I've been here as long as you and recall the old days with regular cp threads with jessie and sandra and siberian mouse. That stuff was mostly for lulz, but every now and then a real pedo would show up. That was also funny. But I think 4chan is largely harmless compared with what's happening with sexual violence in the real world or suicide bombers or religious sectarianism or the curtailing of intellectual freedoms. A good day to you, anon.</br>  Starting one of these threads, don't forget to rate.  <br><br>Really? I think the P226 Siggy is the embodiment of gorgeous weaponry.
