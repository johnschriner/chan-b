Those were the days...</br></br></br></br>  I bought one of the mlp sex dolls for $250<br>I can't use it until i find out how to clean it because it's so full of dried cum that it feels like sandpaper unless i squirt water in it and wait, but now it's all mouldy and that stains my dick.</br>    get a hot girl's shoe and fuck that. I love the feel, it's almost the perfect shape. Just ignore them when they wonder why their shoes are all sticky  <br>yeah well i have 5 and 12 pocket pussies take that</br>  <br>Was in a yhread where an anon fucked a donut last night.<br><br>I just so happened to have a box of donuts so timestamped one between my ladies tits.<br><br>Memories.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br> Has MLP sheets  <br> Paid $250 for an MLP sex doll <br> Full of dried cum  <br><br>Holy shit anon do you live alone?

I'm just curious because the fact that you have MLP sheets and blew $250 on a fucking MLP sex doll just baffles me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  OP here. Here is a better idea of what I mean with my rich and creamy voice.<br><br>http://vocaroo.com/i/s133jgwVIhe3</br></br>  whats the weirdest thing you guys have ever put your dick in for sexual pleasure?<br> inb4 "your mom KEK" <br>im a melon fucker</br></br>  <br>Gee I wonder who's a closet pony fucker...</br>  <br> paying 250 for something that can be made for 40 <br>kekt</br></br>  <br>Go to the hardware store and get rubber foam insulation in tube form, (don't get the crap that's split down the middle)<br>Get a condom (larger latex condoms work best)<br>Stop at a convenience store and get a large slushie. Drink it and keep the cup.<br>Cut the rubber foam insulation tube to roughly the size of the slushie cup<br>Unroll the condom and put it on the inside of the tube.<br>Secure the closed end of the condom to one side of the insulation tube.<br>Stuff the insulation tube into the slushie cup as much as possible (open end of the condom facing up/out).<br>Stretch the edges of the condom up and around the edge of the cup.<br>Use duct tape or vinyl tape to secure the condom to the side of the cup.<br>Congrats, you've made a sex toy.<br>You can skip the condom part if you want to, but it helps with cleanup and helps the device last longer.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>that's not his doll</br>  <br> 1 - Put to heat this in water <br> 2 - Cut the top of it <br> 3 Make a hole in the center <br> 4 Oh god...

I dont even heat up my oatmeal. Add water, mix, eat. I dont even bother heating up the water..just cold fuckin water.</br>  <br>fuck, those donuts look good. you get from a local bakery?</br>  <br>Multiple bananas enveloped in each other bundled in a towel bundled in my blankets on my bed. The banana won't get out. After a while or if you microwave it it feels warm and it's tight and slippery and you can hump the fuck out of it.</br>  <br>Do they look like some donuts you'd get from a walmart? Shit no they don't.<br><br>I pay extra for the good, cooked daily d-nuts.</br></br></br>  <br>Really??</br>    <br>Yeah, anon. That's how I grew up eating oatmeal. I never read the instructions. Always thought it was a 'just add water' kinda food.</br>  So to anyone who bought a fleshlight from Amazon, what is the packaging like?  Ive tried using the Latex gloves and I really dont like the feel of them especially when you Cum. <br><br> Plastic sheeting is much better.<br><br> Roll up some plastic sheeting in a washcloth and bind it with rubber bands and lube it up.<br><br> Its better then gloves because they are deeper, the plastic feels better and it stays in place. <br><br> When your trying to fuck the glove it slides all over and you have to pull the fingers or it get all bound up. <br><br> But the sheeting does not do that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  mochi is heavenly  <br>interesting</br>  <br>I used to eat it when I lived in Hawaii. Where do you get it?</br>  <br>Mochi?</br>  Slice the tip off a banana and squeeze the banana out of the peel. Put your dick in the peel. If you want, microwave the peel for a few seconds.  <br>japanese market</br>  At first I tried rolling up plastic sheeting and putting it in a toilet paper roll. Just folding back some of the extra plastic around the roll and holding it in place with the rubber bands.<br><br> But its better to use a washcloth because when you bind it all with rubber bands it squeezed your cock. While the tube is just a hollow hole that is around your cock.</br></br>  <br>Jeeze didn't you have a mother?</br>  <br> Corn starch + water <br> "is this dangerous?" <br>I will be honest, no.<br>But, this does not work.<br>it turns into a snow-like, mushy paste.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I fucked a banana once</br>  <br>Yeah..kinda.<br>That's neither here nor there.<br><br>Have you tried it cold? Might like it anon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I sometimes just eat it out of the packet</br>  <br>how was it tho</br>  <br>sawdust/10</br>  <br>And you guys think I'm weird for eating it cold?<br><br>Get a load of this guy.</br></br></br>  <br> doing this </br>  <br>It was pretty disappointing tbh, and it left a mess</br>  <br>Under rated post</br>  <br>blow 'em up, lube 'em up. tape 2 together if you don't like poking out the end.</br>  What I like to do is take a square piece of plastic sheeting and fold an inch or so of it along the edge.<br><br> Then roll that up in the washcloth so that you dont get any of the plastic cut edge touching your Cock. Just a rolled up tube of plastic sheeting. <br><br> Wrap the extra sheeting around the rolled up wash cloth or two and bind them with rubber bands. <br><br> The rubber bands make the pussy feel tight, the plastic sheeting is better then the gloves because it does not move and its easy throw away clean up and the cloth of the pussy is an ok feel. <br><br> I lube up with coconut oil. <br><br> Then sometimes I roll this up in a towel and put it on a full body pillow then fold the full body pillow over the fake pussy wrapped in a towel.<br><br> When you lay on your side you can fuck it and it feels like your sliding your cock into a pussy in the spoon position. And you can trust into it. <br><br> It feels like a fake ass and you can even get the ass in missionary position and slam fuck the fake pussy and cum into it. All hands free.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah man. Still gets mushy. Just not all runny n shit like when it's heated.<br><br>I add two packets<br>Add water<br>Mix<br>Add more water if needed<br>Usually a lil syrup or sugar depending on oatmeal flavor.<br><br>Try it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Jim is that you? it's me stiffler</br>    <br><br> buy ribeye steak <br> let it come to room temperature <br> rub down with olive oil <br> invite single next door neighbor over for dinner and fuck some real poontang ya lonely loser </br></br></br></br></br>   cock ring <br> best feeling ever <br>Chose one</br></br>  <br>Kekkles</br>  <br>fucking genius</br>  <br>this but rub Vaseline inside of it and you're really set</br>  Get Vaseline, put it in a zip lock, put your cock in zip lock, close zip lock to fit just around your cock, put it in between your mattress and your matress holder. Fuck it.  <br>This</br>  <br>DONT DO THIS unless you want to wait in line for a kidney transplant:<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_O<wbr>atmeal_Toxicity<br><br><br> inb4 whiteknight </br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  You can also doggy style the fake ass. <br><br> Make the fake pussy and roll it up in a towel and then put that towel in the middle of the body pillow and fold the pillow over the towel / pussy. <br> <br> It makes a fake ass you can spoon or fuck doggy.<br><br> Sometimes I put my Ipad on the fake ass and watch porn as I fuck the fake ass doggy.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait...really? I'm not trolling, anon.<br><br>That IS how I've eaten my oatmeal my whole life.</br></br></br>  <br><br> I tried zip locks too, but the plastic is not good.<br><br> It has the same problem as the gloves. The plastic does not stay in place and it gets all bunched up. <br><br> And it does not feel as good as the plastic sheeting. <br><br> They would be a good solution if it was good. But its not.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I never really got this...<br>How do you thrust? It's an incredibly awkward position to thrust in.</br></br>  <br>Kill yourself faggot</br>  <br>my boyfriend did this, said citrus juice in his dick hole hurt really bad</br>  <br><br> Make the fake ass with a body pillow. Because you can put the pillow / fake ass on your bed and you can fuck it.<br><br> If feels more like a real pussy when you can hold the ass and thrust into it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Tits or gtfo.<br><br>You should know better.</br></br></br>  <br>Amazing Atheist is that you?</br>  I won't get dubs.<br><br>The next post will.</br></br>  <br>Come ooon... grapefruit doesn't hurt.

The hot uptight bitch, she probably sucks in bed. But the other hot chicks, some of them are great. And I'd rather deal with a couple mediocre thin fucks then that fat chick who looks like my uncle any day.</br></br>  <br>Dude, she might be a little big but she's fucking hot</br>  <br>Whatever.

Have some standards, my nigga.</br>  <br>Lmao nasty fagget thinks I have to dip my standards to get pussy</br>  <br>Is her umbilical cord still attached</br>  I think she slept through most of it...    Closest thing I have to regret (at least with photo evidence). She was a great lay but made strange noises, hyped up how much she liked cum (didn't even like it on her skin in the end) but let me blow a load in her. Not terrible but not great.  She had a nice but I couldn't get over how fat she was    <br>bewbs</br>  <br>lmao is that a midget?</br>    <br>  <br>why.... just... why?</br></br>  <br>Also I'll even take this one step further and tell you something I picked up a 7 and her friend at a party a few years back rooks them back to my place they wanted a threesome so my drunken assuming figured whatever well after about 20 min of fking around I kick her friend out of my bed guess why because she is fat and I can't stand fat people I work my assume off for my apperance so I don't deal with birches who can't take care of themselves anyway she says wth I told her to go sleep on the couch in the other room not in the mood to strain my back tonight so she fking goes and sleeps on the couch while I pound her friend lmao come morning the fat girl made us all breakfast and I bought them a taxi never saw them kinda wish I would of stayed in contact with that 7 though she had good personalty which is something looking for at this point in my life lol Inb4 fake fagget inb4 virgin keep hating guys but I used to be a pretty big player these days looking for a girl to have a steady relationship with though which is extremely hard as I am somewhat a perfectionist inb4 kek fgt vergin inb4 poor Grammer fktard</br>    jesus, after seeing some of the goblins in this thread im no longer ashamed  <br> mwf </br>  <br>kek<br>Is she hiding?.. that awful stare though...</br></br>  <br>I got the reference, well played.</br>      <br>Nice trips /b/ro</br>  <br>I'd have to say your handjobs are the worst also</br>    <br>This made me laugh really hard</br>    <br>May you forever be haunted by the shame of having fucked horrible beast</br>    #nojudgement.....<br>.....<br>......<br>I'm sorry</br></br></br>  <br>She's trying so hard to suck that gut in....lol</br>  <br>atleast she has a nice face</br>  Femanon here. Got this finished last week. Opinions please.  <br>tits + timestamp or gtfo</br>    <br>not really my style but cool, hope you like it!</br>  <br>PLEASE tell me this is a really good fucking shoop, otherwise I suggest suicide</br>    ...And this broad will still get laid no problem.  <br><br>what idgi</br></br>  <br>The artwork itself is okay I guess, the text is awful<br> no timestamp </br></br>  <br>This</br>  <br>Poor composition, looks well executed, though.</br>  <br>Looks dumb as shit.<br>I'd kill myself if I payed for that to be on me.</br></br>  <br><br>Tits or gtfo cumdumpster</br></br>  I like it.  <br>This really sums it up OP</br>  Not bad actually. Has a kinda storybook fantasy type thing going for it  <br>Is the owl supposed to look like it's flying?<br> if so it looks fucking retarded </br></br>  <br>Anyone who gets a tattoo like that is obviously homely as shit. <br>Keep your tits to yourself, Femanon.</br></br>  It looks like the sort of think you'd see on the wall of a library. It's needlessly busy and the artwork is okay at best. For something that's going to stay on your for ever, I don't think you put a lot of thought into what's going on with it.<br>Now, show us your dick.</br>  <br>Shit tier work all around. Looks like a giant "C" from over ten feet away and the "C" is for "cheezy". Seriously, it's not about being a femanon, it's about taste and talent. This is a competent display of neither.</br>  <br>The owl is going, "Hey brah, I got a new scroll for you, shit is so literature"</br>  <br>Seems like more of a too much thought kind of thing to me.</br>  Would be a LOT better if it said<br>"Havin' fun isn't hard when you've got a library card!"</br>  <br>  This </br>  dope art but the text looks pretty shoddy  <br>What's the matter, OP? Not happy with /b/s critique?</br>  Back bra/10  Target practice just got sticky  <br>either way, she failed to take a step back and realize just how idiotic her ink was and now its too late.</br>  <br>Of course not, the attention whoring didn't go the way she hoped.</br>  <br>Overstated busy-ness.<br><br>Jesus, wwwwhhhhyyy?</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, tattoos are unforgiving like that. <br>C'est la vie...</br></br>  <br>first mistake was her thinking this was fucking reddit now she should pot a pick of sharpie in the poo and write slut on the asscheeks</br>  <br>Lame<br>Gay<br>And I guess you are probably 'wiccan' as well huh?</br></br></br>  <br>It's alright. Artwork is decent. I got this one last week.</br>    If your ass is fine you fucked up  <br><br>Aw man, I love GWAR!!</br></br>  <br>I like this one, the placement isn't bad either, but it's a visible arm tattoo, doesn't that affect finding a job? One of my coworkers had a few tattoos on his arms and he has to wear a sleeve over them at all time, other people I know that have large arm tattoos are in their mid twenties and haven't been able to get a job past Kohl's or some shit</br>  <br><br>you're not a "femanon"<br><br>you're a whore<br><br>the end</br></br></br></br></br></br>  This song sums up my feelings about the tattoo:<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=xwA<wbr>iFWCiOH8</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Nice idea. Weird placement.</br>  <br>fuck you faggot go suck a dick</br>    <br>no u</br>  <br> It's needlessly busy <br><br>This. Concept is good but overall design is shit. Way too oversaturated and cluttered.<br><br>Whoever designed it should slap themselves.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is that Medievil?</br>  <br>I'm a Regional VP for a retail chain. My wife is an engineer. She's covered. I do wear long sleeves almost exclusively. The other region's VP's think it's cool. One of the VP's has two entire sleeves. Our annual conference I attend the "Fun Run." Which everyone sees our tattoos. No one seems to care. I don't think I'll have trouble finding a job if mine faltered.</br>  <br>i thought it was a harry potter tat for a second which i would have been ok with. but no, its shit</br>  <br>too fucking messy. The colors dont really blend together that well either<br><br>The artist that drew that needs to take (more) acid</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah. My favorite game when I was a teenager, probably of my entire life. I decided on it because of how much I love it, and how for sure I was that SONY would not produce another giving them a chance to ruin it's image. So I felt it was a safe bet.</br>  <br>this</br>  <br> I'm a Regional VP for a retail chain. <br><br>How's being a Trader Joes "yes man" working out for ya?</br></br></br>  <br>Fair enough m8, wasn't trying to call you guys faggots, just curious</br>  tits or gtfo<br><br>how are girls still fucking this up</br></br>  <br>Nice artwork. I remember playing that when I was a kid.<br><br>How much did it cost?</br></br></br>  <br>Because they're girls. They're naturally dim witted.</br>  <br>nice</br>  <br>Dumb, stupid, kill yourself. tits first. kthanxbye</br>  <br>Reasonable quality work, just fucking retarded concept.<br>I guarantee your tattooist hates you</br></br>  <br> implying Trader Joes isnt bomb as fuck </br>  <br> Reasonable quality work, just fucking retarded concept. <br><br>Other way around m8</br></br></br>  <br>I'm definitely a "Yes man." It pays my mortgage and other expenses. I do everything as instructed by the high ups. I fly under the radar and perform just as expected. Not good enough to draw attention from LP. Not bad enough to be asked to resign. My friends call be a corporate slave. I most definitely am. Noshame.</br>  <br>pretty much</br>  <br>100 to set the appointment<br>300 four months later after it was finished. <br>I also tipped my artist. Me and my wife always tip an extra 100.</br></br></br>  That's some baseball glove. <br><br>Total of sports books read: 0<br>Precentage of care: 0</br></br></br>  <br> corporate slave in a shitty retail store <br><br>Tattooed people being winners as always.</br></br></br>  <br>how long have u had this image .. just waiting to use it?</br>  <br>$500 total?</br>  It's his favorite episode.  <br>shit/10</br>  <br>I've got so many of those. Poor things never get a chance.</br>    <br>so your idea was that, if someone is to fuck you from the back, they can have a shit ton of stuff to look at while doing it?</br>  I've got some tattoos I regret, but I was never enough of a retard to get them somewhere I couldn't easily cover. Enjoy never wearing a tank top again. Even if you wear a blouse, if it's sheer or a light colour, your shitty decisions will show through.<br>Do you plan on ever wearing a wedding gown and not looking like trash? Did you consider if you have kids and they get married that you'll be a fucking joke? Imagine your daughter manages to marry into a respectable family and there you are at the wedding, 50 or so, with that on your back, disgracing your family.<br>Poorly thought through. It's not even remotely cute now and it's going down hill from here.</br></br>  <br>JESUS CHRIST WHY DOES THIS THREAD HAVE SO MANY COMMENTS?<br><br>THE BITCH DIDN'T DELIVER.
