[ Fuck the supreme court.<br><br>Hear me out guys, I'm all for gay marriage being legal everywhere, but I don't think this is the best way to do it. There wasn't any notice that they were talking about this, and there wasn't really any time for anyone to object to it. It all happened very quickly and it would be very difficult to go back on that decision.<br><br>Sure, I agree with what they did this time, but what's to say I'll agree with what they do next. Would I get a chance to speak out against it?</br></br></br></br>  :^)  Majority of 5 decides laws for over 300 million  <br>bump</br>  <br>Same thing with the legalization of weed in Washington and Colorado.</br>  <br>You don't really understand how the westminster system of democratic government works do you.</br>  <br><br>What are you talking about? People have been objecting for the past 50 years. Since the last 5-6 years a majority is for same sex marriage, so they changed it. That's how it's supposed to be, majority decides, instead of the hardest shouter decides, what happened in many other regulations.</br></br>  There are three arms of government:<br>Executive (President &amp; his cabinet)<br>legislative (Congress/Senate)<br>Judiciary (Judges)<br><br>All three are supposed to be a balance for the other. As part of this, it is crucial that the judiciary be appointed &amp; unelected. Judges will often be tasked with making potentially extremely unpopular decisions in the interests of justice. If they are elected they are unlikely to do the fair thing, and will more likely do the thing that gets them re-elected.<br><br>A good example is the Scottsboro trials of the 1930's (Alabama I believe)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Majority? Of what? Social media? The majority opposes it. The internet cried louder and won. Fags only account for about 3-4% of the population.</br>  <br> There wasn't any notice that they were talking about this <br>Yeah if you ignore the last 40 years.<br> and there wasn't really any time for anyone to object to it <br>Its the supreme fucking court</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's a state decision. If you don't like it you can move. But federal laws are across the entire country</br>  <br> The majority opposes it. <br>With the baby boomers dying out and the hicks in the south killing themselves no, the majority of people either are casually for, or really for same-sex marriage.<br><br>You don't have to be gay to think people shouldn't be denied rights because of some shit in a dumb book written by people who hate shrimp and mixed fabrics.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Wrong. Do some research.</br>  <br>Anti-intellectual detected. Stupid fucking convervative.</br>  <br>How the fuck do you function being so dumb? Read. Stay off the internet.</br>  <br><br><br>And this is how the fags won. No proof of the contrary just screaming and shouting that people are wrong.</br></br></br>  wtf is op talking about? This wasn't some arbitrary announcement made by the supreme court. It was a trial, it was several trials consolidated<br>14-556, Obergefell v. Hodges <br>Consolidation <br>14-562, Tanco v. Haslam<br>14-571, DeBoer v. Snyder<br>14-574, Bourke v. Beshear<br><br>The court didn't just decide over night, hey, gay marriage is legal. These people have been in court for years trying to get their 14th amendment rights affirmed. Get your shit together Op, just because you didn't have time between browsing /b/ and masturbating to trap porn to read about what the fuck is happening in this world doesn't mean it just happened over night.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh shut up. Just let them have marriage so they can be as miserable as everyone else.</br>  <br><br> And this is how the fags won. No proof of the contrary just screaming and shouting that people are wrong. <br><br>umad m8? If the government recognizes marriage between a man and woman, it must recognize marriage between same sexes since the government does not operate on religious principles, which is pretty much the only valid reason people object to it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Comon man, everybody does that, same goes for climate acts and shouting from the gas industry. It maybe a two edged blade covered in oil and money, but it is YOUR two edged blade.<br><br>lrn2live with it amerifat</br></br></br>  <br>+1<br><br>why do we even have states and state constitutions if the supreme court can just throw out any little thing they don't like?<br><br>Quick! recite the 10th amendment! Should be a prerequisite test for any potential justice.<br><br>Fuck the supreme court and fuck all you faggot lovers.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Everything that happens is conducted for the betterment of the rich and powerful, not for the people of the U.S. <br><br>Making gay marriage legal came at a convenient time huh?</br></br></br>  <br> implying the government can define marriage, being a religious principle.  <br>That was what this was all about. Forcing fag marriage on the churches.</br></br>  <br>Didn't I tell you to stay off the internet?!<br><br>Here is your source:<br><br>http://www.pewforum.org/2015/06/08/<wbr>graphics-slideshow-changing-attitud<wbr>es-on-gay-marriage/<br><br>This breaks it down by age, political, religious, and race.</br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> why do we even have states and state constitutions if the supreme court can just throw out any little thing they don't like? <br><br>Because this has to do with human rights and conservatards in the states using their religion to make laws telling people can/cannot do. Which flies in the face of "shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion".<br><br> Fuck the supreme court and fuck all you faggot lovers. <br><br>umad. Other people getting married doesn't affect your life in any way. Disgusted by it? Your grandparents shag all the time, doesn't mean you have the right to go in there and prevent them from shagging.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The bible sees women as property, with little rights. How does your wife view this?</br>  <br><br> That was what this was all about. Forcing fag marriage on the churches. <br><br>This seriously has to be some bait. No it isn't about forcing "fag marriages on the churches", it's about getting equal rights/benefits from marriage as straight couples dumbass.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You stupid bro? Gay marriage can't be a state issue, it's a contract between two parties, which needs protection from state to state.<br><br>The 15 redneck states which oppose it would take another 30 years to come around.</br></br></br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br>No it doesnt</br>  <br>Two words.<br><br>Distractionary Tactic.</br></br></br>  <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=OFk<wbr>eKKszXTw</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Kek Obamas rally wrecking the joint before he moves out hey amerifags</br>  <br> fucking retard detected that thinks it's okay for the judical branch to make legislation </br>  <br><br> No notice <br><br>Were you literally born yesterday? Gay marriage is an issue that's been in the public domain for decades. Anyone who paid any attention at all to politics/the news knew this was coming.<br><br> Happened very quickly <br>Unless you didn't notice the majority of states changing their gay marriage laws over the past decade.<br><br> What if I don't agree with what they do next? <br>Like what? Also, each side in a SC decision has 25 days to file for an appeal, so there's that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hurr durr YouTube Link. Fuck me, when did it become the norm to put a bunch of bullshit in a PowerPoint presentation, add some shityy bacckbround music and post it on YouTube and have ppl actually believe it over real peer reviewed esearch</br>  <br><br>No law was newly written. You morons keep shouting this and also shouting how's it unconstitutional while conveniently forgetting the 14thamendment states that no state shall have laws that apply unequally to two different parties. I.e. If a man and woman can be married, then so can a man and man/woman and woman.</br></br>  <br><br> fucking retard detected that thinks it's okay for the judical branch to make legislation <br><br>Judicial branch can decide what laws are constitutional. Here's an elementary school chart of our government so you actually can learn how our government operates.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Eh. True, there's a lot of that in there, but most is in the old Testament, which doesn't really get followed anymore. There's plenty of evidence of near equal rights in the new testament.</br></br>  <br>It was also written in a time when all of society treated women worse than a greasy kebab shit and a lot of what is written in the Old Testament regarding women when viewed in historical context is protective and supportive of women.</br>  <br><br> have ppl actually believe it over real peer reviewed esearch <br><br>It's technically research since she cites the bible passages at the bottom in her talk. Anyways, you bitching about all this is nonsense. Listen to what she's saying.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm fine with gay marriage but now that everyone can marry anyone can I marry myself and get tax benefits?<br><br>Why does the government discriminate against single people? It is much harder for me to own a home and get loans from banks because I am the sole earner of income. The banks won't recognize any "roommates" who have income in the decision for me to get a home.<br><br>Some people choose to be single and now are discriminated against. Others do not choose to be single and society punishes them for it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you that autistic? <br>You're correct, that's exactly what the Supreme Court does. What the Supreme Court is not supposed to do is create laws.<br><br>Here's a diagram for you since you clearly don't understand the basic responsibilities of the separate branches in the U.S. government. I suggest you go back to middle school and beat the shit out of your civics teacher because you obviously didn't learn a fucking thing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They didn't create a new law here you fucking idiot. This law pre existed in the form of the 14th amendment.</br>  <br><br> now that everyone can marry anyone can I marry myself and get tax benefits? <br><br>Are you a schizophrenic? Because marriage is between two people. Hence the word "marriage". I'm with you that I don't agree with the government getting involved with marriage, but if they are going to get involved what they did was correct.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Something tells me you have no idea what the 14th amendment even says.</br>  <br><br> What the Supreme Court is not supposed to do is create laws <br><br>They did not create any laws, SCOTUS said the ban on gay marriage is unconstitutional, which is completely within their jurisdiction.<br><br> I suggest you go back to middle school and beat the shit out of your civics teacher because you obviously didn't learn a fucking thing. <br><br>Way to mirror my insult, umad I insulted yo intellectz?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Funny because I should be saying that to you. You, like most, probably o my know half of it.</br>  <br><br>Pretty much says that the government must recognize all people's rights as equals regardless of how they identify themselves and also have equal protection under the law. Which applies to gay marriage considering straight marriage had benefits over gay couples before this court ruling.</br></br>  <br>Bible passages take out of context I'm sure, can't be bothered listening to some bitch who needs to put her shit on YouTube, give me a peer reviewed journal anyday</br>  <br>They have 25 days? What's that got to do with my chance to say something</br>  <br><br> Bible passages take out of context I'm sure <br><br>lel, the fact you said "I'm sure" just goes to prove you didn't bother fact checking the passage or the surrounding chapter. Here's another vid for you: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=PK7<wbr>P7uZFf5o</wbr>  [ ]<br><br> give me a peer reviewed journal anyday <br><br>Yup, you've got to be a troll.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Then I can marry my daughter</br>  <br>Then I can marry my daughter</br>  im fine with guys and stuff but historically every culture that has embraced them has a terrible downfall  <br><br>That's a huge risk of fucking up family dynamics and having fucked up children. Two gay people are two consenting adults. You're comparing apples and oranges.</br></br>  <br><br> every culture that has embraced them has a terrible downfall <br><br>Their downfall is nothing related to gay marriage.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's incorrect. Who said my daughter was a minor? Also, gay parents fuck up family dynamics.</br>  <br>File a petition for reconsideration r a petition for a temporary restraining order? Okay now. Dont go all apeshit here okay? I now clearly know that you dont know shit about what you talk</br>  <br>It's proven that children respond to and mirror their environment. Messages either explicit or often times implicit in their parents behavior get passed along To children. Therefore gay fuck up family dynamics. They cannot reproduce, and their adopted children are at risk of not reproducing.</br>  I hate how faggots liken not being able to marry each other to black oppression in the 60's  <br>Not to mention he didn't say anything about reproducing with his daughter.</br>  <br><br> Also, gay parents fuck up family dynamics. <br><br>No it doesn't, having gay parents doesn't effect the child's mental health in any way:<br><br>http://www.medicaldaily.com/do-same<wbr>-sex-parents-impact-mental-health-t<wbr>heir-children-some-us-states-say-ye<wbr>s-and-prohibit-lgbt<br><br>"Research shows that children raised by gay or lesbian parents do as well as other children in terms of well-being, adjustment, functioning and peer relationships, and researchers have found no differences in terms of depression, anxiety and self-esteem"<br><br>Now do you have any direct reasonable objection to gay marriage right now or are you going to continue wasting my time with the overused slippery slope bullshit? Because if it's the latter, I see no reason in continuing a conversation with you.</br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br>Please provide a peer-reviewed citation to back up your claim.</br>  I though b would be all for the shirtlifters being able to marry, now you're only one step away from legalising pedo marriage and will be able to marry that 6year old waifu you've been jerking off to  <br>Your detracting from the actual argument, dipshit. I never said anything about reproducing with my daughter. She is a consenting adult, as am i. Congress shall have no laws treating to parties unequally. Tell me why u can't marry my daughter. <br><br>Protip: checkmate.</br></br></br>  <br>Who said gays have to account for other minority groups that want to get married? Oh, wait. They fucking don't? They fucking don't have to account for other people who want to get married? That's fucking awkward for you. That really makes your analogy look fucking stupid.</br>  <br><br>see:<br><br><br><br><br><br>https://www.psychologytoday.com/blo<wbr>g/animals-and-us/201210/the-problem<wbr>-incest</wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>if this is what you believe, you don't deserve to be an american</br>  <br>It's well known that luminati have covered up all research showing such outcomes to promote gay agenda and depopulate the earth. Get educated sheeple. Tips tinfoil hat.</br>  <br>What in the actual fuck are you even trying to say lulz? Gas don't have to give an account for anything, but we share the same congress. and Congress shall make no laws treating to parties unequally. <br><br>Again, so you can marry your daughter or be gay and incestuous and marry your son. Why not?</br></br></br>  <br>  no notice <br><br>they announced they would decide on the case a long time ago</br></br></br>  <br> wasn't any notice <br>Pay more attention.</br></br>  <br>You just discovered Google or something ? Quit spamming this thread with links when you can have this debate using basic logic and discussing basic concepts. This isn't college, it's /b/.<br><br>Fuck ass.</br></br></br>  <br>You can also emigrate...</br>  <br><br> Your detracting from the actual argument, dipshit. I never said anything about reproducing with my daughter. She is a consenting adult, as am i. <br><br>You're* And granting you marriage doesn't guaranteed that you wouldn't have sex/reproduce with her, so it would be silly for congress to agree to such a marriage.<br><br>Marriages are for the relationship, not the benefits (which is why I don't agree with government giving benefits to married couples). So marrying yoru daughter for government benefits is also silly.<br><br> . Congress shall have no laws treating to parties unequally <br><br>Two*. Again, I don't agree with government's regulation of marriage. It'll help you if you actually took time proofreading your shit btw</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>God only knows what benefits some idiots can get from fully reading the article.</br></br>  Can't we all just agree that murican pretty mch fucked and pin all our hopes on North korea  No one has articulated why two consenting adults, whether they be mother/son, father/daughter<br>or father/son , mother/daughter, cannot get married. It's unconstitutional.</br>  <br>I think it's closer than less than 1/2% they just want you to think it's more so stuff like this gets passed.</br>  Where were you when SCOTUS handed the presidency to Bush over Gore?  <br>Lobby for the right too after the child turns 18, get enough support and you'll be able to. The law is in place currently for the protection of the child from sick fucks attempting to groom their children into marriage from an early age.</br>  <br>I guess I'll just have to break this down for you since you're too fucking stupid to figure it out on your own. <br><br>The Supreme Court tries specific cases. The Justices don't sit on the fucking bench and go "hmm, I wonder what issues I want to tackle today." They read through petitions and have to choose which cases to see. <br><br>So it's pretty fucking stupid that your argument against gay marriage is about incest, which has absolutely nothing to do with whether states can constitutionally: 1) Not recognize *homosexual* unions from other states, or 2) Openly ban *homosexual* marriage. <br><br>You want to marry your daughter? You can take the same route gays did. Otherwise, your analogy isn't applicable. As I said before, it's irrelevant to the question of whether gays should be allowed to marry, and a huge fucking red herring. <br><br>Also, you're a fucking imbecile, and it's absolutely terrifying that braindead fucks like you are allowed to vote.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Obvious desperation is obvious. Becomes a grammar Nazi when all else begins to fail. So you don't believe that goverment should regulate marriage? Then fine, I can marry my child who is an adult. Love is love, right?</br>  <br>that's not the issue. the issue is how much power do you think the federal government should have over the states.</br>  <br>Should be no states and Obama bin Hussein should run Murica for ever with his invincible legions of homos kept healthy by universal Medicare and armed with all the guns he confiscated from texas</br>  <br><br>So single people have to suffer?<br><br>how about ending tax breaks and benefits for married people period?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I take your Butthurt as failure in this debate. It's perfectly valid for me to draw this analogy. It's a question of right and wrong, not strictly legality. It's unconstitutional to ban gay from getting married. But then by the same logic, wouldn't it be unconstitutional to ban family members who are consenting adults from being married? Yet, something is unsettling about the notion. Who are you or anyone else to draw the arbitrary line separating love and perversion? Homosexualit is found in nature, but so is incest. Why you hatin, nigga?? Kek</br>  <br><br> Becomes a grammar Nazi when all else begins to fail. <br><br>More of the fact that there's a blatant difference between the little things like two and to and shows how much time you actually put into your thought.<br><br> So you don't believe that goverment should regulate marriage? <br><br>And your reading proves to be as useless as your proof-reading. I said I don't agree with government giving out benefits, which is completely different from regulating the marriage age. And again, two consenting adults having a marriage isn't fucked up.<br><br>And no, I'm not being desperate. You're just a piss poor arguer. If you wanted to make the best absolute case, you should say something along the lines of "what if a son and a bisexual father fall in love and want to marry" that way it eliminates the possibility of having children. In this situation, I still think it's abuse on part of the parent since the child should have a life outside of his blood family.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>See<br><br><br><br>Under the 14th Amendment I should have the same benefits and rewards for being married if I am single. No?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Exactly. End tax breaks and benefits for married people, government shouldn't be doing this shit.</br></br>  <br>A country founded on inalienable rights of pursuit of happiness. Passes a law allowing people to be happy. If you are not gay it has no effect on your life whatsoever, and does nothing to impede on your freedoms. Why do you feel the need to start yet another thread on the same thing for the thousandth time?</br>  <br>Grammar descrepancy is no indication of a lack of intelligence. If you want to be a proof reading chimp, go get a job at your local newspaper. The grown ups are busy.</br>  If marriage causes this much butthurt then ban it completely, no one gets married or everything and anything can. Nice and simple.  <br><br> Under the 14th Amendment I should have the same benefits and rewards for being married if I am single. No? <br><br>Considering that the benefits is for marriage and marriage implies more than one person, and under the tax break laws, then no you shouldn't be allowed for tax break. However, I agree that it is still unfair part for single people.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think that adults should "have a life" outside of their own sex.</br>  <br>It's also unfair that people with children get additional money back on their taxes each year for each child they have. Why should someone who has 3 children pay less taxes than someone with 2, 1 or 0 children???</br>  <br><br>I never called you an idiot for your grammar mistakes, now did I? I'm telling you that your grammar mistakes and miss-spelling shows how much care you actually put into typing and thinking something out especially whenever your computer underlines incorrect spelt words, WITH an option to right click and correct the word.</br></br>  <br>Its called sources you uneducated pinko fuck, go back to your mardi gras or wherever it is you fuckwads suck each other's dicks</br>  <br>exactly. this will not end with faggot marriage. mark my fucking words.<br><br>The ONLY reason that incest (and pedophilia and a whole shitload of other degeneracy) is not legally condoned like gay marriage is now is the same fucking reason gay marriage used to be illegal, because most of the population is opposed to it. Get enough people on the side of incest and you'll have "love wins" parades for that. <br><br>I give it about 30 years tops.<br><br>Inb4 "buh but muh incest produces 6 headed babbehs that have heart conditions!" there have been studies already that incest isn't as bad as the wives tales would have you believe. And really, there used to be scientific reasoning against faggotry too, until some activist "scientists" cooked up some "studies" that showed it was a-ok.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe you'll understand once you've passed your high school government class.</br>  <br><br>And how long will it be before the government starts saying that a church can't be tax exempt unless it performs marriages for anyone regardless of the genders of the couple? how long before those who don't are labelled "hate groups?"<br><br>so much for freedom of religion.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This anon gets it. Luckily i plan to die of liver failure long before you lefty pinko pedo perverts get legalised</br>  <br>Sometimes shit like this needs to happen though. <br><br>I'm against the fact that they're chosen by the current president and appointed for life</br></br></br>  <br> incorrect spelt words <br><br>I see now why you're a grammar nazi.</br></br></br>  <br>You're conflating two separate issues here. My own moral opinion with the legal issues at hand, which is what the thread is about. The question of whether it's "right" for someone to marry their child isn't what's being debated. Let me restate that one more time. We aren't debating the morality of homosexuality or incest.<br><br>I truly don't give a shit whether people want incestuous marriage. I'm just explaining to you why nobody else is breaking down why the analogy isn't relevant: It was impossible for such an issue to be decided in this case. <br><br>Your analogy is a red herring. Red herrings are logical fallacies. Like I said before, if people really wanted to argue this, they could challenge it in a federal court just like gays did. There might actually be legal grounding for it in the same way there was for homosexual marriage (assuming two conseunsual adults). <br><br>But neither you, nor anyone else wants to argue this. It's just a bullshit red herring fallacy you honestly believe is your ace in the fucking hole. You should probably sterilize yourself so you don't reproduce. You're stupid to the point of being inarticulate.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Retarded statement, that means you'd never have friends of the same sex. My point being was that spending the rest of one's life in romantic relationship with his/her father/mother/son can completely impede the relationship. Yall start fighting like an old couple, then you end up resenting your dad because he did this? Congradulations, you've now got no father as a father figure because you've messed it up in a romantic relationship.</br></br>  <br>So let the imperial resident of the white house pick. You're fucking dumb.</br>  Op here:<br><br>Oh shit what have i done</br></br>  Filthy faggots will still fuck each other whether married or not. Let the aids sort em out and reduce their numbers.  <br><br> And how long will it be before the government starts saying that a church can't be tax exempt unless it performs marriages for anyone regardless of the genders of the couple? <br><br>Slipperly slope fallacy. This ruling stands constitutional while telling churches to marry gay people is violation of the first amendment. There is no argument here.</br></br></br></br>  <br> internet implosion </br>  <br>what? Lol. You have a crystal ball now? Amazing. Talk about slippery slope.</br>  <br>Because when it comes to typical progressives and civil, spiritual or deeply personal issues...damn the legal process.<br><br>They will find the shortest path to get their way, whatever it is, and get it done. They use word gymnastics to justify their actions and go scorched earth on anyone who gets in their way with personal attacks.</br></br></br>  <br><br>How embarrassing, my mistake. Still, you can type "two" instead of "to".</br></br>  <br><br>It's not a slippery slope, it's just a hypothetical on how it fucks up family dynamics.</br></br>  <br><br><br>a hypothetical that gives insight to why it fucks up family dynamics*</br></br></br>  <br>Those damned word gymnasts with their scorched earth ad hominem tactical nuke cannons. Whatever shall you do?<br><br>Buck up faggot.</br></br></br>  <br> muh slippery slope logical fallacy <br> i don't understand how logical fallacies work <br> i don't understand how consent between adults works  <br> i don't understand basic human rights </br></br></br></br>  <br>you knew exactly what you were doing<br>you bastard</br></br>  <br>If i had faggot parents id suicide</br>  <br>what if he is schizophrenic? What if he really believes he is two people and they want to marry each other. Why are you judging him you hatemonger!? Love is love no matter who it's between! including a person's love for his alternate personality! before you object, remember homosexuality used to be considered a mental illness too.<br><br>This will not end with gay marriage. you're</br></br></br>  <br>Yep, checkmate</br>  <br><br> getting married <br> a right </br></br></br>  <br><br> Marriage implies more than one person <br><br>Marriage also implied a man and a woman only. Now that that is out the window I should be able to marry myself.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I did :^)</br>  <br><br>And when all these supposed incest activists and advocates band together and create an effective enough lobby to persuade the US Supreme Court to allow it, where will you be?<br><br>My bet: Exactly where you are now (if you're alive then). At your fucking computer crying about your inability to bend the world to your personal will. Sucks to be you, doesn't it?</br></br></br></br>  approval of gay marriage by the US public is overwhelmingly huge. an easy majority. even if decided by popular vote you would still be bitching on 4chan.  <br><br>Although this seems more satirical then serious, schizophrenia is a mental illness and it was sarcasm and not an actual part of my argument. Two people are two individuals, not one individual with imaginary people in his head.<br><br><br><br>Probaby because you weren't raised by homosexual parents? I mean, do you really know how stupid this sounds? If you were adpoted and raised by homosexual parents, you'd most likely tolerate homosexuals. Silly</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>check:<br><br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Schizophrenic here, I don't think you know what schizophrenia is.</br>  <br>What's with all the chess-styled faggotry? Do you faggots actually debate/argue like this in person or is it something especially retarded you only let yourself do online?</br>  <br><br> Marriage also implied a man and a woman only. <br><br>Marriage also means "mixture of two elements". Two being a keyword, marriage can extend to homosexuals. You are not two people. Quit with the cognitive dissonance, it's completely reasonable to allow homosexuals to marry.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Interesting, how did you recognize you were schizophrenic?<br><br><br><br>I did not say "check" as in chess. I said "check" as in "check these comments". Although the "checkmate" shit is egotistical douchebagary</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>went to a doctor and did some shit</br>  <br><br>Also marriage in the definition of "man and woman" is not concrete. Marriage has meant many different styles of relationships in the past.</br></br>  <br><br>I'm fine with homosexuals marrying, but it now sets a new precedent on what the term "marriage" is.<br><br>I love myself. I believe that I should gain the same benefits that married people have since I am choosing not to marry. Why does my status as a single person affect my ability to get a loan for a home? Or adopt? Or anything like that?<br><br>See this is what happens, however, when you do not draw the line somewhere. Equality is a great idea, but it is a COSTLY idea.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Excuse me for not being clear, I meant what were your symptoms? And I'm not the guy you first commented to btw.</br></br>  <br>Sorry, I should have replied directly to the checkmate dipshit not you.</br>  <br><br>I can live with that for sure.</br></br>  <br><br>And is it not completely reasonable to have a relationship with oneself? Many cultures practice the belief that one must love oneself to be of any value to another person.</br></br>  <br><br>Have you not read the other part of my comment? Marriage is a metaphorical combining of two different people. You're one person. If you clone yourself and get married to yourself, that's perfectly fine.<br><br>And I don't agree with the government handing out benefits.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hearing shit. Started pretty simple, not really voices but like people coughing when no one was there</br>  <br><br>The courts didn't make a new law. They basically made it illegal to discriminate against gays via marriage licenses and therefore by the 10th amendment, it became de-facto legal. Use your brain retard.</br></br>  <br><br>It's all good.<br><br><br><br>The thing is, even if you have a "relationship with yourself", meaning you love yourself, you're still an individual and not two people. Marriage is, again, "mixture of TWO".</br></br></br></br></br></br>  ITT: mouth breathing pleb faggots who think they know how law/the courts work.  <br><br>And I'm trying to explain to you that because the Government stepped in and redefined marriage once more to include every relationship possible to getting married there are going to be single people out there, like me, very miffed that another group of people get tax benefits, but I do not.<br><br>Then you'll have a few lawsuits popping up here and there. Lawyers will fight to define what "marriage is" once again and this will debacle will continue on and on and on because the line was never drawn.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Was it scary?</br></br>  <br><br>Just because you have gay parents doesn't mean you'll grow up liking the same sex. What explains how gay people come out of straight families? Complete nonsense. <br><br>Also, your bit about reproduction. It's not like we really need any more people around. We could actually use about a 3/4 reduction in population if we want to keep living on this planet for much longer.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>And as to quote an SJW standard: "Who are YOU to define what marriage is, shitlord?"</br></br>  <br><br>If you can't grasp the concept of marriage being two individuals and not yourself then I don't know how else I can explain to you that "marrying yourself" is silly.</br></br>  <br>Nah, the scary stuff came a while later.</br>  <br><br>Yes trust big business jewish studies<br><br>Yup all science is always pure and never agenda driven</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The entire population of the world can fit into Texas if lined shoulder to shoulder.<br><br>Just sayin'.</br></br></br></br>  I would rather see the word "marriage" removed from all legal documents/procedures and a different word/phrase used instead. Leave the debate over the meaning of "marriage" entirely out of consideration for 14th Amendment protection for all citizens under the law.  <br><br> an <br><br> SFW <br><br>And I don't really need to respond to that. Marriage implies two.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>"If you can't grasp the concept of marriage being one man and one woman and not two men or two women then I don't know how else I can explain to you that "homosexual marriage" is silly."<br><br>You're sounding mighty Christian right now. See how this works?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>See<br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>Hence<br><br>This ^</br></br></br>  <br>No, he's sounding like a bigot. Plenty of christians support gay marriage.</br>  <br><br>What does that have to do with anything? With the rate that we're extracting oil, metals, nutrients (for food) and other things from the earth and burning it into the air, we only have about 50 years left at our current rate.</br></br>  <br> There wasn't any notice that they were talking about this <br>lol wut?<br>It's been the most discussed decision in recent memory. It could only come as a surprise if you were living under a rock.<br> and there wasn't really any time for anyone to object to it <br>Except for the months (multiple!) between when SCOTUS decided to hear the case, and when they handed down the decision.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Underrated and informed post.</br>  <br>In doing so, everyone can have their own fancy definition of marriage entirely separate from the legal intention and requirements of the 14th Amendment.</br>  <br><br>You are correct on that. SJWs just target Christians more than any other person when trying to prove a point.</br></br>  <br>Not that there wasn't anyone talking about it, but that no one knew SCOTUS was talking about it.</br>  <br><br>I'm sure when it comes right down to it we will figure out a way to prolong our rule. Always have.</br></br>  <br><br>You've either got to be a narrow-minded imbecile or a troll. I've addressed the fact that the word marriage means "mixture of TWO elements". Marriage, when it comes to relationships, MEANS TWO PEOPLE (or more, which is a separate issue.) You can't make a mixture of water with water, because it's the same fucking thing.</br></br>  <br> We could actually use about a 3/4 reduction in population if we want to keep living on this planet for much longer. <br>It took all of history for world population to reach 2 billion in the early 20th century. People then predicted disastrous starvation and turmoil. By 1970 it was about 4 billion and it hit 7 billion in the 90s.<br>The fraction of the world without food and clean water every day has always been about 25%. The number of hungry people now is much higher than the world population of 2000 years ago.<br>There's never been a shortage of anything, we create scarcity to control populations. Money is a form of rationing. 7 billion people cannot live like the USA does, using a quarter of the world's energy, but it's a bit rich for them to advocate a reduction in world population when they are that wasteful. The USA discards enough to feed the whole world twice a year. 10% of it's military budget would save every woman who dies in childbirth, every single one.<br>The problem is the way we distribute things, nothing else.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How could you possibly be so invested in this issue and not have known SCOTUS was considering it?</br>  ITT: we post favorite childhood movies  <br>yup<br>that's the movie<br>the moment I wanted that movie in theaters I realized that I have outgrown pokemon and I was only 11 or 12.</br></br></br>  <br>at least you realized it. there's still adults that still fucking play it.</br>  bump  <br>dubs</br>  Man Mew kicked so much ass in that movie he was like a furry pink Terminator  God Tier  dam iam old  back when capturing them all was actually possible  bump  So how does /b/ shave their pubes?  <br>what makes this funny is that 42% of Japanese men in their 40's are still virgins</br>  ITT: We post our shoes.

Although on the surface he appears to be nothing more than a redneck, if you actually watch the show and read between the lines, he's a lot more.<br>Hank Hill, and by extension King of The Hill as a whole, is at its core about showing that one group is not always right, and one group is not always wrong. It's not just blind Liberal bashing by some angry Texans, or angsty Liberal bawwing like Family Guy, it's somewhere in the middle.<br>Hank is a man who represents traditional family values. He works a just-above blue collar job, has an ugly wife, and a kid he fails to understand. He enjoys working on his lawn, grilling, and selling propane (and propane accessories).<br>because he represents traditional values, he often butts heads with newer, more liberal ideas. Now about half the time, he will have a hard time adjusting, but ultimately realize that it isn't that bad, or is even correct. But the other half of the time, he exposes it for the bullshit it is and tries to save those who have been brainwashed.<br>And that's the thing, Hank isn't a racist or Homophobe, or even a devout Republican. If that was the point of the show, he would have voted for Bush in that one episode. No, Hank is a good man who just has a hard time adjusting.<br>Hank stands by his family, his friends, and his family values, and this is why he is a good character. He has a hard time understanding his son, like a lot of parents, but ultimately loves him and accepts him for what he is.<br>When you really get down to it, Hank is so much more than your average sitcom father. Unlike the bumbling Homer, he is a very real man who many people can relate to THEIR fathers. he is the next progression in mature cartoons and sitcoms, a complex character, not a 1 dimensional caricature.<br>In short, he is the Average Joe the typical person represents, and that's a good thing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>trips dont lie</br>  <br>Groucho Marx is way hotter than this shit</br>  <br>Simply cute.

Yes indeed. One MMF and one MMMF, It's very hot watching your lady moan for other guys.  Super gay  <br><br>A few times.<br><br>It was fun. It helps if you're bi.</br></br></br></br>  did this a while ago with an ex-gf... it's a little weird when you first see another guy fucking her, but overall incredibly hot.<br><br>hoping to repeat the experience soon with current gf.</br></br>  <br>Nope, but I may have double teamed yours.</br>    Everyone post their gfs for fapping purposes  <br>tell us more.</br>  <br>No, but i'd like to, because i'm a pervert.</br>  My girl loves two dicks in her pussy at once.  I want to be the guy that gets invited to double team someones gf  <br>Congratulations! You're a cuck!<br>How does it feel to be an unappreciative, self-loathing, degenerate piece of shit?</br></br>  <br>Girls love two dicks fag! Get over knowing that if you ever get a girl she will b unhappy with your small penile and she will be fucking everyone she can behind your back. Good luck kid</br>  <br>No but I allowed my gf to have group sex with black men. German here and I shared that I was going to do this in some threads a couple weeks back. Anyone want to know how everything went? She is also German.</br>  <br>Yes please. Got pics?</br>  <br>Are there that many black dudes in germany? It seems like this is getting common among german dudes</br>  <br>There are only very few blacks in Germany and, to be honest, most girls don't like blacks (for sexual intercourse).</br>  <br>only if you have pics of your girl for proof.</br>  <br>Holy shit stories! I am german too (as my gf is), but sadly she is not into threesomes, gangbangs and cuckolding-stuff :( I would love to suck cum out of her ass and kiss her while she has tons of other men's cum in her mouth :)</br>  <br>what do you want to know?</br>    <br>what it's like to watch</br>  <br><br>Yes actually depending on where you are though. Many times they will just be tourists, usually from the US army, that want to simply have fun in Germany.<br><br>So I took my gf to get gangbanged by 5 black men. I originally wanted more but it wasn't as easy as I thought it would be. Twelve or so were interested but for various reasons we had to wind that number down to 5. Anyways back on topic.<br><br>I told my gf I wanted her to get really nasty with them. She agreed since she also fantasized about this. They had sex with her for over two hours. DP, rough anal, creampie, cum swallowing, you name it she did it. I even wanted them to pee in her mouth to. Which they complied. Piss porn is actually somewhat popular in germany. Best 3 loads I ever cummed in my life.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I guess you are single and a virgin. If you get out of your robot shell and your mom's basement and discover the many fields of human sexuality you will love the wild and hard stuff.</br>  <br>watching your gf suck another guy's cock is really hot. but i didn't watch for that long - it's more fun to join in.</br>  <br>Yeah, this isn't real.</br>  I not double teamed my gf, but I was the guy who joined. If you guys wonder, it was very nice!  <br><br>Here she is. What do you guys think of her? I want to see her do this again. She's open to another session. <br><br>I wouldn't want to go that far yet but more power to you.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That depends on you.<br><br>I enjoy it. Anymore, I'm a one-shot-and-done kinda guy, but back when I was young, watching the other guy go at it got me ready for my next round.<br><br>The first time was kinda weird, but the weirdness passed quickly enough.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    I did it once a while ago with a friend and his GF, was a weird experience, can talk more about it if y'all have questions.  <br>I only need to reverse image search to see this is fake. I seriously fucking hate you shills.<br><br>Screencapping this to show the distance shills go to lie.</br></br></br>  <br>Not bait friend. Should she do another session guys? We are still in contact with those guys.</br>    <br>Hahahahahahaha</br>  I'm gona do it, any advise ? <br>I'm a french fag</br>  I want my wife to suck a huge cock while I'm doggie-styling her pussy. But she's chronically normal. How do I get her to see the light?  <br>Lol her name is savannah highnote not annette faggot.</br>  <br>you are insulting me because im not human garbage like you are? sure thing cuck, stay free</br>  <br>Try to go into it really relaxed, maybe have a drink or two (don't go overboard, you don't want whiskey dick) but enough to make you feel just relaxed enough to be less uncomfortable with the idea, makes it way easier.</br>  <br>This.<br><br>Also to anyone who is interested, in my experience the best way to do stuff like this is MMFF.<br><br>You can do MMF, FFM, both for you two and for the other couple, and same-room swapping is really hot.<br><br>When it's done, there's really no feeling of unevenness or owed anything; you and your gf both got to do something exciting and new that many partners aren't okay with, you both got some strange so the score is even, etc.<br><br>Once upon a time Craigslist was great for this but they got rid of casual encounters and IDK what sort of services are good for it now.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shut the fuck up nig nog</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Cuckolds got BTFO<br><br>kek</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thank you bro.<br>I even prepare alcool and cocaïne to help me...<br>It's her wish and if i want to do a FFM threesome, she say ok but whe do a FMM threesome before...</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>lel thats NOT your girl. That's Savannah Highnote from tumblr</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>My fear is that the guy have a bigger dick or be more long to cum...</br>  <br>It's a friend of her...</br>  <br><br>If you're that insecure, group sex isn't for you.</br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, if you insist on viewing it as a competition, you're not gonna have a good time.</br></br>  <br>If you are that insecure, then life isn't for you</br>  <br>This should be your aim rather than your fear. If not then you gonna have a bad day at the shops, /b/ro.</br>  <br>pics of ur gf?</br>  <br>Is She good?</br>  Done it a few times with pic related now. Insanely hot, especially the first time  <br>No fuck you this is b8 again.</br>  <br>is that really your gf or are you lying like the other guy?</br>  <br><br>This isn't bait. Go ahead and try image search. What you think?</br></br>  <br>no results on image search doesn't prove anything</br>  <br><br>anon i think she would be perfect for a bbc gangbang<br>u need to convince her to do it<br>pretty sure others will tell u the same</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck you bitch</br>  <br>What the hell else do you want me to do then?</br>  <br>they gotta go that extra mile in the direction away from eugenics</br>  <br>take a picture hanging in your house of her and take a picture of it with timestamp</br>  <br>I do not live with her and she is at her house at the moment.</br>  <br>text her something and post screencaps</br>  Nope but would love to try it.  <br><br><br><br><br>WTF is the matter with you cuckolded faggots? Why are you guy so damn desperate to see this? Honestly I want to know why you guys want to see a beautiful white woman doing this. This saddens me. Are you guys all gay?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What should I text her?</br>  <br>tell her to send a selfie to you. if she doesn't want to send her porn</br>  <br>Why didn't you take pics of the gangbang? <br><br>If I ever convince my gf to try something like this I would have it recorded.</br></br></br>  <br>Okay what kind of porn?</br>  <br>not the same guy idiot</br>  <br>try get the selfie first. the porn part is just for fun.</br>  <br>Anon I am not that guy who lied about his gf. I said I would like to see my gf do this. Read the proper posts anon. I wish she would. She doesn't like it though ;(</br>  <br>She told me she doesn't want to take a picture right now. In fact I woke her up but she seems to want to talk. Should I just send her the porn? What should I send her? I'll make sure to post images.</br>  no nor will I. I don't date whores. if she wants something in her ass while I fuck her, we have toys for that. other than that, she can respect the fact that I don't share, or she can go find a manwhore that does and be with him, and I will go find a girl who actually has self respect and respect for me.

Damn it this day has gone to shit ;_;  <br><br>  went to visit my friend with gf <br>  friend is chef, lays on great dinner for us at restaurant, vip treatament loads of extras <br>  drinks after dinner, all 3 of us getting on a storm <br>  back to his place for rum and some class A <br>  friend gets super drunk and high, falls asleep on couch <br>  gf always horny after md, start making out with her on the other couch <br>  skirt off, eating her out, teasing her about friend being awake <br> suddenly friend pipes up, "anon, I am awake" <br>  gf not even remotely fazed just laughs and says <br>  "you should join us" <br>  he can barely believe his luck, dick out at the speed of light never seen him move so quick  <br>  she sucks him off while I'm eating her out <br>  move to the bedroom <br>  spitroast.jpeg <br>  after a bit he pulls out and nuts on her face, I follow suit inside her. <br>  slightlyawkwardnow.gif <br>  we retreat to lounge to sleep on sofa <br>  still all on good terms <br> Done a couple more since with others</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Everyone involved has to be in the right state of mind for it to work.<br><br>You wouldn't try a 3-way with <br>for instance.<br><br>Your best bet is to stick with experienced couples.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, I have. It was awesome, though a bit disconcerting to be naked with a good friend of mine. It led to full on swinging as well as FMF threesomes. I am not a cuckold, and rarely am into the idea of not getting another girl to fuck if someone is fucking my girl. I am also very secure in my awesomeness, so I do not get jealous. Not being a jealous person is essential in doing these types of things.</br>  <br>you have earned my respect</br>  <br><br>I knew he wouldn't deliver. He was lying that that was his gf all along like the other guy.</br></br>  <br>Roofies or Mollie</br>  <br>Enjoy your life being a loser.</br>  <br>holy shit, more?</br>  I've tried to convince my current GF to let me double team her with another guy, or invite another girl into the bedroom, but she isn't interested.<br><br>However, a few years ago my cousin invited me over to play cards with him and his girlfriend. We all got fucked up and spent about 2 hours fucking the shit out of her.</br></br>  <br> Everyone involved has to be in the right state of mind for it to work. <br><br>They approached me. I'm pretty sure it was her idea because she was more experienced than him. We talked about this a few days earlier and what they expected from it. They both knew I'm pretty dominant, especially he knew because he met my ex gf and heard us fucking a few times. We talked about limits and things they want to try. Basically I could fuck her like I would normally fuck my girlfriend. We had a great night, a few drinks and it started all well. <br><br>But as soon as I was into it and her enjoying it he had doubts. I did not realise it at that time, he told me a few days later and even cried. He said he never seen her like that, giving more enthusiastic blowjobs, not reluctant getting her hair pulled and spanked hard, getting her ass fingered.......<br>He told me she was asking him when we'll have another threesome and he felt like pussy who could not satisfy her. This fucked up his mindset and he blamed me for it. They had good sex before but his feeling of inferiority just messed it all up.<br><br>Seriously guys, women want to be dominated hard. Not only physical but also mentally. Do not ask her to do something, tell her to do it! I never met a women who did not enjoy it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the difference is that guy admitted to being gay. so why not drop the gf and just become a faggot for niggers like he said he wanted to anyways? all interracial fetishists have this issue. they are all gay.</br>  <br>sure. <br>Tell me what you want, and let me see if it's in my OC folder. Tell me what appeals your interest, and what would you do to her.</br></br>  <br>nice story that's how I would like it to go down too, also amazing ass MOAR!</br>  <br>and this is how you win. You took a shitty situation and made the best of it.</br>  <br>good to know not everyone is cuck beta fag now on /b/</br>  <br><br>Lingerie, sexy costumes, boobs, blowjobs are my top picks.</br></br>  <br>does anyone ever actually believe shit like this? this entire thread is full of lying scum.</br>  <br>craigslist still has casual encounters in my area?<br>My wife and I troll around it now and then, we're very selective and have found some incredible couples</br></br>  <br><br><br>From a later mmf</br></br></br>  <br>like...that?</br>  <br>Very nice! Well done.</br>  <br>you obviously just saved that shit from the numerous other cuck threads that get posted here daily. <br><br>time stamp with you and gf or gtfo.</br></br></br>  <br>It's totally possible unlike most other things in this thread. Only call BS when you're sure.</br>  I only fantasize about it constantly but I'm too nervous to follow through when I talk about it with her .. She doesn't know I'm gonna wanna suck his dick too lol  <br>awesome, so incredibly hot to see her filled up like that!</br>  <br><br>Exactly like that! Holy shit she is a knockout!</br></br>  <br>i didn't know there were any, every woman i have fucked has always acted like a whore in bed, mabye i just attract those type of girls, but its ok i love them this way.</br>  <br><br><br>would you like to see her with niggers?</br></br></br>  <br><br>I'd like to see her anyway I can.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Yeah it's good fun as long as everyone's down and you don't pick morons to try it with.</br></br></br></br>  Done it 3 times, once with her friend and twice on holiday<br>its fucking hot but we're only going to do it outside our social circle in future, no more friends of hers (or mine) but were going away in august so I guess its on the cards for then</br>  <br>She is... <br><br>Nope, I mean not specially as she is not interested in "niggers fucking". She's not triggered by "interracial" sex. She just happens to have a big sex appetite.</br></br></br>  <br>You lucky bastard.<br><br>Any blowjob or penetration pics?</br></br></br>  Nope. We've had threesomes with females before. I think the only way I could double team her would be with a shemale.  <br>HAH! Same her with the GF. FFM is ok. but no MMF. Only exception is a shemale she said :P</br>  <br>Had she done MMF before she met you?</br>  <br><br> Human garbage <br>  kek <br>Go kill yourself cucks</br></br></br></br>  <br>shit, her ass, post more</br>  <br><br>I'm totally for the idea of her being penetrated or sucking another cock... But just not one that's attached to a masculine body. I could watch her be fucked by two girls and not be fazed, but the idea of another masculine being there just doesn't sit well with me. Maybe because i'm not attracted to that.</br></br>  Would you guys advise or disadvice having a try on mmff with gf an a couple friend of ours? Gf of ~ four years is also interested an so is the other guy. Idk but would say that the other girl is rather not interested but how do i/we find out? I think for all of us it would not be worth loosing the friendship..  Buncha fuckin cucks.  <br><br>You reek of insecurity and loneliness, guy.</br></br>  <br>no bj pics, for obvious privacy reasons. <br>Here is a blurry screenshot from one of her lover's video. And no, I won't post it, again for privacy reasons.</br></br>  <br>Yeah because I'm always timestamping my photos while nailing a girl in a 3 way.<br>Douche</br></br>  <br>we are the same! (And my gf agrees) no other masculine person should be involved. but a shemale dick would work for both :D</br>  <br>I would first advise you to be utterly secure in your relationship. If you are the type of guy who gets worried that she's cheating on you when you call or text her and dont hear back, then you should not do any of these things. And you should only do it with other people who are secure in their relationship, otherwise shit gets real bad, real quick. If everyone can handle it, then just try talking about it. My girl and I are open about it and we have gotten quite a few other couples just by asking them if they would be interested in joining us.</br>  <br>its impossible to say without knowing the people involved and how they feel about it<br>if anyone has any doubts then dont but if everyones into it then maybe is about all anyone can tell you<br>me &amp; my gf havent done mmff as in all of us in a big pile but we did swap partners for the night with my best m8 &amp; his gf once, which was fucking great</br></br></br>  <br>I didn't say to do it while in a threeway faggot. read properly.</br>  <br><br>I wouldn't do it. If the girl in the other relationship isnt interested you may have a shitty situation in your hands where your gf gets fucked by another dude and you're not getting new pussy.<br><br>The pasta doesn't lie.</br></br></br></br>  JUST  <br><br>I can respect that. Very hot.<br><br>any slutty halloween costumes?</br></br></br></br>   being a cuck   <br><br>Yes exactly. Has she ever been with a shemale?<br><br>My gf has before, and I only found out about it because I asked in the middle of a bj after we had discussed a threesome with a shemale/tranny, then got to hear the story of how she got fucked by a shemale whole she sucked me on and off. 10/10 would recommend.</br></br></br></br>  <br>nah she never tried a shemale but she wants too. so gonna find one someday! :D</br>  No but I have the urge to. Pic related.  I find it kinda funny how /b/ hates niggers but will jump at the chance to let one fuck their gfs.  <br>That girl is really hot but the filename looks suspicious.</br>  <br><br>Good luck on your quest dude.<br><br><br><br>LOL it's all those repressed feelings and aggression.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well two people have already been caught lying about liking niggers ITT so it's hard to say it's not all just shills.</br>  <br>Actually she won't fuck niggers.</br>  <br>How so?</br>  <br>Looks like it was saved from 4chan.</br>  My gf had a threesome with a couple who were her friends before. It got awkward after and they ended up not speaking after a couple of weeks. <br><br>She enjoyed the threesome and would like to do it again but she said we need to be more mature as a couple before she thinks we can try it. We're closing in on a year, not sure how long she wants to wait, hope it's not too long.<br><br>We tried to get some girls into bed in the early days but never found someone who we both liked and was interested. <br>I like being in this relationship, knowing that her pussy doesn't have to be the last pussy I get to fuck. I know she will come around eventually</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah I guess that's just what her camera calls them? Idunno man, they're definitely OC. Not sure how I can prove that though.</br>  <br><br>Actually I just checked. It's not, it just looks like it. Keep going she's hot as hell.</br></br>  <br>damn does she know you want to share her?</br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br>Nah, just don't need another man dicking my girlfriend for me to feel better about the relationship. Cucks can't satisfy women by themselves, so out of fear of losing the only women they can get, they let actual alpha males dick their bitches. You sir, are one of those pathetic, small dick, chicken clucking men. But don't feel bad, there is alot of you faggots, so atleast when she finds someone of suitable size you could all fuck each other in the bum, m8.</br>  <br><br>She doesn't, I don't even know if I want to, I'm pretty possessive but I find DP hot as hell.</br></br>    <br>just a fantasy then. would you watch or participate?</br>  <br><br>It's definitely an attractive idea and you'll get off to it in porn... But do you really think you'll enjoy it when you come to and realize you're looking at some other guy's face behind your gf and feeling his cock grind against yours? <br><br>I mean... Really think about it</br></br></br></br>  <br>Awful!<br> mfw the other guy put his dick in my ass </br></br>      <br>Definitely participate.<br><br>Yeah I agree completely, definitely wouldn't like that. I just like the idea of stuffing all her holes, maybe I could buy a strapon, hah.</br></br></br>    <br>Nice b8</br>    <br>I want to so bad. Either a girl or boy idc. Here's the wife.</br>  Never with a GF but yeah.<br><br>Basically I hooked up with this girl who lived at my apartment complex and she had a lot of issues handling the size, couple days later she came over and me and my roomate got her really drunk and ended up DP'ing her - she moved out of the apartment lol</br></br>      <br><br>LOL <br><br>I dont really dig the idea of letting another dude fuck my gf but I don't know why you feel so personally attacked when other people want to do it. Calling someone else "small dick" really shows how badly you're projecting your insecurities. You sound like a guy that tried MMF then lost his gf to someone who knew how to fuck her.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This. Want a women and me to fuck my wife.</br>  <br>Greg?</br>  <br><br><br>wtf is wrong with german people?</br></br></br>    <br>Her vag</br>  <br>It's lovely too.</br>  <br>If you read the fuckin thread you'll see they turned out fake. Newfag.</br>  <br>she has a nice twat, very nice.</br>  <br><br>Yep. Get a girl with a strapon or a shemale, if you're into the latter.</br></br>  <br>The only insecurity I have is that I'll lose my friends some day. I'm generally care free ( other than anxiety every now and then) the reason I sounded so personally offended is because it's the only way to get a point across here on /b/. You replied solely because of the tone taken in my writing, correct?</br>  <br>no, but it is her fantasy to get DPed.<br><br><br>my name is Greg</br></br></br></br>  <br>I love shit like this! &lt;3</br>  <br><br>im not gonna waste my whole fucking time to read all your bullshit, asshole<br>so fuck you, and your mother too sob</br></br></br>  <br>Because you're most likely under 18<br>Hunting is cool but not when you make shit suffer<br>inb4 this is le /b/ we are le legion XDXD</br></br></br>    <br><br>That still doesn't explain why you are so personally affected by cucks/MMF people. Why does it bother you what they do? Are you gonna lose your friends if you don't cry and shit your pants at the sight of cucks every chance you get?</br></br>  <br>Please more. Dump all</br>  <br>pics?<br><br><br>tight body, would look great between two guys</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, in fact my anger stems from hating weakness in others, and I perceive cucks as the ultimate beta male, or berry picker if you will. Wanna be my therapist and figure out why I hate weakness in others and myself?</br>  <br>being bi has to have an use, uh?</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=xDj<wbr>gBjUnmb8</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>I havent done mmf but i think it looks hot. I have 7 inch dick so i dont think it has anything to do with small dicks. Just a fetish.</br>  <br>My apologies, I should have differentiated between cucks and MMF.</br>  <br>Never "double-teamed" my wife, but when she was very drunk I undressed her in front of a close friend and let him touch where he wanted. <br><br>He started licking her, it was pretty hot.</br></br></br>  <br>Now i can agree to those guys who only watches their gf getting pounded are pretty pathetic.</br>  <br> &gt; He started licking her </br>  <br><br>dude looks like moot</br></br>  <br>Actually made me think of ninja scroll too.</br>  <br>i hate dipshits, and there are plenty of them to hate, not saying that you are, just jumping on the band wagon telling you what i hate.</br>  <br><br>Like I said before, seems like you're projecting. Or maybe it stems from something more deep-rooted than that. Did your mom leave your dad and call him weak?</br></br>  <br> <br>I agree with that, and I would probably enjoy cucking someone.<br><br>Idk why the idea of laughing at some miserable guy while I fuck his woman just seems appealing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Going straight to parents for psychological analysis how droll</br>  <br>unfortunately, not</br>  <br><br>Judging my methods like I'm a professional doing a poor job. I'm just another asshole on this website like you, what the fuck did you expect?</br></br>  <br>pretty much the hottest shit ever</br>  Advice on posing this idea to gf?  <br> Not being a jealous person is essential in doing these types of things. <br><br><br>This, so much<br>If I was jealous (which means scared of losing her) I wouldn't have been able to do it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>MMF or cuck?</br>  <br>MMF</br>  <br>I tend to agree with the last line. Rape fantasies are said to be common. They don't actually want to be raped, they want to be fucked hard and to enjoy the loss of control.</br>  <br>this guy gets it. it's where im at with my current gf. anything else gets weird.</br>  <br><br>never my girl but my old roomy and I DPd a few chicks we'd bring home...<br><br>after he moved out and married, he invited me to DP his wife. She reversed cowgirl with his cock in her ass as I laid between her legs. I pulled out and shot a load like my nutz knew I was inside someone else's wife. Damn near hit him in the face. Was funny. He yelled "heyyyyy! trying to hit me?!" I just said it was either that or in her cervix. He agreed.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Is that you Chuck Norris?</br>  <br>nice</br>  <br>Would look lovely being slowly parted by a cock doggy style after she's started to drip her natural lube from being seduced by two guys.</br>  <br>I have the same sheets. Is it from JYSK?</br>  <br><br>that's a good whore.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Same faggot. Pls go. Nobody has these cockold fantasies in Germany. We all hate niggers</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No cause I am not a faggot like you.</br>   CBF posting pics referenced in story. Gives a bit of advice on getting started. <br><br>I'd been talking dirty to my gf for a year about threesomes...started with suggesting dildos during sex, when she was mentally clear, busy really getting off from my cock in her..."I bet you'd love a fat dildo stretching your pussy lips too...". Whisper things like that right into her ear, all hot breath etc. Be convincing, strong. Positive reinforcement (say it during her intense pleasure) goes a long way over time. You have to be able to get your girl to be putty in your hands already though, I can't teach you that. I also love to tease a lot, borderline mean at times. Getting her begging for it is great fun and also I think opens their mind to the depravity you wish to share. &gt;;)<br><br>As I said this went on for a year or so, first sex toy talk (and bought some dildos/vibes along the way) and then telling her that I bet she'd like to take the dildo and my cock at the same time, or swapping back from one to the other, the fatter dildo stretching her wider and pushing deeper each time, then sliding it out and her pussy back onto my cock again just as it gets too much...after that had become well accepted fantasy talk I made the bold move...possibly doggy style as it's not as much romantic as it is primal sweaty thrusting, deeply, claiming her cunt ("make it YOURS!" she'd say)... While railing her I suggested it..."I bet you'd love to feel another hard wet cock inside your pussy at the same time as mine, both pistoning in and out in alternating rhythms, fucking you mercilessly and making your naughty little pussy cream all over both of them, you dirty girl!" ... hot.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You better not bring that out too early or when they are not gagging for it or you risk shocking them (unless you are lucky and they are already that open minded).<br><br>So anyway I knew she liked the idea when she made a nice deep ERRRGHHHH grunt sound while I was half way through the description, lol. More dirty talk along the same lines and making her cum really hard. Don't recall if I came, probably but it's not the point. Didn't mention it after sex unless she brought it up. Eventually during sex I managed to get a finger in on her G Spot whilst my cock was in her which is something I'd never tried before. I have slim fingers and average cock (length &amp; girth). This then allows you to add the physical element. Fucking her with your cock as well as rubbing her G spot with your fingers. We still have some of the hottest sex like this. It's tiring for me though, either kneeling over her missionary style or her on her back and me on the side with hand on top...and now even one under her body rubbing her ass! But I digress...</br></br></br>  <br>Enough time passes and it becomes a valid topic outside the bedroom. Just fantasy talk of course, playful. Our anniversary came along and for a month or so I had been asking her what she thought of random guys around the place, at the shops etc, did she find them cute...we were eating dinner and she confessed the young waiter (we were late twenties, he probably 21-23) was quite hot. A few cheeky grins over dinner and we retire to the hotel room upstairs...as we're starting foreplay and she's getting worked up I tell her a story about "what if we'd asked him to deliver our leftovers up to our room...he would be knocking right now and you could tell him to come in while I'm eating your pussy like this, your legs spread for him to get a great view of your swollen clit". She grabbed my head and practically mashed my face to her pussy. As I'd come up for air to give her a dirty look she said these words to me..."I want to have a threesome." Me: "Mmmmmhmmm!" Her: "No, like a real threesome".<br><br>Oh baby. Did we fuck that night...</br></br></br>  <br>We made a profile on some adult dating sites, I did a photo shoot for her at home, probably a hundred shots, picked the best couple and posted them up (pic related)...started messaging and dirty chatting. She was timid at first now that real guys were involved but soon warmed up and was even screwing herself with toys and sex chatting while I was out of the house...she was really losing the guilt over her natural sexuality (she was quite vanilla before me!).<br><br>We had the usual flakes at this point, people that abruptly didn't return messages and shit...probably married. Sucks when you are dirty talking and they disappear...eventually we found a guy that chatted nice, was available regularly and seemed genuine. We met him for a drink one weekend in a Perth garden bar to see if the chemistry was there in person. Early 30's bloke. Landscaper or something physical like that. Tanned, ok body. Small chat for a bit, talking about our sex lives and whatnot...a couple of "sometimes you just gotta take the plunge" comments lol. He left to go to the bathroom which upon returning he said was our chance to split if we wanted so he was glad we stayed. Eventually after an hour or so he just asked the question...so should we get a hotel room? I looked at my girl and she just said it was up to me...I said...yeah :)</br></br></br>  <br>He paid for the room. We headed up the lift to the room (bellboy must have known what was going on...) and she went to freshen up in the bathroom. Him and I took the chance to discuss any rules. I suspected I would get some mad stage fright, and told him if he had the same issue not to worry, we had all night. I'd read many posts that first times could be nerve wracking.<br><br>She came out and I forget how we started actually...sat her on the bed and began gentle touching and caressing probably, massage etc to get used to the sensation of 4 hands. Slowly the clothes start to come off...she's in her bra and panties and getting rubbed allll over. I can see she's getting quite wet...her eyes are closed the entire time this is happening. She's nervous too. I strip off her underwear and she's totally naked...he's touching her bare pussy with his hands for the first time...she's softly moaning and starting to writhe around on the hotel bed...things are going very nicely, he's going slowly like we talked about. She's loosening up figuratively and literally...she's opening her eyes now. She points out we aren't naked yet and that's not fair...I strip to boxers, he's got jeans on still.</br></br></br>  <br>Just watching the first video now...he's filming, I'm kissing her on her mouth and body. She's joking about how she used to be so innocent before me, not even played with herself...lol. I take the camera from him. He comes to caress her body and I mesh my fingers in hers...he moves up and cups her breast, playing with the nipple, starts to kiss her. She's closed her eyes again. I move away and he starts kissing down her body...eventually getting to her shaved pussy lips...her eyes stay shut this whole time. Short raspy breaths from her mouth are clearly audible as he gently licks her...moans as he takes her in his mouth. I'm holding her hand again (lovely French nails she had done for this).<br><br>She's loving it and keeping her eyes shut gently. He moves up and lays against her, pressing his jeans into her wet crotch, more kissing...I step back to enjoy the show as some gentle tunes play on the hotel TV music station (good to have on in the background). He kneels between her legs and pulls her thighs onto his, she arches her back so fucking sexily...he pulls her up so she's straddling him as he kneels in his jeans. He reaches under her bare ass and touches her lips more. She's bucking against him, running her hands through her hair, smiling at me...slapping her hand on his back suddenly...I guess he's fingering her but I can't see. I can see the absolute desire written on her face now. That look where she has her eyes closed, slightly furrowed brow, jaw slightly open, breathing through her open mouth. My hand is on her thigh and she's holding it there while she straddles him. They are kissing and he asks her softly "would you like some cocks to play with...?" She falls back onto the bed embarrassed :)</br></br></br>  <br>No videos now but I do recall that she then got fingered rather well by him and his strong hands. She squirted for the first time from this. Like me, he's no stranger to it so we are both highly amused when she says it feels like it's raining in here (a few drops flew up onto her). Good times...there is more oral and hands but what I had talked to him about before might have jinxed him as neither of us were hard, as dumb as that sounds. She's smoking hot and into it but we're so focused on her pleasure that we can't relax (or at least that's my issue). She gets tired of cumming and we all collapse on the bed for a rest.<br><br>After a bit of chat about how good things are going, he gets up and heads out for some fresh air and a night cap at a bar up the street. We fall asleep in the king bed together.<br><br>About an hour or two later I stir slightly, he's returned. lights are off and I'm not sure if she is awake. He gets undressed and hops in the bed. She stirs a bit. She's in between the two of us, facing me...a minute goes by and I feel the most gentle movement and can hear something. I realise sleepily that he is caressing her. She has a nice gap between her upper thighs...I'm later told that he was in fact touching her pussy and she was moving gently, rocking on his hand, before he places the head of his hardening cock between her thighs.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>God I wish this was on video...he begins rubbing her bare lips with his bare cock. They are both getting very horny over this. She bucks against him. I'm now aware that they are getting quite active next to me so I'm kissing her and squeezing her fantastic tits, gently. She loves it, I can tell from her breathing. She tells him to get a condom on so he does right away. I am wide awake now and watching them together in the dim room...wow it's really about to happen...They are possibly under the sheets as I don't remember seeing him first enter her. This was about 3 years ago now. What I do recall was just about passing out when I saw his cock physically inside her pussy. They are missionary. It was almost an out of body experience, my eyes and brain were arguing with each other about if it was reality. I thought I'd be comfortable and horny out of my mind when we did it but be careful what you wish for I guess! It was hard to believe. I grabbed the digital camera and filmed. The gasps were coming with each thrust of his cock about every second, as she grabbed at his arms and back. I got my phone for a light source and realised how incredibly wet she was when it caught the light! I realised I had HD recording on my phone so changed over and got this nice view as they moved to a sitting up position, just like she was straddling him in before when he still had jeans on.</br>  <br>She rode him so fucking sexily I cannot begin to describe it. Seeing her body moving like that, raw sexuality, and knowing she is such an innocent person doing such a dirty thing is just incredible. I love this girl, no denying it, she is entertaining my fantasy and sharing it now too.<br><br>They rolled over to have her on top, which is where the previously posted cock in pussy close up clip of her working it is from. Look how lovely and pink her pussy lips are, so clearly aroused. How wet his condom and cock are from her being so fucking horny. She then lay flat on him, fucked herself against his body for a good 2 minutes and made herself cum on another cock for the first time in over 2 years. Wow. The expressions on her face as she was fucking his cock and making herself cum were intense. Staring right into the camera as she did it, a look of exquisite pain on her beautiful face. In a perfect world I could share that with you but you'll need to imagine it. I know I love seeing other women's faces in their home videos too!</br></br></br>  <br><br> pistoning <br><br>Stopped reading there.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>No.<br><br>If your dick gets hard from seeing another man's cock, then you're a faggot, plain and simple.<br><br>Enjoy your marriage rights, faggots.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hope you both enjoy your aids beta cuck</br>  <br><br> If your dick gets hard from seeing another man's cock <br><br>This thread is full of 8th grade children with an 8th grade childs understanding of sex.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She didn't move for another minute, just enjoying the orgasm and kissing him, whispering things to him that I still can't make out on the video :) We all lay down and relaxed again. After a few minutes I got up to shower myself quickly, setting the scene for my favourite part of the night! 5 minutes later as I was drying myself off I opened the door to the ensuite and realised I could her them gently going at it. This was super hot. They had started fucking when I was not in the room to watch. We hadn't discussed this at all but I found it very exciting, probably what gave my brain the cuck tendencies it now has. She later told me that it was very fucking hot for her when they started playing with me in the next room unaware, the feeling of being so naughty really made her wet. When I came out and they saw me, she started fucking him much faster. I grabbed the phone to record it. The noises that came out of her mouth were fantastic. Grunts, squeals, screams into the pillow to avoid waking other patrons (it was about 3am). I once posted a video of this which I took back down after she got very angry. Those who've seen it seem to love it too. He really jackhammered her, slapping thighs against her ass at full pace.<br><br><br>She rapidly came and after a few slow let down pumps he let her off his cock and she collapsed on the bed again...I told her how fucking hot it was coming out to see that they had started alone.<br><br>We fell asleep and ate breakfast together in the hotel upper floors. That is more or less the story of the first MFM we ever had and it remains my favourite for that reason. Corrupting her in a way to give in to her animal instincts was a once in a relationship experience, once in a lifetime in fact.<br> end wall of text <br> pic generally related <br> last time we did it, while she was on top and had him in her pussy, I fucked her in the ass taking her anal virginity at the same time </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> you must be a sexually inexperienced 8th grader if you don't want to see another man's cock in your girl <br><br>is that how you justify your degenerate behaviour? keep obeying the social jew, good goy</br></br></br>  <br>Once with one of my GF's friends it was pretty hot. can green text</br>  I switched hands once?  <br>I'll refund your admission, 100% satisfaction guaranteed or your money back</br>  Tag teamed this girl with her BF, literally best sex I've ever had, was so tight  What if you're bi and not the other guy ?  <br>Yes, need more new stuff to fap to, posted my own stuff enough</br>  <br><br>Please tell us how seeing a man's cock is "sexy".</br></br>  <br>Read it all, good stuff.

When will our love be free too?  <br>Did you mean butthurts nobody?</br>  <br>Because literally the only reason people fly the confederate flag is because of the reoccurring American thing where they're for some reason really proud of something retarded.</br>  <br> you personally don't agree with it <br><br>wow the level of integrity</br></br></br>  <br>we nigga want</br>  <br>yeah you sure got your pulse on what they were thinking back then. pic related.</br>  <br>its the equivalent of hanging a giant flag with a swastika on it on the front of your house</br>  <br> <br>Except they didn't want to be part of that nation anymore, and instead formed their own. You fucking moron.<br> <br>The South was essentially raped and told "hey, you shouldn't have done that, it's your fault you got raped"</br></br></br></br>  <br>bump</br>  <br>do you even merika? I bet you don't even have freedoms. go get your own</br>  I think it's just a flag, a sheet of fabric. Symbolism is subjective.

One, it doesn't fucking matter what it stands for. Free speech protects unpopular expression too. Two, what it stands for is a desire for local self governance, which is exactly what the founding fathers actually wanted. Hate to tell you this you ignorant cuck, but there were no "good guys" in the US Civil War. The north was no more anti slavery than the south, and the emancipation proclemation did nothing and Lincoln knew it.</br>  <br><br>If it has SO much historical significance, why isn't the fucking flag displayed in a museum? Hmm?</br></br>  because slavery.  <br>Wrong. The south wanted to follow the path the founding fathers had in mind and not become the shithole the country is now.</br>  <br>they didn't want to be apart of the nation because they were going to lose their slave industry. it wasn't about them becoming a nation, it was about fighting for human rights or enslaving blacks.</br>  <br>stfu retard, you never know what you're talking about and you post all the time.</br>  <br>everything else is. flags are special. when you put a flag in the ground you are claiming that ground for what is on the flag, if it's an enemy country or ideology. <br><br>do you understand that or not?</br></br></br>  <br>i have no problems with any redneck flying this flag. i just don't think it should be flown by any government entity. better?</br>  <br>Not sure what you're trying to say<br><br><br>I like how this strawman comic completely ignores the fact that the flag in the comic actually wasn't used to represent the confederacy for most of the war.<br><br><br>Why wouldn't I be able to?

That isn't even the flag of the confederate states dumbass.</br>  <br>oh yeah you're right. the only problem with this whole comic is it uses the wrong flag. good one.</br>  <br> <br>technically the cross was a battle flag (also adopted by the navy). This was the real Confederate States official flag</br></br>  <br>if you actually read the comic then you'd see they are using it as a battle flag. what's your problem with it?</br>  <br>the flag was used for the armies of tennessee and north virginia, the navy, and was prominent on the 1st and 2nd national flags of the confederacy. the fact that it wasn't ubiquitous in the civil war is irrelevant.</br>  Fuck off you nongayfaggots<br>Protip im not gay</br>  <br><br> Same reason Germans can't have nazi shit in Germany <br>because it's the enemy's flag</br></br></br>  <br>fcuukk offf British fag</br>  <br>because both, legalizing gay marriage and taking down the flag, hurts the feelings of conservatives, who are bawwwing about like anything that changes and shouldn't be listened to.</br>  <br>I'm just highlighting the fact the comic in now way represents how things actually happened.<br><br>Pointing out how they use the incorrect flag to represent their argument further proves the people who made it don't know what they are talking about.</br></br></br>  <br>exactly. and it will be used to ferment rebellion so it must not fly.</br>  <br>it has nothing to do with feelings you faggot. <br><br>We live in America. America already has a flag, it's got 13 stripes and 50 fucking stars. This is the flag that will be flown at American govt buildings. <br><br>If you want to fly the stars and bars in your trailer or across your pick up truck, by all means, please do so. Just like, right now, I could create a flag with purple and green and have a picture or Bea Arthur giving the thumbs up and fly that on my property. <br><br>So relax, grab another beer, turn on those dallas cowboys on your tv.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it's a joke idiot. it points out that the man who designed the flag was not designing it for southern heritage. that's the fucking point of hte comic. holy shit you're so dumb</br>  it hurts me  Being gay does hurt! I can't imagine having my asshole getting ripped open by another mans penis then filling me full of his warm sticky cum  <br> I'm just highlighting the fact the comic in now way represents how things actually happened. <br>that's the point.</br></br>  <br>Speak your own language native american.<br>:^)</br></br>  Well faggots, the Battle Flag is still up in SC, and the nigger that tried to tear it down is in jail. It's going to take an impossible legislative action to have it permanently removed. <br><br>There are literally hundreds of other places to buy the flag online. Besides cucks like Amazon and Walmart.<br><br>There's really nothing to argue about anymore. You anti-flag faggots have lost.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Not even a britbong <br><br>I'm just smart enough to recognize that if it wasn't for the British, your god blessed land of the free would be stinky surrender monkey territory.</br></br></br>  <br>Can someone explain the meaning of the flag, the history of it in a few words?<br>Thanks</br></br>  People want it off government buildings. Why would you fly an enemy flag on a government building? Are you fucking stupid?  <br>The problem is, why are you cherry picking just one flag then? It's one battle flag of many and not even the most important so why is this even an issue?</br>  We're so fucked.<br><br>Not because fags can marry now. Not because the rednecks angry that the flag was banned on government property, but the fact the TPP passed while all you fucking mentally retarded waste of life was distracted.<br><br>Have fun America. You fucking dumb cunts. Damn it feels good to be from Deutschland.</br></br></br></br>  <br>you're the flaggot.</br>  <br>Look it up you lazy mong.</br>  <br> <br>I'm neither for nor against the flag, but I was kind of hoping that nigger woman would set the flag on fire and keep the flag flying just to piss off all the rednecks</br></br>  <br>keep crying you impotent little bitch</br>  <br>we're "cherry-picking" the flag that the idiots who live in the deep south think is the right flag.</br>  <br><br>Murder, rape, slavery, secession, Civil war, Union victory, Dukes of Hazard</br></br>  <br>The flag is just removed from government buildings. You can still fly it on your property.</br>  <br> <br>South wanted their own flag, adopted red, white, and blue of US flag, but with stars for the Confederacy</br></br>  <br>geg newfag doesn't watch news</br>  <br>*Future pedophile</br>  <br>Most Western European countries, including Germany, are more democratic than the US, according to the Democratic Index. Your point is invalid.</br>  <br>It's the battle flag of a division of the confederate army in Tennessee used during the american civil war.</br>  <br> You anti-flag faggots have lost. <br>are you joking? alabama took down their flags and SC is likely to follow suit. major retailers have stopped carrying the flag and the nation has just been reminded that only rednecks care about the flag. anti-flag-fags won dude. this was a major step in moving past this flag culturally, no one is trying to ban it outright, the 1st amendment is still in effect. its about government endorsement of the flag and wider cultural acceptance.</br></br>  <br>That's good, lets create even bigger divides in the country. You do know that after the Civil War, the North let the flags stand because they were trying to heal the country, not tear it apart, right?</br>  <br> I could create a flag with purple and green and have a picture or Bea Arthur giving the thumbs up <br><br>can someone please make this? i need this now, for reasons.</br></br></br>  <br>slavery, treason</br>  <br>even though you shouldn't. it's a flag that you should keep in your basement to remind of you how bad decisions can affect whole groups of people and nearly bring down a country. it should also remind you of how great the USA is and how easily they destroy their enemies. it should remind you of how inferior southerners are to people in the north. it should inspire fear and make you re-think every one of your white trash decisions.</br>  <br>Both are legal. Enjoy life, anon</br>  <br> Why wouldn't I be able to? I'm pretty sure all flags are protected under the first amendment. <br>you are able but you have to live with people thinking / knowing that you're a nazi. Same with the confederate flag.</br></br>  <br> <br>are you talking about the flag with the St George's Cross?<br> <br>That was adopted as a battle flag, because the official flag (  ) was too close to the US flag and was confusing in the smoke and chaos of battle, and resulted in friendly fire casualties.</br></br></br></br>    <br>because it's the only flag that people today associate with the confederacy, and it has historical ties to the klan, rednecks, other white power groups, and civil rights counter-protests.</br>  All y'all are missing a much bigger concept here. I still fly my confederate flag by the way. Come and take it by force. I dare ya. But I digress. The bigger concept here is the use and interpretation of the 14th Amendment that was used to violate the 10th amendment. The interpretation of the 14th from the supreme court basically said that no state has the right to interfere with anyone's lifestyle choices. That means that I can legally carry my pistol and rifle anywhere I want because that's my lifestyle choice. I can fly my confederate flag wherever I want because it's a lifestyle choice. I can beat the ever loving fuck out of any little faggot that I want because it's a lifestyle choice. This is broad spectrum legalization of anything and everything because of the way they worded their opinions.  <br>Nice spin, but the only idiots so far have been the people trying to have it removed because they think it represents slavery.</br>  <br>Why do people think the south was fighting for state rights? <br> south has slaves <br> slaves run away <br> slave is now a fugitive  <br> federal government says that any state of the Union must chase down and return fugitives  <br> north be like, "but there's a fuckton of niggers coming up here. We can't get them all"  <br> north gives up on returning slaves because fuck it, not their problem <br> south gets pissy and bitches about the federal government not forcing the north to catch their slaves <br> war </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  this is the equivalent to Germans fighting their govt to keep nazi flags flying on govt property. <br><br> muh heritage <br> muh history </br></br></br>  <br>Alabama took some down on an executive order that probably won't stand, certainly not past the next governor. Four retailers banned the sale of Confederate merch. There are hundreds more that don't. Everything else you posting is impotent bitching and wishful thinking. Stay mad cuck.</br>  <br>who cares about slavery? it's the flag of a bunch of traitors.</br>  <br>apparently you don't. every american has the right to fly the redneck rag AND to gaymarry.</br>  USA killed a lot of innocent Japanese with nuclear weapons so maybe we should ban the flag of the United States of America.  <br> this <br>Fag or flags, whatever. All of you are getting fucked rotten.</br></br>  <br>And the gay pride flag is associated with AIDS. I guess you really like AIDS.</br>  <br>see<br><br/></br></br>  <br>Now this I can agree with. Too bad people aren't trying to have it erased for that reason alone.</br>  Man y'all can't expect anything to be fair<br>Some things just aren't right, whether you like it or not<br>mail the government if you don't like it.</br></br>  Why do the Fucking liberals care about the flag anyways? They clearly hate our country and make the US to be the bad guys along with white males just look at the media. They don't have a right to way in on this issue.  <br>The flag isn't banned, it is just Jew stores like Walmart decided they are no longer selling them. <br><br>Like the Washington Redskins, this will blow over in a week or so.</br></br></br>  <br>no one wants to ban the sale of that loser flag. and no one is. <br><br>you just shouldn't be able to fly the traitorous flag on government land and soon you won't be able to.</br></br></br>  <br>no one cares about other countries, fuck the world, murica bitch</br>  Because it reminds the world of what a scumbag country the US is.  <br><br>The only losers here are the products of the American education system.<br><br>Because holy shit, this entire thing is absolutely retarded and no one who had a single unbiased history class would think this flag is racist.<br><br>Get your shit together, Amerifags.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It wasn't about slavery you autist.<br><br>They seceded because Lincoln was elected and they thought the federal government would become too powerful.<br><br>If you don't know anything about history, don't post.<br><br> Lurkmoar.pdf <br><br>geg fucking newfag</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this.

Gay marriage should be okay as long as your flag.<br><br>PC makes me want to puke. I hate my fellow liberals for much for this.</br></br></br>  <br>yeah, why would anyone think the flag of a rebellion that broke out due to slavery is racist? just because the klan and other white power groups like to fly it?<br><br>makes no sense.</br></br></br>  Battle flag is still up and not going anywhere any time soon. Chinese are still cranking out hundreds of thousands of them and online retailers are having trouble keeping them in stock.<br><br>Nothing to see here but mad SJW summerfaggots.</br></br>   here<br><br><br><br>If someone flew a flag that resembled very closely a confederate flag, except for one small detail: It was missing a star, would that flag be just as symbolic as the confederate flag? What if it was missing two stars? What if it had different colors? At what point does it lose its symbolism? Is this point inherently agreed upon across all the human race?<br><br>If flags were special, then the flag closely resembling the confederate flag would not share any of the symbolism of the confederate flag. They would be two completely different flags, and the maker of the flag with a missing star would be entitled to assigning its symbolism.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>geg is like gog</br>  <br>keep listening to your dad and internet forums, then when you graduate highschool, reevaluate your life.</br>  <br> The new Constitution has put at rest forever all the agitating questions relating to our peculiar institutions—African slavery as it exists among us—the proper status of the negro in our form of civilization. This was the immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution. Jefferson, in his forecast, had anticipated this, as the "rock upon which the old Union would split." He was right. What was conjecture with him, is now a realized fact. <br><br>- Alexander Stephens, Vice President of the Confederacy</br></br></br>  <br>You're autistic and that doesnt even apply to that post.<br><br> when you get called a redneck and you live on the canadian border <br> geg.png </br></br></br></br>  <br>at least I didn't save a gif as a jpg.</br>    <br>good. spend what little money you white trash have on endless numbers of flags when every time you put one up it mysteriously gets torn down. buy 100 right now, keep it under your trailer.</br>  <br> and soon you won't be able to. <br><br>The impotent wishing of a mad little cuck. Don't come back here crying when nothing happens kid. Oh that's right, by then you'll be back in the 6th grade....</br></br></br>  <br>You are wrong, sir.<br><br>Go do some real history research. Lincoln was a piece of shit politican who USED slavery as an tool to win a war. He never gave two shots about the slavery issue since it wasn't outlawed in the north until AFTER the civil war was over. The central government was pissed that the confederacy didn't want to be under the control of a large government and they wanted to tax the ever living fuck out of the south. The south wanted the 10th Amendment to be upheld to the letter. States had the rights. The central government only worried about national defense. That's it. That's what the real issues were, and Lincoln fucked up the country by severely deviating from the path of the founding fathers.</br></br></br>  <br> a country is fucked up in one aspect <br> so it must be less democratic overall  <br><br><br>Your logic is retarded.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>geg<br><br> actually knowing things </br></br></br>  <br> mong </br>  <br>Lol, enjoy getting shot retard</br>  <br>kek'd and check'd</br>  <br> [Texas] was received as a commonwealth holding, maintaining and protecting the institution known as negro slavery-- the servitude of the African to the white race within her limits-- a relation that had existed from the first settlement of her wilderness by the white race, and which her people intended should exist in all future time.

The Holocaust is proof of that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it's about what you're attracted to sexually genius. it's not even similar to murdering or not. <br><br>plus you can want to kill someone, i have, and still not do it. just wanting to doesn't make you a murderer. but just wanting to suck a dick as a guy still makes you gay. <br><br>do you understand it now?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Citation needed.</br>  <br>You word it the same way every time you obvious faggot.

If we the people are not armed, then the other rights don't matter. The right to keep and bear arms is Liberty's Teeth.</br>  <br> It's false equivalency because I say so. <br><br>K</br></br></br>  <br>only people who have lost touch with reality or are close minded would agree with the op</br>  ITT; we discus if being gay should be made illegal again  <br><br>I heard of these 2 cases in Japan during the end of WW2...
