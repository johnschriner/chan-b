I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.

Also girls generally ignore me.</br>  <br>GOT EEEEEM</br>  <br>thanks bro<br>im just feeling lonely today</br></br>  <br>*knew <br><br> Sure is summer here </br></br></br>    <br>I feel that pain, I do that and push people including good friends away unintenionally</br>  Take xanax and later smoke a Blunt rather than drink. <br><br>Works way better</br></br>  <br>Yeah. Fuck it all.<br><br>Yup.</br></br></br>    <br>Thats rough.<br>One cannot handle all of this clusterfuck of life on oneself. <br><br>I would guess that you alienate people out of a sense of pride (that has been hurt maybe). To this (and that is based on my guess on the reason of your dilemma) I would advise to offer honesty and trust to people you want in your life (good people who can help you be the best YOU you can be).<br>As to girls (plural): dont aspire to things you emotionally cant handle. Players are more often than not emotionally desolate and fill holes in a desire to fill the holes within themselves. <br><br>Find a mate. Some (one) girl to accompany you. This is where your pride plays in again. Dont let your ego muck things up. Be honest and faithfull and kind in your agenda.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I appreciate your sincere advice, I do contemplate about how validating yourself through girls can be a desolate and miserable path</br>  Impermanence is a strange state.  <br>Feel my dick you fucking faggot</br>  <br>Im not that poster but my reason is due to not wanting to bother others with venting (stressful life) even if they say I can anytime. So I tend to go a few days sometimes just in brooding, just to like keep myself up. Also doesnt help my social skills are crippled from a lack of trying to get out (gave up after turning 18)</br>  <br><br>And as an anonymous bro i shall offer the modest consolation i can provide.<br><br>I know the feeling of lonelyness. It is entirely different from beeing alone.<br><br>I think it is human to seek human interaction in your position. I understand that venturing outside to seek it with real people is scary and mostly fuitless (since the places one would gather to do such a thing are generally emotionally cold and imperonal) but consider that looking for consolation here of all places is not the right hand path.<br>I do not presume to know you or your shortcomings but i am willing to guess that if you relax and dont let social doctrine dictate your behaviour (as a loner maybe) you can find at the very least yourself and and a way to be comfortable with the place you are in,</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Feels threads might not be new but they were always faggotry.</br>    <br>lel, wrong pic</br>  <br>The ego thing is definitely true, This place has made me a bit jaded in dealing with women. I generally hate all of them when all the horrow stories posted on here are cherry picked.</br>  <br>I laughed. Interjecting humor into death can be healthy, Unless they died horribly in someone;s basement or some other dahmer shit like that.</br>  <br>these threads are a little piece of /r9k/ coming here. and i don't mean this in a negative way</br>   in love with best friend <br> find out she likes me back but because of circumstances we can't be together together <br> it's hard to explain but she's not lying, so we just cuddle and shit  <br> much more than I had ever expected because i'd convinced myself she would never have feelings for me <br> feels great <br> but <br> she's extremely busy so i don't see her often <br> she honestly puts in like over 60 hours a week <br> worry about her condition (doesn't eat often, works/sleeps/works/sleeps, etc) <br>  also hate not seeing her as often as i used to (several hours daily for past six months) <br><br> uncle died recently and is causing huge turmoil for my family <br> no will, medical bills, etc. <br> family constantly getting drunk so i can't stand to be home (summer break) <br> parents obviously emotionally distraught and tired after caring for him for months <br> i sit by and watch <br><br> research position where i'm unimportant and professor literally doesn't even read what i send <br> have to redo past six months' worth of data because it's all wrong <br> makes me feel like shit so i don't even bother going in because anything i send him will be "outstanding work!" <br><br> hate being by myself <br> have always struggled with self-image and confidence <br> feel worthless and doesn't matter what people tell me <br> feel ugly and doesn't matter what people tell me <br> feel like life is shit and there has to be something more <br> always want change but too afraid to go out and make change <br> resign to sitting in bedroom on laptop for 10 hours a day <br> parents probably think i hate them <br> it's okay because "i get good grades" <br> feels fucking terrible <br><br>this is a total stream of consciousness, i don't care if nobody reads it. i just want to write it out</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This the the only place i have where i can talk to people, every time i go outside i feel like i dont belong and in the rare event i go outside it hard to make conversation. this place is only place where a can take to people and feel okay.</br>  <br><br>Dont despare. Identify what you truly want (A fling to feel better about yourself. A Bro to talk to on a semiemotional level or an ally to stand beside you against all of the chaos life has to offer) and aspire to gain that thing with honesty.<br>If you honestly want a fling and seek it in earnest i am sure you will find someone who is willing to do that for/with ya. If you honestly seek an ally and someone who is emotionally stable and mature enough to withstand their own chaos and some to spare (yours), I belive you will eventually find such a person. Granted that person might be sorta plain but you need to check your standards realistically and dont panik if you go lucky.<br><br>I hope i make sense. i am sorta very drunk. And Sorta german for that matter</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>edgy</br>  <br><br>I don't feel it anon !<br><br>Looks like it's true what they say, size does matter!</br></br></br></br>  <br> always want change but too afraid to go out and make change <br> resign to sitting in bedroom on laptop for 10 hours a day <br><br>this is exactly the thing 80% of the people here deal with. i had this too, but as shit turned serious for me i finally got my ass up. believe me, whatever you do to change this life will be good. even if it looks bad as first, even if you end up being homeless first...</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>This is probably the coldest and emotionally distnad place there is.<br>Here you can lay your heart bare and if someone shitposts you, you can just think "hes a troll" . There is no consequence here, no filter. You can just listen to all the things that your think are ok and ignore the rest (even if some harsh words may hold some hurtfull truth) cause they are "just rolls".<br><br>Fear is a reasonable reflex to have. Social anxiety means fear of social ...stuff in general. That means you learned that social stuff hurts you. <br> <br>This is a hard thing to unlearn or circumvent, especially alone.<br>It can be done though. And i would advise you try.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's the biggest amount of bollocks ever.</br>  bumping until i write my story, hope thread doesnt 404  What's up with everyone here having social anxiety and stuff. Are there no people like me? I am pretty good at social interaction, but I depression and exhaustion have gotten me to a point where I am completely disfunctional. I haven't eaten in 2 days, because there is no food left in the appartment, and I cannot bear the thought of walking the 300 meters to the store  novafags  <br>dump it m8, we'll keep bumping</br>  <br> mfw having your problem but the other one as well sometimes </br>  Reading all these.<br>I feel nothing. You are all caricatures of humans. You should dig a big hole and lay yourselves in it. Die, you fucking waste of space. Fuck this is disgusting.</br>  <br>People with social anxiety seem to speak out more on the internet, if you ask me. They are that majority in some areas. But what do i know, im some anon</br>  <br>why are you spending your worthless life here then? for the fur-threads? makes you a waste of space as well</br>  <br>Women are human but different than men. They arent some mystical creatures like unicorns or lebrechauns. They are just dudes with ladypart and completely alien way to think (for menfolk generally) some are jerks some are tards some are nice and kind and fun to be around.<br><br>Sadly all that is generally overshadowed by the omnipresent issue of sex. Its always in the room. Its always on everyones mind. and its damn complicated and unproducitve at that.<br><br>Know what you want and dont be dishonest about it. try beeing upfront and blunt even if it offends people. Communication can only work on accident and I think its easier to try and be honest to not overcomplicate things.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hey now my life is like a depressing sitcom, thank you.</br>  <br>We are all slaves on the laws of nature. Free will is an illusion, and all value judgment of the basis of character are faulty. Shakespear said that the question is to be or not to be, but that is not correct. The question is to suffer, or not to suffer. My life sucks, and I suffer, because of my character flaws. I don't hate myself though, I only hate the world</br>  <br> be me <br> be a lonely faggot, have only a friend <br> name him John <br> John had a gf, name her Diana <br> John and Diana were happy together <br> until one day <br> Diana got tired of John <br> they broke up <br> they decide that they shouldn't talk to each other anymore <br> fast forward a few weeks later <br> i add her on facebook <br> talk to her a lot <br> find out she has same interests just like i do <br> she is antisocial <br> fast forward months <br> only met her once by now <br> i fell in love with her <br> motherfuckingshit.jpg <br> she finds out that i fell in love with her <br> she doesn't say anything <br> says that i'm all nice and shit <br> keep my hopes up, maybe she'll fall in love with me <br> fast forward tonight <br>'Anon, I'm really sorry, but I still have feelings for John'<br> remain wordless <br> feel like killing myself <br> a dude i know calls me, asks me if i wanna have a smoke <br> go to his place and have a smoke <br> he gives me some weed, enough for a joint <br> get home <br> tell her that im full of shit, she should never talk to me again, im about to do a big mistake <br> she keeps asking me what mistake i was about to do but i dont tell her <br> she logs off <br> i log off too <br> i get high <br> i start crying <br>i still feel worthless as fuck</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I find this very hard to, you wouldn't have advice/tips to over come this</br>  Poor guy had to deal with feminists  <br>You should probably just kill yourself anon.</br>  <br>Honesty and being blunt also leaves you wthout the remorse of telling that big lie ypu shouldnt have said because the truth stared them in the face too. Its definitely worth.</br>  <br>i never had the actual balls to kill myself</br>  i lost almost all of my friends just as summer started now i dont know how im gonna go thru senior year give me tips bros im 18 btw  <br>i don't quite get it...<br>what was the mistake? the weed? oh yes, you'll go to hell for that.<br>and why do you feel worthless?</br></br></br>  <br>some people are like that, deal with it anon.<br>me too, but I live and will live alone hence I'm married</br></br>   Be 21 M <br> intern with a 20 F <br> Both single <br> Really like this intern <br> keep convincing myself Im not good enough <br> to scared to ask her to hang out <br> Feel shittier everyday <br><br>Fuck me right?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>we all should, but we won't. Our programing makes us keep on living, and our destiny is to walk around on this earth while we suffer. There is no silver lining, and accepting this fact will probably make things even worse. So why am i writing this?</br>  <br>i never wanted her to know that i was gonna get high, we would both hurt each other for that<br>and i feel worthless cause that faggot is better than me, i dont understand what she fucking sees at him</br></br>  <br>Because of losers like you. I get a thrill out of knowing that by pointing out how pointless your existence is, you'll break. Which people like you always do, at some point.<br><br>I bet your entire life is like a sitcom no one watches.<br><br>You need to grab yourself by the balls and pull yourself up, then. Living a shit life is for losers.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Look at thebright side of things, always know someone else has it much worse and theyre making throught itbetter than you, and tell yourself if that fuck can do it so can you. Like say your car gets lit on fire, say to yourself at least you still have your clothes or life, stuff like that, until it works out for ya</br>  <br>first you called him friend... now it's a faggot.</br>  <br>Yeah who likes depressing sitcoms I mean</br>  <br>I'll dumb some for you OP</br>  <br>why the fuck should he be my friend? i will NEVER love someone as much as i loved her</br>            <br>You sir, need to move on. If she isnt into you youre best off without her, save yourself the pain</br>                <br>holy fuck... that's just -</br>      <br>It's a long one but worth it</br>  <br><br>I can't believe there are folks that actually give sound advice over here. <br>Will finish it up with King since /b loves negros.</br></br></br>                <br>Fuck I actually cried alot. I wish I had friends like this...</br>              <br>that's some heavy shit there. life in prison is the most horrible thing i could imagine</br>                      <br>Anyone lurking?</br>    <br>yep</br>    <br>yes</br>      <br>you're bumping too fast bro</br>        <br><br>Start going to the gym, ugly.</br></br>    <br>Context? Is it a reference?</br>  <br><br>Except weed is for losers. The point is to stop being a loser.</br></br>      <br><br>Anyone has some good sad songs?</br></br>    <br><br>You're alone because you talk like a faggot. What's with all the brackets?</br></br>    Do you know that feel when you think you have finally found someone like you, but then one day you find out something about them that makes you realize it was all in your head?<br><br>It fills me with sadness and disappointment, but also a melancholy, for that voice inside my head saying<br> this is too good to be true, there are no people like you <br>was right all along. Again.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>So your problem is you're just a loser. Stop being a judgmental homo.</br></br>    <br>idk, just saved that image. but i think it's free for interpretation.</br>  i cant take this thread anymore    <br>Flair by Josh Rouse</br>            last night i finished pissing, and as I left the bathroom, just before I turned out the light, I saw myself in the mirror. I had an automatic thought, one without any kind of provocation or mental build up: "i'm stuck being this person. how disappointing."<br><br>Can't get that shit out of my head today.</br></br>    Some music to listen while reading:<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Sqd<wbr>WTeXWvOg</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>what a feel.</br>   be me <br> 20yo <br> poor, zero salary/benefits <br> live with parents <br> left by gf <br> no motivation for anything larger plan than getting a new videogame <br> no profession <br> NEET <br>If I get money, I spend it on liquor or gamble or get something pointless timekill like games</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably wasn't a great idea to start talking to your mate's ex</br>  I swear b as soon as I feel like my interest is sparked I waste a month of my life doing something only to drop it. Everyone is always on my shit about it. I tried uni for a year when I was 18 and I knew it just wasn't what was going to make me happy. I then tried several different job areas to see which I would prefer. I fucking absolutely hated every job. What;s wrong with me? It's not as if I feel like I shouldn't have to work; I just can't figure out what it is I'm supposed to be doing. I'm 21 and I feel like my chances of happiness are slipping away.  <br>in what way?</br>      <br>That's what /b/ is for, nigger</br>    <br>was a fucking mistake to post her pics tho... i bet there were enough anons having a good fap to his thread.</br>    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;627111111 <br>Sex's</br>  <br><br>Go to the gym.</br></br>    <br>you will</br>    <br><br>Why would anyone feel bad that you choose to be a loser?</br></br>  <br>It wasn't about my physical shape.

You were just excited a girl was talking to you by choice.</br></br>    <br>Just do it, if she says yes you'll have a girlfriend. If she says no you won't have a girlfriend. If you don't ask her you won't have a girlfriend.

I fake confidecne, but inside I am so insecure that all the thoughts do not let me live. I sleep only 2 hours, sometimes I do 2x2hours, because I am afraid of dreaming. I cannot piss, eat, drink, or sleep with other people around, even though to them I seem like an outgoing person. My only thoughts are that my girlfriend is lying, is flirting with others, is doing things capable of completily destabilising me mentally. So I am cutting her off, not to bother myself.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You definitely chose. You could be bettering your life but you stay at home as a fat nerd. Being successful is being as little like you as possible.</br></br>  I don't know what's worse, /b/. Regretting asking out a girl, or regretting that I didn't. Really, this applies to everything in my life. I regret everything I do and regret everything I don't do and I can't make up my mind for what's good and not.    <br>I'll stop dumping soon.</br>    <br>thanks alot for dumping, m8</br>     Girls like me, but as a friend <br> mfw.jpg <br> I am desperate for change  <br>Should I turn, would it help?
