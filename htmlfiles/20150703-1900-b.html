I don't remember much, I recall them being afraid that if they kept digging they'd just fall forever when they reached the other side.</br></br>      <br>is it that disney "Enchanted" or whatever where they sing everything but it's a prince and a princess in modern day so wAkCy and ZanY comedy?</br>   This thread   <br>greatness</br>  Nostalgia  So much win in this thread  <br>Oh dude fuck yas</br>  <br>Unfortunately only the premise itself rings a bell, if any anon knows it would most certainly blow my mind.</br>  <br>Jesus Christ I've seen this many times along with the movie Dodgeball</br>  <br><br>I used to know this film word for word.

And I don't think it was very Disney-like. It had people dying of the fucking plague, after all, and it seemed very darkly filmed from what I remember.</br></br>  <br>As she became more famous her father "became increasingly abusive, jealous, and paranoid, and would routinely threaten to kill himself, Maria, and Judith"<br><br>What?? You have a little fucking cash cow sitting right there making you heaps of money, and you want to kill her?

I would love to trade, but all my nudes lost on old computers and cameras. I gots nonnudes, tho.</br></br>  <br>win rar<br><br>you get to see my exs tits</br></br></br>  Second we need to agree on a subreddit. there are 17 on r/moonmankkk and 16 on r/crashthisplane.

Very nice, however.</br></br>  <br><br>It's based on how quickly the votes come in, something can get to the front page with a hundred or so if it has enough traction.</br></br>  Don't tell me every plan we come up for this with will require trips, because it's just too slow.<br><br>I want the action NOW!</br></br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br>if true that makes this even more plausible.</br>  <br>and this is why they banned fatpeoplehate, though they should be going all out and banning as many harassment subs as possible. reddit's job isn't to host that shit.</br>    <br><br>What do you suggest?</br></br>  Post a fucking shit ton of feminist hate, and scat porn. Anywhere and everywhere.  Are people moving to voat or w/e the fuck is the new thing?  <br>reroll fgsfds</br>  <br><br>I'll allow it.</br></br>  Ok which one is it, r/chrashingthisplane or r/moonmankkk  I just thought of something. All the great /b/ raids had a name.<br>Usually "operation: (fill in blank)"<br>We should have one. Any one have suggestions?</br></br>  <br><br>Yes, but voat can't handle the load right now, and SWJ's got PayPal to revoke their funding for servers due to jailbait.</br></br>  <br>no</br>  <br>faggot</br>  <br><br>Moonmankkk would probably get the ban much faster. Crashingthisplane will get more visibility. Making 9/11 reddit Pao memes now.</br></br>  <br>operation cure the cancer?</br>    <br>poor moonman</br>  <br>RedditUnchained</br>  <br>i dont see whats wrong with jailbait, but the free the nipple pictures can also be worse as breasts are still private parts. to combat the sjw's who accept donations just report this to paypal. age 15-17 teenagers who are showing there breasts for donations. paypal will throw a fit and ban people who support.</br>  <br>/Pol/ did its part.

What are you, a fucking faggot?  it's full  Have any of you ever had a bad high? I smoked weed for the second time a couple nights ago, it was fine the first night, however this time it was terrible. I was hungry and ate some kind of cookie/brownie thing, then all of a sudden I had a terrible stomach-ache. I laid down on a couch near some friends then my entire body began feeling hot and aching. The more I told myself I was imagining it the less it hurt, but when a friend would say something I would lose focus and begin hurting again, I never said anything about it to my friends.  <br>No<br><br>every high I have is a delight</br></br></br>  <br>Are you fat?</br>  <br>It can happen if you get too high and you're new to smoking. It has never happened to me though. Cuz I'm not a pussy. Like OP.</br>  Edibles are a lot more potent than smoking. The THC gets converted into a more potent molecule when subjected to heat. Being your second time explains it since I've had a lot of bad edible highs even with a high tolerance.  <br>I guess a couple of my first dozen or so times smoking weed were mildly uncomfortable, but usually because my lungs were sore or something related to actually smoking. can't say I ever had aches and stomach pains because of weed, I've had plenty of them from other drugs, but weed is actually a decent anti-nauseant.</br>  <br>underweight :(</br>  <br>I'm assuming it's just because of how strong it was. The first time I smoked it was just cheap weed, but this time it was supposed to be stronger, I didn't buy it so I'm not entirely sure.</br>  <br>Were u hydrated? That shit matters</br>  <br>Easily could've been the problem. I've been practically living on Dr. Pepper and microwaved chicken this summer.</br>   at community college with old friend <br> "Hey anon wanna get stoned?" <br> it's an hour before class, so sure why not <br> go off campus <br> it's been like a year since I last smoked pot <br> even then I never did it often <br> take 2-3 fat hits off his joint <br> no more than 10 mins later <br> feel myself losing my hearing <br> vision gradually starts to black out <br> actually think I'm dying <br> can't even sit up without feeling dizzy and faint <br> lie on log in fetal position crying <br> friend leaves <br> my class has started <br> people throwing rocks at me <br> friend of friend is there and waits it out with me and drives me back to school when I started feeling better </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>that'll do it.</br>  <br>weed is extremely extremely strong now compared to how it used to be, so new smokers need a LOT less, just smoke less.</br>  <br>please clean your pieces</br>  <br>How in the fuck? I cannot understand how that can happen to people unless it is laced.</br>  <br>Well hell I'm glad it was just some pain then :/</br>  From Austin. Does anyone have a shrooms hookup  <br>I thought it was too but he kept telling me it wasn't.</br>   live in Minnesota <br> never been high <br> never even seen hash in person <br> do need to at least try <br> no connections I trust <br> not edgy enough to find any <br> afraid of the ass breaking law <br> cant afford a possible fine and dont want a record <br><br>call me a pussy but everyone I know who smokes pot has either paid a big ass fine or has a record. I cant afford that shit but I will throw in some money to share a puff</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>have you ever smoked before?</br>  <br>Lel if you lived in Austin I would smoke you out for free. I just love the company</br>  <br>Just started smoking this summer, making sure to stop a month before school starts back up. For some reason "random" drug tests love me. I've never even asked to get high tbh, just go to a friend's house and occasionally he'll have some.</br>  <br>do I need to wait for it to be legalized? <br><br>I remember 5 years ago when "we will legalize recreational pot use across the country before we legalize gay marriage"</br></br></br>  <br>What school drug tests you?</br>  <br>Public school? Apparently FBLA warrants reason for a drug test.</br>  <br>He's probably in sports</br>  <br>He had no tolerance for it and his body rejected. You need to build up to smoke intense shit, like conditioning. Plus sometimes Weed isn't for everyone ya know, unfortunately...</br>  <br>never<br>no puff do inhale..nothing..I dont feel like i fit in at all I feel terrible and depressed.<br>Im 23 working 2 jobs Im not a neet or anything<br>I just want to be happy again I havent felt good in 3 years</br></br></br></br>  <br>Haven't been in any sports since like grade 6, as long as you're in a club at my school you can be drug tested, I'm in FBLA. If you don't join a club you get extra work when all the clubs meet.</br>  <br>Lel you should do shrooms then. That actually makes your life better afterwards</br>  <br>this, or acid</br>  <br>If you have a low enough tolerance and it's half decent weed, then it's very possible</br>  <br>Drink some water or Gatorade next time you smoke, dont take as many bug hits so fast. Slow down and itll be much easier. Remember to get some breaths of fresh air every now and then so you don't get light headed</br>  The first time I really smoked is with some synthetic weed my, my brother had loaded up 3 bowls and we both smoked around 2 and a half, the only thing I had ever experienced was a buss from a joint, but once it hit me I was absolutely terrified. I could hardly stand and had a hard time breathing.  <br>Dude I ripped a bowl of sour diesel my first time. Was fine. Some people are just naturally weak fahgots</br>  <br>Thanks for advice, I could tell I needed to stop when at about the third hit I was feeling light headed. I stopped but on the walk back to the house it got worse and I just had to lay down. Will do next time.</br>  <br>Stay the fuck away from that synthetic bullshit</br>  What I'm smoking on  <br>Idk why my reaction was so bad. I've done acid numerous times with no problem and smoke cigs regularly.</br>  <br>No problem nigger</br>  <br>After that, I don't think I'll ever smoke synthetic again</br>  I had my first bad high today. <br><br>It was bad. I nearly threw up after the second bong hit, and crawled into my living room to sit on the couch. I imagined there was something pressing against my chest really fucking hard, like an elephant was sitting on it or something. Im not even hungry so after like 5 minutes of kind of clutching my torso, I got up to my room. I kept getting this weird feeling in my left lung,, like it was gonna collapse or something. And it got worse over the course of a few hours, I was short of breath even though I could technically breathe fine. I kept thinking that if I breathe in too much, my lung and heart will "pop" the way ears do on an airplane, and so I would only take short, small breaths. I tried to calm down by talking to some of my friends but i couldn't get any of them to text back. That was around 1 and the lung collapse-y feeling is still kind of here, it wasn't a fun experience.<br><br>I think 1 bong rip is enough for me now</br></br></br></br>  <br>Im sorry you had to smoke it in the first place. Weed is fucking awesome, but hell i HATE synthetic shit</br>  <br>About the weight on your chest. You could've fallen asleep and had had paralysis sleep, I used to have it about every week, there are three different forms. You should look it up.</br>  <br>I don't think I'll ever smoke synthetic again after that</br>  <br>I definitely didn't fall asleep, but yeah I've had that shit before. Fucking terrifying.</br>  <br>That weight was your heart freaking the fuck out. When you have a heart attack you feel that same weight. Sometimes if I'm really high ill feel it but you jsit have to calm yourself down</br>  Yeah I had a bad experience on my birthday a few years back. I had a total of 4 bongs and 4 pipes so I loaded all of them and had a group of 5 people smoking and ontop of that I smoked an entire blunt to myself, vomited everywhere and bad shitty stomach pains.  <br>decent collection /b/ro<br>i'm nasty as fuck about my bongs, i mostly just stick to a thin 18" straight shooter, holds about a quarter cup of water which i change maybe once every 2 ... gets really nasty by the end considering i smoke my bowls down all the way and ash into the stem like a lazy piece of shit by the time i change it it's usually black sludge</br></br>  <br>I tried 2 more times after that, it's really not to bad if you know your limit. I'm fairly new to smoking so really synthetic is the only thing I've ever smoked</br>  <br>Did you swallow a little bit? Swallowing a bing rip is the most nauseating feeling you will ever experience. And from what your saying, it sounds like you took too big of a rio and got way too high too fast. You just gotta remember no one has ever died from it and that inhaling/exhaling is your best friend. Sorry for the bad high bro i would of helped if i could</br>  <br>You've got to be smart about it. Don't smoke in an alley, it's too public. Smoke in the comfort of your own house. Hotbox your car, but only in the garage. Shit works only if you don't get caught. Been smoking weed for 5 months, have not gotten caught yet. Could be because I'm so new, but I also know people who have smoked for more than 5 years, and still haven't gotten caught. It only works if you're careful.</br>  <br>Synthetic weed can kill you. You know that right?</br>  <br>It's not to bad if you know you're limit, I'm fairly new to smoking so synthetic is the only thing I've ever really smoked. Never really gotten high off of real weed.<br>But that being said I think I'm done with synthetic</br></br>  Only bad high I've ever gotten was when I smoked a shit ton, and the only thing that made it bad was the burning in my lungs.  <br>*2 weeks</br>  So /b/, trips decides what I do-<br> be me, 22, have new girlfriend <br> she's a virgin, gets freaked out when I tell her about my sexual history, especially that my last relationship was an open one.

Dear god, how she wants the D <br> fooling around last night, mostly oral stuff, and she stops right in the middle of it and asks if I've ever been tested <br> dafaq.jpg <br> I say no, because honesty <br> 'how do you know you're clean?' <br> so at this point I've gone for over a year without having sex, have no symptoms, and the last girl I Did fuck just had some other guy's baby and is clean. Def not telling her that <br> just told her 'I don't' <br> find out that she got some condoms from Planned Parenthood <br> now it's a fucking game to her to get everything ready for us to have sex while making it clear that I'll have to wear one of her fucking cock-suffocators <br> wat do? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>get tested retard</br></br>  <br>I'm not letting someone shove a q-tip down my dick hole just to prove what I already know</br>  <br>Also, pic related<br>Because that's not me</br></br>  <br>You have two options op<br>A.

I'd be freaked out if she did.<br>What I'm not crazy about is the fact that she thinks I'm dirty just because I'm not a virgin like her.<br>Also, not trips.</br></br></br>  Also, most MD's just order the blood or urine test.
