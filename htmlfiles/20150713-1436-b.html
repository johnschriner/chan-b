I'm not even a towelhead. But that will never come to pass due to all the added shit.</br>  9/11 was an inside job.  <br>Faggot.</br>  I eat my boogers  I have a rape fetish (receiving)  I'm not happy with my life. I have a plan, but no desire to do anything.  if i was offered a place at isis, i would totally go there.  i cheat on wife all the time with hookers but i lover her!!!!  I have fallen back into depression again after 2 years past it but don't want to tell my girlfriend and family in case they are ashamed of me  <br>your depression comes from some were?<br><br>not happy at work?<br><br>how old are you?</br></br></br></br></br>  I want to leave my family and everyone else i know behind, and start a new life somewhere.  <br>why?</br>  <br>I'm in love with Anna.</br>  I didn't get the appeal of 12 monkeys, I thought it was redundant and pointless.  <br>No one gets ashamed if you get a cold or any other sickness. Why would they be ashamed of depression? It's not something that you choose</br>  <br><br>So am I. I tried telling someone, but they didn't believe me. So now I just keep it inside. <br><br>It's hard to explain that it isn't a momentary thing like being upset because your girlfriend left you. It's a disease that has always been there, and always will be. I'm mentally ill.</br></br></br></br>  Kissless virgin faggot, been working on this girl for over a year. Terrified of rejection/friendzone, too much of a bitch to push it any where, getting tired of putting all the work in to get her, constant texting, defending etc, only because i'm afraid she doesn't like me back.  <br>I hate black people.</br>  I've fucked 2 girls whilst in my current relationship. One of the girl's was my girlfriend's best friend. I fucked her many times and would do it again because she is so damn sexy. The only reason I can't is because she hates me.  <br>Fuck off, asshole<br><br>sorry</br></br></br>  <br>really lately its got to be the gay hookers. i go out a couple times a month and pay street hookers so i can suck their dick. i really cant imagine ever stopping, as it's become more and more frequent.</br>  <br>I love sucking cocks I think im a bit gay but I also like women sometimes</br>  <br>Lost my job in March, haven't found one since. I'm 25</br>  <br>Man up you fucking faggot, ask her out and stop being a bitch. If not you'll be a beta faggot forever.</br>  Taking a shit while I watch futurama  <br>Are you Greek? Coz that sounds Greek.</br>  <br>Kek no thank fuck I don't live there but I have been and its a nice place, the old temples are a shithole though, they don't look after them at all</br>  <br><br>Depression is rough, the people who are worth their salt aren't going to be ashamed of you. It was hard telling my friends and family, but they have been doing whatever they can to support me when I need it. I owe them so much more than they realize.</br></br>  <br>Many people don't understand that</br>  <br><br>If you don't make a move, she won't know that you're interested in her. And bitches rarely make the first move. Drink some liquid courage and ask her out.</br></br>  I want to fuck my son  i wanna suck a guys cock  <br>i am currently going through hiv tests which is scaring the life out of me. i havent had the fear of death for a few years since my first overdose but my life seems to have hit rock bottom.</br>  <br>Yea people are actually quite nice even though I'm German. Not at all like media describes it</br>  Should have stopped talking to her when she ditched me to hang out with another guy. Would have saved me a lot of heartache two years later  <br>I fucking hate bananas, sunflowers, children, scrpited reality, the queen, talkshows, gays and lesbians, Oprah, feminism, france, YLYL threads, the Kardashians, power metal, gothics/emos, useless activism, the "victim role", pork and most peoples habit to end their sentences with questions, know 'im sayin?</br>  Gotdamnit stop playing the victim card and grow a pair. Faggot.  I genuinely dislike autistic people. They make me cringe. I wish they would all get quarantined someplace where I didn't have to know they existed.  <br>nothing</br>  <br><br>I'm not the one you replied to, but I've always been afraid of seeming like I need too much support. The one girl I have told won't even talk to me right now (she's on her period and being a cunt), but sometimes I feel like she doesn't want to talk because I'm a burden.</br></br>  I've go plenty of money and don't have to worry anymore for the rest of my life but I'd give all of that up, becasuse I just want my mom back.  my friend just said he got wicked drunk for the first time and liked it<br><br>I am worried he will drink more now</br></br>  I had a really gay experience that i never told anybody about when i was in 4 grade  I was sodomized by a pack of rabid wild beavers while hang gliding when I was 14.  I've met, talked with, lived with and worked alongside a lot of kinds of people, and black people are genuinely worse and more unpleasant to be around than other populations.  <br> greentextit? </br>  <br>It's probably cause you are a downer, stop being such a bitch, unless they are a huge asshole or you are a huge asshole they probably don't think like that.Grow a pair and gain some self confidence.</br>  I fucked my friends ex girlfriend and am not ashamed of it  I've been in a relationship with this girl for years. She seems happy with where our relationship is but I'm not. We've never had sex or done anything of that nature, but more than that it often feels like i dont know how to move forward, or even if we can. It's really hard for us to communicate about this stuff because both of us internalize our feelings so much. I love this girl and i feel lucky that I even have someone who cares about me, but the fact that it doesnt really feel like weve gotten anywhere in 2 years really bums me out.  <br>My girlfriend is working like a fucking cunt trying to keep our heads above the water, no way am I gonna bother her with this right now. I know she would shout at me if she knew but I would rather not stress her even more with this shit</br>  i finally feel peaceful. i have a solid plan in place to kill myself and have it look like an accident.  <br>hang in there man it gets better :)</br>  <br> ex girlfriend <br>What is problem here?</br></br>  <br>Protip: Moving on can solve much of your problems.</br>  <br>hahahahahahahah</br>  <br><br>Yeah, it's hard. There are people in my life who just stopped contacting me or talking to me after I've told them. I'm not saying go out and tell the world you have depression, but if someone asks what's wrong, it doesn't hurt to tell the truth. Being honest about it is what helped me find the friends that truly cared about me. I hope things work out for you, anon.</br></br>  Im trying to stop masturbating because it makes me so tired but its hard because its like the #1 stress reliever for me  <br>I'm the true pisslord and I dunno why I collect gallons of piss from over the years<br><br>Just the way I learned how to piss</br></br></br>  <br> invite her for movie and cuddle <br> "wanna try something more intimate tonight?" <br> "like what?" <br> "sex" <br><br>if she says no dump her lol</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I'm transgender and I'm tired of being forced to prove it to shitty people that have a problem with it. Staying male is making me want to kill myself every day and all I ever do anymore is sleep so I don't have to be awake and hating myself.<br><br>Fuck everyone else. I'm trans and I'm going to live my life however I fucking please.</br></br>  <br>not be a faggot, get drunk with him<br><br>then suck his cock gay sex is better when youre drunk</br></br></br>  <br>details?</br>  I just want to make videogames, but I need to pay rent.  i cut my chest with razor every now and then cause i hate myself and too coward to commit suicide  <br>you really wanna know?</br>  I deserve more than I'm getting  Olivia I'm falling for you  <br>dead serious man</br>  I'M GAY!  <br>carbon monoxide poisoning via a heater with poor ventilation in a small enclosed space<br><br>just have to wait until it gets cold enough at nights where it would be reasonable for me to use a heater. i'm thinking october, november at the latest.</br></br></br>  I need to lose weight I need to stop being a bitch get a girlfriend I'm tired being a bitch.  <br>Prepare for dox</br>  <br><br>One of my best friends was working hard as well. I'm not saying you should always rely on them and call on them nonstop. People have their own lives to live, but even if they continue to treat you the way they treated you before you told them, while understanding that there are some periods of time where you are at your worst, it helps.</br></br>  <br>Make sure it's a gas heater</br>  <br>Then do so but keep it off the goddamn internet</br>  <br>-how long does it take<br>-100% painless (like wont wake up in the middle of the trip and start coughing orsome shit)<br>- i live in my parents house but have my own room, is it possible to do it without affecting the other rooms?</br></br></br>  <br>Try finding someone to talk to about it? Even if its not someone who knows you very well, fibding someone who will listen to your whole story can be really helpful. <br><br>Short of that, try asking yourself what good hurting yourself will do.</br></br></br>   with gf for 8 months <br> in hs so not too serious <br> got a few BJ's, virgin fag <br> shit was so cash <br> total stoner before we started dating <br> gives me choice between her and weed <br> mfw <br> beta so I stop for her <br> smoke once after 3 months with friends <br> "dont do it again or we're done" <br> "but I din du nuffin" <br> jk, bullshit promise about how I won't again  <br> 8 months in, do it again with same people <br> "Anon I'm breaking up with you" <br> too much of a stupidfag to lie <br> that was about 5 months ago <br> still really miss her, wish I could do things over again </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I'm 21 making a rather comfy salary with the possibility of more, but no degree. I'm in school idly to eventually finish one, but I don't feel like I can be arsed. It feels like a waste of time and money, and then that makes me feel that everything is a waste of time and money.

This is the exact opposite of bait, what is this called, OP?  <br>reason?</br>  <br><br>Logic? Rationality? Facts? Reasoned debate? Summat along those lines...</br></br>  There's nothing to discuss here then /thread.  <br>religion is all about personal responsibility. there's a huge emphasis on sin/karma/etc. and many definitions of god include ineffability or describe a metaphysical concept, or are "defined" only through negation (apophatic theology), so it's silly to dismiss ALL possible conceptions of god.<br><br>do some reading into contemplative christianity, sufism, etc.</br></br></br>  <br>Because if you're nothing but a random selection of chemicals brought into existence by chance, then there is no such thing as morality. <br><br>And yet we're all hard wired with not only morality, but also spirituality (however that manifests itself in the individual) and as such proves that there is something about Man that makes us different than any other creature on earth. <br><br>Also, the fact that the "uneducated" had a better grasp on this than you is telling of your own infantile ability to understand your place in the universe. <br><br>Don't listen to Catholics, Mormons, Muslims, Hindus or anyone else. Understand for yourself. <br><br>If you want to know what "christians" are really supposed to be following, read Matthew, Mark, Luke and John for yourself and then get an opinion based on the true teachings of Christ. Not what someone else tells you he said.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Religion used to be needed because stupid sand niggers didn't know how to not put their dick in everything that moved  <br> implying things have changed </br>   implying that morality is in no way material, even though thought processes can be recorded and recorded via electrical (Aka material) impulses in the brain   <br>I'll give you 100 morals to shut the fuck up. you can even keep the box.</br>  <br>By the way I have read the Bible, it is full of contradictions. Baffles my mind how anyone can take it seriously <br> pic related </br></br>    <br>Meant for <br/></br>  <br>I've read the Bible, New and Old testament. The Old Testament god wasn't very big on love and forgiveness.</br>  <br>it is an enormous fairytale, indeed...</br>  <br>No, in fact the only "good" man in Sodom in God's eyes is apparently a guy who offers his daughters up to be raped instead of angels. Kek</br>  <br>easy. don't take it literally, and realize that it was composed by lots of different people over a vast span of time, represents many different theological positions, and was redacted quite a bit.<br><br>there's a lot to get out of it if you don't throw the baby out with the bathwater. just apply some textual criticism and read the book for what it is.</br></br></br>  <br>The purpose of what you read in Genesis is for us to see just how sinful and corrupt man was. The average citizen in this age cannot fathom just how people were back then. It all has the same message: man is sinful and hopelessly lost without a Savior.</br>  <br>much more than that. "fairytales" (mythology) is only one aspect of it. it's also poetry, moral guidance, hymns, embellished historical narratives, theology, etc.<br><br>and the fairytales are some of the best stuff. they tell us a lot about judaism's relation to other near eastern religions and give us an insight into ancient religious practices in the levant.</br></br></br>  ha ha ha silly pic  <br>Sex between man and woman is a sin. Sex between man and man is a sin. God says that all sins are equal to each other.<br><br>Whats the problem with homosexuality then?<br><br>Checkmate theists.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>common creationist fallacy; they are completely baffled by naturalist and empirical thinking and are of a mistaken belief that "because they can't conceive of empirical thought there is no way it could possibly work", even in the face of overwhelming evidence that it no only works, it works over and over and over again in nature. Not only that, but natural principals work in the most simple of ways. Their appeal is to some kind of incredibly complex series of meta processes that could never occur in nature; and the fact of the matter is the fundamental processes of life occur by accident in nature all the time.</br>  <br>Ex-christian here. I went to a Christian private school for years and they, along with the majority of christians, believe that the Bible completely factual and everything in it is true. They take the bible very literally. <br><br>Also The current version of bible only has two "theological positions", the old and new testament, because most other books of the bible that contained other views belonging to different sects etc. were not included in the book.</br></br></br>  Some gods are real. I know. I took LSD and i'm a doctor.  Why do we tell children Father Christmas isn't real when he's exactly the same as the Jew God?  <br>If I made up a religion today where the afterlife was literally in the clouds, everybody would laugh since science has disproven it. They are made by the water cycle, we literally can see them from satellites, etc etc etc.<br><br>But nobody does that about Christianity. Just because it has been around so long, nobody seems to give a shit that it's completely bullshit a lot of the time. If you ask a Christian about this, they'll give some bull about how "it's a metaphor" and "oh I was just pretending to be retarded."<br><br>Well that's not the fucking case. Way back centuries ago, people LITERALLY thought the clouds was where heaven was... think Tower of Babel. Why the fuck would they build a tower "into the heavens" aka really far up into the clouds if they didn't LITERALLY think that was where God was? I think the moment Yuri Gagarin said he didn't see God from space is when project cleanup happened and Christians began saying it was a metaphor the whole time.<br><br>Fucking theists.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> they believe this <br> they believe that <br>so don't believe like they do.<br><br> The current version of bible only has two "theological positions", the old and new testament <br>you literally don't know what you're talking about. there are a range of theological positions just within the old testament. look at the afterlife- is it the nothingness of Sheol? is there a reward? is the soul judged? is it the same for the righteous and the unrighteous, or do good boys get seated in the bosom of abraham? does man have a spirit like the beasts, or something special? what about the resurrection?<br><br>the old testament offers a range of answers to these questions. it doesn't offer a single, consistent position.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> "oh I was just pretending to be retarded." <br>topkek</br></br>  <br><br>Evidence such as? Has life ever been observed being created out of nothing?</br></br>  <br>yeah, its called pregnancy, look it up</br>  <br><br>You do realize that cells are living, right?

In fact, the Bible says that when we break one law, we are guilty of breaking all of them. <br><br>Homosexuality is a sin because it goes against the natural order of how God established marriage between one man and one woman.</br></br></br></br>  <br>OMG, topkek, HELLO, it's 2015!!!</br>  <br>the bible indicates that all sins are in fact not equal, and some offenses are more serious than others.</br>  <br>nah man we are just hopes and dreams. wtf are cells that shit dont exist</br>  <br><br>Yes, like murder. If you murdered someone, you'd be tried and killed.</br></br>  <br>not even talking about women themselves<br><br>  you dont know how pregnancy works do you <br>  inb4 permavirgin </br></br></br></br>  <br><br> For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.  <br>James 2:10 (NIV)</br></br></br>  <br><br>I used to be believe all that too. When you have to deal with a traumatic experience, it really brings you face to face with reality. <br><br>I'm a pretty chill Christian. We get a bad rep for Jesus' sake. People want to make statements about my faith and expect us to remain silent, but there's often an answer for just about anything concerning God, the Bible, Christianity, Jesus, Heaven and Hell, theology, etc.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sauce for the pic?</br>  <br>Moar!</br>  <br><br><br>  for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God <br>Romans 3:23 (NIV)</br></br></br></br>  <br>samefag starts same thread multiple times today. Get over your god hate.</br>  <br><br>Not nothing, but the elements carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and sulphur. With the addition of some electricity.</br></br>  <br>God, I want to fuck her so bad</br>  <br>The bible also says children should be killed with they disobey their fathers. I think we should follow the bible a little more closely as well...</br>  <br> Scripture shows that in God's estimate some sins are worse and bring greater guilt than others, and that some sins do us more damage. Moses rates the golden calf debacle a great sin (Ex. 32:30). Ezekiel in his horrific allegory says that after Oholah (Samaria) had ruined herself by unfaithfulness to God, Oholibah (Jerusalem) "became more corrupt … in her lust and in her whoring, which was worse than that of her sister" (Ezek. 23:11, ESV). John distinguishes sins that do and do not inevitably lead to death (1 John 5:16), picking up Jesus' warning about the unforgivable sin (Mk. 3:28-30). <br> in Exodus 32:21, Moses asked Aaron: “What did this people do to you, that you brought so great a sin upon them?” Obviously, this is comparative language, indicating that Aaron’s sin was more evil, or had greater implications than some other sin. We see this concept carried over into the New Testament as well. In Matthew 5:19, Jesus said that whoever breaks “the least of these commandments, and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven.” Clearly, certain commandments were considered “least” and, by comparison, others must have been considered “greater.” </br></br>  <br>"all have sinned" doesn't mean "all sins are equal"</br>  <br>Which is exactly what Darwin believes, right? A random bolt of lightning hitting a pond full of the right chemicals which some how created a replicating cell which somehow became intelligent, which somehow developed a consciousness, which somehow became a fish.</br>  <br>Deuteronomy 23:1 ESV<br>No one whose testicles are crushed or whose male organ is cut off shall enter the assembly of the Lord</br></br>  <br>missing quite a few steps between self-replicating organic molecules and fish. and there are different theories as to how those initial self-replicators developed.</br>  <br> asked Aaron <br>read asked anon, bible nearly got to me</br></br>  <br>More believable than "a man in the sky created the universe in seven days"</br>  It's all just infinity oberserving itself, it's just a ride. Bill Hicks knew...  <br>That probably wasn't what Darwin thought. Darwin was a religious man and probably believed in a miraculous creation of life. He laid the foundation for evolution via natural selection, which is what happens to life after it's already come about.<br><br>What does it matter what Darwin thought anyways?</br></br></br>  <br>Deuteronomy 22:28-29 NLT) If a man is caught in the act of raping a young woman who is not engaged, he must pay fifty pieces of silver to her father. Then he must marry the young woman because he violated her, and he will never be allowed to divorce her.<br><br>So sayeth the lord YOUR GOD.</br></br></br>  TELL ME THE SOURCE OF THE OP PICTURE.  <br>NICE! Gonna become a christian.<br>50 pieces of silver is how many Euros?</br></br>  <br>Ah, Christianity, so righteous and wholesome</br>  <br>euros are for niggers.</br>  <br>your mom wasnt so picky?!</br>  <br>laves, obey your earthly masters with deep respect and fear. Serve them sincerely as you would serve Christ. (Ephesians 6:5 NLT)</br>  <br>Did Darwin believe in abiogenesis?</br>  <br>It's 570 grams of silver, which should be a bit north of 275 American at the moment.</br>  <br><br>just fyi, that shit is old, old testament. the social context is no longer relevant, same as the verses that gives rules on how to treat your slaves. and jesus was born many centuries after those verses were written.</br></br>  <br>Slaves then were treated as servants. They ate, slept in their masters' houses and were treated like people. Not like the slaves you saw during early American history.</br>  <br>Why do you have to be mad, atheist? Why can't you accept the fact that you'll never know or understand the real truth regardless of what it really is?</br>  <br>ah great, fuckin party pooper. so islam it is...</br>  <br>Probably not. Abiogenesis came about long after Darwin. He had a religious upbringing, tried to get pushed into the church by his father (going off of memory here,) and was a lifelong Catholic. There would have been little known evidence of abiogenesis when he was alive. It's much more likely that it's a popular misconception that he believed it, because of how often evolution is conflated with abiogenesis.</br>  <br>Still, though, the truths of the Bible are supposed to be eternal, according to its own teachings; they should still be setting the precedent in 2011.</br>  I always love coming to these threads. Amidst the bullshit there are some intelligent debates. But what about people like myself, who believe in one God, but also believe science, fact, and reason? For example. In Genesis when it says that the universe (heavens and earth) were created in a matter of days, I believe each one of those 'days' spanned billions of years, simply because God would be above time. Time for him would not be linear like it is for man, not would our measurements apply to God.  <br>agreed, all religiontards are caveman-level idiots</br>  OPs just mad cuz his dog died on a Sunday and his grandaddie had cancer from him being such a faggot  Anyone who is captured will be run through with a sword. Their little children will be dashed to death right before their eyes. Their homes will be sacked and their wives raped by the attacking hordes. For I will stir up the Medes against Babylon, and no amount of silver or gold will buy them off. The attacking armies will shoot down the young people with arrows. They will have no mercy on helpless babies and will show no compassion for the children. (Isaiah 13:15-18 NLT)  <br>didn't they think the night sky was just a sphere enclosing the earth</br>  <br>WUT YOU SAY TO ME?!?</br>  <br>They sure as hell thought the sun went around the Earth</br>  <br>Oh, okay, so that means having slaves is good!</br>  However, you may purchase male or female slaves from among the foreigners who live among you. You may also purchase the children of such resident foreigners, including those who have been born in your land. You may treat them as your property, passing them on to your children as a permanent inheritance. You may treat your slaves like this, but the people of Israel, your relatives, must never be treated this way. (Leviticus 25:44-46 NLT)  <br>so you actually believe we are all descendants of adam and eve?</br>  <br>ayy lmao<br>it's you again</br></br>  <br>post-hoc rationalization can be used to 'prove' most anything.</br>  Well think I might kill myself tonight and I'm telling you because you are my only friends because and my brother made me go to a party with him and everyone is fake and I can't stand it.
