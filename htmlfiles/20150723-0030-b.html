[ Does /b/ hate Germany?    <br>nein.</br>    <br>no, /b/ loves harmony, anti-racism, anti-nazi and multiculturality</br>  <br>one of the best people I came across in my city are germans. REALLY REALLY GOOD PEOPLE</br>  <br>Of course not! Why would I?<br>The Germans are really friendly and polite.<br>They aren't smug or self righteous like americlaps. <br>Their streets are super clean.<br><br>Literally nothing to hate about Germany.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>/b/ hates todays germany<br><br>/b/ loves the germany of the 1930's and 1940's<br><br>hitler was a true hero and his achievements were only denigrated by the allies and the jews who controlled the allies after he lost the war<br><br>the world would be a better place if hitler had won</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I do, but I cant say why. <br>There are some really nice germans, that I get along with great.<br>But over all? nah. They seem arrogant and bitchy.<br>But, I also hate the people of my own country, so yeah.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Tyr didn't pave the way for shit. Odin made sacrifices for mankind to gain basic knowlege, until then mankind was given shit from the gods.</br>  Nah. It's not like the dropped atomic bombs on civilians or anything.  <br> Arrogant and bitchy <br><br>That is just not true! Of course all countries have lame people, but this is definitely not the mentality I see in Germans.<br><br>But maybe you just don't like people?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Moses to Annslinger, bitch.</br>  nah they're alright. i hate the french though.  <br>Their politicians, yeah. But all the Germans I've actually met have been pretty cool guys.</br>  <br>The only people who don't hate the French are the French</br>  ive nothing against the germans, infact how their government runs is alot better then what the UK currently has<br><br>3rd most voted part only gets 1 seat, something very wrong with a system that allows that to happen.</br></br>  <br>Everyone hates eurocucks.</br>  Hey /b/, I have an idea.<br><br>Right now, with Tumblr defending transsexual and trans-racial identities, we should get them to defend another one: trans-age.<br><br>I know it sounds stupid, but hear me out.<br><br>First of all, Tumblr is infested with hundreds of self-righteous 12 year olds who think they're mature. So then, if the trans-age agenda moves forward, they will jump at the opportunity to "identify" as older and more mature. They will rally congress to recognize trans-ageism, and allow those who "identify" as 18+ to vote, etc. And congress will listen, of course, since it is infested with leftist gayloving jews.<br><br>So once trans-ageism is recognized, the good stuff starts to happen. Statutory consent laws will be thrown into the dust. 12 year olds will enter the government. The government will break down due to inadequacy. With the fall of the government will also bring the fall of the Jews, and the economy. The fall of the American economy will bring global economic collapse.<br><br>/b/, this is our chance to make a difference, and possibly alter history. Go to Tumblr and start posting. Let's get the trans-ageism agenda started.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>      This is part of your masterplan to fuck little girls legally isnt it?  yeeeeeee  Bump  <br>If so, it's even better</br>  <br>Check them</br>  <br><br>Fuuuuuaaarrrkkk</br></br>  Bump  <br>fucking genius. let's do this /b/</br>  bump for potential  <br>this is relevant to my interests.. start posting screen caps of 12 year olds going wild and ill join in on the fun</br>  <br>bumping for interest</br>  To hell with it, I LOVE IT!<br>On it OP</br>  <br><br>Excellent. Let's help OP fuck up two things with one dick.</br></br>  this is actually fucking brilliant i'm in just for the underage poon  First thing we need to do is make people think it's a legitimate growing movement. Here (<a href="http://boards.4chan.org/b/thread/629648283" target="_blank">http://boards.4chan.org/b/thread/62<wbr>9648283</wbr></a>), I've seeded a thread that makes it look like a nationwide phenomenon. Reply to that thread pretending it's a real thing, we'll see where it all goes from there.  We first start with the innocent stuff, like 17 year olds identifying as trans-18. If we give it enough time, we can eventually drop down to 12 year olds while still being taken seriously by Tumblr.  <br>keep pushing OP.. force meme this shit</br>  <br>remake this thread it 404d samefag the shit out of it</br>  Oh shit it 404'd. Here's the new thread:   I approve. Once this identity crisis thing starts causing real problems for the administration we will see a useful crackdown. It's long overdue.  Bump for potential  <br><br>Well, I'm in.</br></br>  <br>Of course!</br>  <br><br>In as well.</br></br>  Fucking with people is one thing, but causing a total economic breakdown in the name of lulz?  Solid. Lets get to work  Im in, give me something to post(?)<br> We should start a hashtag. </br>  <br> fucking 12yo who identify as 18yo. <br>please continue</br></br>  <br>hey, it's /b/. It's in our blood.<br>Also 12 yo poon is pretty nice</br></br>  <br>Of course faggot!</br>  <br>#TransAge #TransAdult #Trans18 are some good ones to start with.</br>  <br>lol'd</br>  <br>NEWFAG DETECTED</br>      THIS IS FUCKIN GENIUS but sadly some white night fagget is going to snitch on us like always  Someone on twitter - try posting things under #Trans18 or #TransAdult and monitor the hashtag.<br><br>People on Tumblr - start circulating the images in the other thread (<a href="http://boards.4chan.org/b/thread/629649841#p629649841" target="_blank">http://boards.4chan.org/b/thread/62<wbr>9649841#p629649841</wbr></a>), posing the question of whether 17 year olds should be allowed to identify as 18 and vote.</br></br>  someone post this thread to reddit's 4chan board so it can gain some more visibility. At this point, any visibility is useful visibility, even if it's from reddit.  There are posts on this going back years. Google trans-ageism. It's already a Thing.  bump<br><br>let's see how far this will go</br></br>  Who gives a fuck, I haven't been on Tumblr once, ever, and never will.  <br>dont</br>  <br>Fuuuuccckkk offfffff<br>We will never lower our selves to that level<br>Haven't you noticed le reddit is filled with stupid SJW's?</br></br></br>  <br>You do realize that there is majority of old men running the government, right? The last thing these guys want around are people who are like their grandsons and granddaughters who feel like they are fit to run the show.</br>  <br>I don't think it'll work anon</br>  <br>the point of this is to first get innocent ages, like 17, pushed into the Tumblr agenda and then go mainstream. Once that is accomplished, laws will have trouble defining age boundaries, so ages like 12-16 will be easy to work with.<br><br>We need to take this a lot slower than we are taking it right now.</br></br></br>  <br>As long as we can mobilize the left wing, we're golden. If we can't run this through congress, we can definitely get this running through the justice system with enough effort. (As illustration, look to the recent ruling on gay marriage.)</br>  <br>Not OP but you have to remember, they're pretty stupid, they'll fall for anything that will make them feel as if they're in a movement.</br>  <br>As people have said earlier, WE NEED TO ONLY TALK ABOUT AGE 17-&gt;18. If we talk about anything outside of that, people will become suspicious. We need to frame it in terms of maturity, which I can definitely see the Tumblr crowd soaking up.</br>  <br>then how do you plan to take it slower? the wheels are already in motion</br>  <br>eh fuck it, any discussion will increase visibility. We just need to touch a single nerve in Tumblr's collective consciousness, that "mature" underage people should deserve adult legal treatment.</br>  <br>like if the phrase "trans-age" becomes known to at least, say, 1% of the US population within a month, there is no doubt it will eventually show up on Tumblr's dashboard. From there they can take it where they want to take it.</br>  Already found this on their gay little site  Okay guys, before this thread 404's, some final thoughts and recap:<br><br>- Make sure there is AT LEAST one "trans-age" thread every day<br>- Start editing news headlines that discuss "age identity" and post them here<br>- If you have twitter, post voting complaints there under #TransAge, #Trans18, and #VotingRights. Get it trending.<br>- If you have tumblr, start posting and reblogging #Trans18 images as 17-year olds</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this.</br>  <br>if you have a Tumblr, start reblogging this.</br>  <br>Exactly. Trigger a backlash.</br>  <br>get all the young liberals to go along with this</br>  <br>URL for the lazy: http://transagemovement.tumblr.com.<wbr> This will be our holy grail. I am so happy this already exists, it has the correct mentality that young liberals empathize with.</wbr></br>  Okay well clearly that whole government thing isn't going to happen, but this is going to funny as fuck when we get 12 year olds posting all of tumblr about transage. When they think it's a real thing: and were going to be the only ones who know what we did top kek  I'd only do this if it meant I could take over Europe. But New USA sounds good, too.  I WASN'T RAPED<br><br>About a year ago (16) I was confused about my age.<br>I was having feelings for an older man who was 19.<br>I never thought it was wrong, I just knew we were to be<br><br>When my parents found out about what had happened they called the police<br>He was arrested and was put in jail for 2 years<br><br>The problem is that I felt that I was 18<br>I knew what I was doing, it was consensual<br>The government is corrupt<br><br>yadaa yadaa yadaa <br><br>More detail<br>More lovey dovey bs<br>More info about life<br><br>They will fucking fall for it</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But we need publicity, this may exist but nobody knows about it.</br>  My final comment:<br><br>To those doubting whether this will work, I argue that it has the potential to become a full-blown agenda item - especially since the gay marriage issue has been resolved and something needs to take its place. The center is currently shifting left and issues that were once considered non-issues are now being taken seriously. Two years ago, would we have imagined trans-racial to have even existed? So yes, trans-age may be a non-issue right now. But by raising the suggestion, we can have millions of teens and preteens to convert it into a relevant national issue, spark nationwide debate, and thus bring it onto the Democratic agenda. I have absolutely no doubt this can work, we just need as much visibility as possible since it is a latent issue that is bound to be taken seriously sooner or later.</br></br>  Whoever is best at pretending to be a white 12 year old girl who think everyone else in the world is privileged, needs to go make an account and we need to make multiple accounts and start following it, and reposting on it. Put tags as things such as "trans, gay, black, privilege, ptv, emo music, Genderfluid, etc" anything that a lot of them search tags for. That way we can give it a bunch of notes and they'll see it on the tag.  <br>This.</br>  <br>you may hate me for this, but this has to go onto r/4chan. reddit will eat this up.</br>  <br>We need to keep it secret</br>  I identify as a 12 yo girl.<br>Locker rooms here I cum!</br>  <br>its ur lucky day anon cause im one of the mods and will ban you when i get back from work.</br>  <br>We need publicity on the correct sites, certainly not on moralfag reddit<br><br>Hush anon, don't do it</br></br></br>  <br>The fuck is the point in that</br>  bumping for being one of the only smart ideas to come out of /b/  <br>People on Reddit have fucking Tumblr accounts fucktard<br>if you post it there then you'll fucking ruin it</br></br>  <br> wants to keep trans-age a secret <br> agrees that we should get this shit going on tumblr <br><br>pick one you faggot</br></br></br></br>  this is so fucking stupid that it's probably going to work too  <br><br><br>the point is, it shouldn't matter EVEN IF the media picks up that the idea started in 4chan. Because end goal is simply to have more kids talking about it. Nothing else, nothing more, nothing less. So no, DON'T KEEP IT A SECRET. Once the momentum is started on tumblr, they'll be able to bring it to the national stage all by themselves.<br><br>If Washington Post comes out tomorrow saying "Don't trust #Trans18", that is only good for us since it gives the idea exposure, and edgy kids will pick up on the *idea* and start discussing it.<br><br>The point is to get the phrase "trans-age" into our national vocabulary. Then 100% guaranteed everything will work from there.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Cause if they find out they'll get all mad and day 4chan is triggering them and then it will not work</br>   never been there before <br> finds homepage <br>i hate this fucking shithole already</br></br>  as a frequent tumblr user i've hardly seen anything about defending trans-racial identities<br><br>that shit is so fucking retarded</br></br>  Any idea about how long it will take to make the entire American government collapse? Better yet, how to send the fucking world into an economic collapse?  <br>No you summerfag. We want to make it a thing on tumblr. If it's put on reddit that means the whole idea of it beg made up will be on reddit. They wanna tell reddit about our plan. I want to go through with our plan. Get out twelvie. Ask your mom to explain if you still don't understand</br>  <br>well, sooner or later someone's going to trace the whole thing back to 4chan. But our goal is that it shouldn't matter once enough people are taking the idea seriously.</br>  Someone should make some teams age pride photos so we could post some on tumblr  <br>you just want to avoid the consequences of cheese pizza, don't you?</br>  <br> just now clueing in <br><br>Why are you on 4chan anyways</br></br></br>  <br>fucking love it!</br>  <br>do you have any concepts/ideas for the photos?</br>  for those not following this thread, check out this other thread:   <br>Not him but I'm thinking something that shows how adults can be immature and vice versa</br>  <br>Done</br>  <br>Keep it rolling /b/oys</br>  <br>Can someone write a good version of this and post it here? Please?</br>  Nearly every tumblr user:<br>If you haven't considered you might be trans-age or trans-gender or trans-race. Come to tumblr and we can help you discover yourself. So you can get the attention you crave.</br>  k  <br>I'll start writing one</br>  <br>When are you faggots gonna work, here we have a good anon, stop lurking start working</br>  <br>bump for interest and 12yo cheese pizza</br>  Creating a tumblr now, got a couple friends who are also in. <br>I'm thinking, trans chronologia as a name.<br>Die cis aged scum.</br></br>  It is done! Muhahahahahahahahahaha  I'm personally not good with making photos but you could make one with a kid with like the shadow of an adult and an adult with the shadow of a kid and some words like "Not all of us act our age" or some stupid faggy shit like that  we can easily pull in demographics like this faggot  Will we be taking over the American Government after it collapses?<br><br>And if so, what sill be the laws on foreign-born political entities? Say.. A Canadian Senator? An Irish President? Rules on those types of things.</br></br>  <br>we'll have the trans-national movement, where visas and green cards don't carry any relevance.

Facebook and such, mutual friends or acquaintances. Try to find out what they enjoy and bring it up casually in conversation. <br><br>I read a book called "How to Win Friends and Influence People" by Dave Carnegie.<br><br>Really great book, google for a quick summary so you can read the main points and work on those.<br><br>It's helped exponentially with me getting along with people and leaving great impressions.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>had that already, sorry...<br>get a game anyway if its not beyond my sad budget, watcha want ?</br></br>  <br>just give em some weed, you can never go wrong with weed and high rhymes with sky that's sum good shit right there<br><br>http://steamcommunity.com/id/epicsh<wbr>iiiiit/</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>did nothing else for the last few days, sadly they have &gt;100 employees and i con't know which or how many will do the audition<br><br>thanks for the book tip, love reading good stuff, I'll download it!<br><br>Still got these xbox codes, want one? <br><br>I also have a fuckload of diffrent DLCs</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm alright, appreciate the offer though.<br><br>I went to a pretty good military academy where appearance and charisma was everything. <br><br>If you have any more specific questions I could probably help you out.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If anyone else wants that book, archive org has most formats available<br><br>archive•org/details/BooksOfArslanho<wbr>wToWinFriendsAndInfluencePeople</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Well then, here we go:<br><br>It's not like I have to wear a suit or anything, its even pretty relaxed, so what would you wear?<br><br>Jeans and shirt probably, huh ?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>dress to impress brotha dress to impress</br>  To make the task clearer:<br><br>They want me to convince them in 5 minutes, why they should choose me.<br><br>Got a TV and a laptop for that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>life is strange eps 1 please :)</br>  <br>I have a higher end taste, so even if it's a more casual setting I'll wear something like khakis and an oxford. For a shoes I'll typically wear brown suede chukkas<br><br>I always get compliments and people ask advice on how to dress, so i assume the better you dress on a regular basis people typically think that you really care about your appearance and hygiene.<br><br>Don't over do it though, or you'll look gay. Even if people don't admit it, they seem to think gays are less competent. Just make sure your clothes are properly fit for your body type and everything is taken care of like finger nails, brushed teeth, etc.<br><br>People notice the small stuff.<br><br>Oh, and smell nice.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What are you trying to convince?

What do you think you can exaggerate about to your advantage?</br></br></br>  <br> don't over do the cologne <br>nah, dad taught me to use that<br><br>19, caucasian, about 1,80m/5,9 feet, pretty good stature, but not built</br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah, Im kinda excited, and I want to do that job for gods sake.<br><br>Sadly there's few shit I can brag with, at least not in the field theyre working in.<br><br>Im pretty good with any kind of media related stuff, can use photoshop and played arround with a few blogs<br><br><br>I'm outside for a quick smoke, back in 5 Minutes</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Posture is good to have, it's something I learned at school. Roll your shoulders back and down so that your chest somewhat sticks out. Practice a little in the mirror, you don't want to look too stiff or cocky.<br><br>Be confident, all confidence is is an act. Just act like you know what the hell you're doing. People like people who smile. It sounds dumb, but practice your smile in the mirror too. Don't be forceful of it, but when you talk to people maintain good eye contact and smile a lot. <br><br>Have a good handshake, not too firm and not too loose. If there's just a few people around interviewing don't be shy. If they don't initiate the hand shake then you should.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Also, do you have any facial hair? Unless it's very appealing and completely filled in and well trimmed I would go clean shaven.<br><br>What hairstyle you rocking?</br></br></br>  <br>Beard is weil trimed and looks naturally <br><br>Shaved I look way, younger and less attractive in my eyes<br><br><br>These fricking captchas make me hungry ffs</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How much time do you have before this?<br><br>You should post a pic of beard too</br></br></br>  <br>The audition is on sunday, I'm staying in the city where it is for one or two days before <br><br><br>Didn't trim my beard the last few days, looks better when it's done well but I am not at home before tomorrow<br>Will post pic of hair in next post</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hair looks like this, a bit less on the sides</br>  <br>hello OP i would like to help u<br>http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anonym<wbr>ousBeggars/<br><br>The first thing is<br>Talk like a Fucking Alpha. Great speakers are thought leaders who teach their audiences something about the industry, often things they didn’t know See yourself as an EDUCATOR and teach your audience some fucking newthings because old repetetion is boring as fuck.</br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>Oh, a very important tip along with all of my other etiquette ideas.<br><br>Yes sir/ma'am and no sir/ma'am. Always. Everytime you say yes or no. Always. Always. Always.<br><br>We seem to have a little in common, if you need extra help follow me on instagram and feel free to hit me up when you need something.<br><br>@chill_its_will</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Next thing is<br>Tell YOUR personal stories. Good speakers tell stories; great speakers tell personal ones.Stories like why do you intrested in them and also WHY YOU WANT TO JOIN them. These stories are fine, but if you’ve reached a high level of success it’s likely that people want to hear MORE about you. Bill Jobs did it and get success you should fucking do it too</br></br>  <br>Thnaks, I practiced a confident appearance for logernow since I often meet new people and I like to do a good first mpression.
