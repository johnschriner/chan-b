I don't know if that helped really but yea. After that, a lot of my friends moved away due to Uni and the like so I found myself having to make new friends. This in its self seemed to change my out look a lot. Idk if it's because it wasn't something I'd not done before, but it made me feel fresh.

My best advice to you is to try something new. I know your tired in every way, but you gotta just pick your self up and make a change.
