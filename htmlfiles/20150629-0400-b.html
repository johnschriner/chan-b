[ I have a question /b/<br><br>If you are goign to drown, is it better to hold your breath or just to inhale water to pass out as soon as possible?</br></br>  What do you think?<br>Suffer longer or force yourself to pass out?</br>  Hold your breath. You'll be lightheaded by the time your autonamous gasp reflex takes over. You'll only pass out from lack of oxygen, so breathing in early will just be agonizing for longer. <br><br>It's still going to be painful dans terrible, but less so.</br></br>  <br>But the time you held the breath also counts for you to pass out sooner. The more you hold your breath the less time you pass drowning till you actually pass out.</br>  <br>As much as i sympathise with these poor bastards, why the fuck do people keep surrendering to ISIS? they must have heard the stories, bullet to the head would be bliss compared to what these cunts to do people.<br><br>On topic if your in a cage like they are yes force it down you and get it over with quick would be the best way, but chances are the body will fight you till the very end. Suppose it's a similar response to why people allow themselves to be taken prisoner...</br></br></br>  <br>Hold your breath, you pass out much quicker and no pain in your lungs from holding your breath!</br>  <br>Man I just had this exact same fucking conversation in a group chat. <br><br>You absolutely will not survive an ISIS capture. Just end yourself immediately or be tortured in the most fucked up ways until they decide to kill you as a spectacle</br></br></br>  god the feeling of breathing in water must be unimaginable. <br><br>I just cant fucking watch people torture other people in TV series for these reasons..</br></br>  <br>Hold breath, you might get lucky and pass out!</br>  <br>Video???</br>  <br> or just to inhale water to pass out as soon as possible? <br><br>You run the risk of them pulling the cage back up and going "psych! we were just fucking with you. holy shit, is that guy dead? he was only down there for one second!"</br></br></br>  They should of tried to run... it would probably would have been better to be shot while running away then forcibly drowned  <br>Exactly, grab something anything scream fuck allah and charge at them, it'll be over quickly.</br>   &gt;If you are goign to drown, <br><br>What is dead may never die</br></br>  Is there a new ISIS video?  <br>Evolve and grow gills so you can breathe water, duh</br>  <br>No. OP drew that picture all by himself just for this thread.</br>  islam is cancer. <br><br>Do you have video ?</br></br>  <br><br>i dunno a beheading seems pretty painful for a few seconds.</br></br>  <br><br>lol!!</br></br>  <br><br> i dont know basic human psychology </br></br>  <br>Here you go<br>http://cache-2.send vid.com/jyw5enj9.mp4</br></br>  <br>Fucking captain planet up in this, first fire now water <br>What happens when they all combine</br></br>  <br><br>many people says they will not get captured alive by these. killing themselves if they are losing.</br></br>  <br>I'd imagine that the initial cutting of flesh and fat isn't even noticeable to most at first if the knife is sharp enough... it's probably the deep half-way through cutting that is prob the worst part</br>  <br>found it <br><br>http://www.bestgore.com/execution/i<wbr>sis-video-three-group-captive-execu<wbr>tion-exceptional-brutal-mean/</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>It is known.</br>  <br>Very easy to say this on /b/, but a lot of people are too scared to take their own life and they rather be captured. Also some might not have a choice, if there is no way to take your own life than you're fucked</br>  Interesting thing about beavers is they can't drown. They have a little flap in their throat which closes when they're under water, so when they get stuck under water they suffocate instead of drown.  <br> implying they aren't Dan Brown's Illuminati <br>Next they're gonna kill people using earth, probably bury them alive, I'm curios about how they're gonna kill people using air.</br></br>  <br>Be like this guy.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=YDs<wbr>pP4BhlTw</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br><br>they should drop the prison-thing from a high. that would be wind, would be interesting to watch also with go-pro cams inside</br></br>  <br>http://theync.com/murder/new-video-<wbr>from-isis-shows-men-drown.htm here is the video. It´s definetely unpleasant as fuck. What is that foam dripping out of their mouths ?</wbr></br>  <br><br>Its better not to be dumb enough to surrender to ISIS. Go down guns blazin and save the last bullet for yourself.</br></br>  <br>Because they use a lot of prisoners as leverage for ransoms and prisoner exchanges? You don't know they will use you for staged execution for sure.</br>  <br>lunge at them and they will shoot, they won't risk injury to themselves for the sake of taking someone prisoner.</br>  <br>Then they should throw the cage into a volcano for the earth part. Am I getting too excited about this ?</br>  <br>Some want to cling to life till the very end and fear the uncertainty of death</br>  <br>good point actually, i didn't think of that, i guess it's because we mostly only hear about the ones they executed for show.</br>  <br><br>i guess that is better way to die.. just keep holding your breath untill u pass out. but when i try to do it now. its so fucking hard lel but i guess its possible for humans too<br><br>then again. when you pass out you will imidiatly breath in water and wake up to drowning agony</br></br></br></br>  <br>drop them from a height dude<br><br/></br></br>  <br><br><br>If you get taking prisoner by ISIS there is always a chanche of getting freed. Especally in the urban areas there are often small groups operating and the group taht captured you may be defeated a few minutes/hours later.<br>But I think the main reason people surrender to them is because of their human nature. I think it is really not that easy to charge at someone who will kill you immediately. Although you know they gonna kill you later and it will be painfull you just do what they command you to do. Imagine a bunch of tehse fuckers yelling at you and pointing weapons at you and you are just extremly frightened. You will most likey not charge them. I think its soemhow the same reason why the jews mostly dont fight against the germans and let them kill them slowly.</br></br></br></br>  I read somewhere drowning is supposed to be quite peaceful despite looking like the person is suffering alot due to thrashing around. apparently the brain knows it's drowning and your body just shuts down. Then again I don't relly give a Fuck about these idiots why the fuck would you go to the middle east in the first place ? ah let's help these poor muslim cunts.... oh dear now there torturing me. stay at home in your first World country's you idiots !  <br> http://theync.com/murder/new-video<wbr>-from-isis-shows-men-drown.htm</wbr> <br><br>what were their crimes?<br><br>that was so grim</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>oh goody<br><br><br>funny as shit</br></br></br></br>  <br>About a quarter of the funding for ISIS comes from ransom demands if I remember correctly. Oil is half and the rest is the selling of historical artifacts on the black market. The ones they don't destroy for propaganda.</br>  But this was fake. Look at all the angles and fucking editing. Either they have a Hollywood movie crew or this was made in Hollywood. Jesus Christ they don't even care if people know it's fake anymore.  <br>All these videos seem so produced. And what's with the red outfits the victims are all wearing? How do a bunch of crazy desert jihadis have designated prisoner of war clothing at their disposal?</br>  <br>what is this game?</br>  <br>they aren't white, so i'll assume there a different type of muslim to isis, sunni shia etc like catholics killing protestants really.</br>  I'm sure that in the moment of capture your brain makes up all kinds of excuses to avoid ending your life.<br><br> maybe I will be ransomed <br> if I play my cards right they might let me go <br> maybe this is a different group, not ISIS at all <br> maybe somebody will come for me <br><br>It could go on and on but you get the idea. I feel like even if you are fully committed to killing yourself to avoid capture it will be unlikely to happen when it comes down to it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hi, I'm Dan.</br>  <br>Kek</br>  <br>but they're killing muslims</br>  <br><br><br><br>There is an american sociologist who is writing about violence and why people dont act rational in combat situations. His name is Randall Collins and I can really recommend him to you.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Life</br>  <br>besiege</br>  <br><br>You're a retard. ISIS videos are real, but it's well known now that they edit the shitout of their videos to the point it almost looks fake.<br><br>It's called propaganda m8</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>LOL no that is a normal sea myth that old admirals /captains tells the new seamen. so that they will not be afraid. drowning is actually the most painful way to die if im not mistaken. thats why waterboading is so effective too (mimicking drowning just by a wet towel is enough to make most people break. brain definitely doest shut down.</br></br>  anyway who has the video of these fucks drowning? I wanna watch.  <br>Thanks anon!</br>  anybody could explain that endless foam and blood coming from inside one of the dudes?  <br>He has dubs and you don't so he's right and you're a faggot.</br>  <br>It's not that easy. A friend of mine was in Iraq and he talked to some curds, 90% of them has an additional grenade to use just in case things get desperate. <br>Still you'll think to the very end:<br> what if they can rescue me with navy seals or something? <br> what if airforce is incoming? <br> What if they'll just let me go for God-knows-what reason? <br><br>Death is not easy to accept. One morning you are fucking your wife-gf or playing with your kids and 4 hours later you are holding a grenade in your hand asking if you should blow up in a blaze of glory. It's tough.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>makes no difference.</br>  <br> I think its soemhow the same reason why the jews mostly dont fight against the germans and let them kill them slowly. </br>  <br>Are you really that stupid? ISIS loves to work with special effects.</br>  <br><br>mfw when all these ISIS videos will turn out to be viral campaigning for some clint eastwoods middleeast movie or somthing</br></br>  <br> Faking it <br>lol, you're retarded, it's MUCH easier/cheaper to kill, than fake it.<br>They killed at LEAST 1700, from the mass grave they found in iraq, it's not like they have qualms about killing.<br>You just so detached from the concept of death, it's hilarious.<br>I hope a nigger or a cop kills you.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>probably because lungs arent meant to be full of water</br>  <br><br>You guys forget that there are alot of ex-militarys, ex-intelligencemembers and ex-officials from Sadams regime working with ISIS. They want to get back their power which they lost since there are the Shias rulling in Bagdad. These guys are professionals and I think wihtout them ISIS wouldnt be a real threat anymore.</br></br>  <br>Hi dan, iam Dan</br>  <br><br>Yeah fuck that. Just try holding your breath for as long as you can, and then some more, asshole.</br></br>  <br>They were drugged forget with what but it was so they would follow orders to get in the cage. It's fake, but the people really died. It's propaganda to keep the war going.</br>  <br>Truth</br>  <br>I'm not talking about these camel jockeys , I'm talking about stupid white people going there and trying to help these assholes</br>  ISIS gotta do more chainsawy stuff imho  <br><br>that happens to everyone who drown and gets pulled bacvk to the surface. <br><br>Its water mixed with air that pours out of your lungs. DERP</br></br></br></br>  <br>have you ever been in water?</br>  <br>Wow. The production value is really good. They've really improved. Felt professional</br>  <br>go pro's and dslr's are really cheap and iMovie is quite good for edting. just because they're brwon doesnt they're retarded.</br>  Americans crying "fake!" will never stop being entertaining.<br><br>They all imagine they are geniuses.</br></br>  <br>I've actually drowned before. It didn't hurt really at all before I passed out, what really hurt was when I woke the fuck up and couldn't stop coughing water up.</br>  <br><br> implulaying </br></br>  Daily reminder. <br><br>  never spend money in a Muslim own or employed establishment  <br>  always check the good you're buying, never buy Halal food. Check the labelling.  <br>  never go to a Muslim country ever. Ridicule people that do.  <br>  resist Islam it's cancer. The liberal faggots will have us all killed. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But it literally does</br>  <br> feeling threatened by muslims <br><br>do the actions of ISIS seem like the kind of thing that people do when they're secure about their beliefs?<br><br>they are doing this because their children think islam is shit and when they see a VHS cassette of transformers they think "wow, America is cool as shit"</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You know that this is from a moviescene, right?</br>  <br>those are niggers</br>  <br><br>i dont get it<br><br>they are in a war, they have planes flying over their heads, they have Iraqi army, hurr durr they are shit, but still they are looking for them, they have the Syrian Army looking for them<br><br>How do they have the time to set up all these cameras, get the right lighting in the fucking middle of the day to shoot this.<br><br>who the fuck does this in the middle of a conflict.<br><br>look at all the liveleak shaky cams with sandniggers, they are done in a split second with a smartphone<br><br>this seems professionally done</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I just don't get what all the fancy editing and music is there to communicate and who it's being communicated to. I would be just as terrified of the footage if it wasn't so theatrical and staged in appearance. Why do they do to the extra effort?</br>  <br>Just because a documentary is a movie doesn't mean it's fake dumbass.</br>  <br>exactly.</br>  <br>They right, m8</br>  <br><br><br>You know that they are controlling their own territory?</br></br></br>  <br>Because the CIA knows people don't give a fuck about anything unless it has a high production value. Look at every new movie release.</br>  media is so fucking biased<br>ISIS DID THIS, KILLED THAT, DESTROYED THAT... but you never read the truth about how kurds are kicking ISIS's ass</br>    <br>Ever seen a bollywood movie?<br><br>These are the same kind of brown people.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah it seems wrong somehow. Then again, narco trafficers definitely get a little theatrical when they murder a bunch of peasants in Mexico. They're sort of proud of themselves and true believers. It's a way of deifying themselves or seeing themselves as movie stars and not just the human waste they actually are.</br>    The foam coming out of their mouth is just carbon dioxide in the water.<br><br>Their body takes gulps to replenish the oxygen, but instead they get water. Now your body is still pumping blood, putting carbon monoxide back into the lungs for exhaling. Once pressure is released it flows back out.</br></br>  <br><br>Comrade?</br></br>  <br>newfag</br>  <br>nah the editing terrorist was a an mlg cod player who put his videos on youtube and he continued to do this IRL</br>  <br>Disguising bait as heresy as bait. Nice try ygethmor. We won't be so easily fooled.</br>  <br>FASCINATING</br>  <br>You haven't got a fucking clue.</br>  <br>So is the CIA just off camera directing everything? Are these guys just on the CIA payroll? And to what end? Destabilize the middle east to make it easier to control?</br>  <br>The difference is what, maybe 2 minutes? Hold your breath, at least you died trying and didn't quit like a bitch</br>  <br><br>maybe because this is the exact type of violence that is at some 18+ action movie at cinema every day in the west. this is almost mainstream. everyone that likes action movies can watch this (and like it ) this is not worse than the movie braveheart , it will go "viral" and maybe some will think its cool <br><br>the gory amateur footage is only something for /b/ and weirdos. not that that makes sense sine morally its the same</br></br></br></br>  <br> mfw you use "mfw" without a reaction face because you think it means "mother fucking win." You're clearly a retard. </br>   ITS DER CIA   I love that they had divers with waterproof cameras to go underwater and film their gargly screams.<br><br>We are definitely living in interesting times.</br></br>  <br>It's 2015 faggot.<br><br> Google 'orange jumpsuit' <br> Buy orange jumpsuit </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>summerfag</br></br>  soon isis videos will have air horns and doritos ads  <br><br><br> newsummerfags </br></br></br>    <br><br>there is something called dry drowning. which i think is less painful than wet drowning (lungs full of water)</br></br>  <br>now if you're going to drown and want to pass out, do this<br>Before taking a dive, exhales as much as possible.<br>Without knowing, your body will automatically shut itself down because CO2 level didn't reach quota to trigger the alarm of suffocation.<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shall<wbr>ow_water_blackout</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Those that have almost drowned say that the second your lungs fill up with water, a peaceful bliss overcomes them. Drowning is a pleasant way to die I guess. Sorry my shit english.</br>  <br> deliver to Iraq <br> not traced <br> still can't find them <br>Are you really this retarded?</br></br></br></br>  <br>maybe next generation</br>  <br><br>mother fucking win!? lol mfs (my fucking sides)<br><br>where is that from anyways, did you just make it up now ?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm Dan and this is my brother Dan.</br>  It's more than just the jumpsuits and editing and music. What's with all the creative ways to murder people? What's the point? Throughout history people have just either hung, stabbed, or put a bullet in the back of the head. What's motivating them to drown people in a cage, set someone on fire in a cage, wrap explosives around people's necks and blow their heads off, etc? It seems like needless extravagance imo. Usually in war you just kill your enemies as easily as possible.  <br>Man, I gotta admit, they find creative ways to murder but not just that... They hired a pretty damn good video crew, it's always good editings</br>  <br><br>no this is wrong .read the thread. or watch the movie</br></br>  <br>HELLO?!?! Look at middle ages torture chambers, creativity always wins</br>  <br> Throughout history people have just... <br><br>Learn your self some history, people have killed each other in all sorts of fucked up ways.</br></br></br>  <br>Embolism. Air in the veins.</br>  <br>it looks fake</br>  <br><br><br><br>To all y'all fags saying "hurr human psychology makes u not go down fighting"<br><br>Either that's bullshit, or the japanese aren't humans.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Here's another genius american</br>  <br>Hmm. Yeah. and these guys are from the middle ages. I just can't relate to it because I'm not that much of a sadist. Like I would gladly shoot an enemy on a battlefield in defense of my country but I can't imagine killing prisoners of war let alone torturing them. I don't know how people get like that. I guess just growing up in the third world where life is cheap.</br>  <br><br>err you better check that history again. what about googling execution methods. you wil get a endles list of creative ways that humans have killed eachohers.<br><br>example a hollow ox sculpture made by bronze or something. they put people in there and had fire under it . cooking them alive. the funny part is that at the mouth of the "ox" they had a tromped/brass instrument . so that when the guys screamed in pain. the ox would sing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>fuck that people got tortured, fucking impaled, blood eagle, Scaphism, stake burning<br>people are creative and fucked up</br></br>  <br>nevermind i take it back parts 2 and 3 look very real<br>nasty stuff holy shit<br>lets kill them all</br></br></br>  <br>Yes they have. But what makes ISIS different from people who just put prisoners in front of a firing squad fast and easy? I still just don't see the point other than shock value or sadism. It's much more efficient to just use bullets in front of a grave.</br>  <br> Implying oxygen toxicity isn't a thing. </br>  <br> impleying most of the japanese soldiers did this at the end of the war and not just a few per mille... </br>  <br>But they aren't human, anon.</br>  <br><br>A Lifetime of indoctrination will overcome human nature.</br></br>  <br>Those fuckers were batshit insane</br>  they want to be taken seriously? who took time to set up this James bond death scene. next it will be tied to train tracks  <br>Yeah I got it. I just don't get the point but maybe it's impossible to understand the minds of 12th century religious fanatics. I can understand killing in self defense or even for conquest. But killing for pleasure seems really strange to me.</br>  <br>what about donations from rich people and countries</br>  <br>That's what I'm saying. The slowly dipping cage into water is straight out of Live and Let Die.</br>  <br><br>fear can be useful tactics if you have no morallity or FN/NATO conventions you need to follow.<br><br>they also wants people to be mad at muslims so that Muslims will get hated and they have to turn to isis. if they get USA to go to more wars. maybe russia and usas relationship can be even colder.<br><br>just think. there is thousands of reason to do this.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Trips for tits.  dont want to see them  rollin  tits or gtfo  Nope.  get    nty.  literally don't want  nop  <br>i fucken do.
