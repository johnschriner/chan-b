[ Sup /b/<br><br>My dick is 6 inches in length at 4.9 in girth. Tonight's my first night of jelqing. Aiming for 7 inch length and a 6 inch girth. Anyone else here jelq and get results?<br><br>Jelq Thread.</br></br></br></br>  lmao, enjoy ripping the nerve ending on your penis due to stretching it and actually LOSING LENGTH.<br><br>Jelqing is a hoax, anybody with a brain knows it's NOT the equivalent to female keggles. Idiot lol</br></br>  <br>I've only done it a few times so I'm still skeptical...<br>I'm starting at 6.5 X (an uneven) 4.8 at max. Would like 7.25 X 5.25.<br>Any one here actually get results?</br></br></br>  Just deal with the dick you have.  <br>top keg<br>He's right though, you know.</br></br>  <br>I have been jelqing for a long time results are slows and mostly in girth. I'd say follow Jon Pop's 90 day first. Stretching is required for length but never do something as asinine as weighted hanging or clamping. <br><br>this guy is plain retarded and does not know the differnance between a jelq and a kegel.</br></br></br>  <br>Someone with a dick approximately as big as your goal checking in.<br><br>Having 6"+ inches of girth is the fucking worst.</br></br></br>  <br>whats wrong with your dick anon?</br>  <br><br>There's no way you can increase length and girth. Isn't the entire point of jelqing to sacrifice girth to be longer?</br></br>  <br>Here's mine</br>  <br>it's definitely possible I would not expect more than 1/2 an inch a year though. There's limits to how much you can exercise it without causing damage. Girth is easy though length is hard because it requires you to lengthen ligaments.</br>  <br>Wash your dick brah<br><br> Checked </br></br></br>  <br><br>Seriously bro, I hardly ever give actual advice here. Do not do this. Is there a possibility that it could actually have positive results? Sure, but that's like saying you could survive a fall from 10,000 feet. Has it happened? Yes, but more people have turned to human pancakes than survived that feat. The cons do not outweigh the pros. From personal experience, I did it for about 3 months. Followed the instructions to a T. My dick never got any longer. I was able to last a little longer but that was short lived once I stopped. The only real positive was that my dick looks bigger when I'm not hard. Now I'm a shower and not a grower. Big whoop. You can can cause serious damage to your junk from this shit. In conclusion...it's better to have a fully functioning 5 incher than a broke ass 5.25 incher. Be you and be happy with you. Women care more about the man attached to the dick than the dick itself. Unless she was molested by her dad. Then just stay away.</br></br>  <br>no that's not how it works at all.</br>  <br>No, it's to increase the amount of blood the penis tissue can hold by stretching it out gradually. Like those Africans with the elongated necks due to using those weird neck collar things. Or the plates in their lips.</br>  <br>this could be good pasta</br>  <br>nice papules</br>  <br>Hmm. I guess I'll stop at like 5.5 then? I just feel like 4.9 is a bit too skinny. My girl loves sex but I can't make her cum. I feel like at least some of the blame is on my pencil dick.</br>  <br>this is alarmist bullshit. <br>If you did the routine correctly you'd at least have a harder dick. You should have "newbie gains" after 90 days.</br></br>  <br><br>you'll just damage your already normal dick</br></br>  ITT: Post your real name.<br><br>I'll start:<br>David Davidson</br></br></br>  Ha  <br><br>What?
