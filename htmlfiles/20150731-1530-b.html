Continue</br>  <br>Lurking.</br>  <br>Mike T just got rekt</br>    <br>They said that they will "share your data" meaning that it would have been sent already.</br>  <br>Get em OP, make Mike T kill</br>  <br><br>Is that the Eye of Sauron? What game?</br></br>  <br>I work from home too but you don't see me with a tin foil hat eating cheese pizza you fucking weirdo what do you have to hide</br>  <br>Ask them if they will be key logging your shit. They hadn't directly stated that they are not receiving information, just wont "share your data" without you knowing. Someone working there could easily steal your shit.</br>  OP here, give me something to say to him.<br><br>Not trolling stuff, legitimate concerns.<br><br>Apparently they won't collect data straight from your PC, unless you have a Microsoft Account linked with it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ask if it gets sent to third parties for advwrtisement. Or if they are going to advertise to you based on this "metadata" .....more like megadata!!! Bazinga</br>  <br>Can Microsoft let me walk with my nipples</br>  <br>Ask him if they store your voice records after you use cortana</br>  <br><br><br>Of course it gets sent for advertisers. You can just reset Advertising ID for that, just like Android and Apple.<br><br>What I'm concerned about is they may be collecting information and I have no way of stopping them.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was away from windows for 7 years until January when I had to choose between windows 7 and 8 as a secondary OS. Windows 8 creeped me out because the installation process made me believe I had to link the OS to a microsoft account.<br><br>I know nothing about windows 10. But I assume tons of features might not work if you don't link it to an account. Try asking him about that.</br></br></br>  you are aware that, this is how you get into an even deeper watch list right?    <br>Ask if the active malware protection that scans every file you download sends data about the files to microsoft</br>  <br><br>interesting thread OP<br><br>also nice trips</br></br></br></br>  <br>the more pro the version you get, the less microsoft will monitor without your explicit consent.<br><br>So your options:<br>1) get the enterprise edition, set up home domain, disallow anything you want<br>2) block at the router/physical firewall level. You should be able to take out anything to microsoft-owned networks pretty easily.<br>3) don't upgrade. your current version of windows will continue to work as it always has. <br>4) linux etc</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  ask him why the windows store isn't working, even when you use the "wsreset" command  <br>I've not linked my win10 install to a MS account, the main thing that wont work is onedrive (which I disabled anyway).</br>    <br>this is actually good news, seriously considering upgrading now</br>  <br>Is it yes for the sending MS all your downloaded files?</br>  <br>He meant yes, as in yes you are correct when saying there won't be transmission of data without a Microsoft Account</br>  bump  <br> trusting an Indian help desk guy </br>  kek  OP here.<br><br>I think that wraps it up. There won't be any freaky transmission of data if you don't use a Microsoft Account with your copy of Windows 10.<br><br>I'll be upgrading, I think. You guys have anything else you want me to ask him?</br></br></br></br>  Last chance.  <br>Ask him why the windows store isn't working even after using the wsreset command.</br>  <br>Ask him how to make Curry</br>  <br>Fuck it, sticking with arch for op sec and windows 7 for vidya. 10/10 thread tho.</br>  <br>Say thanks alot for your time, you've cleared alot up for alot of people</br>  <br>He walked around this question</br>  Love<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>say thank you for your assistance and thanks for answering important questions, you've been helpful<br><br>btw informative thread OP</br></br></br></br>  ask him how to make dank maymay XD  <br>Like a boss he did</br>  Tell him that he can suck my hairy asshole  You're all overreacting I've had windows 10 for several months (beta) and it's been though my folders of cheez as well as my keyboard, hell shit from 4chan syncs though my Microsoft account. It really makes me laugh how fucking stupid people are just because a privacy statement says it does not mean the os actively does it 24/7 if you're so fucking obsessed with privacy grow a dick and use Linux as your primary os I do this on ever other computer I own. Stop complain and take privacy in your own hands little shits.    <br><br>He said it was with the Microsoft Account, not with Windows itself.<br><br><br>Asked him for you.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> You're all overreacting I've had windows 10 for several months (beta) and it's been though my folders of cheez as well as my keyboard <br>v&amp;</br></br>  <br>Well, the store worked right away when I first used it, but after a couple hours it didn't. Can you ask him for the correct configurations?</br>  <br>obvious bait<br><br>but I do actually use linux. I researched win10 privacy because I'll probably roll it for my company in the next couple of years and we have government contracts that are very strict about how we store and transport data.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm waiting for the day.</br>    <br>Nah its not bait it's just how fucking done I am with some people (prime example Facebook messenger remember that stupidity.), I use Linux as my primary as well, I've been testing windows on and off for as a said several months and it works and at this point I've noticed no weird transmission (I monitor my network pretty closely) in terms of your company makes sense. Just make sure your tinfoil isn't to tight for your own life.</br>  <br> folders of cheez <br>Lost</br></br>  <br>My company will be using it as well, mainly to get our software running it. Before I was an admin, I took tech support calls, an honestly could give a fuck about my customers....they are cattle. As far as company privacy, I havr so much shit blacklisted...microsoft can collect wtfe.</br>  Best soft drink. Prove me wrong.

I almost proposed on the spot.</br>  Pretty much anything in pic related, but most of all the Curiosity Cola front and center.  hurd u was takin sht wite boi  Found a bottle the other day. The problem with cherry soda's is they're reluctant to actually have that tart taste of cherries, and this soda is no exception. It's like any other cherry soda, really, maybe a bit sweeter than darker black cherry sodas.  <br>It would be, but it got topped by one of its own sub-brands<br>Pic related, a shame it's no longer available in the U.S.</br></br>  <br>Cherry Pepsi is better</br>  <br> 51USD <br>you're fucking high if you think I'm paying an excess of $2 for 12 ounces.<br>I can get it cheaper at soda shop in the northeast.</br></br></br>  <br>Wat<br><br>20oz bottles are 99 cents apiece at every corner store in the South</br></br></br>  <br><br>https://soundcloud.com/catilluminat<wbr>i/catazepam</wbr></br></br>  <br>Big red is seriously delicious<br>Big blue, on the other hand, is one of the most disgusting soda's I've had, and I've had lesters fixin's.<br><br>I had to do a double take when I saw faygo being sold in glass bottles</br></br></br></br>  <br>fuck yeah</br>  <br>Cheerwine is the best, but right next to it is this.</br>  <br>really is an acquired taste but i fucking love this drink. the 72oz of sugar in the can is less than ideal, though</br>  <br>Sarsaparilla was originally made, a long long time ago, with sassafras roots. Over the years the formula changed to where it's practically identical to root beer.</br>  <br>Asheville. Normally it is but late July and August are 80s-90s, then it drops to the 70s in september<br><br>Pleb spotted</br></br></br>  <br>two possibilities.<br>1. It's just root beer, but calling it sarsaparilla is classier<br>2. It's the legit stuff, in which case the dominant flavour is sarsaparilla. You'll usually find these tasting very strongly of licourice.</br></br></br>  <br>We have Faygo here in the south east US and we all say its the cheap shit compared to pepsi and coke products</br>  <br>Less sugar per ounce than Coke though. Sucks I can't find it anywhere anymore</br>  <br> 2015 <br> drinking sodee pop </br></br>  <br>You can do whatever you want, anon, whatever you want. No need to announce it to the world.</br>  <br>Cannot, OP is correct.</br>  Oh yeah currently drinking this<br>Apparently, it's supposed to taste like crystal pepsi.</br>  <br>grams</br>  <br>Cool. Sis is going to UNCA.<br><br>Very nice town. People are....different.</br></br></br>    You spelled pop wrong.  <br>I can 24 pack of glass cheerwine for $16 at sams club.</br>    <br>are you my grandfather from Buffalo? i didn't think it was still called that anywhere.</br>  <br>Godamnit that why OP</br>  <br>I don't order a vodka soda and expect cola or Faygo or whatever. Pop is correct. Soda is a different thing.</br>  <br>I grew up here. You're more right than you know. <br><br>It has it's ups and downs, damn good food and beer though. Never been able to enjoy Raleigh man, what am I missing about it?</br></br></br>  <br>massfag detected</br>  Why do they call them soft drinks  <br><br>it's a regional thing, guiz.<br>http://www4.uwm.edu/FLL/linguistics<wbr>/dialect/staticmaps/q_105.html<br>also, apparently some stupid pieces of shit refer to all sweetened carbonated beverages as coke<br>fucking barbarians</br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>No it isn't you fucking aspie.</br>  <br><br>Museums, mostly.<br><br>Also this place called the Mecca.<br>Best fried chicken I've ever had.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ohio dude. I suppose soda pop is acceptable but unnecessary. Nothing drives me crazier than when I order a vodka soda and some idiot says "what kind of soda?" What?</br>  <br>Actually it is. Soda is carbonated water. When you add syrup it becomes soda pop. Shortened now to pop. Soda is a mixer.</br>  Forgetting somthing?  <br>i know its regional, thats why i mentioned Buffalo. I just figured it was dying out since advertising is mostly done nationally and its always called soda or cola in commercials.</br>  <br>Haven't been to any there, guess I will now. If we're doing food recommendations, eat at doc cheys and get any of the noodle bowls, just trust me. <br><br>Just add the word club before soda and then you'll never have issues again, friend.</br></br></br>  <br>Jones is pretty hit-or-miss, really. Their original flavours (most of the fruit ones) are pretty great, but their root beer and dr pepper (dr jones) are shit tier.</br>  <br><br>i don't go to bars very often. isn't that a vodka tonic?</br></br>  Soda  <br>Pop</br>  <br>No tonic is a different thing it contains quinine and sugars.</br>  Orangina. Game over bitches.  <br>Except when used in 99% of all contexts, it refers to what aspies like you call soda pop. If you can't figure out the words people use for specific objects or situations then you are autistic.<br><br>Do you get upset when people refer to sodium chloride as salt even though technically a salt is a type of ionized compound?</br></br></br>  <br>Feck off</br>  <br>can't argue.<br><br>Iron beer is good though.<br><br><br>we have it in orlando m8<br>cheerwine is here</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yoda Soda</br>  Master flavour  Trips or 420 get to open the box  <br>Ayy lmao</br>  C H E C K<br>H M A T E<br>E M A T E<br>C M A T E<br>K M A T E</br></br></br></br>  box roll  <br>WHAT'S IN THE FUCKING BOX</br>    Roll lawd  roll  Raw  open sesame nigga  better be worth  lost :/  :(  roll  much trips  Rolling  Rolling for Dragon dildos  any clues?

Hell, I'm not even talking about Juubi Jinchuuriki Gedou Rinne Tensei Uchiha Madara with the Eternal Mangekyou Sharingan and Rinnegan doujutsus (with the rikodou abilities and being capable of both Amateratsu and Tsukuyomi genjutsu), equipped with his Gunbai, a perfect Susano'o, control of the juubi and Gedou Mazou, with Hashirama Senju's DNA implanted in him so he has mokuton kekkei genkai and can perform yin yang release ninjutsu while being an expert in kenjutsu and taijutsu. I’m talking about Kono Yo no Kyūseishu Futarime no Rikudō Juubi Jinchuuriki Gedou Rinne Tensei Uchiha Madara with the Eternal Mangekyou Sharingan (which is capable of Enton Amaterasu, Izanagi, Izanami and the Tsyukuyomi Genjutsu), his two original Rinnegan (which grant him Chikushōdō, Shuradō, Tendō, Ningendō, Jigokudō, Gakidō, Gedō, Banshō Ten’in, Chibaku Tensei, Shinra Tensei, Tengai Shinsei and Banbutsu Sōzō) and a third Tomoe Rinnegan on his forehead, capable of using Katon, Fūton, Raiton, Doton, Suiton, Mokuton, Ranton, Inton, Yōton and even Onmyōton Jutsu, equipped with his Gunbai(capable of using Uchihagaeshi) and a Shakujō because he is a master in kenjutsu and taijutsu, a perfect Susano’o (that can use Yasaka no Magatama ), control of both the Juubi and the Gedou Mazou, with Hashirama Senju’s DNA and face implanted on his chest, his four Rinbo Hengoku Clones guarding him and nine Gudōdama floating behind him AFTER he absorbed Senjutsu from the First Hokage, entered Rikudō Senjutsu Mode, cast Mugen Tsukuyomi on everybody and used Shin: Jukai Kōtan so he can use their Chakra while they are under Genjutsu.  lmao_  <br>top kek<br><br>9/11 was an inside job</br></br></br>  INHALE THE TRIPS  <br>Lol</br>  ayy  roll  nobody can trip like I do  Don't want to  u dun goofed guys  the cake is a lie  Roll nig  Roll  rollio  now  Trips get  <br>get outta here inbred cunt</br>  Down  hey 555555 coming up soon  <br>55555 get</br>  Oy Vey wew lad  Aw ffs<br><br>OP GIVE US A HINT!</br></br>  roll for 420  Nigga fuck trips  always pizza captcha  Check my trips, fags  ready  Trips, please!  roll  <br>555555 get</br>  Quints get?
