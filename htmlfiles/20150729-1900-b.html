Side way, bad angle yeah.</br></br>  <br><br>I fucking hate men and I hate their fucking privilege. I hate how they view women as less than people- we’re objects to them, good for fucking and for having as slaves but not really human. I hate how they view themselves as the default, how they’re not embarrassed to be utterly disgusting in front of other people, how I’m supposed to be ashamed of my body hair and keep in shape for them, while they get to look how the fuck they want, and how I’m supposed to be all nice and feminine around them. I hate how they have no fucking consideration for other people- they talk loud, they take up all the space, they spread their legs wide across the seats in the public transportation to show off their fucking crotch. I hate how they bother me when I’m out and minding my own business, I hate how they try to pick me up and expect me to take their attention as a compliment and that I should be grateful about being bothered in the middle of running my errands. I hate on how they comment on my looks- who the fuck asked them? I hate how they seem to believe that their opinion is important, especially when it comes to what women should look like. I hate their fucking condescending attitude. I hate how they try to teach me things and explain shit I already know to me. I hate how they treat “you’re not like most women” as a compliment.</br></br>  <br><br>I hate how they’re controlled by their little dicks and how they think those dicks make them special. I hate how they’re essentially all spoiled little princes who’ve been raised to believe they are the center of the universe. I hate that even the adult men act like children. I hate how I’ve been brought up to believe that my value rests entirely in how men perceive me- I’ve always done my best to be nice and sweet and smiling, because that’s what guys like and that’s what’s important! If guys don’t like you- then you’re useless. And I’ve always been prepared to change who I am to get a man’s interest. I was raped but was afraid to stop it because hey, I was afraid to hurt the guy’s feelings. Aren’t I sweet? When I’ve tried to be friends with guys, they’ve always ended up hitting on me, to the extent that I’m afraid to even have a normal conversation with men. Men are responsible for so much violence. I hesitate to go out alone at dark, despite the fact that I love a night time jog, because I’m afraid of getting attacked and raped by a man. I always have to consider the safest way of doing things- on my vacation, should I take a cab (meaning I’ll be alone with a male driver) or should I take the subway (which has safety in the fact that there’s more people around- but also a higher number of potential attackers)? Should I go to that country, or will that be too unsafe for me to go alone? I read all this articles in the paper about women in other countries getting mutilated and raped and murdered and married away as children.</br></br>  <br><br>On the news I see reports of women who’ve been murdered by their date or their partner, and I know there’s an enormous number of women out there who are in abusive relationships or have been raped and will never tell anybody about it. I see news reports on women who’ve been raped by strangers and I read enough online comments to know that the standard responses are 1) well, she shouldn’t have been out alone (regardless of time and place!) or 2) she’s lying. I know that if I get raped I’ll get no support outside maybe my closest family. And that’s a maybe! The patricarchy is internalized in everybody. I don’t want anything to do with men, and at the same time society treats me as an incomplete woman because I don’t want to marry and I don’t want to have children. I’m 33 years old and I don’t want anything to do with men because even the seemingly reasonable ones are absolutely spoilt by our patriarchal culture. I could rant on about this forever- and don’t even give me that ‘not all men’. Yes, ALL men!</br></br>  <br>how'd you get her to do that, i've talked with her for ages</br>  lol  <br><br><br>Obvious bait.<br><br>Lol "crotch display". Good one!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's not a faggot? Just a guess.</br>  <br>hahahahaha</br>  <br>Be funny, i guess. Idk anon, it just happened.</br>  <br>No, not "all men" you dumb bitch. Generalizing an entire gender based on the actions of a few if fucking ignorant. That's like saying that all women are prostitutes and porn stars. God I hate ignorant people like you. You give all women and feminists a bad name. You might as well be over in the middle east with all the other extremist nutjobs.</br>  <br>shit man :\</br>  Odds: You stay up<br><br>Evens: You go to bed<br><br>Dubs or higher: Your choice<br><br>Let's play, /b/</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Roll.

Sleep time  Rollin  Games that disappointed you.<br><br> Expected feels, got shitty plot twists <br> Gameplay is meh at best <br> Hardly used the Vigors or whatever they're called <br> Got stuck too far up its own ass </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That shit is a fucking disgrace to the first two</br>  <br>That game wouldn't be that bad, if it didn't come after the first two. I was basically just a recolor of the first one but it was still a good enough game.</br>    Exploration is shit <br>  Dialogue is shit <br>  Combat is shit <br>  Story is shit <br>  DLC is same shit <br>  Mechanically dumbed down to OP's level <br>  Story telling is shit <br>  Recieves high praise <br><br>Pic related</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought the way it pulled the rug out from under you at the end was brilliant. Gameplay wise it was an average shooter with a few lame gimmicks like that skyhook shit that never seemed to pay off at all</br>  <br>3edgy5me</br>  <br>Let me get this straight. You expected an Elder Scrolls game to have a good story and good dialogue? You pretty much set yourself up for it there.</br>  All the Bioshock games are shit. The first one is poor attempt at redux of System Shock 2, itself really overrated, but the other games are utter garbage that sell themselves on production values alone and get away with it.  <br>The exploration was okay but everything else was shit. Alduin is one of the worst villains ever</br>    <br>Every assassin's creed game after the first two</br>  <br>Actually Black Flag was pretty good</br>    So apparently making a game bullshit hard with a ridiculous learning curve, and a 10-15 minute trek back through everything from the last checkpoint makes it a critically-acclaimed game now.<br> shitty combat mechanics <br> lame same-same looking environments <br> boring repetitive gameplay <br> confusing inventory system </br></br></br></br>   Shat on established lore <br> Obvious moneygrab  <br> Disgrace to original trilogy </br></br>  <br>No it wasn't, it was fucking awful.</br>  <br> got stuck too far up it's own ass <br>Just like Andrew Ryan?<br>What way to better carry on the bioshock legacy?</br></br></br>  <br>That shit was just riding on the coattails of Dark Souls, which was only popular because of youtube. Personally I think Dark Souls wasn't very good, hard yes, but that doesn't make it good.</br>    <br>Seriously, it is the best pirate video game current in existence. Just sailing around, exploring, looting, and ship battling is 10/10.</br>  <br>What was so bad about it?</br>  <br> Shits on game <br> Doesn't explain <br>Enlighten us, anon.</br></br></br>  <br>You're just bad at it.</br>  <br>Try playing Jak II. Has good skill curve but none of the stuff you're complaining about.</br>  <br>To a degree I'd say I was average at it. But I don't see how any of the mechanics make it fun. Even when I was doing well in parts I wasn't enjoying myself, just waiting for the next checkpoint to turn it off</br>  Fable II will always be the most disappointing game I have ever been hyped for. Never even played Fable III but heard it was even worse.  <br>Sid Meier's Pirates for Com64 still wins at that</br>  <br>But it doesn't. Sorry.</br>  <br> Expecting feels instead of plot twists from a Bioshock game <br>retard confirmed.</br></br>  <br>I thought Fable II was pretty good, Fable III was complete shit, I am glad you avoided that dumpster fire.</br>  <br>The first two had a great story line rooted in deep philosophy. Infinite just had some hippy dippy timey wimey shit for big bang theory fans.</br>  <br>Yeah, no..</br>  People shitting on great games?<br><br>It smells like /v/ in here.</br></br>  <br>name a game that's better in every way than Skyrim, fixing the issues you named, i dare you.</br>  i have a question, im playing l4d2 and my pc is brand new, built it myself. when i lag super hard even with a good connection, whats the problem?just looking for advice here. any anonsknow what to do?should i reinstall and try again?  <br>Witcher 3</br>  I was really hoping this game would be good, but it was crap. Storyline was shit, combat was shit, gameplay in general was just bad. Third person only too. <br><br>Felt like a fucking arcade game. <br><br>I guess the graphics were pretty decent though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>having said that i enjoyed playing it.</br>  <br><br><br>I should clarify. As an Assassin's Creed game, it was awful. It was really just a pirate simulator. It was enjoyable but I really think they should of just made it a separate IP, especially since the weird templar frame story was so bad.</br></br></br>  <br>Fable II was in my opinion the best Fable game there is, it has both the features from the first and third game blended into a mix that works better than the first or third game for me.</br>  <br>Dark souls</br>  The Last of Us. <br><br>It has the same story concept as The Walking Dead by Telltale Games, but Telltale games did it better.</br></br>  <br>prison rape simulator 2015 10/10 would run again</br>  <br>post specs</br>  <br>Ah, I see, you like the Windows 3.1 verson better. Didn't have Windows at the time so couldn't play it. Perfectly understandable</br>  <br>Damn you must be some kind of sociopath or something. So edgy, don't mess with anon over here.<br><br>BS had a pretty shit plot twist and an okay ending. BS2 had less plot twist and some pretty great endings. BS: I had way too much plot twist and it fucked up whatever feels could have been.</br></br></br>  <br>I was expecting a lot more. It was my fault believing everything the game director bullshitted to journalists. I didn't realize he did it with the first game and I fucking love the first game.</br>  <br>Totally agree. II was OK, just different. III was just horrible. By the time the game felt like it was getting started it was over. That game's storyline had fewer missions than a sidechain in an Elder Scrolls game</br>  <br> has a different opinion <br> edgy <br>kill yourself</br></br></br>  I've always disliked ocarina of time and the loz as a whole. How many times can you make a game with the same shit in it? Z targeting was a poor excuse for not having another analog stick.  <br>ty</br>  Tbh nothing compares  <br>Eh, I quite enjoyed their twist on religion. The people were so patriotic that their country became their religion, and thus deemed foreigners to be sinners. I think its a good twist on xenophobia. Maybe if they focused more on Columbia rather than, say, Booker's time in Wounded Knee. Its a character driven game, but some moments, such as getting the shock jockey, felt pointless.</br>  <br>Well, I respect that opinion, I do think that if they focused on the seafaring it would make a much better game. I have never cared for the assassin's creed story, i have played through every game and the main story with the aliens has never grabbed me. So I agree with you, but I still thought it was fun to play.</br>  <br>Fallout 3, fuck man even New Vegas was better then that garbage</br>   bland characters <br> lazy writing <br> half unplayable due to save file size <br> it just..ends, unable to continue after hoover dam <br><br>as much as I wanted to like it, I couldn't</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>here, it was a custom order thru Futureshop when that was still a thing. figured it was a decent pc for what i need it for. work etc.. it plays most games like a dream, farcry 4 was the best looking game on this system imho.</br>  Surprised Watchdogs hasn't been mentioned yet. Guess the flames from that have finally died off. Worst part was that I live in Chicago and was hoping they'd at least try and capture the city. It was as though the only looked at the Loop and nothing else  <br>Yea that guy was a total bullshit artist, I'll give you that. He shouldn't be allowed to talk to the press ever.</br>  <br><br>Except New Vegas was way better than 3.I've got both , with all the DLCs (for free gotta thank based mom)</br></br>  <br>i know its not the greatest, but it was within my budget .</br>  <br>im forced to give it a ten cause it was more like playing Stanleys parable or whatever.</br>  <br>THANK YOU. Other popular series like Pokemon and CoD get shit on all the time for constantly rehashing, (which they probably deserve) and yet LoZ releases LITERALLY the same game every 2 years or so and is met with critical acclaim. Spirit Tracks was one of the worst things I have ever put into a game system.</br>    <br>Ocarina of Time was fine when it came out because for many people that was the first Zelda game for them. I have only played 2 since, but it seems like they are just moneygrabs of the same game over the past decade</br>  <br>Overall i think bioshock infinite would have been better off being its own game and shouldn't have tried so hard to be apart of the series.</br>    I don't like this game cause literally bad <br>  fug u ur edge </br>  <br>4790 with a gtx 745... Why?</br>  <br>lol good one. obviously going to have to disagree there.</br>  <br>morrowind, except for the melee combat</br>  <br>naa man I like both but the guns from Mothership Zeta... they were the tits!</br>  Roll dubs and you can't fap for the next three days.<br><br>Step up /b/!

Like an uneven Foosball table, you put us on tilt. The only way to rectify this is of course... tits. Now before you get all uppity and ignore this realize your audience. For some poor btards this is the closest they will get to a female for months. They are only acting like that because you have a vagina and tits, and those are only strong because they are concealed. So in order to even it out, tits or gtfo.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>A nice penis, that's it</br>  <br>Can I see your face with a timestamp plz</br>    <br>Respect his double dubs</br>  <br>Confirmed for gay male, women don't care about the penis only the bank account.</br>  <br>ha, lol, but seriously, how can I get a female friend?
