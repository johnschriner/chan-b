Filthy Casual  Green text story time /b/<br><br> everybody walk the dinosaur and bel-air up front to fuck up the niggerfaggots. <br> meet a cute girl on Tinder. We banter back and forth a few days. <br> cute as hell face, pretty average body. Not really fat but not super fit either. A little short. <br> finally get the courage to ask her on a date, she says yes instantly. <br> we agree to meet on a Thrusday since this weekend is packed for the both of us <br> meet up, shes even cutier than in her pictures. perfect tits suspected <br> we talk like we're old friends for an hour over tacos. She offers to drive us down town to hit some bars <br> oshit.jpg this girl knows how to treat a man <br> get downtown, hit her favorite bar, banter some more, shes touching and making sure I know she likes me <br> bail from the bar to hit another bar, start holding hands on the way <br> go to the rooftop patio of another bar down town, Perfect backdrop, view of the city, perfect kiss, no ackwardness <br> hang out on the rooftop for a while order more drinks but its like 1:30 by now and we both work tomorrow. <br> head back to her car, she lets me drive, shes pretty toasted at this point <br> drive back to taco shop to get my car, we sit in her car for a bit and talk some more, mentions she should go to my house because its too far to drive for her in her drunkenish condition <br> back to my house, she hits the bathroom, comes out without pants on <br> lookslikeimnotworkingtomorrow.png </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> we make out on the couch a little bit before she moves us to my bedroom, practically leading the way <br> asks if I want to use a condom or not, makes sure I know she has an IUD. I use one anyway becuase shit barely know this girl <br> we fuck like theres no tomorrow. Shes the loudest screamer I have ever been with. I came buckets. <br> perfect tits confirmed. I wish I had taken a pic but I was busy goddamnit <br> she lets an "i love you" slip from her mouth, but immediately appologizes for it. <br> holy shit wat <br> asks me about anal later, and if I want to see her again she'll bleach her asshole for me next time. <br> omgpleasemarryme.jpg <br> 3:30 am by now. she tells me to set the alarm, shes sleeping over. holy shit this girl <br> we sleep together for a while, im still blown away by this chick goddamn. <br> 7:30 I haven't even gone to sleep yet. But today I can work from home so its no big deal for me. <br> she wakes up, immediately on my already hard as fuck dick. Again super fucking loud. <br> we're done again, asks to borrow my shower, isn't even shy about it. <br> gets out of the shower and comes sit with me in the living room like shes already my girlfriend.  <br> talkas about things in my house, books, trinkets I have from traveling, whatever. Geinuine curiosity from what I can tell <br> Clothes up and leaves, asks me to walk her to her car like a gentleman. Of course I do at this point. <br> Share long passionate kiss in front of whole apartment complex. <br> texts me later that day and even calls about how my day is going <br> texts me later that night how shes telling the tale of our date to her friend. I say make me a legened <br> texts me the afternoon of the following day, now saturday, that she had so much fun but she thinks we shouldnt see each other anymore <br> whattheactualfuck.jpg </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> ask what I did wrong, she says nothing <br> tell her to keep my number if she changes her mind <br> she calls me later that night and talks to me for like an hour <br> says shes on a lot of meds or something...or used to be. How she surrounds herself with expensive material things to make her feel better but it doesn't. <br> Says she has strong feelings for me but can't drag me into her shitpile. So maybe just be friends <br> I am so goddamn confused at this point. <br> I let it cool down for a day, and wait until Monday (yesterday) to text her again, asking about how her day went <br> no reply at all. Not even today. <br> I think we're done at this point. <br><br>what the fuck happened /b/?
