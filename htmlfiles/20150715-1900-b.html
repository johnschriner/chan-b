She pressed her palms flat against the base of Trixie's spine and lowered her own bodyweight to pop out the kinks in her back.

This girl was strung up by her wrists after being mutilated and murdered. This has been kept on the down low with the media due to family requests but this bitch doesn't quite understand that. This has been a hard time for our city having such a serious thing happen. Now I hate to ask such fine gentlemen and ladies for a favour but I need some white knights to help me out. I want this stupid fuck to feel like the piece of shit she is for disrespecting a family in mourning. So do what you guys do best and teach this bitch a lesson.  <br>We've sent pictures of kids who have suicided to parents before go back to reddit</br>  Niggers, regardless of what we believe, the bitch is hot.
