Pussy, this tits or both  Hey /b/ name a movie that could use a remake  Shameless self bump    <br>You mean fuck it up?</br>  <br><br>I've seen a fanedit of this that was much, much better.</br></br>  <br>No, OP. Don't even say that</br>  <br>No i mean like a god teir remake(ex.mad max:fury road)</br>  Batman. Hadn't had nearly enough remakes.  <br>all remakes suck why would you want to destroy classic movies</br>    <br>I'm less into remakes and more into restoring and enhancing the original films.</br>    <br><br>The Thing (1982) was probably the best remake ever.</br></br>  <br>More like only 95% of them.</br>  <br><br>I will second that notion. Mah nigga.</br></br>  <br>The thing?<br>Dawn of the dead?<br>Let me in?<br>Evil dead?<br>King kong?<br>The ring? <br>Robo cop?<br>Total recall?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    Eragon and the sequels. <br>The book has potential for whomever makes a good film of it. Let's hope they go with actors that actually look the right ages and don't dress them up in badly conceived costumes.</br>  <br>why remake a movie like this?<br><br>take away all its original charm, make it edgier, retell the same story you already saw</br></br></br>  <br>remakes suck</br>  <br> The Fags <br><br><br> The Fagotemeus <br><br>No need, they are faggy enough. Street gangs dressed like...fags.<br><br><br> Im a big fan of director walter hill and he is responsible for 4 of my favourite ever films - namely - hard times, southern comfort, the driver and the long riders. This one though, is definately walter on an off day and the reviews on this page just make me scratch my head in dismay <br><br> ok so lets get it in perspective. Firstly, this is an enjoyable film in a brainless kind of way. As a period peice it works ok. The biggest problem with it is that it takes itself SOOOO seriously. It has no sense of humour at all, (unlike the far superior 'the wanderers' which was released the same year) - The worst offender however is the fight scenes. Think power rangers meets batman and you'll be on the right track. The real viciousness and menace of new york street gangs (or any other city street gangs come to that) is completely absent from this film and for the most part the gang members look like goofy drama school students, which is of course, what they were in reality anyway. They certainly dont come across as anything resembling menacing! <br><br> If ever a film cries out for a remake its this one, cos its a great little storyline. I hear rumours that there is indeed a remake being planned. I dont hold out much hope for it being any better though unless its in the hands of someone who doesnt treat it like a cartoon scenario or we'll back to where we are with this version. I guess we'll have to wait and see <br><br> anyway, 'the warriors' is alright. but it really is tame and lame in the extreme. if all gangs in new york are really as lame as this i think i'll go over there and take over the city myself! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I saw one that was a black and white combo of Alien and Prometheus it was 1000 times better</br>      <br>Nigga that movie was astronomical levels of bad. I don't know how anyone who worked on that could watch the preview version and think " Hmm this is just the way the books told it"</br>  <br>Its a good movie but i feel it could have been way better</br>  <br><br>Keep Your Hands Out ,BITCH</br></br>  <br>Hard to remake the Warriors. New York isn't like that anymore. You would have to do a period piece, and explain to all you Fucking kiddies how fucked up new York City used to be in a long drawn oUT intro full of exposition. You would lose most of that classic movies easy plot and quick set up.<br>plus, it would suck. Nobody would understand how teenagers own blocks if the city anymore. <br> It's a bad idea OP.</br></br></br>  <br>Just finished watching this an hour ago and I thought it was pretty good and doesn't really need a remake</br>  <br>Ghostbusters but with women instead of dudes.</br>    <br>Warriors is the best. They added it to Netflix recently. I watched it last night.</br>  <br>herd u was talkn shit m8</br>  <br>This is a gr8 idea</br>  <br>Same here</br>  Might be neat. <br><br> inb4 wall-e was it </br></br>    <br>What about true grit?</br>  Twister<br>Armageddon<br>Earthquake<br>Flashdance<br>Top Gun<br>Back to the Future<br>Casablanca</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I know it was horrible. Other than devoted fanboys, most of the audience was probably girls and gay guys looking for shirtless Ed Speleers. <br>That's why there should be a better version.</br></br>    Only make it with women this time.      <br><br> remake <br> Terminator 5 <br><br> implying a sequel can be a remake </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is that the best you can do in silliness?</br>  <br><br>Any of the movies listed here<br><br/></br></br></br>  They could do it modern aircraft and everything!!!<br><br>Oh wait, the F-35 sucks donkey dick and is no where near as sexy as the F-14. Also no back seat, so no comedic relief RIO.</br></br>  <br>Niiiice finally a nigga with a really good anwer</br>    <br><br>This.</br></br>  <br><br>They are remaking Top Gun. Tom Cruise will go up against drones. Honest.</br></br>  Ghostbusters  <br>I dont think thats possible</br>  <br>They already did that...</br>  <br>Dude, The Sarah Connor Chronicles adressed the problem with different timelines. Also Star Trek: Voyager and Enterprise who often adressed the problem with different timelines. IIRC, an entire season of ENT was an alternate timeline.<br><br><br>So if Genisys was the third movie released in the late 90's - early 00's it would be silly. But after T3, Salvation and Chronicles it makes perfect sense. Back to basics, I say. It's 2017, the judgement day won't be here but a vengeful AI is still around.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I know. And they did it before that.<br><br>Look, the guy wanted remakes. He will get a remake squared.</br></br></br></br>  [alt+255][alt+255][alt+30] <br>[enter] <br>[alt+30][alt+32][alt+30]</br></br>  <br><br>faggots</br></br>    ▲<br>▲ ▲   ▲<br>▲ ▲<br>  ▲<br>▲ ▲<br>  ▲<br>▲ ▲<br>  ▲<br>▲ ▲</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>▲<br>▲ ▲<br>boom</br></br></br>  ITT: underrated celebrity qt's<br> Emma Roberts </br>    <br>Ewe no</br>  Rashida Jones for sure.  <br> Rashida <br>half breed?<br>still bang/10</br></br></br>  <br>More your kind of thing?</br>  <br>Roberts emma is best emma</br>    <br>moar!</br>    <br>Name a hotter actress<br><br> protip: you literally can't </br></br></br>  <br>Her skin is flawless</br>    <br>Fuck you for making me post.<br> Eva for the win </br></br>    <br>checked</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>I've cum to this so many times, wish the original video with all those comments was still up<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=2wW<wbr>6bhNaOiY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Would smash</br>  <br>watching now</br>    Anna torv  Demi.  <br>This</br>  <br><br>Who thought a half nigger half Jew could be so hot?</br></br>  <br>I could fap to that</br>  <br><br>what's it like being 12</br></br>    <br><br>fuck no, come back when she has a jaw</br></br>  <br>Name?</br>      <br>camilla luddington<br> the voice actress for laura croft from tomb raider </br></br>   <br><br>I'd let her insult me any day of the week.</br></br>  <br>Chevron 7 locked</br>  <br>disappoint she not get out of tub</br>  girl from Mirrormask  I recently gorged on Mixology on Netflix.
