They said I need a gun and that they will pay for it, but I dont know what kind or which one to try to get. The guy who let me in the building and all the other people had pistols. They looked a little big.<br><br> Pic related, its one ive been researching </br></br>  <br>Don't buy a Taurus or a 9mm 1911 for that matter.</br>  <br>OP bump<br><br>Also, this is a gun that I get to keep (after I pay them back), so I would like something reliable for concealed carry. Also, in New Hampshire if that matters</br></br></br>  Look up hickock45 on youtube and watch his pistol vids to start narrowing it down by company, price, and size.<br><br>If you're into 1911's, look at Sig Sauer. <br><br>If you want something cheap, look at S&amp;W or Glock.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>This</br></br>  A good starter pistol would be the standart Beretta M9 9mm<br>Good performance across the board<br>Or a classic FN Glock, the best ones are from the 20 and up series<br>...or if you want a smaller one, get the Walther PPK or the Derringer 6mm<br>Or a IMI Desert Eagle if you're feeling badass</br></br></br></br>  <br>good advice anon<br><br><br>ask them if they have any recommendations. <br>9mm is cheap.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How about a FN 57?</br>  <br>also the berreta can shoot cast bullet</br>  get this gun. it looks cool and it shoots boolets.  <br>Go ask &gt;&gt;/k/ I'm sure they'll be happy to help you out.</br>  <br>/k/ here<br><br>Dont go 1911 as a first gun. They are low capacity, heavy, more complicated then most(any) modern poly guns, and usually are maintenance hogs. <br><br>Go with any full or duty size modern polymer 9x19 from S&amp;W, walther, sig, glock, or CZ<br><br>Avoid anything made by taurus except pt 92 series or pt 1911 series<br><br>Dont even think about .40sw, and many stated don't allow .45acp</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> FN 57 <br>if you can get a perm exemption from the ATF to pic up the AP rounds for the rest of your life, do it.<br><br>if not, it will be expensive, unless you also plan to get the civi P90</br></br></br></br>  <br>there are a couple more factors you have to consider.<br>The gun is basically going to be a part of your uniform so you don't want something big and bulky getting in your way all day but you want something that is going to work if you ever need it. I'd advise checking into what law enforcement carry in your area and go from there.</br></br>  <br>Fn five seven...hands down best gun for what you are going to be doing</br>  <br>You could got for something in the .40 range. They're not too big and still pack a punch.</br>  <br>  FN glock <br>2 different companies. One is from Austria one from Belgium. <br><br> the 20 and up series is best <br>Glock 19 gen 3 is objectively the best handgun ever made. <br><br>I prefer sigs tho</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>walther ppk cause james bond.</br>  <br>AR-15 all the way, m8...either that or a Bushmaster....good starter weapons....if all these kiddos in the Arab states can fire em, you can too, m8!</br>  <br>You can buy 5.7 at bass pro<br><br>The only stuff thats hard to find isn't even an ATF thing. FNH stopped importing it for feel related purposes. <br><br>I heard S&amp;B is coming out with a wider range of loadings though. <br><br>I have also heard that some guys use pulled ss109 pills and hand load them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Dont even think about .40sw <br>And you say this because of recoil vs 9mm? Sure, there's more, but with a little training that becomes manageable and the payoffs are worth it, IMO.</br></br>  Go ask /k/ the people here dont know shit and get all their knowledge from call of duty what where you thinking going here for advice. If the company is paying for it might as well go expensive and get a p30l or something  <br>fucking hell<br><br>what has Jersey made me?</br></br></br>  Smith and Wesson M&amp;P Shield is a quality gun. have owned one for a couple months and love it.  <br>No it has nothing to do with recoil .40 is a shit round</br>  <br>what do you think /k/ is for?<br><br>better yet, ask /r/guns</br></br></br>  <br>I've heard great things about H&amp;K pistols, not sure if they're good for carry, though. Even the compact models.<br><br>Look at Sig and Glock for concealed carry. Or for cheap, the S&amp;W 9mm Shield. Of course you can't go wrong with a .38 snub.<br><br>Don't listen to anybody who tells you that you need .40 or .45. Sure, they're awesome and powerful. But if 9mm wouldn't stop a man, our US military wouldn't use it. It's perfectly fine for a first pistol.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Of course a pistol. If you ever need it - and I sincerely hope you won't - would you rather reload after 6 rounds or have 12 more?<br><br>I'm a Eurofag btw and would recommend Walther, SIG or Glock.</br></br></br>  <br><br>First gun? Get a Glock 19.<br><br>Small enough for concealed carry if you want to, dead fucking simple to maintain, reliable as Old Faithful, and if you get ambitious there are fifty-seven zillion parts you can buy to modify it.<br><br>Plus it's common as hell and isn't going away any time soon. And it's a 9mm, which is relatively inexpensive to shoot and the recoil won't be bad.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 3-4 less rounds per mag <br> negligible difference in likelihood of 1 shot incapacition <br> difficult round to reload due to optimized pressure <br> pretty much stuck with 180gr loading vs 9mm's 115, 124, 147 (all found at walmart) <br> same caliber military uses so ammo is cheap AF <br><br>9mm is better in every aspect. If you want more power in an auto go .38 super or go 10mm</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> .40 is a shit round <br>Do go on... Especially since you are recommending 9mm.</br></br>  <br> not sure if their good for carry  <br><br>Wat why would you thik this?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Glock 29, Salient Arms that shit</br></br>  <br>Glock 19 (9mm) or 23 (.40s&amp;w). Not too big but not too small and goes bang every time. End of story. Ugly as hell but they work.</br>  Sig Sauer P226. Since you don't want something "big" like thr 1911 pictured. Or if you are looking for something of that quality, look for a variant since the more originals are maintenance hogs.  I own a few handguns and rifles myself, however my Taurus .357 snub nose is my CC weapon of choice....a lot of various holster options in all kinds of sleek looks (both outer and concealed) and most important of all, it shoots through schools!  <br>Quit now. Loomis is a shitty ass company, i just quit there after 10 months.</br>  <br>What's wrong with .40?</br>  Pistols are for babies, Sawn off mosin nagant covered in medical tape so you can be an intimidating mother fucker.  <br>Or to continue my thought even a Glock 32 which is .357 sig would be a good choice</br>  <br>At least 9x19 got picked by NATO<br><br>Oh yeah, did ya hear FBI is switching from .40 to 9x19 as well?<br><br>Nice try .40cuck and wesson shill</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>wow ur retarded. salient arms is fucking horrible, its been documented, look it up.<br><br><br>op go to /k/. pls, they will help</br></br></br></br>  <br>Aren't they full size? Certainly not as short as the P226.</br>  <br>Springfield makes some nice 1911's. If .45 is a bit much for you stick with a 9mm or .40. Sig makes some great pistols, stay away from Glock. If you got the money for it though Colt is a good choice.</br>  <br>See<br><br><br>And its <br> more expensive  <br> high pressure as fuck (if your gun has an issue it go kaboomey easyease) <br> overall a commercial failure only surviving because people are stupid and think 9x19 is underpowered (its not) </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i can tell u arent from /k/ or you would have called it an obrez, maybe a handnugget.</br>  <br><br>If you're not familiar with shooting then a larger pistol is probably better since more weight relative to caliber means less recoil.<br><br>A Glock 19 (9mm) is always a solid choice; but they're butt ugly and devoid of character.<br><br>My personal recommendation would be a Lionheart LH9. Lots of options for how to safely carry it, good capacity, built like a tank and its purty (pic related).<br><br>M1911s (like the pic you posted) are great guns but take more experience to handle and maintain (you need to get used to a manual safety). Additionally the Taurus brand (the maker of the gun you posted) is generally shit, so I'd avoid their guns. If you really want an M1911 get a Springfield Armory or a Colt or any other brand with a good rep and get it in .45 ACP as his Holiness John Moses Browning intended.<br><br>If you want a smaller gun to carry then you might also look into the Sig Sauer P938. Its a compact 9mm that operates very much like an M1911, just be aware that it has some recoil since its so small.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Salient Arms is horrible, m8...only good on the cheap if yous got dirt-rubbin' bus'ness on your mind.</br>  <br>With modern ammunition there is no difference between the .40 and 9mm you are sacrificing capacity for no reason</br>  <br>Walther P22 or PPQ<br><br>Or<br><br>If you want to be safe and effective you buy a S&amp;W 60 in .357 magnum.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wilson Tactical CQB Elite 1911<br><br>http://wilsoncombat.com/new/handgun<wbr>-cqb-elite.asp#.VZc-YEbPwZw</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>My favorite 9mm is the Jericho 941. I used to go to a range and rent one all the time. It was a shitty range and every other gun they had that I tried jammed a lot. The Jericho though, jammed like once or twice each visit and I put 100-150 rounds through it each visit. (this was 10 years ago when 50 9mm rounds were around $30) I plan on buying one in a few months now that I'm not a poorfag anymore. They are about $550. I would recommend it for a new shooter. It was the first 9mm I've ever fired and It's still my favorite. My best friend Loved the Kimber 1911. It was just as reliable. Too big for my hands though. Also, my sister worked for Loomis. They made her qualify with a .38 special (revolver) before they'd let her carry a semi auto. She worked in the building though keeping track of all that cash.</br>  <br>I carried a usp9 for 2 years<br><br>They are big and blocky, but doable</br></br></br>  <br>Glock 19</br>  <br>Good to know, I really fucking want a USP</br>  <br>The p30 is about the same size as a sig different models have different sizes</br>  Glock 20.<br><br>15 round magazine, 10mm Auto.</br></br>  <br><br>A snub nosed double action revolver like a Smith and Wesson is worth considering since its OP's first gun.<br><br>Double action wheel guns are about as idiot proof as it gets when it comes to guns.<br><br>.357 Mag is a good caliber although he might want to start by loading his gun with .38 special (.357 mags can fire both calibers) till he gets used to handling the recoil.<br><br>.38 special is a solid round and it doesn't kick like .357 does.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Jehricos are nice. Check out CZs too. The Jehrico is a derivative (goy speak for filthy jews copied) of it</br>  Are you an experienced shooter?<br>If not I recommend a handgun with a steel frame - cz75b and Beretta m9 and 92 or a browning hipower are all good choices<br>A steel frame absorbs felt recoil but the tradeoff is weight<br>If you go polymer frame - glock, S&amp;w mp, Springfield xd all good<br><br>My first was a Springfield xd9<br>Reliable<br>Easy as fuck to takedown and clean<br>Easy to get hi-cap mags<br>I recently used it to certify for my state's concealed handgun license</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Hey /b/, normally I would put this in /vg/ but I was wondering if there are any "/b/" friendly or membered guilds.....and if not, why the fuck not?  <br>Oh nvm I was thinking of the P238</br>  <br><br>Its his frst gun.<br><br>10mm is very expensive ammo to learn to shoot on and its far from a beginner round.<br><br>If he did go with a 10mm then he should get a second gun in 9mm or .22lr to practice with.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>For armored guard duty, I'd go with a Beretta 93R. Not overly expensive, and packs a good punch.</br>  <br>Your a fucking idiot and dont know shit about guns if you think .40 is better then 9mm<br><br> hurr its bigger so that means it must be better </br></br></br>  <br>Armed guards in the private sector typically can only carry a pistol chambered in 9mm or .38 special because &gt;muh feelings.<br><br>That said I would choose a Glock 19.</br></br></br>  <br>Good call. Excellent stopping power, full size makes recovery on target easy, plenty of rounds, not terribly expensive.</br>  <br> MADE IN BRAZIL <br>If it isn't made in USA don't bother. USA makes the only high quality guns available and they'll never fail you.</br></br>  <br>I think you should get this gun, pretty reliable, full of potassium and could save you from diabetes</br>  1911s are badass.<br><br>Get a Dan Wesson, Wilson Combat, Guncrafter, Les Baer.<br><br>Don't get a Kimber, Sig or Smith.<br><br>Anyone who says otherwise, doesn't know 1911s.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dont know if 10mm would be good for a beginner</br>  <br>  kek. </br>  <br>They are getting cheap. <br><br>Be warned though that they are becoming antiquated. They have a high bore axis, low capacity for their size, xboxhueg slide, and a trigger that feels like sticking your trigger into a rusty mumbai sewer pipe. <br><br>I did love mine. Was the first handgun i ever bought and recently gave it to my mom. <br><br>Accurate as fuck too. <br><br>HK does have more modern usp like guns like the p30, and different, but still an hk handgat is the vp9, which is a ppq copy (what i carry) but still a great gun</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Fuck you, my Kimber is fantastic.<br><br>But I say you should get a H&amp;K. Love mine.</br></br></br></br>  <br> 1911 <br> duty gun <br><br>Oh anon</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, a good CZ is on my list. Though since I've been poor for a long time I haven't been shooting for years. Gonna start expanding the list with research and more range visits so I have more options once I'm ready to buy. I need something reliable and comfortable in my hand, since I only plan of having one sidearm. I think it's worth blowing a few hundred bucks in ammo to find the right fit.</br>  A Glock is just a hammer. <br><br>It's not pretty or cool. It just does its job, reliably.</br></br>  <br>Fuck that...come to work with thsi baby strapped to ya back<br>pic related</br></br>  <br>Some kimbers are good, but their qa is shit, and has been documented for a decade and a half.</br>  <br><br>Stopping power is somewhat of a myth.<br><br>Shot placement is everything, if you hit someone in the heart with a .22 its still going to kill them (if it gets through the sternum) and if you hit them in the arm with a .44 Magnum its going to put a big hole in their arm but its not going to stop them.<br><br>Larger rounds to cause larger wounds and thus require a somewhat less accurate shot to kill; but unless you're hitting them with a 12 gauge shotgun or a big ass rifle round they probably won't be staggered by the impact.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Beretta 92fs is my recommendation perfect duty gun for a beginner in my opinion  <br>CZ75 is nice. Never liked the triggers. That talon trigger always irritated the underside of my finger when pulling trigger at range.</br>  <br>Op if you really wanna be pimp, get you a revolver. hehehe</br>  <br>If you like the jehrico, you will like the CZ<br><br>They are cheaper too, because the profits don't go to the dirty jews. <br><br>Check em out</br></br></br></br></br>  OP here.<br><br>Not really experienced at all. Shot a few guns about 8 years ago. Haven't even held one since. I fundamentally know how to shoot, but not at a well versed level. <br><br>I also have to qualify for the gun license with this gun. Does anyone know what I have to do to qualify?</br></br></br></br>  <br>You need to be able to shoot straight to qualify.</br>  <br><br>Kind of heavy. <br><br>I mean they're pretty and they have great capacity; but he might get sick of carrying around something so chunky.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Depends on the state. <br><br>You'll probably just need to go to a pistol range, answer 10 questions or so, and maybe shoot a target.</br></br></br>  Do yourself a favor and go into a gun store and pick up and handle any full sized hand gun you like. If you have access to a range that rents guns, even better. The reality of it is, it doesn't matter what kind of gun you carry. Just so long as you like it, are willing to deal with the weight of it on your hip all day, and are willing to do the bare minimal (hopefully more than) maintenance to make sure it's in working order should you ever need to use it.<br><br>Some other thoughts are, 9mm, .40s&amp;w, .45acp will all kill someone IF you do your part and put the bullet where it needs to go. That being said, if you're new to firearms I would go with a 9mm because practice ammo is cheap and someone new to guns, who may need to rely on one to defend themselves should practice. As far as the ballistic differences between 9mm, .45, .40 ect. In modern duty/defense rounds the ballistic differences are very little and as I stated before it's more about you putting your rounds where you need to go, hence practice.<br><br>Whatever you buy, just make sure you can hit what you have to shoot.</br></br></br></br>  Just get a glock 19 then OP. Doesn't sound like you want to spend and they are overall great guns.  <br>This</br>  You need to get a S&amp;W M&amp;P 9. If you want concealed, get a M&amp;P Shield 9.<br><br>It's reliable, easily concealed, and well-made.</br></br>  <br><br> I also have to qualify for the gun license with this gun. Does anyone know what I have to do to qualify? <br><br>If you're a security guard you probably have to prove you can safely carry it and pass a basic marksmanship test.<br><br>If you get a gun you need to run some ammo through it to learn to shoot it well. You might ask your employer if they'll put up the funds for some ammunition to train with.<br><br>A good marksman with a mediocre gun is far more effective than a chump with a great gun.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>wtf are you talking about faggot</br>  <br>I'm assuming there's some sort of price cap on how much they're willing to spend on your handgun.<br><br>I'd go for a .357 magnum revolver, a pretty brutal round but you can also shoot cheaper less powerful .38 specials out of the same gun. S&amp;W Model 27 for upscale, S&amp;W 686 for the same thing but a bit less pretty. Colt Pythons are a notch better than Model 27s but they'll cost like 3k (they quit making them in the 90s).<br><br>Sure, you only get 6 shots with .357 magum.... but if you can shoot worth a fuck you get more stopping power than the 7 from a .45 AGP.<br><br>For cheap and reliable get a glock of some sort. <br><br>I guess it all really depends on what your employer is willing to spend on it. I'd probably find out what the cap is and get something a couple hundred MORE than that by contributing a bit of your own money.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Will do. If I can get the same reliability at a cheaper price I will be so happy.</br>  <br><br> .45 AGP. </br></br>  <br>True but if your new to guns thats not so bad and if your going to be open carrying in a good holster it shouldent really matter much</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Of course 9mm is cheaper and smaller and they will naturally put a hole in someone. I've admittedly been out of the loop for a couple years as I've been happy with my setup, so I've tried googling ".40 s&amp;w vs 9mm" and I can't find much supporting 9mm over .40.<br><br>Now for a first timer, I probably would recommend they start with 9mm for recoil alone.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Typo Dale, don't get butthurt.</br>  last one got deleted  Get a KSG op, it's my everyday carry.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=X8b<wbr>PNUhz_Iw</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>I have to agree here. The Shield is becoming THE starter pistol.</br>  <br>.40 is still shit...</br>  <br>Those are pretty heavy, but also look pretty badass. One good thing about revolvers though, is they rarely misfire and when they do, it's usually the round's fault.</br>  <br>okay ▲<br> ▲ ▲</br></br>  <br>Well, since some Anoneemouses on a Balinese caricature board said so...</br>   ITT: kids who don't know what they're talking about: guns edition   <br>Anon, double check that they'll allow you carry a 1911. Most companies won't due to the fact that they have to be cocked to apply the safety, or holstered hammer down and manually cocked before firing wasting time (that's all it could take in a shoot situation to cost you your life.) <br><br>Listen, you're best bet if you can't get the 1911 is to go and pick up a bunch of different guns at the shop. Hold them, dry fire. Work them and see which is most comfortable in your hand. Caliber is irrelevant if the pistol is too large and you're not keeping it perfectly straight as you squeeze the trigger. Now me, I'm a Sig man. Older ones aren't great in the ergonomic department, but newer ones have a thinner single piece grip that is much easier to work with. If you want a work horse that can go through hell and back and keep working, look at Glock. Don't believe me? Look up the Glock torture test.</br></br></br>  <br>Good im glad we jave established this</br>  <br><br>If you're anti-gun just buy an FN FiveSeven. It's so expensive to shoot, you'l never fire it.</br></br>  <br>The FBI is switching back to 9mm from the .40. Lot's of law enforcement agencies are doing the same.</br>  Glock 19, hands down, perfect combination of size and firepower, use federal hydrashock +p+ rounds and you're good to go.<br><br>This is going to be a work tool for you not some range queen 1911 with too many moving parts for a gun newb. All you have to do with a glock is unholster it and pull the trigger until its empty. <br><br>Go with the proven winner and get a glock</br></br></br></br>  I've worked for loomis for just over a year now, quit now. It's a terrible company to work for, they lie about the armor on the trucks too, they can only stop handgun rounds, and they sure as hell don't pay us enough to get shot over walmarts money  You have no previous firearms experience and you want to be an armed guard.<br>Yeah, this will go well.</br>  <br>Of course, if you really get attacked your enemy is going to be using this.<br><br>50BMG.jpg...<br><br>But all your gun really does is scare off pre-teen dindus...
