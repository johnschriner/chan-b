On the rag again, OP?</br>  <br><br>jesus..</br></br>  <br>I wrote is as b instead of /b/, it triggers his autism</br>  <br>haha, how can autism be used as an insult? Only an ignorant cunt would use autism as an insult. (And there's nothing I hate more than ignorance)<br><br>Autism is a gift in my case, I have an IQ of over 150 which makes me technically a genius thanks to my autism. I've been going through school all my life being bored out of my fucking brains getting at least 95% on all my tests (and all the incorrect answers were silly mistakes) because I'm just too fucking smart for school, I can't wait for everyone else to learn something I already knew within the first day or two of being taught it. Every year I scored the best of my year on these stupid multiple choice tests we do and the headmaster came to my class to tell me that, which obviously resulted in being called a 'nerd' which is true but I shouldn't be ridiculed for it.<br><br>I recently became home educated so I could learn at my own pace and I'm getting my GCSEs done in 1/4 of the time everyone else has to do it in, I'm also doing more than double the average amount of GCSEs that usually would be done.<br><br>I used to get paid $30 an hour working online, which is more than the teaching assistants at my old school earned, it was so fun pointing that out to them.<br><br>So, in conclusion, calling someone autistic is not an insult, in my case, it makes me highly gifted.<br><br>One more thing, I don't know if this has anything to do with my autism but I am a sociopath so I'm not hindered by irrational emotions like guilt, compassion, empathy etc.<br><br>haha, the most satisfying this is to know that you will all see this as a waste of a natural gift and that I am undeserving hahaha, that brings me great satisfaction.<br><br>I'm practically perfect, let the jealousy flow through you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Trying to suck your own dick, faggot?</br>  J ....

I'll stream it if I do.  <br>Roll</br>  All the nice people kill themselves and now the world is full of idiots.  Tell us your story op<br><br>And I say flip a coin</br></br>  <br>Girlfriend cheated on me with some fucking douchebag, and claimed I raped her. My family is siding on her because they have some fucking retarded feministic views. Kicked out of my own house, I don't have a job. Like 70 dollars left, and all i have left are some clothes. I'm staying at friend's place for now, but obviously I can't stay forever. A lot of my friends were good friends with my ex, so they sided with her too. My life is pretty much fucked. I don't have enough money to move to another state, so i have nothing else to do.</br>  <br>Shouldn't have raped her faggot.<br><br> inb4 69 get <br> if so then YES </br></br></br></br>  Joyce Dewitt  <br>I live in New Mexico. There's a lot of street life here/homeless people.<br><br>You can kill yourself. It won't really make a difference.

In a way though, I kind of preferred it that. People who live comfortable lives, like most of the people on /b/, don't really know how meaningful it is to live so close to the edge. Even when you're dying, you feel so alive.</br></br></br>  <br>roll</br>  Damn rapist, kill youself, we don't need scums like you  Kill yourself, I guess.<br><br>But make all those faggots feel guilty with a suicide note saying how they didn't belive you in your time of hardship, no reason to lie about raping her if you're dead anyway etc.</br></br>  No kill b/ro  Get<br><br>and do it</br></br>  NO KILLARINO PLEECE!<br>Join the army and kill children in the name of freedums you dippy.</br>  She ain't worth it  Nope  op if I get 69 please martyr and get on the news for all the people against muslims, jews, gays, and niggers. This week was a shitty political week and we need to fight back. I want you to kill a lot of niggers and gays.  Do it  Nope  she sounds like a bitch and don't let a petty reason like that be your reason for killing yourself  Doo eet  <br>Yes, you should</br>  <br>FUCK YOU</br>  Don't give her what she wants anon, if u kill urself that bitch will have reached her goal  nah bruh. Send me your stuff first then never use a computer again.  <br>there you go, op lives</br>  <br>Did this actually happen? WTF? I am sorry, anon. Truly. I wish I could tell you life is worth living, but I am suicidal too. I just hope you don't kill yourself. I was kicked out last year for 7 months. I couch-hopped for shelter(the difference between a couch-hopper and a homeless person is some social skills), got a job at Publix(southern grocery chain), and took night classes at my local community college. Enrolling in a small state school next year with a good amount of money saved up, and since I was couch-hopping, I lost weight and got in great shape since I had no money to burn. There will always be more woman, so don't let this bitch win. Remember, the best revenge is the live a good life. Good luck, and please take care of yourself. Find your passion and work towards it. Everything else will fall into place. It won't be easy, but it's possible.</br>  No /b/ro I was there less than a week ago. My life has been shit the past year and a half. It gets better isn't a blind lie people say. It takes a long time and hard work but it gets better. &lt;3 you /b/ro in someway everyone on 4chan likes the other people.  Where do you live?
