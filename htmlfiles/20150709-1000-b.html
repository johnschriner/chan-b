ITT: What is /b/'s record for fapping in one day?<br><br>My record is 7 times, I was about 16 years old and by the last two times I was just shooting blanks.<br>Cmon I know anon can do better than 7.</br></br></br>  7-8. Also blanks at the end  23. And im dead serious  <br>16. I was 15 and it was a sleepless night. I ended up literally not jizzing</br>  <br>I call bullshit, but wtf 23?!? You have the stamina of a God.</br>  Anyone here ever fapped with a friend? Or even with a friend in the room that didnt know you were fapping?  4 here, somethings wrong with everyones balls in this thread or you bs  Here we go.<br> be me <br> 18 <br> it's midnight <br> bored af <br> I decide to fap <br> half hour later <br> bored still <br> not going to sleep, not a pussy <br> fap again <br> this continued every hour until dinner the next day, around 6pm <br> I fapped around 32 times in one day </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ummm you are very very gay.</br>  <br>Mother of god. I'm tired after 4 times...</br>  <br>32 times!!!!!??????????<br><br>Jesus, I thought my 10 times was good.</br></br></br>  <br>midnight - once and hr till 6pm = 18 not 32</br>  <br>actually he said half an hour</br>  <br>Have fun with your heart attacks.</br>  <br>Once every 30 minutes, guv.</br>  <br>Yeah, 7 times for me too. I dream of one day reaching 10. <br> mfw the only goal i have in my life right now is a new fapping record </br></br>  I do but if i dont ejaculate multiple times a day I get extremely irratable. My seratonin levels are all jacked up. I do it at work, home, shower.  <br>I used to stroke myself through my pocket in class</br>  <br>Shared a room with a brother for 18 years, lot of 'scratching' both of us politely ignored.</br>  8-9 when i was 15 or 16, during the summer i literally just fapped every day like 5 times and i was like why not more so i kept on going  6-8 times. with 16 y. while taking a bath. it was somehow a moment where i could cum within like 15 seconds of ultra fapping. also after third time nothing came out.  <br>One time when I was about 15, me and couple guy friends found his fathers porn vids(VCR tapes, I'm an old old fag) So we probably watched 3 whole porn movies.<br>Now that i think about it, it seems pretty gay. 3 guys watching porn together. Anyways, it was a sleepover (getting gayer)<br>I laid there with a boner for like an hour until I was sure the other 2 had fallen asleep, and I busted out 2 times in like 10 minutes. I used my sock for cleaning.<br>I am not proud.</br></br></br></br>  14 is my record, dry by the 3rd. That was when I bought my first vibrator and was alone all day, porn on the big screen and literally could not stop. I passed out after the 7th and did it all over again.  18 dick actually hurt the last few times, couldn't fap for a week afterwards<br><br><br><br>4 a day is like a regular day for me</br></br></br></br>  <br>wait are you a grill?</br>  <br>Of course not anon ;^)</br>  <br>Where the hell do you think you are?</br>  <br>14</br>  <br>I did somewhere in the 20's, my internet was down for 2 weeks during the summer and one day I just masturbated ALL DAY, my dick was VERY sore</br>  <br>13 times finished</br>  <br>this continued every hour makes it sound like 1 an hour just bad wording</br>  <br>Did seven yesterday. I don't think it's my record. How do I stop guys? I'm 17 &amp; ruining my life.</br>  <br>more importantly, why is his skin coming off?</br>  27, back when I just discovered it around 9-10 years old.  most i ever did was 5, holy shit this thread is surprising..  <br>Kek</br>  <br> 48  <br> blacked out when i came <br> friend found me in the morning  <br> hospital for 2 weeks <br> couldnt take a piss for 3 weeks <br><br> worth </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>To be fair, I'm counting involuntary spasms when everything blanked.</br>  <br>Wow, a whole 2 years ago! congrats anon.</br>  <br>10-11... don't remember actualy... Ye I was bored..</br>  I'm pretty sure my max is three. I completely lose my libido after I finish.  <br>Under age ban</br>  <br>Turn off your computer and get a life.</br>  <br>Stopped counting somewhere around 15</br>  <br>underage b&amp;</br>  <br><br><br>7x small loads at end</br></br></br>  <br>still, when i was 15 and had started browsing /b/, that was the most I did. I actually busted out straight semen that had no real cum with it after the 3rd one.<br><br>that day i had to reevaluate my life</br></br></br>  OK wtf I am a 21 year old male and the most I ever masturbated in one day is 3 times. Do I have less testosterone than the normal guy? WTF? People are saying 20-30 times.....<br>Do i need testosterone supplements? wtf</br>  <br><br><br>has nothing to do with testicles. The prostate produces the while fluid the sperm cells swim in. had a doctor say my prostate was unusually large</br></br></br>  <br><br>"this continued every hour" how is that every half hour?</br></br>  lol my max is probably 4<br>my cock is fucking limp as fuck after i cum once</br>  <br> heart attacks <br>wut</br></br>  <br>I never really counted it, but my daily record is definitely 10+. And it's not like I even really tried. Just one of those days where I'm alone at gome and have absolutely nothing to do. Fapping till it hurts ia one way toi pass the time.<br>On average, I fap around 3 times a day.</br></br>  iv only done 20 in a day  <br>underage b&amp;</br>  <br>bait?</br>  <br><br>You aren't alone. I'm glad I can't make it past three.</br></br>  <br>it was 39 to be exact. I got to 40 after midnight so I wont count that one. But my goal that day was to fap. I had no parent at home maybe 1 was 20. I remember at around 20ish i start to shoot blanks but then at 35 it was small precum color. I do remember I was getting a headache at some point for a whole week when i fapped and came. It doesnt happen anymore.</br>  <br><br>pfft.... record for one day. I fapped ALL day one time.</br></br>  probably 5  <br>there are people that actually died from cumming many times.google it</br>  <br>this thread is disturbing nigga</br>    Max 9 times; woke up early and went to sleep extremely late.<br><br>Never shot blanks before though</br></br>  <br>you're gonna get a problem after 50, with a large prostate comes a very small blatter, that is why must males after 50 have to go to the toilet a lot. brace yourself to have to pee every hour</br>  <br>HAHAHA WHAT moar deets</br>  <br>Friend came over to spend the night once. I had a shit laptop and was on my bed playing on a little mini desk thing. My friend had just gotted CS:GO and was playing it on the desk facing away from my bed. I jacked it behind him. I swear I'm straight.</br>  <br>It was a good time. Figured out how to cum faster and when ever basically. lol</br>  <br>i did 25 once, just to see if i could<br><br> be like 12 years old <br> don't know what it is but feels great <br> didn't even ejaculate yet <br><br>i'd kinda rub my hand back and forth over the tip through my underwear (uncircumcised). only took like 1-2 minutes per session.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it is possible, but prob bait...</br>  7 times in 30 minutes when i was 13. that was before i could ejaculate, so stamina was unreal  <br>if i cared enough to google it i would have when i read the original comment. thanks for all the helpful fucking information</br>  Faces of /b/<br><br>Post your gf/bf as well if you want.<br><br>go.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nigga u serious?</br>  It was nice of you to give your chin to your gf, but it seems that she already had one  What are your favorite fb pics to fap to?    <br>bruh post more of that</br>    /bradyn.burney  this.  <br>on the right</br>    She is a biomedical scientist    <br>And my sister</br>  Fuck off 4chan, go kill yourselves faggots! <br>Go use some real websites like reddit or tumblr. <br>fucking faggots</br></br>      <br>Wow the shitty bait is shitty</br>   Game of /B/ros <br>I am Bear, I will be your OP this round<br><br>This round will be a special round because I will be teaching some players the game.<br><br>HOW TO JOIN:<br><br>On the right side of the image are all of the "factions" in the game you may choose.

Good.</br>    <br> tfw cute bottoms only want big black dick </br>    <br>I´d gladly serve your white cock, too</br>    <br><br>The weird part was that when he was done basically raping me, he went back to being Senor Cleaver.<br><br>It wasn't bad and I definitely won't complain about it, but that's basically what prison rape is. Dude just used my ass. I guess the missus wasn't giving up the panoche for a while.<br><br>He did offer to blow me after. Before he noticed that I already came. Pretty gentlemanly.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't like that black guy's head</br>  bla bla bla nigger dick shitty story shove it up my ass for the 1000th time today muh privelige sjw filth  <br>I was going to ask what his demeanor was like afterwards but you said it. I guess nobody can really go around being the same person they are during sex.</br>  <br><br>it is indeed my ass!<br><br> after getting the tip in, he starts to slowly press into me <br> never had a dick this big, i moan in pain and pleasure, he slows down <br> after seriously ten mins of him just inching his dick in and me writhing in pain, he's finally all in <br> lets me relax a little, i'm now laying flat on my stomach(he had pushed me down while inserting) <br> he asks if Im okay, say yes <br> he then starts to slide in and out of me, slowly at first <br> then out of nowhere (guess he was tired of waiting) he just starts to fuck me harder than ive ever been fucked <br> im moaning and almost crying, but he's not listening now <br> continues to fuck me, going slow, then fast, he's going balls deep, slapping my ass <br> im writhing underneath him, cum just dripping from my cock <br> i kinda fade out at this point, breathing way too hard, vision goes blurry <br> he fucked me for almost 30 mins, I came twice without ever touching myself <br> he then tells me to roll over, I do so <br> he grabs the back of my head, pushes his cock in my face and starts beating it furiously <br> i just sit there on my knees still woozy, moaning like a bitch <br> after five mins he unleashes an ungodly load onto my face <br> i just sit there stunned, him just smiling <br> i proceed to lick everything I can up, the rest i wipe off with a towel <br> get up, smoke a cigarette and go home <br><br>this happened a couple weeks ago, he's texted me multiple times, but I haven't had time to play recently...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I want to be hate-fucked so bad.

Even shared some twinks with white guys. I wouldn't even let race come into play because where there's a willing ho there's a willing hole</br></br>      <br><br>not true, my boyfriend is unreal he's that cute, and I'm an average white guy, I'm it even 6 inches and he loves it. inb4 people saying bullshit he's cheating on me etc. but this is real life and I know I make him happy</br></br>          <br>lost</br>        <br>Pretty mch how it is for me, yeah - the color doesn´t matter as long as I can serve cock</br>      I've seen some shit on /b/<br><br>But these threads disgust me the most</br></br>        ITT post your birthday month issue of Playboy  bump for potential  Frieza or GOKU &amp; VEGATA?  <br>What is DragonBall Z?</br>  Goku could beat anybody ever.
