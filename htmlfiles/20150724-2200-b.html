Weed. Works every time.  <br> Weed <br>i'm at work<br>also <br>alcohol + weed = kill</br></br></br></br>  <br>stop being a kid, bitch</br>  <br><br>get a multivitamin and lucozade from a shop</br></br>    What kind of job do you have?  <br> Cleaner at Wendy's <br> $6.00 an hour </br></br>  <br>i'm a programmer</br>  Poorfag here<br><br>I drink $7 Kamchatka vodka. Somehow, I'll drink half and wake up still drunk. Can't understand it. <br><br>I can drink 7-8% beers all night and wake up fine but that shitty cheap 42% vodka just fucks me up.<br><br>As for someone who has woken up with many hangovers. Go to your first convenience store you see and drink whatever comes with the most B Vitamins you can find. I used to drink the Daquiri flavored Sobe and it helped almost instantly. <br><br>Don't drink nothing but water. All water does is sobers you up more and brings the hangover into full form. Trust me. Drink anything with B Vitamins. Greasy food helps some feel better but the only REAL quick way to get rid of a hangover is getting a buzz again.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it's probably because beer needs it's time to be finished, it'll take some time to drink the same amount of (pure) alcohol as there is half a bottle of vodka-</br>  <br><br>Drink pickle juice</br></br>  <br>I drink them pretty fast. Especially things like Ale or Bud Light Platinums. <br><br>I used to drink so much to the point where I was puking every morning and I would go on massively long binges. I thought I was dying a few morning and I'm surprised I've actually made it this far.<br><br>The only thing that ever helped me was vitamin B drinks. I tried every remedy under the sun. Even though I would throw 50% of them up, getting a couple Bloody Mary's usually helped too. I think the bartender got used to it.<br><br> Would come in, got bloody mary <br> There'd be a chance I'd end up going to the bathroom and throwing it up <br> I'd be good </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> jews it is </br></br>  <br>drink a raw egg in some vodka</br>  <br> People sell a product <br> DAMN THE JEWS <br><br>Have you ever thought that not everyone in life wants to be a loser who sits on their computer and blames others for their problems? <br><br>At least they're capitalizing on something you fucking /pol/tard</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>drink fucking lots of water with salt and vomit once again <br>trust me, I'm russian</br></br>  <br>Nigger you're a terrible Russian.<br><br>Don't drink water coming off of a Vodka buzz, you'll get fucked up again.</br></br></br>  <br>I usually get more vodka or beer. Pick up a sixpack and sneak some in troughout the day</br>  <br>underrated</br>  <br>This shit always helps me</br>  <br>no, i meant jews it shall be.</br>  <br> Being this autismo <br> Jews <br> Juice <br>Get some concentrated jews</br></br></br></br>  drive your car into oncoming traffic, go to hospital, be violent, get sedated.<br><br> flawless </br></br>   <br><br>IT'S HAPPENING!

Cheap wodka usually is not filtered that often so the amounts are higher. its what makes headache.<br>also drink as much water as you can. <br>you body dehydrates with alcohol<br>especially working good before going to bed.<br>1,5 litres of water before sleep and you wont have headache at all.<br>trust me i'm german</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Drank water Throw up drank water throw up<br>wait 20 mins drink tiny bit of water<br>Drink 1 PowerAde or Gatorade <br><br>Don't eat breads<br><br>Eat a piece of meat chicken is easy as long as it's not dry.<br><br>Take some Headache tablets or hit some coke<br>not cola.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yea your going to feel like shit for a few days no matter what, drink a lot of water</br>  <br><br><br>Bad hangover from vodka is always the MIXER<br><br>What ever you mixed it with contained too much fucking sugar<br><br><br>Drink loads loads of water throw up<br>Like this </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this. take a bump of coke, itll help</br>  <br>Pic related?</br>  <br> for a few days <br>why the fuck should that be<br><br><br>yeah there was some energy, but i didn't mix, i drink vodka as-is, energy was just to wash that shitty taste out<br><br><br>doing this, this way i don't need to go to a store. i'll just take some of the cola for the clients</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nigger do you even chemistry <br>Methanol is high toxic</br></br>  <br>yeah everytime i smoke weed i turn into a niggerbitch that i secretly want to fuck</br>  <br>so is ethanol you idiot.<br>The Dose Makes the Poison.<br>sadly there is no english article about this lol.<br><br>https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begle<wbr>italkohol</wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  Mittags-/deutschland/-Faden!<br><br>Was treibt euch freundliche Leute zur heutigen Mittagsstunde in diese dunkle Ecke des Kellers?</br></br>  <br>grade erst aufgestanden, Semesterferien sind was feines ;D <br>jetzt erstmal meine Dosis Kopf-fick für heute abholen</br></br>  <br>Uni protokolle schreiben.</br>  <br>Ich habe noch nicht einmal meine erste Prüfung geschrieben.<br><br><br>Studiengang?</br></br></br></br>  <br>lernen für Abschlussklausuren<br><br>und selbst?</br></br></br>  <br>Hab heute das erste mal das herz von unserem flip schlagen sehen. schon toll :D</br>  <br>Grade aufgestanden, jetzt gleich lernen für Klausuren...</br>  <br>gerade aufgewacht. gestern schlafmangel wegen prüfung. heute wird geil. erstmal n dub.</br>  sag mal, nur studenten hier?<br>hallo mitleidende prüfungshuren!</br>  <br>Hab den Eindruck, hier hängen nur Studenten und Asoziale rum...

Die asozialen sind nicht so gehirngewaschen von der Lügenpresse. Da besteht noch Hoffnnung das sie eines Tages aufstehen werden.</br>  <br>Gehst du arbeiten?

Mit Parolen um sich schreien und "alternativer" "freier" Medien Inhalte ungeprüft verinnerlichen ist aber meines Erachtens deutlich schlimmer als die Mainstream-Medien kritisch zu hinterfragen und sich eine eigene Meinung zu BILDen...</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Mit MR ist man auch ncihts wert. Fakt!!!</br></br>  <br>Hab kürzlich ein Interview mit Frauke Petry gesehen. Zum Kotzen, die Frau. Nicht nur persönlich, auch politisch.</br>  <br>Also, Gender-Studies müsste in den kommenden Jahren enorm an Bedeutung gewinnen.

Das macht mir Angst!  Americunts are asleep, /b/.<br><br>America hate thread</br></br>  <br>Almost every single hospital in our country will provide medical care even if you dont have insurance (maternity care is provided at literally 100% regardless of circumstances of the patient). That doesn't mean you wont get bombarded with incredibly ridiculous bills, even for care you didnt receive, and put into bankruptcy. Or you could just go to the hospital when necessary and ignore the bills like I do. You get the care you need, and also can help contribute to the downfall of this fucked up society.<br><br>Not to mention, you might want to consider why that bitch got dumped while pregnant. My sister used to do the same thing, sit in front of mcdonalds while she was pregnant and beg for money. She would tell people she was left by her husband, but in reality- she was still with her piece of shit boyfriend who also didnt have a job, and they begged in separate places to support their heroin addictions.</br></br></br>  <br>so is tumblr and reddit and 9gag</br>    gfur, anyone?  <br>Yeap.</br>      not bumping      <br>yeah sure<br><br>more like <br>if you got it</br></br></br></br>  <br>Some people got it and some don't.</br>    <br> more like <br>more like what?<br>reindeer?</br></br></br>    Got more slutty birds??

You hit X too many times in 94?</br>          <br>nah i found old drugs from 94 in my m8s old family home and took too many of them yesterday, i wasn't even born in 94</br>      <br>Did you not see wolf of wallstreet??<br>The exact same thing happened except he could not speak.</br></br>        <br>Nice, cock fucking!</br>  <br>i only saw half of it for some reason, but now i know to only take 2 instead of 3</br>      <br>Can't find it myself, but if it helps, I believe the comic was by Hardblush and the character's name was Tay</br>  <br>and yeah i realize that i'm a retard for taking them and even a bigger retard for planning to take them again but i don't like my life enough to not do drugs</br>  <br> by hardblush <br>lurk harder faggot</br></br>  <br>Yes but you'll still be retarded for taking them again. What drug is it supposed to be?</br>  <br>no pain no gain<br>theres like 2 sequals<br>enjoy</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks</br>      <br>dolotard, it was banned in EU 2011 because it was too easy to accidentally OD on it</br>          <br>lmao</br>  <br><br>This shit... This shit right here needs to die.<br><br>Im not talking about the art, im talking about the whole "Agender" pronouns (theyself, she) and that shit. "Fae or Faerself" fucking *otherkin* morons who need to be locked up for being absolutely insane.</br></br></br></br>  1/5    Things that would have made me get a cum tube for my chance<br><br>This.</br></br>  3/5  4/5  i find it cute how some people think posting certain stuff will affect gfur threads like we aren't already used to it  5/5  <br>I got something even worse to show you.</br>      <br><br>What in the fucking seriously?<br><br>These people need to grow the fuck up.<br><br>They are idiots...</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>They'll turn ANYTHING into a gender. There's even music genders and fire genders.</br>    <br><br>Cancegender pride.... i read that one and hoped it meant they had cancer. Because everyone who believes along these lines ARE a cancer. <br><br>I dont think i can take anymore. Im losing faith in humanity as a whole by looking at these stupid "genders"</br></br></br></br>    <br>If it makes you feel better, someone on /b/ made this image and posted it on Tumblr. It pissed off several Tumblrinas.</br>  <br><br>Transaryan and bifro. those gave me a good laugh.<br><br><br>How do people believe that other stuff though? <br><br>"IM GENDERFLUID!"<br><br><br>Do these people not understand genetics? Do they not understand science? i have never, not even once, in my entire life wished ill on anyone. Until these tumblrites came around.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's teenagers and mentally fucked up adults trying to be unique, and forcing their "uniqueness" on others.</br>  <br>Saved!</br>  <br><br>Yeah true... Still though, if i was the parent of one those teens, i would send them to an asylum. and then i would 're-educate' them.</br></br>  <br>Gender is not sex, you pleb.</br>  <br>Same. I especially hate how they're trying to make up new sexualities for just about every type of attraction.</br>    <br><br>gender and sex are the same thing. just because retards want it to be different doesnt mean it is.</br></br>  <br>Go make out with a frying pan, you pleb.</br>  <br>go set yourself on fire.</br>  <br>I blame the changes in the educational system and lousy parenting. Everyone wants to be a special snowflake.</br>  <br><br>I completely agree there. So many idiot parents combined with shitty internet crap like Tumblr let people throw their own shitty ideas out there and people reinforce the idiocy.<br><br>Idiocracy, here we come. Let us begin to sow the fields with Gatorade.</br></br></br></br>  <br>We can burn together.<br><br>Not supporting all the queer genders, though.</br></br></br>  <br>If I ever have a kid, I'm blocking Tumblr and Instagram on his computer.</br>  <br>Same. Im all for people exploring stuff on their own, but Tumblr and Instagram are both a blight on intelligence.<br><br>Its sad though, because ive seen some amazing stuff on tumblr, but i refuse to even attempt to find anything now becuase ill be browbeaten with otherkin idiocy or feminazy bullshit.</br></br></br>  <br>Everything is getting affected by the SJWs. Even the porn. There's this fur blog in which they'll attack you if you dare sexualize a hermaphrodite.</br>  <br>I tried to find an appropiate reaction image, but I nutted so hard to that last page that I'm still kind of making my cum face so I resorted to this umbreon drawing, please enjoy.<br>Seriously though damn there's semen all over my desk and it's like 6 inches above my dick</br></br>  <br><br>Those SJW's really are trying to ruin everything.</br></br>  <br>YES</br>      <br><br>I really hope that last guy truly is native american.<br><br>i fucking hate SJWs for all their bullshit :/</br></br></br></br>  You are the worst niggers  <br><br>No sir, you are the worst.</br></br>  <br>Calico fag</br>  TURN AROUND, BRIGHT EYES!<br><br><br>I know right, I don't steal bikes or act like a thug<br>I am truly the worse nigger.</br></br></br></br>  <br>NO YOU'RE THE WORST</br>  <br>No I'M THE WORST</br>  <br>At least you stink like one.</br>  <br>oh damn man thats harsh<br>black people smell funny<br>even the clean ones<br>I don't know what it is, they just do</br></br></br></br>  <br>Its like cats</br>  Im pretty sure tumbltard SJWs are worse than anyone else.  <br>Its a mix of barn animal and a fat sweaty guy who baths in sour milk.</br>        <br>underfur b&amp;<br><br><br>Lucarion</br></br></br></br>  <br>come on if you're going to avatarfag can you at least maybe contribute something instead of posting an image with no text? you didn't even bump it, i posted like 30 seconds before you.</br>  <br>yep<br><br><br>There</br></br></br></br>  *ded*  Yes, they're all dead, mwahahahahaha!

I saw like 150 nut punches and I felt like you got done when it was not even 45. But I can't count because light is in the way of the mind. Also I don't care I saw a man change too much into always a killing machine. And that is unfortunate.</br>  <br>Do what? It's just a picture of the naked banana, i know it's a shit meme but it shouldn't freak you out.</br>  <br>Great read.</br>    <br><br>(y)</br></br>  <br><br>Remember this from a while ago. Dog made it out alive :)</br></br>    <br>3/10 <br>Good effort</br></br>  Someone explain this shit to me /b/<br> Trump leading all republican candidates by hefty margin <br>WHY?<br> America is gonna have to decide between Hillary Cunt or Trump?! <br> we fucked </br></br></br></br>  <br>The poll</br>  <br>The current lineup</br>  Mostly because he's comedy gold.<br><br>He's so fucking stupid he's not going to win.<br>Think of it like 4chan raiding a fucking popularity contest and trying to get the potato elected.</br></br></br>  <br>You can't dump the trump! One Ferrari for every white man and one deportation for every beaner!<br> Trump 2016 </br></br>  <br>Good point..<br>It might also be sabotage because it would be a certain victory for Hillary if she goes against him. Every god damn minority is gonna raise hell in the polls against him</br></br>  <br>The same reason they supported Palin: Republicans are Real 'Murricans.</br>  <br>I'm from Europe, please, americans, let Trump become your president. This is just too fucking funny to become reality.</br>  People like Trump because he doesn't go in for a lot of the traditional political newspeak BS. He says what he thinks and gives zero fucks. He is also, ironically, one of the few GOP candidates who doesn't appear to be in the pocket of big business.  <br>But they can't possibly be this stupid. Trump has no real chance to get elected. At least walker or bush have a shot with Rubio as the VP to get Hispanic voters, but god damn the GOP is gonna shoot itself in the foot back to 2008 if they nominate trump</br>  <br>He IS big business you dipshit.</br>  <br>I believe most of America would be fine with that.</br>  <br>Exactly. He's so fucking rich none of the corporations can buy him off.</br>  <br>Sure he gives zero fucks, but as  said, he is what is wrong this country. He's gonna either bankrupt us to Niger levels or he's gonna let anyone who makes less that 100k a year die</br>  <br>at least trump will try to run the gubment like a for profit entity. i said try.</br>  <br>They elected Dubya twice and almost put Sarah Palin 2nd in line to the Presidency, of course they're stupid enough to do this!</br>  <br>Id rather see him over Jeb.Bush for the republicans.</br>  <br>But I dont wanna vote for Hillary :-(</br>  <br> America is gonna have to decide between Hillary Cunt or Trump?! <br> implying Sanders isn't going to beat Hillary </br></br>  Thumb for peresitent 2016  <br>Idk I think bush is moderate enough to be ok. He isn't like W</br>  <br>No, he can just use the office to further enrich himself. Don't be stupid. The wealth gap in this country is greater than it's ever been, the wealthiest few have more wealth than the overwhelming majority, and you want to elect a BILLIONAIRE?!</br>  <br>Sanders is 2016's Ron Paul. <br>He resonates well with the youth and the Internet but old farts won't vote for him</br></br>  <br>Trump is early election pomp &amp; circumstance.<br>He's not the candidate. Bush is.</br></br>  <br> dreams </br>  <br>If he were to get the nomination you cant tell me that he wont be getting advice from W once he gets in. That if he does.</br>  <br>Yeah because Obama did such a killer job closing the wealth gap</br>  TRUMP 2016!<br>TRUMP<br>TRUMP<br>TRUMP<br>TRUMP<br><br>LET THE TRUMPETS BLOW!</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So don't. Vote 3rd party instead.</br>  I gotta be honest nothing is more funny than americans talking about the election like they have a real democracy  <br>Who cares? There's no difference between any of them. They're all neo-liberal shills for the twenty sociopathic families who comprise the billionaire corporate elite who rule this planet.<br><br>"I have this feeling that whoever is elected president, like Clinton was, no matter what you promise on the campaign trail -– blah, blah, blah -– when you win, you go into this smoke-filled room with the twelve industrialist capitalist scum-fucks who got you in there. And you’re in this smoky room, and this little film screen comes down, and a big guy with a cigar goes, 'Roll the film.' And it’s a shot of the Kennedy assassination from an angle you’ve never seen before, that looks suspiciously like it’s from the grassy knoll. And then the screen goes up and the lights come up, and they go to the new president, 'Any questions?'" -- Bill Hicks</br></br></br>  <br>I'm sure that would apply to all republican candidates</br>  <br>Trumpets here we go?</br>  <br>May as not even bother in that case.</br>  <br><br>Actually his claim that he's worth billions is false. In real life, his net worth is like 150 million.</br></br>  <br>It's between Hillary's cunt, the socialist kike from Vermont, or Trump<br>I've been to vegas and saw the trump hotel, if he runs the country like his resort then he's got my vote</br></br>  <br>I'm not gonna waste my vote on the 3% of the popular vote that might very well skew either trump's or cunt's % to win</br>    <br>Trump is leading because everyone knows it doesn't really matter in this early stage and we want to see more Trump before the end<br><br>don't worry about him getting the nomination, he's not even really interested in the presidency, it's a publicity stunt</br></br></br>  <br>True.</br>  <br>Point. Trump is an asshole but the people crying "He rich he gonna bankrupt errybody!" are retards. Every candidate on both sides is rich as fuck and has mega interests in the corporations. At least Trump knows how to manage wealth and grow an economy.</br>  <br>Your choice, man. For me, Bernie Sanders is the only candidate I actually want to vote for. Usually I vote for one person because the challenger is even worse, but Bernie I would happily vote for.</br>  <br>Wow, you americans are so fucking retarded.</br>  We need to be talking more about Ben Carson. <br> I had dinner with the man <br>I know it's hard to believe, but I did. He was campaigning in my area and a select few people had dinner with him. He's incredibly smart and has great plans for entitlement programs and healthcare. He should get elected. Plus, he's black so he will get some of the nigger vote</br></br>  <br> "I have this feeling that blah blah blah <br> sincerely, a pretty good comedian <br><br>k but you know there's not really a conspiracy and shadow government in a smoky room... right?</br></br></br></br>  <br>This is why the two parties continue to rule us.</br>  <br> manage wealth and grow an economy. <br>The president of the united states does not do this, other people do that and the president is blamed/praised by idiots like you for their performance</br></br>  <br>4 billion</br>  <br><br>Wonderful, when government is responsible for so many chargeable natural monopolies (roads, forests, defence, sanitation, water), I sure would love to see a private industry mindset applied there. Don't see every corner being cut and a fortune being charged because no-one has any other choice, no sir!</br></br>  Would rather have Trump than the Clinton's back in office.  <br> Duverger's law <br><br>Again, he's the Ron Paul of 2016</br></br></br>  <br>See<br/></br>  <br>Conspiracy? Yes. Shadow? No. It's all right there in the open. The Trilateral Commission. The Bilderberg Group. The Project for the New American Century. I mean, they don't even bother to hide it. Why should they? They own the world.</br>  <br>That's interesting. Sadly he's not polling too well</br>    <br>Lol. Just lol.</br>  <br>Don't care, he's who I want. Besides, it's different. Paul was marginalized during Republican primary debates, even omitted from some, but Hillary will have to debate Sanders since he's her only Democratic challenger. More people will hear what he has to say, so more of a chance for an upset. Paul had no chance.</br>  <br>Im 200000% behind Carson for pres, hes fucking smart, humble, dedicated, honest, and knows struggle. He was rising in the polls before Trump came in and made everyone else look like chumps.<br><br>The best ticket now would have to be Trump/Carson. Let the trumpets play.</br></br></br>  <br>They are fabulously wealthy. This does not make them as powerful as you might imagine. I think you watch too many movies.</br>  <br>Yeah, and you're why they don't bother to hide it. Anyone with a triple-digit IQ can pop those names into Wikipedia and read that they exist and what they do. Most of the world is now comprised of low-functioning, semi-literate cretins like you, so there's no reason to waste resources on hiding themselves and their activities.</br>  There are nigroids right now, in the south, that pitched a fit about the Confederate Flag, that are going to vote for Hilary  <br>im gonna vote for trump just so that i can say that i did in the future.</br>  <br>Right and the CEO of a company doesn't do anything it's all the board's decisions</br>  <br>Have you purchased your water filtration units and vitamin supplements yet, patriot?</br>  <br> what is an executive office </br>  <br>A CEO doesn't have a Congress or a Supreme Court to deal with.</br>  <br>Don't worry son. A suddenly popular candidate this early before elections never wins or even makes it to the primaries.</br>  <br>A CEO doesn't have a Congress or a Supreme Court to keep him in check.</br>  <br> They are fabulously wealthy. This does not make them as powerful as you might imagine <br>lol</br></br>  <br>alex jones is paid off to make it seem like everyone who listens to him is a conspiracy nut<br>he went on national television and went fucking crazy that they actually had to throw him off the show, course it was all acting but still. I agree with the other anon its people like you that they are able to get away with this shit.</br></br>  <br>FUCK YOU HILLARY!<br>...conservative piece of trash.<br> yes, i know she's technically in the democratic party. fuck you. </br></br></br>  <br> are going to vote for Hilary <br> in the south <br> south <br>k</br></br></br></br>  <br> I agree with the other anon <br>You haven't fooled anyone, samefag</br></br>  <br>Everything except your last statement is correct. Carson is a great man and needs to be president. He also has a legit shot to beat Hillary with the low information niglets</br>  <br>Steep curve for Trump. Not so steeep for Bush. Trump will fall. He will fall.<br><br>So I'd like to see Bush vs anyone but Clinton.</br></br></br>  <br>dear god...<br>it's like a group-photo of a /b/ board meetup</br></br>  <br>lmao wanna check that again?<br><br/></br></br>  <br>Key word, champ, "nigroids".

It's not like the little nigger votes matter anyways</br>  Trump is really stupid don't let want I'm about to say justify anything he says or does, but in his speech he was talking about deporting ILLEGAL Imigrants because Mexico is pushing criminals out of their country and they're coming here, I don't see it as "Oh, lets kick the beaners out." I see it as "What the fuck are you doing here, you're a criminal." but becoming an American citizen shouldn't be as hard as it is today. It's more complicated than what media is putting it out to be, they're twisting his words. Again he's still rude and dumb so I don't know why I'm defending him, I just want to point out the media hopped on that shit real quick.  <br>Economics and Political Science double major who's in law school.

I may be a social invalid, but at least I'm not a weeaboo faggot.</br>  So I've been seeing a lot of threads asking why you don't have several different guns for protection and a common answer was: "Cause I live in a country with strict gun laws". Y'all do realize that all gun laws do is make it easier for robbers? You can't own a gun, but criminals don't follow laws.<br> black market mayun <br>I'd rather enter a fight gun vs gun rather than kitchen knife vs gun. Just a thought.</br></br>  <br> gun related crimes <br> when you make it harder to get guns, people use other things to commit crimes <br> this solves the problem of people being attacked by criminals who could still get guns illegally regardless </br></br></br>  <br>  <br>and the whole premise behind gun control is that you wouldn't need a gun for defense if there weren't so fucking many of them out on the streets.<br>It's true that a buyback won't take guns from criminals - but it will make ownership rarer over time as cops take them away.<br>In the case of the United States of Arms, it's too late. There are too many guns already for the genie to be put back into the bottle.<br>Other countries can manage it because there aren't that many guns per capita to begin with and because other countires don't have so many Americans in them.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> retart </br>  Drawthread.<br><br>delivering to stabbedgirlguy. <br><br>Also, could the guy who asked for a follow-up to the pattycake girls please tell me the request again?
