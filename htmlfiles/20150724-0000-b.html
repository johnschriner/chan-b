[ new celeb thread<br><br>continued from </br></br>  <br>mmm, more Demi<br>I was having a lot of fun in the last thread</br></br>   tfw no Demi to suck me off   Reclaiming  <br> tfw no Demi to watch as she sucks cock after cock and kiss when they cum in her mouth </br>    <br>That's so ironic.</br>  Fav celeb tits       mfw Marina Diamandis is never in these kinds of threads   <br><br>Why not just cut out the middle Demi and pretend to be her?</br></br>          <br><br>So good.</br></br>    <br>Yuck. Get that traitorous cunt out of here.</br>      How the fuck is PewDiePie a fucking multi-millionaire?  He's not.  <br>Because the content he produces is populair enough that ad revenue is up in the millions</br>  Because children are sheep who will follow any and every fad to fit in and feel accepted because being an intellectual, or having any sense of intelligence, automatically makes you an outcast.<br><br>In this day, It's a bad thing to be smart. People are afraid of being smart and so we let idiots with little intelligence, raise our children. As a result, this piece of shit managed to gain a following of stupid children.</br></br>  <br>yes he is he earned roughly 8 million last year</br>  He also traveled around the world while uploading shit, so he's the #1 and on the front page of several countries  <br>Because he isn't American</br>  <br>shut up nerd</br>  <br>He is</br>  <br>he's a faggot</br>  He has an extremely popular youtube channel which shows advertisements to viewers. The advertisers consider people hearing their messages to have a value and pay him (through youtube) for it.   mfw i can't earn shit on the internet   Also gaming companies prolly pay him for a popular reviev.  <br>He's a faggot, but there is nobody who wouldn't do what he does for the money...</br>  <br>He found a niche and manages to get a lot of regular people to watch him. That's why.<br>I thought just the same as you, but he has been on many shows here in Sweden and he is a really nice dude when is steps out of his girly-scream persona.</br></br>  <br>ITT: fat nerds thinking their boring lets play videos filled with niche sarcasm would be more interesting than an average human that can be "enjoyable" to most people.</br>  <br>fedora tier but has a point.</br>  <br>this guy gets it</br>  Search for a movie trailer on YouTube.<br>First 20 results are reaction videos of the trailer.<br>"Please Subscribe" captions all over the videos.<br>YouTube is full of cancer.<br>YouTube "celebrities" need to be punched in face.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Swedecuck found</br>  Because his sister is HOT<br><br>Assuming she isn't fucking niggers</br></br>  ITT a bunch of jealous faggots who have youtube channels that emulate what pewdiepie does because they're unoriginal faggots and wonder why they cant have millions of subs so they resort to insults because they just cant stand the thought of someone other than them being successful.  <br> Swede <br> not fugging nigs </br></br>  <br><br>He's attractive, charasmatic, funny and stays on top of trends. He understands young people and what they need/want to watch. <br><br>To add, he's also G rated. He abstain from using profanities so absolutely no one's parents could forbid their children from watching him, this also makes him a very PC marketing tool for practically any product. <br><br>That's why. y u mirin on Pewdiepie OP. Are you jealous that you don't make $100,000+ a month doing what you love?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't even like jewtubers (too cookie cutter.) but pretty much this. Idk why people get so assblasted that some guy has fun at work.</br>  <br> Charismatic <br> funny <br><br>For a 12 year old</br></br></br></br>  cause he is the best to yell at screen in the world  <br><br><br><br> being this jelly because your own youtube channels get no subscribers. </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>nailed it</br></br>  <br>I'm italian and I don't even follow pewdiefag. <br>Vinesauce is mostly the only thing I care to watch weekly,</br></br>    <br>That's so ironic.</br>  No, but srsly, I don't get it. He is not even a gamer, he is not playing games as they should be played. He just run through to get off with the story asap.  <br><br>norweigan bitcoin miners used a few of them to create fake youtube accounts as shills to get views.</br></br>  <br>WE NEED TO KILL HIM MAGAD https://<span>youtu.be/x47RGE8bW-s  [ ]</br>  <br> didn't know about this guy until south park no surprise wasn't Fred the top youtuber back in the day? the more things change the more they stay the same</br>  have you ever listened to his podcasts? i have and for some reason i'm 100% positive he lurks 4chan (not just /b/, too). he kinda seems much more intelligent than what he shows in his videos. now, i don't watch his solo let's plays (because there are some better channels out there), but it's pretty weird to hate the guy just because he amuses little girls for money and you don't  <br>Nah my area isn't YouTube. It's not hard to get subscribers though if you try.</br>    <br><br>because of your faggot generation<br><br>rather watch someone play a game than play it themselves</br></br></br></br>  <br>do gay porn</br>  <br><br>What's you point?<br><br>Boogie found a niche too, are you jealous of a 500 lbs man that also makes a six figure income off nothing bit YouTube?<br><br>Pewdiepie knows his audience and knows what type of platform he has created for himself online, so he exploits it to the fullest extent. <br><br>If you were that intelligent you would also do it, but you're not, so here you are crying about an Internet celebrity you'll never be as likable as, will never meet AND you're advertising his channel free of charge.<br><br>How does it feel to work for Pewdiepie by proxy of your asspain?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Does it matter? <br><br>I usually play games to try and find glitches or to fuck around the enviroment for fun, I only play a few for the story to be honest.</br></br></br>  <br>Because humanity is filled with retards</br>  i don't get it, he is not funny at all.  <br>And that is the problem, so many babies get mad at pewdiepie because they want to make money too but don't want to do any if the work required.</br>  <br><br> he doesn't do things the way I do <br> he doesn't accomplish every single side quest like an aspie to see that "100% completed" marking next to their game profile <br> why can't I be efamous too <br> why don't people like me <br> why anon WHHHHHYYYY </br></br></br></br></br></br>  ITT: lots of jealous people  <br>Do you honestly believe that the only reason people don't like him is because they're jealous of him?<br>Are you 12 or just retarded?</br></br>  <br>Well he must be to some degree seeing as he has the most subscribers on youtube.</br>  <br>it means you're not a child. i only watched one video by him and it was slenderman or something. exited out faster then that time i opened up german scat porn by mistake.</br>  <br><br>Kek</br></br>  <br>No, I also don't like his videos but I don't make threads about it and bitch about his success, even if you don't like him you have to give him some props on turning youtube into a cash cow.</br>  Once upon a time I enjoyed his Amnesia videos, but the niche he found after that I wasn't a fan of. Glad he's doing well, the real Felix is super humble and down to earth.  <br> I wouldn't do X so nobody is allowed to do it either! </br>  <br>Yes I am jealous. <br>But I bet he can't play guitar alone in his room every night!

It all depends on where we place them. We place our ears at the beaks of our birds, Cersei's ears are on the stone floor as she is plowed by her squire.<br><br><br>I am most curious of his transformation! As you can see I am still human, what has become of Lord Greyjoy if you don't mind me asking?

You heard that right, MY HOUSE!. Guess what the bastard king decided? To make me Roose Bolton legitimized son. It's Bolton now, not Snow. And there is nothing you can do about it,King in the North.<br><br>Speaking of bastards, how is Jon doing? Still freezing his ass off on top of the Wall. I might decide to travel there myself and see if he...really is a Stark after all or not a child his father rather have killed.<br><br><br> Good job in the Robb Stark RP, i like it! <br><br><br><br>i...cut a few things..removed a few others. That much i'll say...he is nothing but a sack of bones, meat and skin now. I must say i am impressed at what i did myself!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It doesn't even suprise me she is fucking her squire. Isn't that the young cousin, the Lannister?<br><br>Oh what did they say again, family above all wasn't it? The Lannisters sure like their families.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Those bastards ruined my life!</br>  I still want to fuck Disgust!  <br>Hah. You'd wonder if they secretly share High Valyrian blood with the Mother of Dragons, you know with ''keeping the bloodline pure'' and all that buggery.</br>  <br>I bet she just loves anal!</br>  <br>I want to be pure with Nepgear! PURE!</br>  <br>I'M AN EMOTION!<br><br>I'M NOT EVEN SOLID! I'M MADE UP OF PARTICLES!</br></br></br>  I decided to make the wincard a little more fancy for giant apple fish.  <br><br>Jon is more man than you'll ever be, Snow! Don't you dare bring him into this...<br><br>My attention is yours, Lord Ramsay. As informative as this has been, I really must be going, but my attention is yours. We will be seeing each other again.<br><br>((Thank you very much! It's been fun interacting with you, again. Can't say I've done that in quite a bit.))</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Aren't we all?</br>  <br><br>Then I'll dick you with a particle dick</br></br>    <br><br>Worth a million bucks from one king to another you have my gratitude</br></br>  <br>Gobby's got your back<br><br> Gobby </br></br></br>  <br>LALALLALLALALLALALALLAA<br><br>I'M NOT LISTENING</br></br></br>  <br><br>Don't try thinking about it. I've come to the conclusion that most people here have a lot more in their heads than us.<br><br>I don't like thinking about it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>A true butcher of the realm. Do tell, is he still breathing?<br><br><br><br>Dispite what others may say, I'm glad I'm not a part of it.<br><br>What a miserable existance it would be, a Lannister without a cock. What is the point?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>More man?! The boy's never been with a woman before, how can you even say that? As much as i enjoy crossing blades and wits with you, Stark. You really...know nothing. <br><br>Now don't run away with your tail between your legs, boy. I was hoping we would...get to know eachother better.<br><br>(( Cya around, buddy! ))</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You don't have to listen, you just have to lay there<br><br>I'll get the particle lube</br></br></br></br>  <br>FEAR!</br>    <br>He is breathing. I sometimes wonder why i keep him around, but despite beign a steaming pile of shit from those rocks they call The Iron Islands....he does have it's uses.</br>  <br><br/></br>  end<br><br><br>But of

I need some advice. Tonight at work I found out (from my brother in law) that my girlfriend of 7 years is wanting to leave me. We have 3 kids together and such, so Im sure it would be a pretty messy split. Im at home now, and seeing as this relation ship is going to end anyway, How should I go about this situation? Should I wake her up and tell her to get out? Should I wait till she leaves me? Shes asleep right now, but will be waking up in 40 minutes. Any advice will be considered. <br><br> pic related. probably what she does while Im at work. </br></br>  <br>Gif related then?</br>  what about,hm<br> talk </br>  <br>lmao if she really does that you must swim in that pu$$y</br>  maybe just talk to her you fucktard  <br>Indeed. <br>bumping with strange porn.</br></br>  S-s-sauce.  Kill kids<br>Sever kids heads, leave at end of bed<br>Wake wife up, let her see kids heads<br>Kill her<br>Make the news /b/ro, all you've got to look forward to is child support and living like a pauper till they're 18 then picking up the pieces of what you have left</br></br></br></br>  <br>Get nudes then leave her</br>  <br>anybody have sauce on this? I never ask, but this is for science</br>  <br>Nice</br>  <br>Very good idea indeed, I second this good sir.</br>  <br><br>I could talk to her. But Im not completely fucked up about the relation ship ending. Its been a rough 7 years. <br><br><br>I do.<br><br><br>Problem is that I like the kids. Cant kill them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why do people insit on having kids if they cant even be happy in a simple as fuck two person relationship is fucking beyond me.</br>  <br> 7 years together <br> implyin he doesn't have nude <br>thank you virgin now you can go back to your favorite anime.</br></br></br>  <br>Start stretching your asshole out now so when her and her lawyer ram their fists up there for the next 18 years at least it won't tear.</br>  <br>you won't care about them when all you have is supervised visits and most of your pay going to your wife's 18 year holiday<br>'Where's daddy'-she can tell them whatever she likes, you're going to be the asshole to them, she'll get custody and all you'll get is seldom contact with kids who won't give a fuck about you after a while<br>Maybe the guy she hooks up with will be new daddy<br>Kill her at the very least</br></br></br></br>  <br>what happens when you are happy? you make love. you do lovely things. you want kids or maybe you just fuck without a condom. you have kids. <br><br>after awhile you end up sharing life with youru children and forget to be lovers. then you grow apart.</br></br></br>  Cut the bitch up to pieces, mince her, make patties out of it, feed her to your kids. Problem solved + free food for kids  <br>First of all talk with your lawyer</br>  <br>We were happy for a long time. Shit just kinda went wrong somewhere.. Its kinda fucking sad to think about it.<br><br><br>Good advice. Doing this now.<br><br><br><br>Killing her is an option.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  you were probably so happy getting laid you ignored everyone pointing out problems along the way. haha you got cucked and wrekt friend.  <br>kill her OP<br><br>After the divorce and being shafted by the courts you're going to feel dead inside. Why not give her the same?</br></br></br>  Don't be a fucking pussy and kill the cunt  Get help and talk, easy. Lose your tension, breath even the world will end tomorrow. Communication is the key. The good the bad the worse, it's going to be Ok.  <br>My favrit anime is Hetalia</br>  <br>Start undermining her now for the court battle. Hide some coke in something of hers. It's a war of attrition now</br>  <br>No divorce. We are not married. But there is about 100k+ is assets that will probably go to her anyway. <br><br><br>As this could be the issue. Its deeper than that. More like i saw the issues that where happening, and didnt really try to fix them. <br><br><br><br>Killing her seems to be the popular option.<br><br><br>I could do that. But in the state Im in, the court almost always give custody to the mom. <br><br><br>Thanks anon..</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How long until things started going wrong? What were the warning signs?</br>  <br>Go try and bang her 20 mins b4 she wakes up post results</br>  OP BE HONEST UOU FAGGOT  <br> Killing her seems to be the popular option. <br>It's 4chan nigga.</br></br>  <br>Dear god sause please</br>  <br>You know man, I wish I fucking knew. To be honest I love this bitch. But one day it seems like we stopped really spending time together. After that, it spiraled quickly. And now here I am... <br><br><br>But its not sunday anon. We only fuck on sundays. <br><br><br>Sure man, I love that cock.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> But its not sunday anon. We only fuck on sundays. <br>Oh my god. I never want to be in a relationship.</br></br>  <br>We never have time any other day. I work monday-saturday at nights. Shes works monday-friday during the day. So sundays the only day we even sleep in the same bed anymore..</br>  <br>No shit the relationship didn't work out...</br>  <br>Your right man. But you have to do what you have to do. I watch the kids during the day because babysitters are stupidly expensive. She puts them to bed at night. Im not happy about it but what else could we do?</br>  <br><br>OP, you have a 16% chance out of 100% to get custody of those children, while your bitch whore of a GF has an 84% chance, even if she's the problem. Maybe try and pull that 'what do the children want' bullshit? I mean, if you want cusotdy of your children, just try and do something..</br></br>  <br><br>It is like that when someone has kids. Without Kids Marriage is bullshit, its basiacally dating</br></br>  <br>16% dosnt sound bad. After the split is official ill go talk to my lawyer about my real life chances. Thanks to all the anons talking to me. Im gona go wake her up now. See what she has to say.<br><br>Cheers /b/ros</br></br></br>  <br> Have fun, OP.<br><br>Don't fuck it up.</br></br></br>  <br>Good luck bro.</br>  <br>It's not, now that you claimed it is on an online imageboard known for risque content</br>  <br>Op do this especially when its true what you say about court and custody.<br>I mean at least its better than killing the mother of your children... I know this is b but dont forget why you started loving her in the first place</br></br>  put the kids with gran for the weekend quit your job take her out on a short holiday get a new job with normal working hours and be a fucking family.  <br>Wow, that's fucking depressing. Do it anyway, you're leaving her. Tell her its why</br>  <br>Fucking post nudes already <br> post nudes faggot </br></br>  <br>Tell us what happened your brothers need to know</br>  <br>Also why my relationship failed. Fucking 2015 economy</br>  <br>don't blame the economy<br><br>you're a shit cunt and boring</br></br></br>  <br>It also helped that I saw her 5 minutes in a week, but okay kid whatever you say</br>  Not sure if anyone is still here, But I talked to her, She got mad and said that she never said that, then stormed out of the house. Im guessing this means that she did say that. Oh well.  <br>Still lurking.<br><br>So back to business as usual or what?</br></br></br>  <br>Good luck. You deserve better.</br>  <br>either change your lifestyle to make it work with her, or dump her ass and follow advice other anons have gave in terms of winning custody and not getting anally ravaged by lawyers</br>  <br>your fault, could've made some time if you truly cared<br><br>shit cunt</br></br></br>  <br>I didn't. Go cry about it</br>  <br>Im going to start looking for a different place to live. I know whats bound to happen so I want to be prepared.<br><br><br>Thanks anon.<br><br><br>Im going to leave her, Just waiting for better timing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>definitely said it <br>tell that bitch toodles</br></br>  What are the pros and cons of having a bike /b/?<br>I'm 19 by the way</br>  <br>it'll have a faggot ridding on it</br>  pro: you have a bike, it's fun<br>cons: it costs money to drive it.</br>  <br>You'll suck more dick while only on half the wheels of a car</br>  <br>A bike is more convenient than a car imo</br>  I own 2 cars and a motorbike (richfag here)<br><br>it's quicker than a car and more fun. that's it. also takes more skill than driving a car.</br></br>  <br>i doubt this,i'm not the guy to judge though,but i think a bike is safer if you're not doing shit like running etc.A car can cause more damage accidentaly.Not only damage to you but to other cars.This is less comon with bikes.</br>  <br><br>samefeg here<br><br>you're less protected on a bike. if you fall off at speed and you're not wearing the right gear you're as good as dead.</br></br></br></br>  Got a 2015 CBR500R as my first bike. I live in a city and let me tell you right now, fuck anyone elses comment in this thread, just listen to me. <br><br>Its amazing.<br>No srs.<br>Straight up gangsta shit.<br>Gets you mad pussy, everyone stares drenched in jelly and the feeling of riding in general is worth dying in a flash cause of some fuckwit in a car that doesn't know how to drive. <br><br>Nothing better m8.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes indeed,but i don't really want to run on a bike,i'm spooked,i want one to move in the city or a bit outside of it.I don't think i'll have speed problems.</br>  <br>No...<br><br>If you fall off a bike at speed, regardless of attire you're basically dead. There's very little coming back from anything head on at 70kmh+</br></br></br>  <br>Did i just fucking get quints?!</br>  <br><br>you must use shit gear.</br></br>  <br><br><br>You can put Monster stickers on EVERYTHING you own because you're a high energy dude.</br></br></br>  <br>Pro: Fun as hell to ride.<br>Con: You're likely not going to see age 20</br></br>  <br>So a car comes at you at 70kmh, you hit it head on. What fucking riding gear known to man will save you?<br><br>Exactly fuckhead.</br></br></br>  <br>There was an incident where i live where a guy fell of his bike at very high speed and just walked away.I don't know if it's true but that's what i heard.</br>  <br>If you were in a car and that happened youd be fucking dead too</br>  It's more fun than anti-depressants.  <br>I don't even have a bike lol<br>I don't even have a driving license</br></br>  <br>Yeah of course that can happen. Nothing being in the way of him sliding and rolling and he can very well fall off at high speeds and live. It would still fuckin hurt.</br>  <br>That can happen. It depends how you hit the road and what happens after.<br><br>If you lay the bike down, don't roll, and don't smash into anything, you can walk away from some potentially nasty hits relatively unscathed.</br></br></br>  <br>That's so ironic.</br>  <br>It's not the bike rider that makes the bike more dangerous. It's everyone else on the road that you need to worry about.<br><br>It's REAL easy to lose a motorcycle in the blind spot of a car.</br></br></br>  <br>Why?</br>  <br>then <br>/thread</br></br>  <br>gtfo of here with your daily motorcycle thread you enormous faggot.</br>  <br>pro: cheap to run, easy to park<br>con: death, can't go shopping on it, have to wear a leather condom</br></br>  <br>pros: speed. cheap. fun. time efficient. porn.<br>cons: injury. hospital. death.</br></br>  <br>Why can't you just ignore the thread</br>  <br>why can't you just ignore the post<br>turn 360 degrees and walk away</br></br>  <br><br>Bikes are fun as fuck just get one and stop bein a faggot.</br></br>  <br>You should always check your blind spots. What the fuck is wrong with people nowadays i swear</br>  <br>And if a truck hits your car at that speeds you're just as fucked. We were making jokes at a fuel tank label on a CBR1000RR that said "improper use may result in injury or death". If you're scared of dying then wrap yourself in bubble wrap and take the bus. You don't need to tell a motorcyclist that it's dangerous, they know and are laughing at them as they don't know how vulnerable they are in their cages.</br>  Depending on the bike<br>Kids think you're cool<br>Stupid bimbos with daddy issues flock around you.<br>Men always want to talk mechanics.<br>Is people curse you</br></br></br></br>  <br>i'm broke</br>  shut up and get a bike  There is usually a practical course you need to take for a bike. <br><br>Just take it, as by the end of the day you will know if you want a bike or not.</br></br>  <br>K you make no sense. We're talking about riding gear. Not some shitcunt story about a fuel tank, or what would happen same scenario a truck vs car.<br><br> Stick to the topic</br></br></br>  you'll smell of gas all the time  Just sold my GSXR1K. <br><br>Too many assholes on the road not looking out for bikes. I've had one too many close calls.</br></br>  <br>The pros: Way more fun than driving a car, Cons: Tempting to neglect speed limitations and proper gear. The first is usually way more essential than the last one.</br>  <br> Cheaper to run than a car (insurance, fuel, maintenance) <br> Easier to cut through traffic <br>buuut<br> Weather can limit your driving time more than in a car <br> less protection <br> you're gunna boil in the summer in full leathers <br> Can only carry one person, and even then weight limited <br> Tiny transport capacity <br> You're fucked if you need medical treatment most of the time </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Cons: You get a bit cold/wet sometimes, You cant carry a whole lot of things unless you go full Indian style.<br><br>Other than that they're great. Buy one. It'll be the best decision you ever make.</br></br>  Pro: shit is fuking awesome, even when you crash, especially if you standup after a crash, with a busted toe, sore as shit hip and nonexistent wrists to move your bike out of the road and pickup loose bits, then go for a little jog to keep warm.<br>Con: not for everyone, expensive as all hell to start off especially if you don't have someone in the family to train you, insurance, life expectancy.<br>If you like it there is no turning back.</br></br>  <br> Weather can limit your driving time more than in a car <br>This ! It is absolutly no fun to ride in the cold or in the rain</br></br>  What's your secret /b/?  <br>sounds a lot like germany</br>  <br>I'm on /b/. Normal is boring.</br>  <br>Hook me up</br>  This is the friends thread!<br><br>ITT, we discuss friends<br>What's the point of having friends?<br>Do you have friends?<br>They're true ones?<br>How can you confirm if they're true or not?<br><br>As for me, no friends anyway</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  My friends are pretty shit, not fun at all, they never understand jokes, they never want to party or even spend money for activities.  <br>Yuh. And that was like three years ago, better to take it than fake it.</br>  <br>Which is freaking weird because the phonemes in english are almost the same as the ones in japanese. I always wondered why japanese english was bad too. <br><br>The average Joe in Korea never, ever, ever uses english except in a classroom. But classroom language is very limiting.<br><br>And companies are impressed by your skills in English if you're going into the industry there, even if your position doesn't need it. My mom scored a perfect score in this english language standard test and she got into HP as a programmer, even when she knew nothing about computers. I think its another cultural thing where they give symbols and a positive connotation to a useless skill. Socially, knowing english is highly regarded. <br><br>You know, I was listening to the korean prime minister a few days ago and he made an interesting point. When questioned about any educational reforms (since korea scored the highest on student suicide rates) about the rigorous and test-based workload, he said that there is no natural resources in korea, so the country has to resort to human capitol, and this is only achieved through their education system. In the short run, its amazing since high test scores can't be argued, but because the student's knowledge are only based towards standardized tests, their actual innovation levels are quite low. <br><br>I'm sure they can talk very fluently using chatting or emails though. It's just the speaking I'm unsure about</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  which one would you?  <br>thanks for helping</br>  <br>that's not the rule, anon</br>    Yo /b/<br><br>I'm having trouble finding music I like.<br><br> Into QOTSA and Royal Blood, that kind of shit. <br><br> inb4 go to /mu/  <br> LISTEN MOTHERFUCKERS EVERYONE IN /MU/ IS A CUNT </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this is fucking awesome.</br>  <br> New Kids On The Block </br>  <br>Same guy, adding to list.<br> Def leopard <br> Blue Oyster cult <br> Rolling stones <br> The doors <br> The who <br> ZZ top <br> Eric Clapton <br> Pink Floyd <br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/629874834#p629880006">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   be me <br>  24 yo neckbeard <br> currently self-employed in parents' basement <br> forced to get a job <br> enlist at the local library <br> assigned to youth section <br> pedophiliaensues.JPEG <br>  6.5/10 at the desk looks at me <br> she must be noting my MyLittlePony pink shirt that I bought for this <br> puts me in the back of the library, behind closed doors. <br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/629879844#p629879844">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  cont<br>Day 2<br><br> arrive at library <br> near closing time, so not very many people <br> "h-how'd you like your f-first day anon?" <br> grunt  <br> she tells me to clean up and push chairs in and shit <br> push chairs in <br> come to an inhabited area <br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/629879844#p629879974">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  please don't it should end here  Rulle 34, starting with some toon MILFS  <br>OP has departed.
