Probably better than YouTube because that is what they are famous for. Try to get places on the body that are usually covered by clothes to make it look lie they are trying to get away with it.  Get feminists involved. I want them to spam pewdiepie as much as the little kids do  <br>Didn't we settle on no pics?<br>It's fake Skype convos and phone transcripts. This has to look good.</br></br>  <br>Perfect idea.</br>  <br>Yes! Do it!</br>  like i said i could leak something on my blog on tumblr and get the feminist pissed so quickly  do you guys think it would work to make a bunch of accounts for youtube to comment and upvote it to leak it to his general audience or would he delete the comments  <br>everyone who will search for the video will know that's fake. try to do a bruise on her forehead, and make it look like it's hidden by the hair</br>  much cawnfuse. How do we get started?  <br>It's being organized on /b/, it's going to be a catastrophe.</br>  <br>If there's a rape hotline or something make it look corrupt like they advised her to be quiet and then feminists will blame patriarchy</br>  <br>Yeah, we need to make it look legit n shit. Anyone can take a pic from the video and compare it to the photoshopped pic. As long as they can't find the sauce (this thread and the other thread) it should look legit.</br>  <br>Do it, no photoshopped pics of his girlfriend, something else.</br>  <br><br>Sry but I have no fake feminist accouts so I can't contribute more then the idea.<br><br>But if you have then spread this news.</br></br></br></br>  they dont have feminist tumblr pages?  <br><br>yes</br></br>  <br>i dont think the cunt even has comments on his vids anymore</br>  <br>i thought he disabled comments? and if we were to do that we need to make a promo vid first</br>  I kinda wanna leak cutiepie with cuts. Its really easy to cover up with make up. If someone says you cant see them in the vid just say its cause of the make up. She did them because of pewdie or something idkk  Leak it on tumblr and it angers them because violence on chicks and cuts. 2 Things to start the flame  <br>Just checked. He re-enabled comments. You're welcome.</br>  <br>Pewdiepie pressures her to do things she doesn't want to do so they can keep up appearances. It's all smoke and mirrors.</br>  <br>QUADS CONFIRM</br>  icloud leak? take audio clips from pewdie and cutipeies vids saying fuck you bitch and im gonna kill you and crying. then it could be in the dark so you could barely see anything but u kind of can  <br>it would have to be done on his girlfriends page like ask her if its true that she got beaten then link the images</br>  <br>Yea cint disabled them<br><br><br>Idk I hope they do</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Quads and dubs in the same thread.<br>Fuck me.</br></br></br>  Can someone photoshop cuts on this photo? Its her arm and just throw a blank and white filter.  alright guys so are we agreeing on a promo video to stur things up? like remember when keemstar did that faze noodlz bullying is not trolling video? we could do a no domestic violence video for pewdiepie    the pics arent the greatest idea guys because it will be debunked so fast  If anyone wants to fake a transcript, the UK rape whatever is rapecrisis.co.uk  <br>Sounds solid, but a lot of work.</br>  link to previous thread?  <br>agreed. I reckon do a promo vid or a faked phone call.</br>  <br>we can bang it out tonight and post today or tommorow</br>  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;626130097 </br>  <br>Wgat Is Operation TBD? Havent been on for a while.</br>  <br>operation take down pewdiepie</br>  we need to start it off with icloud video i think  Alright here is the full detailed plan.<br><br> We make a fake phone transcript(no pics for now) <br><br> We start sharing the transcript on some shit tier media channel. <br><br> We also share it on tumblr. <br><br> Now we take good unsausable pics and shop it a little(just a little, this is important so they won't understand its photoshop) and start to wait <br><br> ..... <br><br> profit? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's brand new Op<br>To Be Determined</br></br>  <br>like it</br>  <br>Sounds good</br>  So first we hit Tumblr and from there we should make a YouTube promo video pretending to be something like a small tabloid newspaper on the internet? Masquerading as the media company even if it is unreliable should give some credibility.  <br>Yes.</br>  Ok, we have to work fast reddit and newfags love to leak shit and ruin good plans for upboats like a bunch of fucking homos.  <br>exactly. please everyone keep us updated on where to post on tumblr</br>  Even if they find out its fake the shitstorm will be so great it will last for a week or so. Also feminists never forget.  <br>where would they leak it? what subreddit</br>  <br><br>while you guys do that, ill start making a cola + silver jewlery in microwaze pic lol</br></br>  <br>Just post any old shit story about it on tumblr, doesn't have to be convincing.<br><br>It's the comments where you get them.<br>People have to comment to it saying she brought it on herself, or she probably deserved it.<br><br>They'll be so intent on trying to attack you for saying that, they won't even question if it's real or not.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>lets do this</br>  <br>/r/aww</br>  <br>i don't know, the fuckers have probably got a few subreddits dedicated to leaking shit</br>  <br>dont even waste your time its so stupid lol</br>  <br>probably pewds subreddit or whatever the fuck he has</br>  <br>roll</br>  <br>How many people want to clean silver jewellery?</br>  We need to choose our tumblr tags quickly and we need to get an official codename for this operation to maintain the secrecy. We only have so much time before the redditfags find us.  <br>i checked that no posts for 17 hours</br>  are we gonna post links in the comment to the sound cloud and transcripts? and then use fake accounts to upvote and agree/say shit like she deserved it  stopdomesticviolence  <br>if you want feminists to find it, do shit like #antirape or #feminism</br>  keeping an eye on leaking subreddits  <br><br>We need Pewdiepie's name in it so we can quickly find it</br></br>  #pewdsisnotavictim  #slutshaming #Yesallmen #thisiswhyIneedfeminism #Didsheaskforit<br>#antifeminsm #femininsm</br>  stoppewdie  <br>4chan one</br>  <br>Sounds good.<br><br>What are we calling this op then?</br></br></br>  <br>Stop The Pie</br>  oh and #feminism is what we are targeting  <br>I love it</br>  <br>The poster of this plan more detail. This is what the phone call will be about.<br><br>Pewds sounds angry, becouse martz cheated on some nigger. So at first he says that how could she, cheat on him.<br>  What are yu talking about? <br>Shut up whore I know what you were doing on thuesday<br> Well its non of your fucking business. I was confused(or some shit) <br>Shut the fuck of bitch.... bla..blabla.. you will regret this</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  CakeIsBetterThanPie  <br>So the official codename of this operation is "Stop the Pie" agreed?</br>  <br>sounds good</br>  #youtubeispatriatchy #shutdownyoutube  Bump  Operation <br>S.T.P. Stop The Pie is a go.</br>  <br>no cheating. what about he was angry from a video game and punched her. the news will eat that up</br>  <br><br>Too fucking obvious. Something without his name in it.</br></br>  <br>Loving the first tag</br>  <br>That could be a little much.</br>  <br>STP for short</br>  Fuck the sweeds  <br>Could make it leaked by an NSA employee then have feminists tag #yestoNSA</br>  Ask someone with two abscesses anything.  <br>How bad do they smell?</br>  <br>I also want to know this</br>  can you put your dick in those and make them bigger? if can, pics  Think me and my buddy could fit our cocks in there?  what's your favorite flavor of pop tart?  <br>They dont smell at all.</br>  Did you drain them yourself or puss out  What's it like having a beard?  <br>How did you manage this?</br>  <br>Can you finger them? How does it feel? Favorite food?</br>  <br>How the fuck did you get holes in your arm ?</br>  How does that happen? Spider bite or something?  <br>Not OP but, pretty great</br>  <br>Miss a vein?</br>  <br><br>Fuck they probably could. Come and fuck em man.<br><br> <br>I would say cherry<br><br><br>I drained them myself. This is the first outbreak ive had in over a year and a half. I went probably two years with infection/ abscesses every other month. Total was probably 33 infections in the two years.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  i feel like that'd feel good now  <br>I love my beard. I just trimmed it though :/<br><br><br>I have mrsa</br></br></br></br>  <br>where do you live an how'd you get mrsa?</br>  <br>It does. I cought it early and shouldnt have opened them up but i cant take the pain. Its gotten to the point to where if it sets it I literally passout from the pain</br>  <br>How does it feel to be a weak little bitch who needs to post shit like this on a Swazi charas production technique sharing platform?<br><br>I had an abscess on my cock and it got surgically removed so I have a big scar on my dick left. Only + is that my dick became significantly thicker, 'cause it swell and kept the swollen.</br></br></br>  <br>I caught that shit recently<br>Shit sucks. Had boils all over my balls and an abscess between my ballsack and thigh<br>Went away with antibiotics but I'm sure it'll be back eventually</br></br></br>  <br>I live in illinois. My twin brother was hit my a drunk driver when he was like 15 right in front of me and from the accodent he only got a broken leg. Later he had an infection and it turned out they didnt clean the wound well enough and he contracted mrsa. I got it from him.</br>  <br>Its a superbug we most likely have it for life. The only thing we can hope for is a remission</br>  <br>wow, thanks dude.. &amp; godspeed.</br>    <br>So it's like the flu? You can get it simply by standing next to someone who has it?</br>  <br><br>Need to learn to shoot up nigger...</br></br>  Put sharpies in these poopers  You a heroin addict m8?  <br>No skin to skin contact or if someone was touching an object that had it.</br>  <br>is it real that 2 is better than 1?</br>  Not OP but, Anyone can get this its travels through skin to skin contact or from someone touching an object that has it. Causes boils and pus pockets under the skin. Its antibiotic resistant and is hard to cure. You could get this even by going to have surgery (Staph infection)  <br>Where you from?</br>  <br>dude said illinois</br>  <br>in what country, here in mine we don't have those unless if you are rly dirty or have a dirty wound almost healed</br>  <br>Shit fuck. So what do you do in your everyday life? Are you in quarantine or something?</br>  I work in a hospital and have plenty of patient contact. I'm deathly fucking afraid of catching this and/or VRE or any of the other superbugs making the rounds. I no doubt have both already because most infection control isn't all that effective. I've handled patients and their belongings without proper PPE and then been told an hour or two later they actually have MRSA or something worse. I'm assuming it's like this across the board. Thankfully I havent had anything like OP, but I'm waiting for the day.  <br>Where is here in yours? I am talking about the united states like i said 2 in 100 carry this read about it. It lives in your nose . you can be a clean person does not matter</br>  <br>can happen anywhere</br>  <br>Had a mrsa infection but it ate away my heart valve and I had a stroke and emergency open heart surgery. Those look nasty as fuck though.</br>  <br>im not OP i was explaining what it is</br>  <br>feels man hated dealing with it when they came in cause honestly didnt want to be exposed either. Yea i was always told afterwards they had vre or c-diff or even TB damnit</br>  <br>Yep exactly</br>  I wanna do you in every hole you got?  Keep them clean man, hopefully they can find a antibiotic that works or it goes into remission sorry bro  <br><br>do you have abscessive compulsive disorder?</br></br>  MRSA only affects people with AIDS &amp; denial  <br>kek</br>  <br>I understand this. No MRSA but I've gotten some crazy cysts before. Had one in my armpit that got to be golf-ball sized and the pain was so intense I had to get at that fucker with some pliers and a blowtorch.</br>  <br>wrong sir, the strain itself in antibiotic resistant. so if someone brushes up against say you that has it. and yes you would most likely get it. would that mean you have aid and are in denial by your logic?<br><br> http://www.medicinenet.com/mrsa_inf<wbr>ection/page4.htm</wbr></br></br></br>  <br> relying on the patient's honesty <br>Top kek man<br><br><br>This is why we isolate every incoming patient, make some tests and only if they show negative, the patient will be taken to a regular room. No entering iso room without protective suit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>if your in a ER you don't find out till after test or after wards (medical records come in from other facility). why would you isolate every patient if they dont show symptoms?</br>  <br>Nah man, I'm low tier, relying on clinical staff and/or ambos to tell me what's up. protective suit and multiple iso rooms? what fucking cashed up hospital do you work in?</br>  <br><br>If you are healthy and have no AIDS, you dont really need to worry.</br></br>  <br>because you never know, man.<br>and fuck house, but everyone lies.</br></br>  <br><br>Bullshit, you need a severly damaged/ineffective/disabled immune system to get MRSA. Thats why almost none of the hopsital workers get it, although they spread it to other patients.</br></br>  <br>Most patients are old and have some some kind of ulcera anywhere on the body, lots of lungers. People tend to be ashamed of the germs they carry and lie about them, if they even know. Here in Germany, 30.000 people a year die from infections they acquired in hospital. So it's regulated that we have to.</br>  <br>Not possible man like buddy said what cashed up hospital do you work at? and second they wouldn't allow you to just start isolating patients that come in showing no symptoms of it or thats not their initial complaint . just not feasible</br>  I had an infection on the front of my leg, in the thigh. If I was to lay down, it would be facing up.<br>I took the lid from a Mason jar, which is like a ring with an open center, and placed it on my leg as I was lying down.<br>I filled the lid, which was open in the center, with Puell.<br>I let it sit for a good hour.<br>I removed the lid and hopped in the shower.<br>I rinsed off the area where the thick layer of Purell had been soaking into my skin.<br>The skin was a much lighter shade than the surrounding area, and it itched considerably.<br>After a vigorous scrubbing in the shower, the infected area was painful and had a bright red color. However, the infection that had been bothering me for sooooo long was still there, and as a matter of fact it got much worse.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This<br>I have actual staph from after Katrina and can verify the only time it even breaks out is if you have an open wound and don't clean it for weeks.<br>Op is dirty confirmed</br></br></br>  <br>I am not the other anon.<br>I am just saying that you should be careful all the time, because people do lie.</br></br>  <br>horse shit guy i just gave you a fucking reference. i never got it and worked in a medical facility because of PPE. Staff is in most people nose its dormant</br>  This looks like some kimd autoimmune disorder, not mersa. You might want to see a demitologist instead of any normal doctor to really confirm it.  <br>You don't need aids to get it</br>  <br>Should have done the Chinese cup trick and sucked the shit out</br>  <br>not here and not full isolation man, what sort of hospital setting you work at? like i said if its not a inpatient one then i hardly doubt germany isolates every patient that walks into a ER</br>  <br>Do you know what an autoimmune disorder even is I feel like this post was bait because of how awful it was</br>  <br>I always am careful.. Im fully aware people lie</br>  <br>Why haven't you done something about it? like you know doctors and shit. because im sure the trashmen fucking love your highly infectious paper towels and shit hanging around in their rounds.</br>  Eh thats right you can only get this if you have aid or you are dirty love all the disinformation going on around this shit. let this thread fucking die.  <br>Its fucking MRSA retard, he's clearly been to a doctor about it, there isn't much you can do.</br>  <br>come on be nice he had doubles</br>  That shit went around in the locker room back at my highschool, except everybody went to the doctor so that shit didnt happen  <br>Too bad he has a single digit IQ</br>  How deep can you stick something inside there? And does it hurt?  <br>na remember the other know it all faggots in here said you only get that if you have aids or you are a dirty fuck. really</br>  <br>I'm sure there's a way to keep it from actually showing up on the skin surface to be spread. I understand its a fucking virus you cuck.</br>  <br>You're an idiot.</br>  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methi<wbr>cillin-resistant_Staphylococcus_aur<wbr>eus<br><br> possible contribution to the increased spread of MRSA infections comes from the use of antibiotics in intensive pig farming.  <br> A 2008 study in Canada found MRSA in 10% of tested pork chops and ground pork;  <br> a U.S. study in the same year found MRSA in the noses of 70% of the tested farm pigs and in 45% of the tested pig farm workers. <br><br>That's it. I'm going full muslim.</br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr>  <br>you know its funny, I actually hate the way pork taste. and im about as white as you can get. been living most of my life full mudslime..</br>  I got this years ago.<br><br>All over my arm, ass, and legs.<br><br>Praying it doesn't come back. Good luck, OP.</br></br></br></br>  <br>. Also blame the retards who don't finish their antibiotics! Dubs</br>    <br>MRSA in her butt? i mean what</br>  May you all get MRSA and VRE in and around your genitals.
