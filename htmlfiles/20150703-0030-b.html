Freaking mosquitos hitting the windshield</br></br></br></br>  I drive a Mazda 2, manual, which looks a lot like this one.<br><br>It's a very sensitive motor that will stall very quickly if you don't handle it like a princess; as a result, I tend to stall when I'm nervous and handling new situations, like roads I don't know, specifically city complications with shitloads of traffic lights and selections. Other than that, doing great and generally enjoying it, despite the years of traumatic training (financially traumatic, that is, way over 8k dollars).</br></br>  <br><br> What do you drive? <br>.......... my mother crazy.</br></br></br>    Yamaha R6 <br> Manual <br> love it <br> niggers/ spics and soccer moms </br></br></br>  <br><br> 1. What do you drive? <br>Mazda 2<br><br> 2. Manual or automatic? <br>Manual. I fell to peer pressure and assumed I'd not be a real driver unless I drove manually. Later, I also preferred being in full control of my vehicle, despite the annoying stop/go in traffic jams.<br><br> 3. Do you like driving? <br>In general yes, but I get super stressed out if things go wrong. I got anxiety issues.<br><br> 4. What are some problems you have driving? <br>Other drivers. Those who don't indicate before taking a turn. Stress over new roads, starting uphill, parallel parking up or downhill, mostly due to my car's low tolerance and weak engine. Car does very badly uphill on a highway, too. Virtually no acceleration.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   I drive a van <br> my problems is that i always want to get people inside of it </br>  <br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/J2hxOEmXPrw  [ ]</br></br>  <br>BMW 530D (2011)<br>Auto<br>Yes<br>It's automatic and not half as a fun as my old petrol BMW.</br></br></br></br>  <br>petrol = manual.<br><br>2early4me</br></br></br>  <br>1.Nissan B17<br>2.CVT<br>3.I hate it more than anything else in the world<br>4.

I have an actually decent car so yes it is.<br>4. p plate hatchback drivers (aus)<br>Car is same year model but not mine</br></br></br></br>  I drive in Switzerland. Tell us about your rules per country.<br><br>Here:<br><br> 50kmph inside a town <br> 30 when heavily populated by pedestrians <br> 80 on country roads <br> 120 on highways <br><br>I know Germans don't have a speed limit on highways. A German friend told me he casually drives at 150, which is insane to me, as you can't drive anywhere at this speed here. I've literally never driven this fast.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>In the UAE (Dubai for those who don't know):<br><br>  60 kmph in most city areas or where a speed limit is not indicated. <br>  40 kmph in most slow areas <br>  100 to 120 kmph on highways <br><br>However, it's known to everyone that the 'real' speed limits here are actually +20 everywhere. So pretty much everyone drives 140 on highways, or even higher when they know where the radars are.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ausfag here<br>50 kmh in residential areas<br>40 in school zones during school hours<br>100 on urban highways<br>110 on country highways</br></br></br></br></br>  1993 Acura Legend/2003 BMW 325CI<br>Both Manual<br>Love Driving<br>Acura is like sitting in a fish bowl (no tints).</br></br></br>  2007 ford fiesta ST 150<br><br>Manual<br><br>Driving is probably the thing I enjoy most in life, it centres me.<br><br>The clutch pedal on my car can be a real bitch, especially when you first set off in first when the engines cold, you need to get the balance *just* right or you will end up stalling or bunny hopping. It's kinda funny whenever I take the car in for work the first guy who gets in it always stalls it, without fail no matter how much I warn them lol.<br><br>Also I think the gearbox is starting to go a bit iffy now, it occasionally feels a bit clunky going into 3rd and 4th. And reverse has always been a bastard to get into as it has no syncro with the other gears. Fiesta STs in general could really do with a 6th gear for motorways, it gets a bit old cruising at 4k revs at 70 after a while.<br><br>The suspension is very stiff.<br><br>It's too expensive to tax for the size of the car (£225 a year), insurancee is pretty ridic too.<br><br>Police seem to profile my car a lot, been followed countless times since I've owned it.<br><br><br>Picture is just one off google coz I'm on my phone, but mines the same colour minus the side stripes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  1. 2010 Chevy Malibu (I know it's a bitch car)<br>2.

When you have two lots per series, I drive through one to get to the other. The point is to avoid having to go backwards. Supermarkets often have parking lots like this and they're full of tiny kids too small to be seen going backwards.<br><br>Anyone else does this?<br><br>I do this at work too.

Do you like driving? <br>I love it, especialy mountain roads or country roads.<br> 4. What are some problems you have driving? <br>I have troubles while driving in busy city. Where I am people with motorbikes and bikes pass by your right AND your left at the same time. And with that fucking heat thoses days I'm losing my mind.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Obviously a cunt who has not posted his car but is shitting on other cars here eh ? <br>I'm upgrading to a F30 after summer so that's that.

What a poor piece of shit. My work truck cost more than both of those shitty cars combined you pussy. You probably lease that piece of shit too.</br>  <br>Petrol not always manual</br>  <br>if you don't do this out of pure laziness alone your IQ is sub 100</br>  <br>britbong here btw<br> What are some problems you have driving? <br><br>Oh boy...<br>- People who drive big vehicles like vans (usually with no sort of business related markings) and block everyone's fucking view at junctions<br>- People who don't bother to indicate at roundabouts<br>- Lorries trying to overtake other lorries on motorways. Taking them 5 fucking years and causing the outer lanes to have to slow down to the point where the whole concept of a motorway is out the window.<br>- People who can't use their fucking heads to decide which lane they need to be in, so they switch lane last second. I deliberately don't let these people in. They will learn one day.<br>- When approaching most roundabout, a single lane road will split into two for people going in different directions. However there is always some twat that will drive in the middle of both lanes, halting anyone who wants to be in the right half of the lanes.<br><br>Whilst it's a cliche as fuck stereotype, literally everytime something like the above, minus the lorries and vans, has happened to me, it always turns out to be a fucking woman driving the car.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So what do you drive?</br>  1991 Proton Saga<br>Manual<br>Yes<br>Car is a piece of shit that will stall randomly and the rev counter doesn't always go</br></br></br>  Currently a street legal yz426 but will show precious car in next pic, I daily a 2009 ford focus the rest are toys  <br>1.

Always Manual <br> Do you like driving? <br>Love it My favourite thing to do<br> What are some problems you have driving? <br>Police, speed limits and other people using the road</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>1 fiat 600<br>2 manual duh<br>3 yes<br>4 in this particoular car the clutch is a little stiff making it sometimes to sprint too much in first gear</br></br></br></br>  <br>its just common sense, as is passing only in the left : not passing on the right unless its at an intersection sub 10km/h creeping over a left turner, staying in the right side of the lane, holding 10 m back, stopping 3 car lengths before stop if you are first car there and rolling up as traffic builds behind you, turning your tires into a hill when you park....<br><br>then you get to country driving like where i was raised where courtesy overcomes personal safety, i.e. pull into oncoming lane to turn left so that others behind you dont slow, tractor antics, dodgeing horseshit, gravel roads @ 150 has its own etiquette with accords to visibility....<br><br>i wish i could drive a land train in ausfailia :( <br><br> driving is nice because its a skill that can always be improved and is easy to judge others based on, there is argueably nothing more dangerous we do around each other than driving, i am hellishly critical and enjoy it.<br>im beginning to get mechanical as ive always been a pc tech. cabin blower is up next on my todo :)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>- I drive a Silvia and a Levin<br>- Both manual, but nothing against auto<br>- I love driving<br>- people that don't indicate have to be one of the most annoying things</br></br></br></br>  <br>1. 2001 Acura TL <br>2.

Just had it rebuilt after 103,500kms because the second clutch pack failed along with the clutch basket which cracked. Full rebuild ran me $4500nzd with an extended mechanical warranty for a year. Aside from that, really nice car. <br> dat comfortable sedan ride </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Police, speed limits and other people using the road <br>this is what i believed in my first 6 months of having a licence too</br></br>  1. 1996 Nissan Skyline R32 GTR<br>2.

Fucking stop/go traffic and any sort of hill starting, car has a heavy duty twin plate 6 puk clutch and big cams which make any driving under 2000rpm feel like im riding one of those mechanical bulls.

I bouht it to cary my kayaks and bicycles, and at the time, lower my car payments so I could easily afford a motorcycle. I do enjoy the motorcycle, however, it's time I get something a little more exciting. I traded in my sport standard, a GSX650F, for something my wife would go on (this bike). However, it turns out she barely comes with me anyway. I'm thinking FJR1300 for next bike.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>lol get chopped cunt</br></br></br>  <br><br>Would swap gf for car / 10</br></br>  <br>I'd put my FJ up against any of the shit you drive but you probably cry just going over a curb.

Install leftist govt's and then the people who lent all the money (and are expecting it back) will loose big time. With the additional kick of the left rising at the same time, hopefully putting an end to the whole privitise the profits and nationalise the debt practices of the last 20 - 30 years. <br><br>The fact is that as it stands the Troika of lenders is trying to force Greece to sign up for severe austerity until 2030 at least.

Is the same true of Spain?</br>  <br> Can't just jump on at the top you have to work your way up so. <br>lazy fuck.</br></br>  <br> being this economically illiterate. </br>  <br>It is a requirement of the field it helps current paper to come out quicker as the original authors have less work to do alone and allows the skills of the team helping them to be appreciated and therefore more respected in the community. If you think the scientific community would be better off without this practice you must be bait.</br>  <br> corruption under control <br>dipshit, greece is super corrupt, they steal EU money by not paying it back.</br></br>  <br><br>Ok don't read the summary read the doc. itself. <br><br>It makes the same point. That the Greeks are fucked even if they do what the lenders are suggesting. <br><br>Who in their right mind takes a painful 15 year path to get to the same point they could get to by Monday next week? <br><br>https://www.documentcloud.org/docum<wbr>ents/296384-greece-dsa.html</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I'm surprised no one saw that coming. Especially the finance people :<br>Greeks will always fuck you in the ass. Filthy homos.</br>  <br>I'm spanish and I do not undestand why does hate in between Eurofags an Amerifats exist. Holy fuck people are retarded.</br>  I want the<br><br>UNITED STATES OF EUROPE<br><br>and i want it<br><br>NOW<br><br><br>VIVA EUROPA</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Spain suffered from a spectacularly large boom and bust in its construction industry. It had little sovereign debt before the crisis so the situations are quite different.  <br> Pussy PC detected </br>  <br>good point<br>seeing as part of the reason they're in this position is because everyone there is tax evading</br></br>  <br>Kek</br>  I would read but freedom disallows that.  <br>Always easier to tackle the enounciator than the facts right ? Oh Britain, you'll never change</br>  <br>Scandinavia here, best countries in the world, socialism is great, you should try the military, roads, hospitals, great products of socialism.</br>  <br> pay your damn taxes and stop being lazy shits. <br> they work <br> lazy shits <br>you still think the government generates prosperity, don't you? fucking commie</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nope. The blame is two fold, but it mainly rests upon the people of Greece.<br><br>Their leaders lied to get in, fudged budget reports and documents in order to get in. And the Greeks encouraged this.<br><br>The Greek system was designed to fail. Tax dodging is seen as a art, leading to lower revenues. Then Greeks retire at 50, receiving 3/4 of their annual wage an a pension. Greece is the family member you have who lies to get more money, does everything possible to ruin their life, then gets mad when the family refuses to enable their habits any further. Fuck Greece, they deserve every economic trouble that befalls them. Ireland, Span and Portugal have at least tried. <br><br>Ultimately this proves that the Euro and the EU is a failure. The fact that people let a Coal and Steel union between Benelux countries and Italy, France and Germany become what it is today proves how far Europe has fallen. The EU is now trying to take a football club to court for using a stadium they bid for in an open market.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I feel envious of you faggots. I wish I had been born there instead of Spain.</br>  <br>this man is right</br>  <br>everything funded by 100+ years of free markets</br>  <br> &gt;swedecucks </br>  <br>Britain in general doesn't think this, only children and those that dont understand the situation like chav scum.<br><br>Greece has been fucked over. €240 billion in loans and less than 9% of that actually went to the Greeks. The rest went into Greek PRIVATE banks, not public banks but private banks who the re-routed over €120 billion back into other PRIVATE EU and London based banks. The Greek public have been made liable for its private banks losses, much like has happened in the rest of southern Europe and Iceland.<br><br>Greece needs to do what Iceland did. They are the only country that managed to get out of the fake debt trap and they debased their economy in 18 months. What did Iceland do different? Instead of bailing out the private banks with money that would then have to be paid back by the public they prosecuted the fraudulent bankers and allowed the economy to go bust and start again. Greece needs to do this, might be hard to start with but it's the difference between 2 years of poverty or 30-50 years of poverty by staying in the euro.<br><br>Also Spain, portugal Italy and then France are next.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The fact of being a co-author is not wrong at all. However being a co-author for the sake of easy citations is wrong. Very wrong, no matter what other scientists do. Scientists are schooled for independent thinking. Following the 'everyone else is doing it, thus so do I' mentality does not fit this perspective of schooling.</br>  <br> enounciator <br> Enunciator* </br></br>    <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bache<wbr>lor_of_Liberal_Studies</wbr></br>  <br>Almost the were told to lie by the EU and we're appointed a special team by goldman sachs to fiddle the books. The EU needed Greece more than Greece needed the EU. If they didn't pull Greece in Greece would have done the deals with Russia instead and the EU and US really didn't want that.</br>  <br>What I'm saying is more along the lines of they are going to go broke anyway. So why make them suffer for 15 years before hand?<br>Why ruin a country? <br><br>If you make a country horrible to live in then people who can will leave (read as people with economic means) so when they leave the money goes with them (read their contribution to the country's finances).<br>So make conditions worse, income decreases, makes conditions worse, income decreases. <br>Then they go broke anyway and nobody gets anything back. <br><br>Or restructure the debt, then people can meet in the middle. The lenders get most of their money back, the Greeks don't endure as much misery. <br><br>Regarding the 0% tax, yeah that's bad, some corrupt people at the top dodged some tax, why make all the poor / middle class / most of the upper class suffer for 15 years for that? I don't understand who wins except the bodies that lent the money (the ones who can afford to loose it)<br><br>I mean its virtually banks deciding the politics of a society here. Given that a lot of first world countries have very high levels of national debt, that is a worrying precedent.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kek, creative</br>  <br>for FUCK's sake<br>when are people going to learn that austerity is for times of prosperity.<br><br>greeks need stimulus like my country (australia) had. we came out of the GFC on top.<br><br>you don't hit the economy with constriction you hit it with incentive.<br><br>how well has austerity been working for greece and spain and portugal... SHITHOUSE!<br><br>meanwhile australia has come out with one of the best economies in the world. <br><br>keynes FFS.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>and we germans love scandinavia just for one reason: we deeply and truely believe that scandinavians are the better aryans and therefore racially superior.<br>that is the simple truth behind the flooding of our TVs with shitty scandinavian series.<br><br> fuck you scandinavia (especially you, denmark! we haven't forgotten, man. we haven't forgotten --- not you finland. you are cool. you've got guns) and keep on chewing your dried fish. <br> just fuck you <br><br><br> viva europa </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sorry fam we don't have fake bachelors in my country</br>  <br>It's not easy citations you only get cited and your work included if the original author accepts your work. Meaning your work must be up to the same standard as the original authors requirements.<br>Not easy citations dude...</br></br>  <br>lel, it's funded by taxes moron</br>  <br> finland <br> cool </br></br>  <br>France is the second leading economy after Germany, it won't fall if Germany doesn't</br>  <br>This.</br>  Puto Albert Rivera y puto Pablo Motos. Sabía que la gente es imbécil y se iba a creer las mierdas que dicen en ese puto programa.<br><br>El muy hijodeputa miente como un bellaco, cualquier cosa con tal de atacar al PP y pillar algo de votos. Luego no pasa nada, se pacta y a tomar por culo.<br><br>El cabrón llegó a decir que no debemos presionar a Grecia porque nosotros estamos en la misma situación y pedimos un rescate y blahblahblah... lo que el hijodeputa no dice es que nosotros hemos tenido un gobierno con dos cojones que ha hecho LO QUE HABÍA QUE HACER y pagado el precio en popularidad y en votos, y que con nuestro esfuerzo (subidas de impuestos, recortes sociales, todo eso que cabrea a los de izmierdas) NO SOMOS COMO GRECIA. Grecia pide dinero como el que va al banco y se niega a presentar aval, nómina ni pollas. Dinero, y rápido, o lloro. Nosotros hemos hecho lo que teníamos que hacer, que no ha sido agradable, pero era necesario. Y eso es gobernar, hacer lo necesario para asegurar el futuro.<br><br>Pero como este es un país de gilipollas, somos capaces de votar al coletas para que empiece con la demagogia de mierda y tire a la basura el esfuerzo que YA HEMOS HECHO.<br><br>Ojalá Grecia se siga hundiendo, y no lo digo por despecho. Ojalá la situación sea tan claramente mala que hasta el más gilipollas de España pueda ver que votar a un rastrero hijo de puta que promete lo que no puede cumplir y que es más chulo y listo que nadie es una sentencia de muerte. Si no, estamos jodidos.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;some people dodged tax <br>no. its the law in greece. shipping companies are the richest companies in this shitty country. they pay 0% tax. hence no money to spend. simple as that. <br>THE GREEK did ruin their county. nobody else. not all of them, only their corrupt elite. but it sure wasnt the other euro countries.</br></br></br>  <br>Hola. Donde esta la bibliotheca?<br><br><br> BABEL </br></br></br></br>  <br>Greece did live on credit, spending money everywhere. Low retirement age the whole way.<br>Just shoving the letters from loaners asking for their money back under the sofa. Until there wasnt room under the sofa anyway and the letters came pouring out.<br><br>Then it became obvious on how much credit they've been living.<br>Previous governments screwed the Greek over royally.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>People with a scientific degree here are still supposed to write proper articles and reports.<br><br>Write like that here, in English while it is not even our native, and you'll get slapped in the face and laughed at. Scientific degree isn't a reason to be lazy and just fuck it. It's a very good reason to show your degree is actually worth something and that you can also communicate properly besides doing awesome stuff.</br></br></br>  <br>This guy gets it!</br>  <br>That image, it needs another line:<br><br>"can't pay<br>Won't pay<br>gib money"</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Closest via distance you dense piece of shit.</br></br>  <br> Ich habe es nicht gewusst. <br>EU should've slapped earlier. But if your retirement age is like 5-10 years earlier than other countries, life is cheaper and whatnot, you might ask yourself: "Hmmm is this going to work out financially?". Especially when choosing a new government.<br><br>You can't fully pull the 'I didn't know and we inherited it only' card. It happened while you were there and not much questions were asked, if any at all. Then you get the consequences.<br><br>The EU should've noticed earlier too though. Could've been seen years and years in advance.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Also a huuuuge number of those unemployed people its surviving with underground economy. (Jobs with no contract)</br></br>  Greece, italy, spain all of those countries are scumfags who don't give 2 shits about the EU helping them out.

They don't need public money, they have their own. <br><br>So I don't get why you want to see everyone in Greece (except the people who caused it) punished.<br><br>If you compare it to an individual, its very common for a person or Company with unsustainable debts to be declared bankrupt.<br><br>Basically the slate is wiped clean as the situation is recognised by both parties to be unsustainable. <br><br>The same sets of circumstances apply to the Greek situation. <br><br>The lenders know that the Greek debt is unsustainable <br><br>https://www.documentcloud.org/docum<wbr>ents/296384-greece-dsa.html<br><br>So why enforce millions of people to go through 15 years of misery and then a bankruptcy when you an just cut out the 15 years part and get on with it now.</br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>True enough. Greece didn't get a bailout. The private banks that lent money to Greece got the bailout. Every Euro that the taxpayer coughed up went into paying off and the interest on those loans. The austerity condition then squeezes the general population while those billionaires you mentioned, being the good patriots that they are, long since moved their money out of their home country.<br><br>Mind you, I'm not in favor of sending them more money, especially since Tsipras seems to think it's undemocratic not to let the Greek people be in charge of how much money the rest of Europe gives them. <br><br>I think maybe we need another Bastille day.
