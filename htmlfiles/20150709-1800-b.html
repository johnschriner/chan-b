[ /b/ how do I stop fapping? <br>It's becoming apparent that my fapping is messing with my sex drive, and I want to stop. <br>Yet it seems that any time I can't satisfy my urges I become irritated or impulsive, as if I need the release to calm down.<br><br>How do I get rid of that so I can stop fapping so much between sex?<br><br>As it is, I can only see my GF about 3 times a week, which is not nearly enough to satisfy my sexual urges. And, for lack of a better term, she's no monster in bed either.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Get a hobby, do something with your hands like building models or painting or something that keeps your hands busy when you are bored. stay off the internet</br>  get those grip strength things and use them a lot when you're just chilling. your hands will be too tired to hold yo dick  Go to bed liam  As long as you're properly layin down pipe in her and putting that ass to sleep then why stop fapping  <br>Become very aware of whenever you seek masturbation as a means of finding calmness. If you keep looking at this urge and identifying it for what it is, you will become calm. It is insane to think that your urges have control over you. You are where they come from.</br>  I can't help you, just succumbed to my fapping urges after containing them for 3 and a half months. Biggest nut I've busted in my life, felt like a porn star.  Find something new to do every day, it helps me.<br>Also, stay offline.<br>Read a book.<br>Play football, idk, do whatever the fuck you want just don't sit in front of a computer.</br></br></br>  Shit i find sex with the same woman in too close of a time frame to be a serious libido killer for me. <br><br>Three times a week with the same girl? Couldn't do it for long if she was the only girl. Unless I had long periods between our sex of at least extreme flirtation (like office romance. My typical go-to) <br><br>Maybe you shouldn't automatically blame your lack of desire on yourself, Anon? Maybe it's her. Maybe it's your entire relationship. <br><br>Try tying her up. Arms behind her back. Get her face down. Smack her ass as hard as you want. Shove her face in the mattress. Ignore her when she bitches about how she can't breathe. She'll find a way, trust me. Just do whatever you want. Then untie her only when you're ready. <br><br>That sometimes does it for me. Best of luck.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I was going strong with no fap till I came into this board again so:<br>Stay away from 4chan, stay away from the internet, and lastly, stay away from a computer. Pick a hobby. <br>You should also ditch your android/iphone/windowsphone, or at least use them as less as possible, just in case.</br></br>  TRIPS GET YOU BANNED. ROLL.

Post the screenshot  <br>you should be more worried about your breach in security</br>  Just say you didn't mean to, fucking dumbass  <br>this, unless you already went full autistic on her.<br><br>i don't know how to screen shot with my newer phone, but it does it all the time with some kind of swipe.</br></br></br>  <br>Wasn't a breach in security smartass. It was a "story" that was sent to everyone who had her as a friend or something.</br>  <br>Yeah good luck explaining that to a white girl who only knows iphones.</br>  What was the picture of?  <br> anonymous account that nobody knows I have <br><br>again, care to explain?</br></br></br>  <br>All I know now is that I have to use a fucking screen recorder app and then grab the screenshots later.</br>   slip her a note that says: Swiggity Swoogity I'm coming for da booty   <br>It was just a stupid selfie. Wasn't even that much to see.</br>  <br>Deny deny deny</br>  <br>then post it ya fuck</br>  <br>Thats clever, I found an app in the app store that can anonymously do screenshots and save entire snap stories and videos and open snaps without telling them i've opened it. its pretty sick.</br>  <br><br>killing this guy's dreams here<br><br>he was almost right on the internet</br></br></br></br>  <br> anonymous account that nobody knows I have <br>Then how would she know it's you?</br></br>  <br>Autistic OP confirmed.</br>  <br>She doesn't. Just trying to find a good excuse that will get her to not delete the account off her friends list so I can still get her stories in case a "juicy" selfie finally comes up.</br>  <br>share</br>  it's 1;55 am, i'm tanked, op is and forever will be a white hot flaming faggot, goodnight.  And also I haven't said anything yet, I came here for help so I don't fuck something up.  <br>So you don't show your face when you snapchat</br>  <br>App name?</br>  <br>Called Snaphack in the iOS store. Theres probably an le anderod equivalent</br>  <br>Snaphack in iOS store</br>  Stoner thread    I'll bite. I just got an Oz of this today. Strain is headway. It's realllllly good shit  <br> tfw no weed </br>  <br>Forgot pic lol</br>  It's a layers bowl resin weed keef  Just got onna these <br>I fucking love it</br>  <br>Op here</br>  <br>Looks herdy mang</br>  If you really want to see some chronic check out my Instagram mushbrainflex_knight I got some fire bud and oil  <br>clean your nails you degenerate</br>  <br>Muh bowl</br>  <br>Only hand held vape I've use Is a iollite</br>  <br>It's Fucking resin I just got done scraping</br>  <br>Fuck you faggot</br>  <br>clean your fingernails you filthy ape</br>  <br>It's Fucking resin</br>  <br>Headway is what?

I like the vapexhale A LOT. best dab hits ever.</br>  <br>Took the privacy setting off go take a look bitch</br>  <br>Okay sure<br> pic related </br></br>  I just a medical caramel. That's my contribution to this thread  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>GO GET A JOB YOU DEGENERATE STONER FAGGOTS!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Worst $60 I've ever spent. no clouds just taste and a very light buzz. I wish I can sell it but no one wants to buy :(</br>  On a break. On average I smoke a gram one week, take a week off, then repeat. I can tell my tolerance is up, and I'm not gonna escalate. So I'm halfway into a month break. Looking forward to the next bowl, as I've saved kief from several wonderful strains. That and my broseph managed to get some white widow from out of state that he's saving for the occasion. Wish me luck on my spirit journey.  <br>I have a job<br>I just came back from work half an hour ago</br></br>  <br>Woooo when I searched it in google I found the same picture GOOD FOR YOU</br>  <br>I LOVE it. I've used all kinds of vapes, and this one is by far my favorite. That, and it's so fucking efficient</br>  <br>Lol. It's like there's just one dude who waits until these threads start just so he can contribute his 2 cents. At least, that's what I like to believe.</br>  <br>Ill bet you were high the whole time you were at work. You disgusting piece of human trash!</br>  <br>just wait for e liquid with THC to become legal and use that.<br>Only a matter of time, now.</br></br>  <br>Trying far too hard.</br>  <br>https://instagram.com/p/3IH1WJAxyY/<wbr></wbr></br>  <br>I don't get high at work<br>My job forces me to work impossible deadlines, if I smoked I wouldn't get the work done. I smoke after stressful days because it helps me put my mind at ease.<br>You might want to try calming down, friend. This stuff is great for that.</br></br></br>  I switch it up time to time I just got done with all my tree so I'm switching back to vape.  Can I get a recommendation on a strand with a really strong euphoric high? I had some blue dream a while ago and had great childhood memories.  <br>I wish!! I guess I'll keep it for now. I just feel really stupid for buying it tbh</br>  <br>where in NYC can anyone get dabs????</br>  <br>That would be incorrect considering I have that nug right in front of me still.</br>  Personally I just like to take pictures of good bud and whatever else me and my friends have come are way If your person who appreciates that kind shit then you'd like my Instagram  <br>Super Silver Haze, Cinex, Papaya Kush, every strain I have had with a fruit in the name is really euphoric</br>  <br><br>I'm this guy. I was only fucking with you because you set your account to private and told us to go look. Your bud is fire honestly.</br></br>  <br>Nice bud look like some fire same guy oh and there<br>No reason to be a down right asshole</br></br>  Tell me what you guys think of my bong  <br>It's nice but Why use tinfoil? You might as well made a gravity bong</br>  <br>I really haven't gotten to use any other vape other than MFLB but I'm assuming the vapexhale is high on the totem pole considering its the only vape that can low temp vaporize BHO off a quartz nail</br>  <br>Because the piece is way too large and I need tinfoil to keep it from falling down. And what's a gravity bong?</br>  <br>Thats pretty cringe since its way out of place</br>  <br>I will admit I do have some shitty looking buds on there and some tame soup of oil but that when my usual dudes out and I go through a friend</br>  <br>go buy a 30 dollar bong from a smoke shop</br>   <br>Too much effort plus youre hitting the foil, rey an acorn top</br>  <br>Ricky?</br>  Tips on what dinner to eat today while i blaze?  <br>chicken<br>n rice</br></br>  <br>ohhhh I thought the whole piece was tinfoil my bad. And gravity bong is where you put your bowl on top of the cap, screw it on the bottle and light it. Oh, Before you screw it, poke a hole on the bottom of the bottle and fill it with water. So as you light your bowl from the cap water spills from the bottle and the force pulls the smoke and you take the cap off and inhale.</br>  my recent aqusition  <br>Eat some pasta or noodles /b/ro</br>  Man...<br> can't sleep <br> gf passed out so no sexy time <br> like half a bowl left <br>How do you guys deal with sleeplessness?</br></br></br></br>  if you guys spent have as much time working and studying as you do in getting high maybe yall wouldn't be such losers  <br>If all you have to use is a ghetto blaster here's a tip to make a good one if you have a old two liter layin around take it this works for my since I have a gas stove hold both end over the flame and slowly rotate it an It will harden and as you rotate it the bottle will basically start to form in and for there you can make a hole put your downstem in</br>  <br>just so you know the trick to a bottle bong is just to let the stem go straight in. when you tilt the bong 45 degrees to hit it the water tilts. <br>btw im in the same boat. i just moved 4 states away and didn't bring my bong so i bought an acrylic one which the dog ate. so BROTHER!</br></br>  <br>I spend about as much time working as I do smoking weed. You don't know what it's like to have a shitty life</br>  <br>Question for you guys. Weed has turned on me, and I'm wondering if there is any way to get back to enjoying being high.<br><br>I've smoked weed for years and years. It used to be my favorite thing in the world. I loved it. Gradually, however, I started to not enjoy being high. Now, I get all up in my head, get really down on myself, worry about shit, feel tremendous stress when I get high. It is terrible. Any advice on how to get through this and go back to having fun?<br><br>Thanks /b/. Pic not related</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>what is the small cap on the bottom do?</br>  <br>Are you me? I have the same problem.</br>  <br>Smoke the whole bowl as fast as you can so you pass out, pack the biggest cones you can possibly pull</br>  <br>Go like 2 or 3 weeks without smoking any. After that time it'll be much more enjoyable.</br>  <br>Here's some mid range bud I bought today. I live in an uncivilized place in canada where weed doesn't have names (inb4 pleb) i got a pretty good deal on it tho</br>  <br>Take acid and change perception on whole world?</br>  <br>stop smoking. obviously you're downing on yourself because you believe the weed is a problem. Do other stuff as well and always use weed as an enhancer, not a replacement for things.</br>  <br>Tolerance break<br>Or switch to concentrates.</br></br>  <br>I found this picture on google. I still don't get where you suck air when you're burning your weed</br>  <br>easier emptying of the bottom, basically a drain cap</br>  <br>HEY im not that guy but i have 8 hits getting dropped off to me tomorrow. plan on going with 3 of my bros and having a big bonfire while tripping. should be fun.</br>  <br>Maybe if I spent all the time I spent going to school and working getting high instead, i wouldn't be so fucking sober right now.</br>  <br>Man it's gotten so bad I went like 3 months w/o getting high, and just tried again yesterday to the same shitty result.</br>  <br>Where do you get that?</br>  <br>Hash bro</br>  <br>Do dabs</br>  <br>Dude weed really dosent have a name anywhere unless you getting it straight from a dispensary them most of the time your dealers just throwing some<br>Name at you</br></br>  Mmmmmm Obama  Picking up an 2oz of reg for $40 tomorrow. How much do dabs normally cost /b/ros?  Somebody ever smoked synthetic weed and had after it lung pain after smoking a cigarette?  <br>you dont. its a type of gravity bong. the water pulling out fills the bottle with smoke then you remove the cap and inhale the smoke. the air displaces the oxygen to burn not your lungs.</br>  <br>SmokeCartel.com is where I got mine, really quick service I bought my carbon filter there too and it arrived quick as fuck</br>  <br>His fingernails are so fucking gross</br>  <br>well its beautiful.</br>  <br>Aqualabtechnologies.com<br>Lots from the same brand</br></br>  <br>I'll see what my local dispensary has tomorrow. Why do you think hash will turn it around?</br>  <br>This. Just take the cap off and inhale the smoke. The water cats as "lungs" and pulls all the smoke down</br>    <br>This is amazing because for my first time ever doing acid I get tricked into doing 8 hits it was my pals birthday and a mutual friend who also sells the whole variety of things came over pulled a rectangle shape of Tim fool from his pocket it had 4 sugar cube I take one my pal who's birthday it was takes one are mutual friend goes you'll probably want to take the other and shove the second sugar cube into his mouth so I said fuck If and ate the other we'll about 45 minutes later I got running to the bathroom and vomit and it fucking hits me I mean full blown visuals like my tv looked like it was doing ripple effects as if someone throwing a rock into water and this goes for 12 hour just peaking coming down peaking and so on and prier to that I had only tripped once and that was on 2 tabs of 25-I now I love tripping it's always a great time</br>  <br>it's not a weed thing, its about your mindset anon</br>  <br>Try harder.</br>  Sup /b/ros  <br>A gram of good oil is usually between 50 to 60 $</br>  Oh thank god. I have a question brothers<br>I bought some weed and it was dry as fuck and just crumbled to ash in my hands. But the weird thing is, it's one of the best smokes I've had in ages.<br>I thought dry weed was bad?</br></br>  <br>That looks ground up really nice</br>  How is everyone doing tonight?<br><br>Feeling shitty? Tell me why.<br><br>Feeling great? Tell me why.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>LUrk more.</br></br>  <br>I feel nothing.</br>  <br>jinx os soooo hot!</br>  Work sucked, not bad just boring and stressful. <br>Drive home sucked major dick. Everyone crashed their cars because a little rain.<br>Got home late and tired, had mediocre dinner, had friends bail on me for playing games tonight. <br>Play 1 game and have worst experience in almost a year. <br>Look at clock and its almost time to sleep and do it all again. so kinda shitty.</br></br></br></br>  <br>i have hemorrhoids</br>  <br>I feel... alone. I need discipline, and a set schedule. Now that I've graduated, I have to make my own decisions, (obviously.) So, now I'm getting in shape to join the army, where I can finally have back discipline. <br><br>What's wrong with me? Why do I crave certainty this badly?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Sorry your friends bailed on you :(<br><br><br><br>Yeah she is</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>she can push them back in for you ;)</br>  <br>Still obsessing.<br>Still feeling a need to contact her.<br>Still not making progress.</br></br></br>  Feeling alright. Money in my pocket. Roof over my head. Got my health. It's all seems........ok.  <br>My day has been meh. Had whole belly clams for dinner, which was fucking glorious. Got my amp back from the guitar shop but now for some reason I can't get effects pedals to work. Tried all sorts of shit to fix it, nothing helped. So now I've gotta call the shop again tomorrow and go through the whole getting it fixed process again. Pretty butt hurt about it really. I've been a loyal fucking customer for many years now. I've spent at least 7 grand at their shop buying and selling equipment. Now I'm trying to get drunk. <br><br> tfw high alcohol tolerance <br><br>I bought a four loko and a monster to make a monster truck (half four loko half monster) to set things off. I've got some premade long island iced tea, a 30 rack of beer, and some wine. <br><br>Any movie suggestions?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't have my mood stabilizers so I'm feeling like dieing.</br>  <br>came here for jinx</br>      <br>Get some lamotrigine faggot. That's what I'm on.

But because of dat dere holiday the cunty office was all herpderp we ain't got none. So I gotta wait. Meanwhile my depression and general unpredictable mood is unacceptable.</br>  <br>Meh. Chronic back pain has been acting up the past few days. <br><br>Spent some time hitting my balls earlier just to try and distract me from the pain. It didn't really work, it was just mild discomfort. <br><br>Other than pain, I've got nothing to complain about. Everything else is pretty great.</br></br></br></br></br>  Shitty. Fucking niggers chasing kills in the jungle when we should be pushing lanes. Infuriating.    Scared shitless. I'm 18 and my girlfriend is 2 weeks late. I used a condom. And we took some pregnancy tests and they both said negative. But she still hasn't had it. I'm freaking out. I'm not ready to be a father.  <br>and now my dicks hard thanks alot</br>  <br>What exactly is wrong with the pedals? Are they plugged in correctly, are your cables working without the pedals?</br>  <br>im sick as fuck but jinx is my waifu so ille just hang here for a bit</br>  <br>I lost everything.<br>I'm broke, back at my mom's. <br>Been 6 weeks.<br>I couldn't text her if I wanted to, I'm blocked everywhere from day 1.<br>I won't stalk her or make burners to communicate with her.<br>I just want to confront her on her bullshit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>glad i could help</br>  <br>smells like teen bronzies<br><br>i know that feel /b/ro</br></br></br>  <br>Anon, it's hard to imagine but when you see that kid you'll be glad you had it. <br><br>Don't abort and don't you LET THAT BITCH do it either. Please trust me.</br></br></br>  <br>That's not it.<br>I have friends, and I get out.</br></br>  <br>I think it's ironic that everyone says they understand when you have a genetic problem involving how you process seratonin but they don't understand when shit goes wrong for you and it's immediatly your fault.</br>  <br>/b/ro I'm in the army. I'm going to be gone the first four years of my kids life. And I wana go to college and live a little man. I'm not ready to settle down</br>  Shitty.<br><br>Out of weed, pissed off cause my job hasn't paid me in a month and I barely get hours anyways. Manager lied to my face and said the payroll paperwork was in last week, but I talked to hr and they told me he turned the paperwork in yesterday. Really just feeling like getting piss drunk, but I don't have booze either and i'm pretty short on cash.</br></br>    <br>man these pictures are the shit all i have is ahri</br>        <br>i read that doujin religiously</br>      <br>Different cables have been used, fresh 9V batteries have been set in place, tried different guitars, tried with, and without power supply. They are plugged in correctly. When the switch is turned off the amp functions fine, crisp clean tone, once I stomp the pedal no sound comes through at all. Tried all sorts of shit man. It's fucked up.</br>    <br>Get a test at Planned Parenthood.<br>I went through what you're going through and we ended up deciding to have an abortion. I don't often think about it, but I wonder what my life could have been like.</br></br>  <br>I hope you find what you're looking for. <br><br>If you don't keep him/her you will regret it. Especially if you keep in contact with the child. Anything you want to do can be done with a child.</br></br></br>        <br>Shitty and great. Because i have to take a shit and i dont want to stand up. I just keep playing with my anus. About to shit in bed, waiting the top of my poo exits the hole and let my arse inhale it back in. So i can imagine sex.</br>        1000 Car Bill when just bringing in for an oil change and checkup.. Brakes were Shot, Power Steering Belt was shot. Leak found on Compressor. Another belt for AC missing. <br><br>Still cost me another grand to fix the AC. GA heat blows cock.<br><br>Need to have my wisdom teeth taken out, probably oral surgeon, so another grand give or take. Then theres my other currents bills from having to move.. Just in debt ... bit lonely. Still alive though, so guess we're good there.</br></br></br></br>  Also I refuse to play LoL anymore. Too many toxic cunts. I would rather play MWO.  <br>Sounds like you need a dildo</br>  <br><br>Thaaaaat's great, anon. Atleast you are happy...</br></br>  this is literally the best porn comic like holy shit      Great but feeling like a cuck. Any sauce on the OP image?    Friend stopped talking to me because she is dating my ex best friend or something so I feel like shit  <br>Feeling like shit. GF moved to some other state. We barely talk now. Haven't talked to anyone in 2 days. Can't sleep.</br>  <br>Sounds like you need a $4.99 six pack of 16oz pbrs m88.</br>        Feeling shitty. I feel I'm unimportant to my Gf.      <br>Because you should grow up I think, having a schedule by yourself</br>  <br>fuck pbrs. If i'm slamming cheap beer its gunna be fosters. Not even aussie.</br>    <br>You nigger ok?</br>  <br>Shitty. I keep peeing out my butt.</br>  <br> porn comic <br>kek</br></br>  I'm okay tonight. A mix of anxious and excitement. My girlfriend has been in Florida scuba diving and shit for the past almost 2 weeks and on Friday she comes back. Sure it'll probably be like Saturday before she's here and even later before I see her, but I just... I can't wait to see her again and I hope she feels similarly about me.  <br> more  <br>Lurk moar.</br></br>  Feeling normal. Just got home from work, wife is watching Netflix, I'm eating a pizza from Dominos and fucking around on my phone. About to take a shower and join her in bed to watch the last few episodes of Criminal Minds and decide what were gonna watch nightly after that. <br>How are you OP ? <br>You ok ?</br></br>  <br>Fuck lamotrigine, flouxetine is where it's AT!</br>  <br>I have no chance of ever getting a girlfriend, or a friend of any kind. I spent al my school years hiding from the world because i was a scared beta little fuck. Now I have no people skills and no interesting stories to tell so I make shit up. Its perfect for meeting people that you'll never see again, not for lasting friendships. Also I have a inch and a half long dick.</br>  <br> Fosters <br><br>Respect. I'm just a filthy hipster don't mind me. Fosters is good too.</br></br></br>  <br>feeling kinda meh. Working full time for the first time in my life this summer and it sucks, mostly in that I know I'll never be as free as I was in college ever again, you know?</br>  <br>Had tontake xanax for panic attack, made me sleep in awake now and fucked I took a sleeping pill but dreading the realistic nightmares I might fet, other then that good watching adult swim about to get some sweet milk and heat it up to drink and hope sleep</br>  op my cocks hard keep posting  <br> Not even aussie. <br>we don't drink fosters</br></br>  <br>would love to feel jinx's tongue licking my balls while deepthroating</br>  <br>Talk to her about it.</br>  <br>fucking kekd<br/></br>  <br>Zoloft is an anti depressant not a mood stabilizer. I'm on 150mg of Zoloft, 200mg of lamotrigine, 80mg of Latuda, and 3mg of xanax.</br>  <br> Fosters over PBR </br>  <br>I take lamotrigine and i'm bipolar/schizo effective.

My girlfriend came back from Poland, where she stayed 3 weeks, I wasn't able to see her for 4 because of a trip to Florida. When I saw her I didn't feel empty. She really means everything to me. I'm going to propose soon. We've been together for 3 years. I feel like shit whenever I'm not around her. Almost shot myself earlier.</br>  <br>Work part time during the rest of the year so you will look forward to graduating and being done with school.</br>  <br>Bro, same. Holla at yo boy. Why do you feel unimportant to her?</br>  <br>I like the name latuda, im on abilify along with host of others</br>  <br>I've also out of weed and haven't smoked in 5 months. Thinking about quitting but I don't know.</br>  <br>I'm an unlabeled Mood disorder and schizo effective. I'm some where between bi polar and MDD.

I'd rather sit home and do the things i live, than making an effort with a girl i actually like, i mean, whats the point? All chicks are sluts  Feeling okay. Relationship of 2 years officially ended today. She was a massive cunt toward the end and expected me to send her snapchats of where I was and the people I was with every time I would leave... Even at work. She had nothing going for her. No job. No education. Nothing. I feel as if I'm finally free, but I really did care for her so there is a little pain. Maybe posting her nudes will make me feel better...  <br>Abilify made me feel like dog shit. They gave it to me when I was admitted. Worst drug ever.</br>  <br>Find something you like and look for a group that gathers in person.<br>There groups who play board games, and not shit like Monopoly either. <br>Be a regular at a comic book shop.<br>There are plenty of ways to meet people.</br></br></br></br>  I just want to sleep tonight fuck my restoril hasnt kicked in yet  <br>Feeling shitty.

Im admin of warbands/ PKing fc. Im a chick. I also used to be a camgirl.<br><br>Long sotry short i left my previous position as a admin of another PKing fc because they found my profile and spammed it to the entire alliance-- over 15 fc's with at least 50 people in age. EVERYONE saw my nudes. EVERYONE knew wha ti did as a living. People who i thought were my friends became disgusting assholes. Some people just said absolutely cruel things to things to me. I left and became super depressed. The people in this online game affected my actual, real life and emotions. <br><br>This was about 3 months ago. Since then i've joined another fc and becamed ranked in this one. As of right now we have been warring with rival fc's lately. somepeople in this fc's know what happened and in fact were some of the worst perprtrators. Every time i PK i get called out about my history in the sex industry. Ihave erased any and all photos nd videos of me off the internet as best as i can as well as assuming a new identity-- but some people still caught on. <br><br>Very soon i feel like people are gonna start beliveing these rumors and the same thign will happen all over again-- which i wont be able to bear a second time. <br><br>stfu judgemental fucks.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Feeling great. Used to have a shit of a social anxiety, tried to be without masturbating for a month to see how my testosterone and dopamine levels (the more dopamine --&gt; more confident and okay with yourself) rose alongside. Had 0 confidence tonight. People are so easy to click with, you know? Just smile and say, "Hi." They're just people like you or everyone else, with their insecurities and everything. They'll only seem like better and worthier people if you let yourself think that way.  <br>Pretty great. Ordered my first dakimakura yesterday and Im eager for it to arrive.</br>  <br>I assumed you were formally military. Thank you for your service<br><br><br>2 years</br></br></br></br>  Im on holiday for 6 weeks on my own, but I just miss my girlfriend so much I cant sleep at night. Probably going back home in 4 weeks because im not made for this shit.  <br>Yo man, I'm only 21 now and I lost my virginity about halfway through 20. You're good man, you've got time, chill it on out</br>  Ive been living/sleeping in a prius for about three and a half months... So theres that  <br>I'm feeling pretty shitty.<br><br>I saw a hot girl today, and I was too much of a beta faggot to go talk to her.</br></br></br>  <br>I can learn something from this anon.</br>  <br>I cant sleep because the a/c is broken and its so fucking hot</br>  <br>Thanks anon, ive been on meds about 2 as well good luck to you</br>  Shitty. Not having the alpha traits to tell her how I feel.  <br>Fuck man, my AC froze up today I forgot to change filter, check your filter you might just need to change out the filter and let it defrost where you from? It was 94 here and 100% humidity fml</br>  <br>[spoiler]we're all /b/etas[/spoiler]</br>  <br>How did this come to pass anon?</br>  <br>The cure for that is to try.<br>What's that worst that can happen?<br>Rejection? So what?<br>I used to go to bars and strike out all fucking night, girl after girl, and all it did was make me less scared of rejection.<br>So just nut up and talk to any girl you want.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That sucks but you kind of had it coming. Doing shit like that online will always come back to haunt you. Just look at zunechan, she tries to stream on twitch but gets raided by /b/tards and shit. It could be worse, your family , or former high school/college class could know about it. I know what it's like to have a beef with online friends who you're really close to.<br><br>Also is runescape even good? I've been a wow fag since 2007. WoD is kind of dildos so I'm looking for something else other then guitar to sink my time into.</br></br></br>  <br> im a stupid fucking nigger that cant spoiler </br>  <br>Ill check that, in tx so about 80 tonight</br>  Bad, i'm taking a new antidepressant and it's doing me shit.<br><br>I feel like i did a shit ton of coke but i don't feel good at all.</br></br>  <br>I'm feeling good, because I'm getting optic fiber internet tomorrow.</br>  <br>I lack motivation to do things</br>  <br>If you're truly an ex cam-girl, fun times. You can do what you want, but in the internet age, it's hard to not separate that shit. One of my good friends stripped nights for extra cash, she worked far from where she lived on purpose, and I was helping her separate both lives. Some douche overheard us one day and followed her to her home, then her work and stalked her nightly. She had to call the cops, but the damage was done, everyone at our work knew and she had to quit. It sucks, but you gotta power through, keep doing what you want, and living with it might be easier, don't know. I'm not a girl, so can't weigh in on that.</br>  <br>We're chill in this thread. <br>This is where the love is in /b/<br>I hope we do this every night.</br></br></br>  <br>It took about 30mins and now AC is rocking</br>  <br>My long time friend, pretty much my older brother and father figure is in MARSOC and has had recent trouble with PTSD, they're trying to get him to finish his contract and take the honorable discharge. He wants to make a career out of it though. I respect what you did for our Country. Not enough amerifag anon's are willing to admit that.</br>  <br><br>Are you a frequent fapper? <br><br>Be without masturbating for a few weeks and then you'll see what kind of a person you'll become. I promise. On anxiety forums there's info on how people have tried to treat their social anxiety for YEARS and how their anxiety ended immediately after they stopped jerking off. <br><br>Internet porn is yet such a short phenomena people don't quite understand its effect on the human brain. <br><br>Make research on the internet. Reddit NoFap, Google / YouTube search "Your brain on porn", "Excessive masturbating" etc.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I feel awful. I'm pretty much barred from work for the next 6 months, I rarely see my girlfriend anymore, and I have few friends. I haven't had a reason to leave the house for months so I'm gaining weight rapidly. I'd like to work or hang with friends or even go on a date but I have no money nor other resources to do anything. I've just been fucking stagnating in my room, slowly wasting away and becoming irrelevant to the world.<br><br>Plus I'm in California, so I dislike everyone I know on one level or another.</br></br></br>  <br>Where can I find more of this artist?</br>   here, I meant I had 0 ANXIETY tonight. My confidence was... perfect. I actually managed to have a great time with any person that came along, instead of seeing talking with people as an awful task.  <br><br>I feel shitty. I'm 29 and i've never held a girl's hand. I've no job and i live with my mom. I'm also overweight and a social reject.<br><br>I'm too worthless to get a girl, and having a girl would be the only motivation i can think of that would get me to get a job and stop being worthless.<br><br>I'm just like millions of other men who will probably die at age 30.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh fuck, don't say that please. Me too, if my mom ever decides to put me out I'm probably gonna be joining you in the boat ;_;</br>  <br>I was a frequent fapper I guess you could call it. I was in a relationship for about 3 years, and I rarely masturbated because I was having sex. Since coming out of that relationship, I still really don't masturbate as much as I used to. <br>I was referring more to the things at the end of your post as things that people can learn from, but that particular bit of information is actually good to know.</br></br>  <br>I hope he is allowed to finish his career out more then likely he will be medicly retired if he is lucky.. thanks as well and I wish best of luck to him he def should get help even if it means his career, dont want him to suicide</br>  <br><br>I plan on doing this every night. Just hanging out and chatting with other anons is pretty nice.</br></br>  <br>You should probably sink time in a hobby (not videogames) to externalize your shit. Depression's a bitch (29 year oldfag with cancer) and it's either medication (thankfully my anxiety meds double as depression meds) or just getting your loved ones/friends to help you move along. Don't stagnate, that shit's terrible, and the longer you wait, the harder it'll get.</br>  <br> i like this image.... alot</br>  <br><br>Im sure for most people getting kicked out would motivate them, but that just never happened for me</br></br>  <br>Yeah, you're not doing this right. At all. You don't NEED a girl. You NEED to spend time on YOURSELF. That shit's 1000000% more important than ANYTHING else. your SELF worth is the ONLY thing that matters. Get up and do something productive.</br>  <br>Every time I get a kill as Jinx I get a little hard.</br>  <br>Instead of turning my life around, i started shoplifting out of boredom</br>  <br>I'd probably just take myself out to be honest. Or I wouldn't work very hard to stay alive at least. Not unless I had someone else to live with. I can't be alone</br>  <br>The thing is that I feel like doing things, but at the same time I hate everything that's available for me to do, and I lack things for other activities</br>  <br>Sometimes I really like these threads lot of anons out there going through shit its nice to chat it out aometimes I wish there were IDS again and less trolls to meep in touch with some of the chill b/ros here</br>  <br>Renegades played and no Remilia drama. <br> Can we start calling Remilia the Thresh Princess? </br></br>  <br>No D: pls man can you rate me cuz ratethread had no responce to mine<br><br>Didnt do my hair and crappy pic srry. Can some femanon add me on skype? I dont know how to get a gf</br></br></br>  Feeling pretty good tonight.<br><br>Got some advice given to me about having to be more in control and dominant to get the things I want.<br><br>Used that advice. Got my girlfriend with an otherwise struggling low libido (She takes medication that made it lower since pre-medication) to talk about me fucking her in all of the dirty ways I want next time I see her (She's with her family on vacation) for the past few days. Normally we don't talk much about sex-related things but I decided fuck this, I'm going to get in her head and turn her into a submissive slut. I wouldn't do something like that unless I knew that's what she really wanted too. Turned her on enough to send me videos of her masturbating and stripping the way I told her to before going out to dinner with her family and in the bathroom before she went to sleep. She asked for videos of me cumming. Being a heavy cummer, she liked it a lot.<br><br>Probably not that big of a deal for some people, but having a re-spark moment in a relationship is so cash. But I think this is something I can maintain if I don't get lazy.<br><br>pic: Her booty.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, you know it's bad and you're doing it anyways. I mean, not much help we can offer here... But you should at least baby steps in the right direction. Up to you really.</br>  <br>I couldn't think of a good reason to go over to talk to her. It looked like she was with her mom anyways, so it would have been 2x as awkward to hit on her.<br><br>And the worst part of the story is that I saw her twice, and then I thought "if I see her again, I'll talk to her". And I saw her again at checkout, even walked withing 5 feet of her, and I didn't do shit.<br><br>So I feel pretty shitty today.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Forgot skype kek. starwarsfannl srry for the crinch i am btw</br>  Feeling shitty as fuck.<br>Can't seem to find purpose in life</br>  <br>Notice me dude who gave me a responce.</br>  <br>Get namesync</br>  <br><br>But i'm worthless. Making someone else happy is all i could be good for. I know there are girls as lonely as i am out there, we just have no way of meeting.<br><br>I need a girl simply because it's an aspect of life i'd like to experience. At 29, dating is only going to get harder as i go on.<br><br>I don't even ask girls i like if they'd go out with me. All that does is put them in an awkward position.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  A few hours from where I live a young girl just jumped off the bridge and smoked herself, ive seen many suicides on calls irl and have had friends do it and I was close my self one time.. I understand it but I dont understand why people dont get help..  <br>Doesn't have to be complicated. Write a short story, draw, paint, whatever. You just need to accomplish something that takes you away from here for a bit, it'll help you clear your mind and just think critically about your situation. Also exercise. Like, get an exercise ball, sit at your computer on it. get a stationary bike, use it as a computer seat, whatever. Something.</br>  <br>You got to go outside. Do something active even if its just walking around your neighborhood. Eat better. Use your energy constructively or you will end up staying at your mother's and not getting a job, never having a woman. <br>I've been there, kind of.<br>Do better for yourself.<br>You have time on your hands, so use it to accomplish this goal.<br>Doing better for someone else will never get you anywhere.</br></br></br></br></br>  Should I try and become a police officer?<br><br>I don't know if I'm up too it.</br></br>  kinda shitty because the girl I am in love with is dating someone that doesn't even like her...  <br>There is none.... The only reason why we are here is cuz sex. Dont anhero thought cuz we all lice for the lulz</br>  <br>Nah man. Sounds like bullshit saying this but I can feel she wouldn't. She's not that kind of person.</br>  <br>Ill look into that</br>  <br>Nah, i already got caught, now i have to do community service, thanfully i didnt have much stuff with me when i got caught</br>  <br>That sucks man. <br>Been there. Thing turned out okay in the end.</br></br>  I love my friends and hangin with em, and I've been hanging with em everyday, so that's great. But behind all that joy is a sad guy. I've been texting this girl for about a month, and I like her a lot, we have so many things in common and we get each other, but she doesn't put in the same amount of effort as I put in. I feel like I'm just an option to her, when she is my priority. And I know its pathetic but I don't care, I just want to be with her.  Been doing a lot of thinking tonight.<br>I turned 18 a few months ago, and I'm having some serious problems. I spent all of my time as a teenager inside, being a nerdy weeb. I didn't really develop an interest in women until I was 16, so I'm still a kissless virgin. I'm in between high school and college now, without a job, and I really feel totally lost. I feel like I missed out on being a stupid kid and now everyone expects me to be a stupid adult. I'm doing a lot of conforming and being something different than I am to appease a lot of people I don't really need to appease, and I'm doing it for no real reason.<br>Plus I have a girlfriend that I really don't love the way she loves me. She loves me like I'm the "one" and I love her in the way you love a girlfriend when you're 18, if that. I'm too much of a pansy to break things off though.</br></br>  ehh im aright i guess...<br> wats futa <br> that fucking manga though </br></br>  <br>Fuck you anon<br>go complain about cancer ylyl, furries, and trap threads</br></br>  I feel good, got some comfy pants on, still keep getting random thoughts of gf who broke up with me back in march, feel pretty confident about myself, maybe ill make new friends tomorrow.  <br>Then make a move and tell her.. but I hate to say it it sounds like you are an option or you are already friend zoned best luck M8</br>  <br>I forgot that i changed it to kawaai girl cuz of a raid someone pllsss mesage me. The only girl experience i have i skype bots.</br>  <br><br>Its true anon. I just had a relationship that motivated me to get a job and move out.<br>Now that's over and all I have left is me.<br>I dont have the job, or the girl, and I'm back at my mom's. <br>I didn't do it for me so I got nothing out of it. Start making an effort.<br>Nothing happens over night.<br>Successful people are never where they want to be, they're striving to do better no matter where they are.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>so i'm right in thinking i shouldn't even bother until i'm more worthy, aka a job and being fit, even having my own place?<br><br>I don't know how much more i can take of being alone.</br></br></br></br>  <br> lick her butthole <br> suck her clit while fucking her with a vibrator <br> make her squirt </br></br></br>  <br>I feel you anon.<br><br>Person saying she cheated on you is just a really lonely person.<br><br>Word of advice, be healthy with your love. A life-long relationship has its severe ups and downs, you can't be ready to pull the trigger because your woman is away from you for a short period of time. She doesn't deserve a person that unstable. Do you think that's fair to someone you want to be partners with?<br><br>Give yourself time before you propose. I know it feels right, but your relationship probably isn't going go away from you. Keep it, craft it, make it last. Time is on your side (yes it is)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Again, you're not worthless. Society makes you feel worthless, because coporations blablabla we're all numbers blablabla. You're exactly my age, I have a loving wife, no kids and been diagnosed with testicular cancer... twice. Now I can't reproduce ever and need to take medication basically forever. Lost my job because of relocation (thought it was my dream job) and can't afford to drink myself silly. I cry like a bitch sometimes because I need to do something, but waking up in the morning and just DOING something, helps. I spend time with friends and family, cook for them, play games, whatever. I know that my situation could be worse, but I CANNOT do anything about it, because I'm going into surgery next week, which entails 30 days of convalescence. So yeah, count your blessings, do something.</br>  <br><br>Successful people just got lucky. Effort is the smallest part of success.</br></br>  <br>always look for watermarks before asking</br>  <br> Be yourself <br> Be more outgoing in college <br> Fuck GF, ride things out and see if your feelings develop <br> If that spark doesn't last then dump her as painlessly as possible <br> Get drunk a lot and party hard <br> Don't party too hard and get at least a 3.0 <br> ??? <br> profit </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thank you anon. You don't know how much your advice means.</br>  <br><br>See it's people like you that make me realize how fleeting anything i ever strive for will be. No matter how hard i try or what i do it's for nothing.</br></br>  <br>No, you shouldn't bother until YOU FEEL like you're worthy. YOU FEEL unworthy because you have nothing to your name, you feel depressed, fat or whatever else you think you are. YOU have to change that, and YOU have the power to do it. nobody else will fix that.</br>  <br>Its called being young, you had fun beeing a weeb dont let it bother you, break up with her anon its not right for her if you feel this way its all part of growing up get a job and go to school or military your going through what many others are and already have</br>  <br> synchronicity not ;fate; </br>  came for the feels. stayed for the jinx  I dont know if i like being alone or if ive just gotten used to it  <br><br>I feel meh, but I did just perfectly poach 2 eggs so I have that going for me. Also nothing sexual about that, just made some eggs to go in my ramen.</br></br>  <br><br>Dude. Step the FUCK up. Your problems are a lot easier to fix right now than they will be if you keep neglecting your well-being. Take it one at a time, piece by piece, not all at once. You can make things improve too, you just honestly need to mature. Carry some real weight on your shoulders, and push through man.<br><br>Don't make the same mistake a fuck-ton of apathetic people your age will make. There's more to life, you just have to make the effort.<br><br>By the way, the next few years in your life. They're called the selfish years. Learn how to become appropriately selfish. A lot of the people you're around now will be worthless to you in months and years ahead. You'll only find a dime a dozen by the end of it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Stop self pitty potting sometimes you need to just man the fuck up and press on either you sink or float balls in your hand</br>  <br>You're 18... Seriously. Your life hasn't even BEGUN yet. Get a job, get some experience, go work in customer service, that shit makes you a conversational GOD. get some cash, get a beater car, go out with friends. You don't NEED to be married and in love and shit like animes or whatever the hell you base yourself on, especially not at your age.</br>  <br><br>That and so much more my friend. She's to show me what I can bring out of her.</br></br>  <br><br>No, do bother.<br>Bother to work on you. <br>It's going to take time and effort.<br>Make the choice to stop making the choice to be the guy who feels worthless. <br>That's a choice you made.<br>You chose to be sedentary and it's fucking you over and now you have to understand that you get the chance to make a new choice every day.<br>You have the option of changing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ah GG on the eggs anon also what flavour of ramen?</br>  <br> nothing sexual about that </br>  <br>Great spirit right there. Your good feeling made me feel better by proxy. Thanks m8.</br>  <br>Did ya fap to her?</br>  thought about killing my self all day. works sucks still wondering what the fuck im doin in this world had to quit smoking weed due to a UA. went for a lil ride on my skateboard witch was nice. but ya took a bunch of sleeping pills watchin mr robot hoping i dont wake up in the morning. maybe im just a drug addict  <br><br>What he said. Seriously. Do shit.</br></br>  <br>That's an excuse.<br>Successful people use their time better than unsuccessful people do. They have discipline and they follow through. <br>Luck is bullshit.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>tbh i know. i know it was but didn't know when or how hard it was. It literally hit me like a brick. and yes runescape can be good- based on your preferences. Some people hate the new RS. Some love it. But i warn you now--- you will be dredged into an entire world of obsession and pure grinds.</br></br></br>  <br>Ill prob take another sleeping pill as well, get help anon and drugs are downers seriously ya might need anti depres meds and other shit at least you have a job Im watching it as well the ol robot</br>  <br>You sound really young. You'll grow out of it. Just don't ACTUALLY kill yourself, that's really dumb. People out there have REAL problems, and they work through that shit. You should do the same and man the fuck up (or woman, no judging).</br>  <br>Or how about today. starwarsfannl on skype. Add me. this product costs time effort and feels. Might give u the followingdiseases: aids cuz i went in the pool. Autisme. Adolf hitler penis. Digures notincluded</br>  <br>I never played RS I still play vanilla wow though.. and visit my old MUDS even though all my childhood friends online are gone and the adults are prob dead damn</br>  I'm feeling fantastic! I'm in an open relationship with my very loving wife, and have met some wonderful paramours recently, and plan on meeting someone else in a few weeks. Meeting people has been really great for me, and I've really enjoyed the new sexual experiences.  <br>Eh, don't blame it on your youth, people do dumb things, and (I'm only 29) but 10 years younger I woulda done a lot of dumb crap on the net. Keep moving away from it and it'll eventually go away. Just... don't feed the trolls? Seriously, it's their only weakness. Strong independent woman and all that.</br>  <br>To each their own anon but glad your in a good mood hope it all stays well!!</br>  <br>Fuck people who don't understand things are out of your hands.<br>Fuck people who are heartless.<br>Fuck two faced people.<br><br>Fuck guys in general, man.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> pie flavor </br>  <br>Eh, fuck some guys. No generalizations please, we're all just trying to help each other out in this thread.</br>  <br>It's not for nothing.<br>Stop rationalizing.<br>Your entire way of thinking keeps you from trying because it's just easier to stay depressed. <br>If you tell yourself you can't be better, then you're right. You'll never be better if you believe you can't change that.<br>You have to make that choice.<br>No one is doing it for you.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hmm.. i dont get these maybe its cuz im an old fag</br>  <br>You need to start taking real risks.<br>Not things that make you a little uncomfortable or things that are kind of scary.<br><br>You're way too comfortable. Sit your fucking ass down, suffer for what you really want to get and have, and start your fucking grind dude. What your doing right now isn't a grind, it's you making excuses for your incompetence, the fear you have for failure and judgement instead of the fear of not actualizing your life. You can wonder all day if you want, but you're going to stay wondering if you don't start doing. Or you can kill yourself. If you had any head in you, you'll know that working for your dreams is a lot more rewarding and scary than killing yourself and calling it quits like a coward. If you can get up to go to work, you're healthy enough to get your shit together.</br></br></br></br>  <br>My relationships with those other than my wife are more casual relationships. It works out pretty well, and everyone is fine with the understanding that it's not a serious long-term relationship.<br><br>Funny thing, I've never actually had a break up with anyone. I could go visit a past paramour and they'd be fine to have me over.</br></br></br>  It's threads like these that make me feel good about people and myself.  Been better, girlfriend is going through nicotine withdrawal because she can't smoke a cigarette without coughing(chest cold), stuck in a hotel after moving to a different state, had the money to get a place, but there wasn't any places available in the area, now not enough money and places are available. And the Shit thing is we're paying about 1200 in total.each month, more than enough for a small place, but there's never enough all at once to put a down payment for a place. We have enough to pay for the room each week and get a few groceries. I'm the only one working, suppose to be doing fiberglass for this pool company, instead stuck with manual labor, and girlfriend can't find a job. (She was a bartender of 10+ years , and even though we're in Myrtle beach, and shes going to tons of places, no one calls back.) And the other one is her kid, 16. And it keeps going, just a couple weeks ago, car accident, minor vendor Bender, but its where the money went.<br><br>Overall a shitty situation. But I'm strangely calm. The kid keeps me going, plans on going to a nice stem school he worked hard to into, pre engineering. So there's that. We'll figure it out at some point, but it's a pain in the ass now, for sure.</br></br>  <br> i dont get these <br>well, you need a browser that supports images<br> its a phone with appeal </br></br></br>  put hardwood floor in my moms place today, i've never hung a painting in my own weird right?  <br>well cause i know how much of a faggot i am, ill tell you op.<br><br>my life has been pretty shitty. I literally just graduated high school and i'm on my summer break. I haven't done jack shit at all, I barely hung out with any friends. The most social interaction I've had was going to some local smash tournaments where I play like shit cause im not good at it at all, i just want to get out.<br><br>I was promised by some people who I thought were my "close" friends that'd we'd hangout and do things together, but that was all obviously a huge lie. I'm pretty sure 90% of them have already forgotten about me cause im pretty useless.<br><br>I've had a girlfriend, but she was pure shit and pretty much ruined my heart and made me more of a shut in. I dream of finding a nice girlfriend, but im too autistic to go out and find one. <br><br>Lately ive been thinking some suicidal thoughts but that shit wont ever go through cause im not a bitch, and i dont cut either cause again, im not a bitch.<br><br>so hows everyone else doing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Good. Sharing is caring. Makes me feel like an oldfag again.</br>  <br>I have no idea, it wasn't in English. Some kind of spicy vegetable.</br>  <br>High school problems. Everyone goes through it. Like we said earlier, work on yourself. If you're happy, life has a way of making shit work for you.</br>  <br><br>No I didn't say you couldn't make it sexual but the action I preformed unfortunately had nothing sexual about it....though I do know people who get turned on by cooking.</br></br>  <br>thanks man ill work through this shit. im only 22</br>  <br> 300 baud? <br> upgrade that shit to 14.4 <br> dat modem sound </br></br></br>  <br>great. have weed and vidya</br>  <br>im pretty sure i've lost the sense of being happy. yeah i can laugh at things every now and then, but does it mean im happy? no i just found something funny.<br>i just want to hang out with people but im too much of a burden or some shit.</br></br>  <br>Glad to hear it bruv. Life's fine if you can just see the good in it, and take the bad with a grain of salt.</br>  Used to feel shitty, but this thread made me realize that my life is fuckin great.  <br>If you're being a debbie downer whenever you're with friends, probably. Thing is, happiness is actually infectious. If you fake happy around people, and they become legitimately happy being around you, they will in turn make you legitimately happy. That or a hobby of some kind. Not vidya. That's just a time killer, not a hobby.</br>  <br>Same here man do you have a pic of the package? I have tons of ramen that idk wtf it says but man they are great</br>  <br>you sound like a bad ass!!! im in a 6yr relationship with a kid and feel trapped because i dont wanna leave my kid but i dont feel like im in love with her so wtf do i do?</br>  <br>if you want to know what pants, they are cargo pants that are a bit big, but holy shit they are good.</br>  <br>oh my bad, um... my point is that everything and anything can be sexualized...<br> wats r34? </br></br>  <br>Feels like I'm on my way there. I'm 18 so I guess things can still change a lot.</br>  <br>im not that dumb. i'm pretty much a fun happy guy when it comes to being around friends. i dont say much, but when i do its usually something funny, nothing negative. i like the feeling of being in a crowd rather than by myself. theres just something about me, literally, that people dont want to be around, and i have literally no idea what. i guess it could be because im so quiet, but im not even sure anymore.</br>  mr robot just got really gay literally!!!! wtf??  <br> this kind.</br>  I'm feeling kid of shitty right now. I started going out with a girl in May and things have gone great. I like her a lot, she seems to like me and I see long term potential. Right now she is out of town for a few weeks and we have been messaging each other regularly. Before she left I told her I liked her a lot and would like to continue seeing her when she gets back and she was on board. Trouble now is that I'm terrified I'm going to say or do something to fuck things up before she gets back and ruin things. I have got nothing but good vibes from her and all my advances have been received well and I'm probably just overthinking things and getting inside my own head, but I can't stop worrying about it. I was feeling very confident a month ago, now I'm back to just pretending to be confident.  I'm pretty great. I came out a couple of days ago, and everyone has been really supportive!  <br>Holy shit m8 I had that same 1 today!! There is also one in a black package that is scrumptious</br>  <br>Then you probably just didnt meet the right people.</br>  This thread is telling me I have to take my own advice and focus on putting in the time and effort to better myself.  <br>Body language maybe? Crossed arms, maybe not looking like you're listening (even if you are), intense looks, basically whatever societal cues you might be doing wrong. I'm terrible with social cues, so I spent a fuckton of time actually reading up on it, so I can understand it logically, since I can't just automagically respond like normal people can.</br>    <br> point and case </br>  <br>Stop stressing anon it sounds like things are fine just enjoy the ride and relax your doing fine, just dont be over bearing on her</br>  <br>I feel like that too a lot of the tie but my problem is that I don't listen. I don't have interest in the small talk.</br>  <br>god damn i wanna fuck that mouth so bad</br>  every one in this thread should listen to the joe rogan podcast    <br>Well thats good faggot, how did you tell them and who?</br>  <br>Long distance relationships are really hard. It's a fact. Your confidence dropping is normal (especially if you're like under 25 or something). Talk it out with her and be honest. If she feels you're like 100% sure everything is honky dory and she doesn't, she might think you're not as invested in the relationship. Seriously, THE #1 thing in a relationship is trust and honesty.</br>  /imjustsosweet<br><br>Get in here /b/<br><br> Also join Kik Group Chats #4chanraidz and #4chanraidz1 </br></br></br></br>  Thump  bomb  ccbunz<br><br>lolololol</br></br>  Bump  To mmany mods man! join /srbsavic1 <br><br>GOGOGOOGO!</br></br>  /b BOYS! lets go <br>TWITCH RAID!<br>/srbsavic1</br></br>  bump   this weak ass shit <br><br>Step up your fucking trolling game sempais.</br></br>  <br><br>There's always some retard yelling MODS</br></br>  <br>This is what /b/ lives for. to fuck mods and raid the hardest targets</br>  we need support ASAP  Find someone new, he doesn't give a fuck  he is not even mad new target required  NEED NEW TARGET! noww!!!
