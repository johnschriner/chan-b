Several years ago, when I first met Neko, she scratched my back as if she was doing it to a dog, only soft and in small circles. Out of nowhere, I got all numb and melted away, it felt so good, I didn't even know about it. So my back is a very weird spot. It's strong as fuck, but is also the key to calming me down. When I wanted to break shit, all I needed was a back scratch from her and I was calm.<br><br>Not sure why.<br><br>Make some friends!

Maybe you'll find someone one day who will touch you in such a way that you'll just feel calm and be able to fully relax and unwind in their presence. <br><br>Just gotta keep hoping.<br><br>What kind of print?<br><br>See?

Was not my type at all, nor did I like her at first, but eventually, I saw past her, and realized that she had a heart full of gold. She's the sweetest Mexican I ever met, I didn't think I'd ever date another Mexican girl again, but she proved me wrong. It's just sad that her family turned her against me, as soon as I moved out from her grandmother's house, they started poisoning her mind, and pretty much is now a Stockholm Syndrome case.<br><br>I can show you who she is, but she's not hot by many standards, but I think she's cute and I love her so damn much. <br><br>But I've found peace that once she wakes up, she'll find her way back to me.<br><br>Or I'll find someone else.<br><br>Either or.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>With that cool ass jacket, I'm pretty sure you'll get a lot of action, haha.</br>  <br>I heard the name neko a few days ago in a thread<br><br>Also people are fucking twisted at times</br></br></br>    <br>http://vocaroo.com/i/s0aScEWbzOSI</br>  <br>I can only hope so.</br>  <br>Was probably me, her name is the same as Foxy Dani's. So people would get confused and think I was dating Foxy Dani, but my girlfriend's name was Dani. <br><br>Her family never liked her and would always put her down. When I was living with her, I used to stand up for her and us, and argue with their flawed ass logic. <br><br>When I moved out because I couldn't take them anymore, they swooped in. <br><br>She acts like she's completely dead inside, and it sucks to see it. She used to be so full of life.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That dude in the top right knows.</br></br>  <br>http://vocaroo.com/i/s0cGKlv6JOwI</br>  <br>We asians know everythin</br>  <br>Or can you?

Well, maybe bug-eyed Claire is a brain dead mongaloid, but not sweet princess Lola. I'm Lola's number 1 fan, I even have a tumblr page dedicated to her - http://hartleyhooliganlola.tumblr.c<wbr>om/</wbr></br>  S/fur<br>Getting to know people edition</br>  pictures of amazing tits/nipples      <br>Keep going</br>    Bump  Bump  Bump  Hows my girl?   be me <br> be famous <br> have more you know what to do with <br> have anything and go anywhere i want <br> fuck as many girls as I want <br> do so <br> each one tells me I'm nothing but sex <br> a fantasy and nothing else <br> tfw I've had sex more times than I can count in my life <br> tfw never had a girlfriend <br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/628296585#p628296585">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I actually met him once.<br><br>I don't know. I've already done that with some others, making their dreams come true. It always makes me happy. I feel like I should try and do something that would make the whole world feel happy though.<br><br>I'm sure we would have a fun time together, not sure what makes people not like me though. It seems like they never do.<br><br>I guess I just don't want to be a cliche, but I guess I've became one.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Even assuming you were just through with everything, you could still go through a lot of options to feel better. You have the funds to access counseling, psychiatric care, and medication the likes of which most can't afford. You could get hard fucked up on feel good drugs and spend a lot of the remaining 25 or so years you have left on the actuary tables in a state of inebriation. <br><br>The sheer resources alone that a famous and wealthy person would have coupled with the amount of people in your life should be the recipe for a good time. If nothing else, find a person in your life every week, and just make their god damned dreams come true. Find one of your old high school friends and be like, "surprise motherfucker, remember that time you were really cool to me in high school? I'm going to pay you back for not being a douche. Here's 10 grand and a week to hang out with me." <br><br>Repeat this process until you either run out of money, or have a good time surprising old friends and making them happy.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Invest in things like 3D-4D printing, nanobots, or space research.<br><br>Or try to finance a honest, willful and applied young person's career so they are debt free when they end it, specially in reconstructive medicine<br><br>Or use your money to free 4chinz of SJW! kek</br></br></br></br></br>  YLYL<br>guarantee i'm not gonna lose tho.</br>    <br>Welp, it's been fun. Time to never come back. Enjoy spending the next half hour on this</br>    rate?  4/10 would bang once maybe  <br>she has decent tits I think, hard to tell with all the clothes tho</br>  I wanna see them feet.  ERP thread. Catgirl edition.  <br>He matches her movements, heating up between them as they play, pushing and shoving each other with their kisses. "Babe know how to plant a smooch too. Way to go, tiger." He grab her from behind, slowly rubbing up and down her thighs and pussy with the tips of his fingers.<br><br><br>"Hey there, being submissive isn't really my thing, but I dont want to impale you, so..." he takes his left hand and grabs her breats, squeezing them playfully. He runs his hand up and down her stomach, occassionaly feeling the wet hole he's about to penetrate. "Seems like you got a fountain going on down there, girly." He squeezes her nipples one last time.</br></br></br></br>  <br>For a moment it occured to him that he could use protection but then he thought why would he? In this day and age, most stds were curable and what better feeling could he have than disregarding it? Alex released a small moan when Ainslee grasped his stiff prick. Her grip on him firm, he involuntarily thrusted into her hand, a sign that he was very eager even if he didn't admit to it completely. <br><br>"No, it's okay. I'd rather do away with a condom this time. Gotta get the full experience to best see your capabilities." Alex kept his hand glued to her breast and the his free one drifted towards her hips, moving them down as a sign that she could lower herself now. His heart was beating very fast, as he awaited her next action and maybe he didn't notice until now or perhaps it was just the situation at hand, but it was quite hot in the room. Beads of sweat formed on his forehead, slowly falling down his face.</br></br></br>  </blockquote>]
