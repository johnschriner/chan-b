[ Hey /b/ have any of you seen any decent horror films lately? Anything that legitimately made you feel at least a bit scared.<br>to clarify, i don't mind jump-scare movies but i prefer the good intense horror kind of scares.</br>  haven't seen it lately but Poughkeepsie Tapes is p spoopy  Grave encounters.    <br>Really poughkeepsie tapes lol, its just shot-on-shitio snuff film style tbh</br>  El orphenato (the orphenage) jesus christ that shit's scary  <br>isnt that just a rip off, of the original omen?</br>  <br><br>This movie wasn't scary, but it was legitimately creepy. Men, women, children, no one was safe. Everyone got fucked up, and all for the viewer's pleasure/horror.<br><br>I loved it. I wish more movies would let go of such moralistic tropes as "never hurt the kids" and make movies like this one.</br></br></br></br>  It Follows. I don't actually remember a jumpscare, but it's original as fuck and my all time favourite horror film. One of those films you can't stop thinking about at night.  <br><br>Yes, it follows was good! The simple premise of an entity walking, not running, but walking towards you at all times until it finally reaches you and kills you. Very creepy. Well done.</br></br>  <br>Honestly, i just loved trick r treat because of the anthology type of movies. They are a guilty pleasure for me i guess. I mean i loved tales from the crypt, VHS 1/2/viral, abc's of death 1 and 2 etc.</br>  <br><br>Yeah, you and I have similar tastes I guess. I also love anthologies. I hope they make like 13 ABCs of death movies.</br></br>  <br>i hope they do too, but i dunno really. they would run out of ideas i guess, the first one just made me cringe when the pedophile one and the furry one came on ¬_¬</br>  <br><br>Hm.. pedophile one and furry one.. don't remember them.</br></br>  <br>yno the one where the guy in abc's of death comes into a forest with a kid... makes him strip down takes pictures and the kid kills him? <br>And the furry one is the one where theres a furry pole dancer that tries killing the dog dressed in ww2 gear but he shoves her into a shark tank...</br></br>  <br>kinda fucked up tbh. ^ that other post was me too btw</br>  <br><br>Oh yeah. I remember the WWII Dog, that one was awesome. I don't remember the pedophile one.</br></br>  This picture is from the pedo one   Furry one &lt;&lt;  <br>I think that was it for me too. Also, I love Halloween, and Trick 'r Treat really embodied the holiday for me far more than the "Halloween" franchise ever did. The sense of danger and horror (and fun), I haven't seen that in a lot of Halloween-themed films.<br><br>I really hope Doherty can keep it up with the sequel.</br></br></br>  <br>i agree that trick r treat did help promote it a little more with better... adult themed films i guess since most Halloween released films nowa days are absolute horse shit.<br>i did also enjoy the halloween franchise too, the remake wasnt bad either imo</br></br>  <br>Oh holy shit, i didn't even know that they were in the process of making a second one.<br>Trick 'r Treat 2 (announced)</br></br>  <br><br>Yes, the atmosphere was perfect. It really embodied the dark themes behind the day.</br></br>  <br>Definately. i know it wont come out this year but at least now i have something to look forward to lol, all the films coming out recently or have already come out (for example as above so below) have been complete shit</br>  <br>Have you seen a movie called "Afflicted"? I honestly thought it was a fantastic movie but it was unbelievably under the radar and incredibly unappreciated imo</br>  Def. Sinister  <br>Seen it, but sinister 2 comes out soon aparantly.</br>  dunno about horror, but if you're in the mood for some desensitizing / gore / disturbing movies I have a list I can share ;)  <br>Go for it, free board and all. i've seen so much of that shit that im pretty desensitized to it tbh</br>  <br>just a sec then. don't let the thread die</br>  <br> Cannibal Holocaust  <br> Srpski (or a Serbian Film) <br> Long Pigs <br> Cannibal <br> Martyrs <br> Irreversible <br> Frontier(s) <br> Antichrist <br> Human-Centipede (I and II) <br> VHS (1, 2, Viral) <br> Audition <br> Hostel (I and II, III) <br> Cannibal Ferox <br> Taxidermia </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thread wont die, if it surpasses a few minutes i usually post something</br>  <br> Salò (or 120 of Sodom) <br> Men Behind the Sun <br> Gummo <br> The Untold Story <br> I Spit On Your Grave (gory but not really disturbing) <br> Borderland <br> Black Mirror series (Especially National Anthem and White Bear) <br> The Poughkeepsie Tapes <br> I Stand Alone <br> Guinnea Pig (Series) <br> The Baby Of Macon <br> Ichi the Killer <br> Eraserhead <br> I saw the Devil <br> Ken Park <br> Julian Donkey Boy <br> Eden Inc. <br> August Underground <br> Caligula <br> Bad Boy Bubby <br> Ebola Syndrome <br> Meat Grinder <br> The Baby Of Macon <br> Visitor Q <br> Eraserhead <br> Grotesque (aka Gurotesuku) </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Canino (aka Kynodontas) <br> Tokyo Gore Fest <br> Bug Eater 2: Cockroach Eating Girl <br> Vase de Noces <br> Melancholie Der Engel <br> Carcinoma (2014) <br> Gusomilk <br> MASD004 <br> Laid to Rest <br> Funny Games <br> Maniac <br> Baise-moi <br> The Last House on the Left <br> Where the Dead Go to Die <br> C'est arrivé près de chez vous <br> La Grande Bouffe <br>DONE <br>enjoy it anons</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Cannibal holocaust - seen, it was okay but it was more scare factor than anything else<br>srpski - Seen it, abit sick tbh but its an alright watch for gore lovers<br>long pigs - not seen, will note and watch<br>cannibal - ^<br>martyrs - Seen and actually liked it<br>irreversible - ^^<br>frontiers - ^^^<br>antichrist - ^^^^<br>human centipede - seen like 3 times, the idea is the horrific part, not the movie<br>vhs - Loved all 3<br>audition - seen and legit liked it<br>hostel - I remember watching the first one and thought i would love that job lol<br>cannibal ferox - ^^^^^^<br>taxidermia - ^^^^^^^</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>thats a lot of movies lol<br>did you copy/paste from another thread or you just have them on standby lol</br></br>  <br>I have a .txt file at hand. I usually gather the titles from some threads I make about the related subject.</br>  <br><br>I did see Afflicted. It was reasonable. I mean, it was a great movie, but for my own reasons didn't really make much impression on me. So I'm not talking it down. It was very well made.</br></br>  <br>seems like a smart idea lol.<br>Ill look into these films, do you have any at all about shit like paranormaly type films. (for example grave encounters, exorcism etc)</br></br>  <br>Antichrist is a bit too "artsy" for my taste, but it's a well made movie nonetheless.<br>Cannibal is actually a bit difficult to acquire. Had to lurk some shady torrent sites just to dwn it.<br>Taxidermia is an instant classic.<br>Cannibal Ferox is utter shit.<br>Irreversible is "artsy" as well.<br>Frontiers is good.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It Follows <br><br>I jumped into this thread specifically to see if this had been mentioned. Kudos, man.<br><br>Besides being genuinely suspenseful, it's also gorgeously shot and has a cool soundtrack.<br><br>I never saw any trailers for it either. I decided to see it based solely on the poster.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ever watch "horrible reviews" on youtube. hes pretty good tbh, he's reviewed almost every movie that was listed lol</br>  <br>isnt it just about a girl that is followed by "something" until she inevitably dies?</br>  <br> paranormaly type films <br>Well tbh I don't. I reckon those movies have been milked for so long they aren't original anymore.<br>But if you're into some alien-type deal I definitely recommend "The Fourth Kind". Kept me awake for a couple of days.<br> When it comes to aliens I get scared shitless. </br></br></br></br>  <br>She doesn't</br>  <br>Salo it's like<br><br>yeah yeah, shit, no sex with womens, we have boy's, yeah yeah, rape and poop</br></br></br>  My husband wants to know if /b thinks that i am a milf (fyi my age is around 50)  In my opignon you look like a old trap.<br>Spread your legs, then we'll talk.</br>  <br>post more pics i need more image info.</br>  Need more pics to tell.

If you are reluctant to shave completely bald, at least use an electric razor.<br><br>b) belly is unfortunate, aside from the hair, vag isn't bad and tits are fine for your age.</br></br>  <br>dub dubs</br>  <br>That would be way better if you shaved a bit, you know ?</br>  <br><br>Nibble</br></br>  <br>Know how I can tell you're a eurofag?</br>  <br> great job </br>  <br>Hey, can I request you something ?<br>I'd love to see that pussy filled with a object.</br></br>  <br>Because I'm a civilised person?</br>  <br>Are you aware that your teenage son attending /b/ regularly will be able to recognize you by the rug and door on that pic? /b/ will save those pics and post it every day for him when he'll come here.</br>  <br>No, because your country's economy sucks</br>  <br>I'm sadly Eurofag, and I must agree.</br>  <br>that pussy got hella miles</br>  <br>i would fuck that dick off you, good job</br>  <br>Britain bitch, suck it.</br>  OP. Well, for a 50ish woman, you're in good shape, you look like you've had a couple kids but you've put in work to keep your body in good shape. I, personally, would like it if you shaved your pubes a bit more, not sayin clean shaven, but trimmed up a bit more would be nice, other then that, I'd have to say yes. You're a totally bangable 50ish year old milf.  <br>I find milf like this hot so..I'd tap that</br>  <br> Britain. <br>Wow. Despite the massive level of tax on everything. <br>Things in the UK cost like 150% of the price in the US.</br></br></br>    I see you're hiding your tattoo, who are you hiding it from? Is it famous or some shit? With where it is, how many fuckin people have seen it?  <br>things in the U.S. weigh 150% more than in the UK</br>  <br>  the U.S. <br><br>How's that 18trillion dollar debt going? Sick economy m80</br></br></br>  <br>Good catch, anon</br>  <br>no</br>  <br>If you can't fit your whole hand in there, you're not a proper milf. Post proof</br>  <br>you misspelled tiny</br>  <br>Nice. Yes, half your age and would fuck you.</br>  <br>fucking ginger.</br>  <br>Face or get the fuck out</br>  <br>very nice</br>  <br>Wow. You do realise I live in the UK. Hence I understand why it is shit here. <br>There is no need for patriotism. This country sucks. Also. Learn something before you start shit posting. <br>If the dollar dies. The whole world's economy will go to shit.</br></br></br>  31y oldfag here.. 9/10 would bang the hell out of you. <br>-1 because of the bush</br>  <br>These nearly quints proves your faggotry</br>  Eat a Rich Tea  <br> 31 <br>sure is old in here.</br></br>  <br>Get the fuck out kid, grown people are talkin in here.</br>  <br>And Britain's is only 1.56 trillion (in pounds). That sounds like a huge difference until you consider that the US's GDP is 8 times that of the UK. You live on a teeny tiny island and produce hardly anything.</br>    <br>depends on how long you are here... I was young like you guys when it started.. And now I'm here fapping to a hot milf on my mdma</br>    SHAVE OR GTFO  <br>You do realise that the US is the biggest importer in the world?</br>    <br>Omg no. Just fucking no. You are pudgy, tanned and leathery, and most of all hairy as fuck.</br>  <br> 12yo detected. </br>  I want to see some more pussy, ass, and maybe you getting fucked. Hurry up op!  how can one judge if your a milf if all you posted was a hairy split kipper? how about posting some non nudes maybe a face then i'll gladly give my input  <br>Very fuckable, OP. Let's have some sharpie in pooper.</br>  <br>Yes because anyone who likes women with a decent complexion and less hair then a man is obviously someone who should be underage b&amp;.</br>  Those breasts look everytime better inlook at them.. <br><br>Yeah more pussy!</br></br>  Excellent idea! Timestamp &amp; shave. Most older milfs will try to look a bit younger. You can do it as its only hair. Give it a go  Op, come on now, hell, I'll even ask nicely. Please, can we see the tattoo?  Hair on pussy is fine if you are below 30 but disgusting if you are over 30 ..  <br>It only sucks because you aren't making the most of it. Being a poor fag sucks. Otherwise you're just edgy. It isn't 'cool' to hate your own country, look around at the other options.</br>  <br>Yeah or maybe we don't ruin her life this one time. <br>If you don't fap with us go to your trap ahit</br></br>  <br>Damn right, we do services mostly. Want your kid to have a good education? You're probably gonna send em to an American university.</br>  <br><br>what the fuck?</br></br>  <br>You failed to make a point, thus wasting your dubs. We don't need to produce anything, production jobs are in the past/3rd world. We do shit now. We do the greatest law in the world. We do science. So what, we don't dig coal, who gives a fuck. Britain is the real land of opportunity, if you're prepared to get the education it's yours.</br>  <br>You do science? The US has almost all of the most prestigious universities in the world. You have like... Oxford.</br>  Only opinion i can give is looks like she is keeping her self in decent shape, too hairy for my tongue. hair hold on to smell and smell well nobody likes a smelly cum trap  <br>yes. it's the fuck.</br>  GOD WHY IS EVERYONE BEING STUPID IN A MILF THREAD REDDIT THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT!  You be pretty Ok if you'd shave, or at least trim, that bush.  <br>You have 3 universities out of the top 20.<br><br>http://www.shanghairanking.com/ARWU<wbr>2014.html<br><br>All the rest but 1 are American. Tell me again how everyone wants to go to school in the UK?</br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>you don't give me the fuck, I give you the fuck!</br>  <br>Tell your husband I'll be glad to experience you myself to find out if you're a MILF. btw, it might take several tries to be for sure.</br>  <br><br>Nice paki dick, faggot.</br></br>  <br>i would bang! if you ever need some young dick, call me</br>  <br>shave that shit.<br>lose 30 pounds.<br>we'll call you.</br></br></br>  give us bent over pussy shot.. i wanna see what a 50 year olds ass/pussy looks like  Shave and your fine  thank you all for your comments! Much appreciated.  <br>Yeah we do science. Just because we don't have a space station doesn't mean we don't do science.</br>  Stunning<br>MILF A++++</br>  <br>I didn't say everyone wants to come and learn here, so I cant 'tell you again'. I said that if you have a good education, the worlds your oyster in Britain. <br><br>Can you read?</br></br></br>  <br>Faggot</br>  You guys that don't like hairy pussy really don't understand the whole milf thing. Just sayin'.  <br>I'll break it down for you, OP:<br>MILF entails that you work out constantly, groom incessantly, and get a boob job/various other cosmetic procedures. <br>Gone are the days of the "natural" MILF.</br></br></br>  i would fill your pussy with jizz  <br>This faggot is wrong.</br>  <br>Nice bellybutton, would put my dick in it</br>  More pics you are a very fuckeable milf!!  <br>If hairy pussy is your thing, I'm cool with that but that doesn't change the reality of this woman's situation. She's a moderately attractive older lady, but there's not going to be dudes lining up to fuck her.</br>  <br> being this mad </br>  <br>I'm in line.</br>  <br> implying the economy doesnt suck everywhere. </br>  Clop thread<br> for random reasons /mlp/ is SFW <br>No fucking diapers<br>Anthro is okay<br>No political ponies it would provoke arguments</br></br></br></br>  <br>Bump<br>Oh btw i use tumblr just because MUH DICK</br></br>  I've actually made some top-rated clop myself, but I can never post it anywhere on 4chan.

We need oc and less cancer. So its time to move on. For now on kek is not the 4chan standard. The new term is now "Feg". When you see something funny you don't reply kek anymore, you reply feg.

Over, even a 1½ year employment a single maternatity leave will have paid off and since there are only 1.6 maternaty leaves on average in the western developed world (so not america with its retarded religiously based laws), it would almost always be super worth it - if it were true at least.</br>  <br>if you can't see the difference between a single individual's experience and a statistical study, then maybe the reason you haven't had a good female manager is because they realized how fucking stupid you are... <br><br>lrn 2 science</br></br></br>      <br>I think you need to learn what racist means.

Men tend to value their labor more and so they ask for more money more often (pay raises, higher wages). Women are more likely to never ask, and then sit there going: "Muh patriarchy" "Muh Muhsoginy".<br><br>You want more? Fucking work hard enough to feel that you're not being paid enough and then demand more. <br><br>I work as an illustrator/graphic designer for a living, so I freelance. If someone offers me beneath my worth, I'm not fucking doing it. Go hire some little teenage shit from deviantart. You get what you pay for though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>      <br>Adding to this:<br>But feminism is important, just as much in the western world! Not because women don't have rights, it's because they're treated first as objects, then as human beings. The media exploits the female body by hypersexualizing it to sell burgers and perfumes. Little kids see that stuff on TV and think that objectifying women is OK. We need to stop the vicious circle exploiting women in the media. Why are there so many body image issues in the western world as opposed to the rest of the world? I'll tell you: media<br> So of course that brings up the issues of how in almost all rape cases, women are seen as the temptress.. esp if she's wearing a short dress. Why? Because women are seen as objects first.</br></br></br>  <br><br>lol fucking nerd, this isn't debate class. I'm not going to avoid the fallacies of reasoning and I'm not citing you sources. You officially win the debate.<br><br>Lol women make terrible leaders you ninkempoop. Why do you think there's less female Generals? Ceos? Presidents?<br><br>It's cause of the magical "The Sexist Force" that all the jedis are using? No, its because women and men have different roles.<br><br>Why are black people opressed? because they're fucking monkeys.

It never does. What it does work however is making tumblr panic and raid themselves. Here are the basis:<br> <br> 1. You won't be able to post in the tags with a fresh account, don't even try it. Won't work.<br> 2. It's much easier and prouctive to go directly to these fucktards. Most of them have "submit" on their blogs, meaning you can fucking send images directly to them.<br> 3. A tumblrina will always open their ask box, they thrive for the potential dicks they could recieve.<br> <br> So what do you do? It's easy mein homo.<br> <br> 1. You use this page (or similar) http://www.fakemailgenerator.com/ to get a fake EMAIL direction. Keep in mind that you have to keep the tab open so you won't lose your temporary email. It's really easy and I know it works for all sites (I used for the wiimini trick last winter, no problems, and have used it several times for small raids).<br> 2. You make a brand NEW tumblr account. You follow the registration steps, whatever name is fine you just wait for the verification email.<br> 3. Using the email you created on step 1 you will recieve an email from Tumbl Staff, the tab with the email has to be open the moment they send the verification. You accept the terms and whatever. Now you're almost ready.<br> 4. Go to tags (tumblr.com/tagged/feminism , /tagged/otherkin , /tagged/trans , etc) and select INDIVIDUALS, if you're lucky you'll get someone with the option for a SUBMIT (http://tumblrdirection.tumblr.com/<wbr>submit) this means you can send images to their askboxs. If the person does not have a submit option just send a regular ask wth hateful words, preferably rape references.<br> 5. If there's a submit box you keep submiting your shitty pictures and please post the direction of the tumblr in the thread or the IRC channel so other people can submit too.<br> <br> YOU'LL GET BANNED. But you can just make a new account and keep doing it, they won't IP ban you. They're stupid.</br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this^</br>  <br>http://pastebincom/eKxifcY7 for instructions and come to the the tiny chat /letopkek we got like 50+ people</br>  <br>This.</br>  I hope I see lives in ruins when I wake up.
