Oh, and Roy.</br></br></br></br></br>   Wants to get a Famicom plus disk system for his birthday but can't afford shit. <br><br>I shouldn't be looking at them on E-bay.</br></br>  <br>They must be bribing you to say that.<br><br><br>Hey.<br><br><br>Me too.<br>Kind of.<br>I'm actually just here to hang out with you all. Kupo.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not masturbating right now, I'm too tired for that anyway. My man is just being adorable and I love it, so I'm just really happy right now.</br>  <br>Hello<br><br><br>He's doing some math 2 + 2 = hard gator dick.</br></br></br></br>  <br> not buying them with the cores already removed <br> expending effort to enjoy good fruit <br>It is not cruelty if it is enjoyed.<br>Do you like mangoes?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Your land? Wut.</br>  <br>We're all guilty of that. But you're right, cut it out.</br>  <br>You just want to maintain appearances.<br><br><br>He's done a few favors for me, yes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>A very large, hard gator dick!</br>  <br>Fucking knew it.<br>Can't trust anyone anymore.<br>Bribery everywhere.</br></br></br>  <br>Problem is, it's an amazing deal. less then $150 for the AV famicom plus shipping.<br><br>I'd have to pick up a disk system later some time though.<br><br><br>Sounds like a "Seen on TV" product.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>alastorstraining.jpg</br>  <br>Want some candy?</br>  <br>.webm*</br>  <br>I wouldnt expect any less.<br>Itd be weird if you were here to say, fap to porn or something. Nobody does that.<br><br><br> Right now <br>Ew. <br>But i'm happy that you're happy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I prefer to stretch out the fruit myself. Don't want a loose fit.<br><br>It's not cruel enough if it's being enjoyed.<br><br>If a man goes where?<br><br><br>My sovereign claims on your rump.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to save face in front of a person I don't care about? That makes sense. Do I have to tell Tay you're being difficult with me?</br>  <br>You need to be 30 years older to use a pedo van sir.</br>  <br>Bill me later is a thing.<br><br><br>Don't even try to woo me.<br><br><br>I don't have porn on my computer, so it wouldn't be abnormal for that in my case.<br><br>But that's lewd and being lewd is a form of being rude.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it was actually a png. I am ashamed.</br>  <br> and last on our sale is large hard gator dick <br> it is very big and pulsing! <br> look at that thing just pulse, bet it is tasty! <br><br>I already told you that I am too tired to fap, but thank you! I hope that your day gets happier too!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You have no idea how many times I've done this little stunt in a Desert combat and had people bail out, just to watch me pull out and fly away without them.</br>  <br>What if you already own a windowless van? Is it not considered a pedo van until you cross a certain age threshold?</br>  <br>Oh. Well you have no claim on it and you wouldn't want it anyway; it's a boring man butt.</br>  <br>So you don't care about me? That's not cruel or anything.<br><br><br>But I'm already 50.<br><br><br>Is it working?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Where no man has gone before</br>  <br>And so are credit cards. Have to have the cash to pay it eventually. I do, but, I have much more important things to pay for, like food!.<br><br><br>Don't buy them in single packs. Go to Costco and get a 24 pack.</br></br></br></br>  the fuck is going on in here, i came for dark souls  <br>If by stretch you mean break in half, sure.<br><br>Would a loose fit really be that bad?<br><br>Well I am waiting.<br><br>Where no man has gone before.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You need a motivation that matches your age.<br>That would make you look like a new age hippie.<br><br><br>Oh well uh, carry on.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not yet.<br><br><br>So stop looking at the stuff~!<br><br><br>...Kupo.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Look no further.<br><br><br>Want some candy?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I had no idea Costco sold them in 24 packs. I better get them before they run out!</br>  <br>I'm saying if I didn't care, why would I ask and want to save face? https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=VlU<wbr>ejOQCAIs</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>No it would still be abnormal. Just not as abnormal as Aces.<br>It is? I've never heard that in my life.<br><br><br>It wont, but i do appreciate the sentiment greatly.<br><br><br>You're right! I have no idea of that, because I didnt know you flew helicopters. I couldnt fathom it. <br>But i know many marines and that seems like something they would do.<br>You hilarious ass.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>It was a condition of the Treaty of the Marches.<br><br><br>My butt.<br><br><br>It's never been in half.<br><br>I'm afraid of hallways.<br><br>Waiting for a sating. <br><br>My butt.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Wish the mods would do their jobs and ban you avatarfags.  <br>Its like you miss me. <br> Insert sarcasm here&lt; </br></br>  <br>I sincerely hope you are wrong and something awesome happens that makes your day.</br>    <br>But I have an excuse coming up soon to treat myself.<br><br><br>They're having a huge sale.<br><br><br>I meant in video games. Also meant to say "Desert combat" not a. Was a mod for Battle Field 1942 back in the day.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Hey  <br>I'm just messing with you, Chet. You're a good guy in my book.<br><br><br>Now?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think I actually claimed your butt. But I have since rescinded that claim since I have another one.</br>  <br>You think I wasn't playing along?

Every night after we got wasted we'd play Deep Space Nine. Every time something went wrong we'd say "this is why you don't give a nigger a starship" and take a drink.

Going to chill with some ds9 tonight.  <br>Im on S1E5 of TNG.<br><br>I didnt start watching the show until i was in high school. But i best you get super nostalgia. Thats pretty cool.<br><br>Nice</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>TNG&gt;ds9&gt;voy&gt;ent&gt;tos<br><br>The reason I hate TOS is because I really fucking hate Shatner.

Its pretty funny.<br><br>That is good to know <br><br>TNG</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Has anyone checked out Star Trek Continues? It's fucking fantastic. <br>http://www.startrekcontinues.com/</br>  Oh shit, Skin of Evil's up next. I hate this episode. :(    <br>(picture of forever alone data here)</br>  <br>Rewatching the entire thing. Just finished TOS and TNG and beginning VOY. Currently at s1 ep6. It's so great.</br>  <br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denis<wbr>e_Crosby<br><br>In 1987, Crosby was cast in the role of Tasha Yar for the much publicized return of Star Trek to television in the syndicated series Star Trek: The Next Generation. She had been chosen to play Counsellor Deanna Troi before Gene Roddenberry switched the roles that she and Marina Sirtis had originally been given. Initially one of the top-billed characters and featured prominently in episodes such as "The Naked Now" and "Code of Honor", the role of Tasha gradually moved into the background as other members of the ensemble cast became a greater focus of the series. It has been reported that Crosby grew disillusioned with her role because of its "Uhura-like" status: "I was struggling with not being able to do much with the character. I had all these ideas and couldn't do them. I was just stage dressing."[5] Ultimately, Crosby decided to leave the show.</br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>She quit Star Trek! One of the dumbest moves in TV history.</br>  <br>Hard to choose. But I really like Voyager</br>  <br>Better question: Who doesn't watch Star Trek?</br>  <br>Kinda like dax not trying to renew her contract. Women are naturally stupid. Nuff said.</br>  I'm still a relative newcomer to Trek. Started about 2 years ago with TOS and did the big ones in chronological order. I recently finished Voyager and now im reallllly unwilling to do Enterprise, since I saw the pilot and of course because of all the stories I am not amused. Can anybody convince me why I should watch it instead of doing the animated TOS for example?<br><br>Also:<br><br>The Doctor &gt; Bashir &gt; McCoy &gt; Dem cunt doctor whores from TNG<br><br>Except McCoy gets extra badass points due to being a badass.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She left because of all the rape gangs. Plus drugs make you feel good.</br>    <br>Close.<br> tng&gt;ds9&gt;voy=tos&gt;ent </br></br>  TNG is great. Favorite line was between Q and Worf after Q had been kick out of the continuum.<br>Q: What do I have to do to prove to you I'm mortal?<br>Worf: Die.</br></br>  <br>The show gets EXCEPTIONALLY good at the start of season 3 right after the Xindi attack on Earth. Also Riker and Troi in the last episode</br>  <br>Bones was the shit you ass hat!<br><br>Watch the alternate universe episode of enterprise. Shit is cash. <br><br>Also that vulcan bitch is too hot.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>Man, how different would the show have been if Sirtis and Crosby had kept their original roles? Wow.<br><br>And fucking Armus, I remember this being terrifying to me when I was young.<br><br><br>Watch it. It's a good show as long as you pretend it has nothing to do with Star Trek.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>plus the doctor on enterprise is awesome</br></br></br>  TNG&gt;TOS Films&gt; TOS&gt; DS9&gt;TNG Films&gt; JJtrek&gt; Voyager&gt; Enterprise<br><br>All these fags putting fucking voyager and enterprise over TOS.... disgusting</br></br>  <br>This is why milfs are a thing.</br>  <br><br>Did I or did I not fucking say that McCoy gets extra badass points? I enjoyed TOS a great deal. Dat fighting was hilarious as fuck, as well as every McCoy/Spock scene.</br></br>  <br>Enterprise doctor creeped me out at first but he quickly became my favorite character on the show</br>  <br>Bill Crosby raped all those women</br>  <br>Every odd number star trek film was garbage. VGER was the worst of them all. I'd rather watch them fuck whales which they did in a later movie.</br>    <br>Straight males.</br>  <br>You still ranked him too low. He gave one of his fans money for a life saving surgery. Deforest Kelley was a god amongst men.</br>  <br>I thought they killed her off because she got into porn.</br>  <br>Where can I find this porn? I need to know for science.</br>  <br>TOS first season was unbearably boring. Didn't get good until the first Romulan episode. And then there were all the fucking planets that were earth "but" nazis, no adults, Romans, and so on. So many premises that felt like clones of other episodes. That being said I did enjoy the majority of the episodes</br>  watching DS9 right now (for the first time)<br><br>kept trying to watch it but could get past the first 3 or 4 episodes, stuck through it this time, its dope</br></br>  <br>Your two word bait shall not succeed, faggot.</br>  <br>The motion picture is the pleb filter for the star trek movies. It was honestly the best written movie in the whole series imo. Definitely had the best effects.<br><br>I actually love 1,3, and 9. I honestly really only think 5, 7, and 10 (emphasis on 10) are the only truly bad movies in the series. And Voyage home is great, fuck you.</br></br></br>  <br>Whale fucker</br>   all the aliens are just people with stuff glued to their face <br>This is why I love these shows.</br>  <br><br>I actually have a theory about this. Multiple people from the cast of ST:TMP have admitted that the directors wanted to piggy-back on the succes of Star Wars. Sci-fi was big but Trek is Trek and not Wars or Alien or whatever sci-fi with action and blasting and death and destruction. Trek is (but especially then when TNG wasn't even there yet) about exploration and discovery. Therefore they wanted to create a "very" non-violent, explorative sci-fi film, resulting in TMP. They realised their mistake afterwards, creating the best Trek film to date. So it's kinda okay.</br></br>  <br>Fascist</br>  <br>It's been years since I found it. Wasn't all that good either way. Only see tits.</br>  <br>It was more inspired by 2001 than anything</br>  <br>Broccoli!<br><br> j/k I liked barclay. He was much better on A-Team though. </br></br></br>  <br><br>You are not getting what I said. I'm not talking about the story. I'm talking about the fact that they (creators of TMP) wanted to piggy back on the succes of other sci-fi movies, most prominently Star Wars. Now my speculation is that deliberately chose a story with less violence and action to distinguish themselves from the other succesfull sci-fi movies. Hence the rather slow moving TMP story. I can not state it any more clearly than this.</br></br>  Imho <br><br> 1 - TNG <br>Brilliant, what Star Trek is and should be, embodies it all for me. Good storylines, great character development, best acting/cast of all the shows (and stories). Also, other than its resolution/ quality, aged incredibly well imho. Something comfy/ cosy about all the different worlds they visited, and the ship itelf.<br><br> 2 - DS9 <br> 3 - Voyager <br>These 2 were great in their own ways. Both had you bonded with the crew/ cast by the end like a sort of family. DS9 had slightly better storylines and less plotholes imho, plus the introduction of 7 of 9 was just a play to reach a wider audience (hurrdurr she's a blonde with tits and a tight suit) which was kinda cheap imo. Not saying I didn't find her hot or enjoy her borg storylines, but it was a low move. They didn't need that shit in TNG, why stoop to it for voyager? They should've come up with better stories instead of a pair of tits, and I agree with all the animosity the trekkie kate mulgrew had at the time that caused the bad atmosphere between her and jeri ryan. Still loved voyager and DS9 anyway.<br><br> 4 Enterprise &amp; TOS - TIED <br>This one was also great in its own way, but ended up dull/ boring/ repetitive for me. I can barely remember it now, but I remember loving the story in the last few seasons with the big war with those other races.<br>TOS was also great in its own way, and I think for a show from the 60s it has aged quite well. Bit too cheesy and dumbed down at times.<br><br><br>As for the films, I hold the TOS and TNG crew's films both close to heart. I don't understand why we never got films from the DS9 or voyager crews, when franchises like stargate (which i love but got dull into atlantis and was dead by universe) can spout out a load of films.<br><br>As for the new films - As sci fi movies, they're decent. As Star Trek films, they're shit. All action, all just to appeal to a big audience, none of what makes trek trek, can't just throw in some franchise references and fuck about with the timeline/ canon. Moneygrab.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Faggots and fat nerds  <br><br>Now you are being unreasonable. I was rating the characters and the actors performance of these characters. I was not taking real life events or action of the actors into account. And again, in my defence, as I have stated before, I gave McCoy extra badass points. I hereby rest my case and accept any judgement Odin my place upon me.</br></br>  <br>I didn't disagree, all I'm saying is the story is clearly very inspired by 2001.</br>  <br>Looky here! My 2-word bait done caught be a big fat greasy Star Wars faggot!</br>  <br> I agree with all the animosity the trekkie kate mulgrew had at the time that caused the bad atmosphere between her and jeri ryan <br>can you elaborate?</br></br>  <br>100% agree</br>  <br>Damnit Jim!</br>  <br>u r my friend i wish we could hang out and watch good shows together</br>  <br>Atlantis was fantastic. I've killed men for spreading lesser lies!</br>  hottest women of any star trek series?<br><br> T'pol master race </br></br>  <br>Can confirm. Enterprise was the only series I ever fapped to.</br>  <br>that dude is buff.</br>  <br>Gross, throw it back</br>  <br>Fucking A+, <br><br>agree 100%</br></br></br>  <br><br> present <br> not having fapped to Gul Dukat <br><br>I couldn't even imagine the world without.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>kes gets an honorable mention as she was cute as fuck. t'pol is sexy though, and for me sexy &gt; cute.</br>  <br>niggawat</br>  I hated ds9 because of kai winn. It was like watching kathy bates in misery. Bitch was such a turnoff.  <br>im watching voyager for the first time<br>s3 e15</br></br>  I'm starting to get into it. Binging.<br><br>I know what the vulcan death grip actually is now.</br></br>  <br>She turned into this...<br><br>That's an old pic. She's even uglier now. Look up a pic of mariana sirtis and be amazed. She got better looking.</br></br></br>  TOS: Repetitive and ridiculous, and not just because it was made in the 60s, I could not endure more than two seasons.<br><br>TNG: The real Star Trek for me, with real sci-fi plots with emphasis on moral and ethical questions.<br><br>DS9: Starts up a little slow, but turns out to be a great series. The Dominium War was a bold and interesting idea.<br><br>Voyager: Written for wider audience, but still sticking to classic ST basics. This crew was probably the easiest to bond with.<br><br>Enterprise: It was okay, but to be honest I cannot recall any episodes or season plots, and that tells a lot about a series.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ds9 is defiantly my favorite</br>  <br> mfw kes </br>  <br>mother of god<br><br>kes was gorgeous<br>what happened.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>More kes...<br><br>Try to fap ever again faggot!</br></br></br></br>  <br>http://waytofamous.com/images/marin<wbr>a-sirtis-07.jpg<br><br>can confirm</br></br></wbr></br>    <br>Kate didn't like the introduction of a blonde with a tight spandex suit. She was in star trek as a fan, a trekkie, and loved the franchise, the philosophy it embodied. Thought (rightly so) it was a cheap move by the producers to reach a wider audience and was probably annoyed that she had worked her ass off acting great for 3 seasons for them to bring in some blonde pair of tits to get a bigger male audience.<br><br>I personally loved seven of nine's character, but when I learned about the animosity between Mulgrew and Ryan I couldn't help but see it from Kate's point of view.</br></br></br>  <br>damnit forgot pic<br><br><br><br><br>More kes...<br><br>Try to fap ever again faggot!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Jadzia is my favourite from any show, even though TNG was my favourite series. I kinda wish Jadzia had been in TNG instead of Troi.</br>  <br>oh man. i watched a documentary with the captains on netflix. Voyager gets alot of flak from the fans but it was my favourite series personally (haven't seen DS9, but watched TOS, TNG ENT and VOY entirely). She seemed serious in her role, and wanted to bring the star trek atmosphere to the audience. it was cool to watch</br>  <br>Live long and prosper, OP. and may the force be with you!<br><br>Star Trek rules!</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck you! <br><br>That is all.</br></br></br>      I'm gonna dump these comic strips  <br>Haha, is that you, Marina?</br>        <br>gold top kek</br>    <br>DS9 is my favorite overall ST series</br>    <br>yes</br>    <br><br><br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Go frack yourself</br>  <br>You know what would be awesome? It would be awesome if we got some proof. Y'know, timestamp, tits, and face.</br>    <br>Confirmed. Jadzia was hottest chick on any ST series.</br>  I wish you wouldn't dump but the series really is golden.<br><br>http://chiefobrienatwork.com/</br></br>  i've been trying to get into watching DS9 since its the only thing Star trek that I haven't seen but man there are just soo many character and plot points i hate.<br> Space station, not a star ship <br> Major Kira is too much like B'Elanna Torres from VOY <br> Jake pls go, (didn't we already go through this BS with will wheaton?) <br> why must we keep constantly hearing about Chief o' Brien's wife constantly naggin and bitching on him? 2 much realism 5 me <br> is quark seriously suppose to be the comic relief? or is that the awkward doctor(who isn't funny)? <br> Dax is such an interesting character yet these damn episodes are written to cliff note her story/characterization <br> i like Odo because he's the only one who doesn't complain and does his job <br><br>seriously I feel like Gul Dukat might be my favorite character and he was hardly in the series.<br> always funny <br> badass/kinda arrogant <br> man of experience and well respected among the entire sector <br>i still haven't seen the entire series but so far my favorite episode of him so far is when DS9 goes into lock down and automated him is taunting the crew. I lost my shit during that episode when he came aboard saying he was patrolling the DMZ when he received a distress call from himself about a miner uprising. lmao</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Love this coming, though reminds me too much of work.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>These were the best two episodes of Enterprise IMO. Didn't have to take any of it seriously.</br>    <br>this^</br>  <br> seriously I feel like Gul Dukat might be my favorite character and he was hardly in the series. <br><br>just wait he is in it more later on, and the show overall gets better</br></br></br>    18 of chief obrien at work is my favorite.<br><br> No potato eaters! </br></br>  <br>the biggest problem was that it was supposed to be an Austrian spy drama w/ a star trek setting<br>and it was for the first 2 and a half seasons<br>then it became this bullshit "war against the unknown empire from the other side of the galaxy"<br>I quit watching after the Dominion plotline took over the show</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're pretty much getting it, tbh.<br><br>All of your issues with the show kinda straighten themselves out. Jake grows up, figures himself out; Odo and Quark play off each other a lot later and it's good.<br><br>Dukat and all of the bad guys kinda make the show.<br><br>Obrien's wife always sucks though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I took a couple seasons to find it's footing.
