How did you solve your problems? Or did you? Need advice? See if other anons can assist you with your shitty roommate problems.<br><br>I just finished yelling at my roommate. Like, insane, psychopathic "I'm going to anally penetrate your corpse with a chainsaw" yelling. I never yell. At anyone. I usually avoid confrontation. But this fucking guy... I'm staying in a large rooming house. At the moment there's only three people staying here. But out of the last four nights, I've only managed to get away with one night worth of decent sleep. This fucking loud Indian cunt, stays up all hours of the night, literally yelling into his phone. Not talking - yelling. He's not angry, he's just having a normal conversation. Except it's in Hindi. And he's yelling. And he's a cunt. If he's not yapping on the phone, he's talking to the other Indian two doors down the hall from me, and the sound travels straight into my room and wakes me the fuck up because he has zero control over his voice.</br></br></br></br>  (cont.)<br><br>Anyway. I got about an hours sleep last night. After being woken up yet again, I went outside and politely ask this shitskin to please be quiet, I've got lab work I've got to do tomorrow morning and I need to be up at 7am. Within 10 fucking minutes, he's back to full yelling, keeping me up for the rest of the night. I was fucked today. I couldn't even concentrate. All I could think was what I wanted to say to this obnoxious cunt. I caught myself talking to myself in public, rehearsing my diatribe through gritted teeth delirious from sleep deprivation.<br><br>I knew I had to say something. I wanted it to be rational, addressing point by point my grievances. Instead, I immediately went from 0 to I want to smash your face in. Honestly was kind of freaked out how angry I got. It just burst out. Probably lack of sleep had something to do with it. Afterwards I felt bad, he was really apologetic. But I had to say something. He's the kind of guy that you ask politely and could give zero fucks. He's pretty quiet now, but we'll see.<br><br>Looking at moving in to a 1 bedroom. Fuck rooming houses. Shitty fucking hovels.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I moved to a new city with a friend that I've never lived with before. I was iffy about it, but I couldn't live alone because rent was too high, so I was kind of stuck with her at first.<br><br>She turned out to be the biggest shit-roommate in the world. It took only a month before I was ready to murder her in her sleep for being annoying, lazy, retarded, irresponsible, etc..</br></br></br></br>  It's better to live poor as hell in a 1 bedroom or studio than with a single other person. <br><br>I guess my biggest worst roommate story is when I lived in a house with this dude and his GF. On top of dealing with hearing them banging all the time, they always ate all my food and never contributed. I ended up eating nothing but McDonalds for three months straight and everyone said I smelled like a cheeseburger. It was the cheapest way to make sure I never had to feed those assholes ever again.</br></br>  <br>Check'd<br><br> ate all my food <br>I'll never get why some roommates do this shit. It's fucking infuriating. And you know exactly who did it. I'm lucky enough to have never had to deal with that shit. The last place I was at, my roommates were good. And one of the things that attracted me to the place I'm in now is that you get your own little bar fridge in your room so you don't have to worry about assholes taking your shit.<br><br>You should've made a curry with shit in it and left it in the fridge. See how they like the butter chicken.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  had good looking blonde bitch move in, she didn't pay shit, invited her drug addict friends over. Made my life full on diff.  <br><br>This chick did some of the dumbest shit in the world and was also so lazy.<br><br>She would never do her dishes. Never. I like the house and kitchen to be clean, so I would regularly do her's while doing mine if they were in the sink, but then I found out she was keeping them in her room all week (too lazy to take them downstairs), and then one day after I'd do all the dishes, there would be a fat stack in the sink again with food and shit stuck onto them. I told her numerous times to 1. do her dishes, 2. do not let them sit in her room, they need rinsed or we'll get fucking bugs and shit, 3. if she doesn't I'll find a way to make sure she starts doing them. I got to the point where I stopped doing her's completely. When it would be time to do the dishes, I would take all of hers (cups, plates, pots, pans), shit was covered in food and smelled terrible, anyway, I would take them and put them in her bed under her blankets so she would think I washed them, but then find them later.</br></br></br></br>  <br> It's better to live poor as hell in a 1 bedroom or studio than with a single other person. <br>A-fucking-men. I'm such a dumbass for signing a 12 month lease here. Hopefully my landlord will continue to be a lazy cunt and fail to repair some of the shit on this property so I can break lease without having to fork out.<br><br>Get a one bedroom and smear the walls with my feces in glee. Big smiley faces everywhere.</br></br></br></br>  <br>At what point did you say enough is enough?</br>  <br><br>After finding the dishes in her bed the first time she freaked out. Yelling and screaming, then crying. She took all of the dishes downstairs and after I screamed at her like she's a stupid fucking child she said she'd do them. I left for the night and came back the next day to all the dishes in the sink again while she was out partying with her friends. They ended up right back in her bed. She came home drunk and tired late at night and flipped shit because she couldn't sleep until she pulled the nasty shitty dishes from her bed.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, that's pretty much all you can do. Or smash it in her room so shards of filthy plates are all over her room. Did she eventually pull her weight?</br>   Moved in with a chubby bitch. <br> Paid no rent <br> Fucked chubby bitch all the time <br> Made her cook, clean, everything <br> Used her car <br> Smoked her weed <br> Told her to hook me up with her asian friend <br> She gets pissed and says no <br> I move out when she's at work the next day. <br> Fucked the Asian 2 days later. <br><br>Yep, I'm the shitty roommate.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fucking cunt. You never really know someone until you live with them. That's why so many people don't like the idea of moving in with friends - they don't want to risk finding out that their buddy is actually a piece of garbage. A lot of people are actually a lot of fun to be around as long as you don't live with them or fuck them.</br>  <br>You are, but she's stupid for letting you manipulate her like that.</br>  <br><br>Never. She'd do the dishes once in awhile, but could probably count the times on one hand.<br><br>She was so fucking filthy. She smoked (I don't) in her room, I told her I didn't care though as long as she had a window open (wasn't supposed to smoke in the apt anyway), well, she used to sit at her desk and chain smoke. She'd go thru a pack of cigs like it was nothing, never getting up off the chair. Her ashtray would be overflowing to the point where every flick of her cigarette would end up on the window ledge she used. I wasn't there to see it, but I could tell what happened when I go into her room and see a barely visible ashtray covered with ash and cigarette butts and a ton of debris on the ledge and carpet below the window. I don't think she ever emptied the ashtray or wiped the window.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fucking pig. You should've tipped her ashtray down her throat while you shitter fucked her.</br>  <br><br>She also used to be really fucking stupid and like to go out and get drunk with her friends every day and come home late at night, but then she'd be too stupid and too drunk to figure out how to unlock the door. She would stand outside for at like 2AM knocking, screaming for me, and ringing the door bell because she couldn't open the door. I would sit in my room and watch her out my window for like an hour or so until she finally gave up. Once in awhile you could here her crying, but I didn't care. Never knew where she went or if she called a friend or something, but I also never cared about that. That was near the end of our time as room mates. I gave zero fucks about her at that point.</br></br>  <br>Do you still keep in touch?</br>  <br><br><br>After showering, she would throw her wet towel on her bedroom floor and then the next time she'd shower she would get a new one and do the same thing. After a couple weeks I got curious as to where the towels all went so went to her room the check. They were all in the corner of her room kind of under her bed. Given the heat and humidity in the upstairs bedroom during the summer + the moisture from her used towels, they grew this mossy fungus bull shit and little mushrooms. Shit smelled like a forest. I couldn't believe it. I put them all in her bed under her covers so she'd find them later.</br></br></br>  <br><br>After she moved out we didn't talk for about a year or so, but then she moved back in the area and we'd hang out once in awhile, have some beers at the bar, didn't have a bad time other than I still hated her in my mind. After awhile though all her shittiness kept bothering me, so one day I just stopped showing up to the bar we'd drink at, deleted and blocked her on facebook, and avoided her if I ever saw her in public. Haven't talked to her or seen her in about 5 years.</br></br>  <br> How did you solve your problems? <br>I'm not going to post my kooky experiences because I just posted them on /ck/ the other day.<br><br>I did, however, pop in to say that it's not really a shitty roommate if you can work out your differences.<br><br>It's only a shitty roommate if you end up moving out to get away from them.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Housemates really fucking suck. You need to get yourself an Chinese international student. Preferably a female. My innate racism tells me they'd cause zero problems. You'd barely even notice them.</br>  <br> if you can work out your differences <br>It's early days anon, early days. Just because I've given this guy a verbal tongue lashing (sorry for the strong language guys) doesn't mean we've worked out our differences. Realistically, I have no move. I can't beat this guy up, even if I wanted to. And if he's smart, which he probably is, he'll know that. I don't have it in me to spook the guy on a regular basis. My health doesn't allow it. So time will tell.</br></br>  <br><br>Meh, she eventually left because I was "too mean" to her. I explained that if I wasn't her friend and she lived with a random roommate found online they would have either beat the shit out of her or kicked her out after the first week.<br><br>She left, I paid rent by myself for a month, then some chick I was hooking up with (we were bf gf, but never really actually talked about it) moved in, she was smart, professional, had a job, was friendly as hell. We lived together for about 8 months before differences between us caused us to 'break up', but then we still lived together for about 4 months with no issues, then her bf at the time moved in, we all had a great time. got along so well, i was never a third wheel or anything, I knew when to give them space and shit. We all lived together for about 2 more months while I was securing a new place, and that was it. I lived solo for a few years after that before getting marriaged.</br></br></br></br>  <br> be me 18 at college <br> go to this club that serves Booz <br> have work in the am so I don't wanna drink <br> have 2 beers make out with 3 girls, grid dance have a good time <br> too sober to try and bring a girl back <br> these 2 girls we know wanna take a taxi back with me and a few of my friends, crowded taxi so they have to lap it <br> let's call her C, sits on my lap  <br> on the way back starts rubbing her ass on me I get hard  <br> leads my hand to her thigh and I start rubbing her thigh leading up to her pussy <br> we get back she goes to her room to get changed because we all wanna chill longer  <br> 20 minutes later damn they took forever her and her friend come back <br>  we chill in my friends room let's call him B <br>  B is hammered and left his room <br> now it's me C her friend and my friend P <br> I start hooking up with C on B's bed <br>  P hooks up with her friend and after a while this other guy comes in yells at P because he has a gf <br> everyone leaves but C and me <br> start getting her naked on Bs bed(asked him if I can fuck her on his bed earlier that night) <br> she's only in a thong and I'm in my boxers <br> she starts jerking me off while I finger her, she's wet as fuck <br>  I stick it in her and start pumping her pussy was kinda loose but oh well <br> out of fucking no where B comes into the room yelling asking to join in <br> tell him fuck off and me and girl get changed and go to my room <br>Cont..?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably for the best. Life is short, and cunts are-a-plenty.</br>  <br>The college I went to had a large population of chinese students, and I can tell you from experience that this isn't necessarily true. They tend to be really high strung, depend on friends for the level of emotional support we would typically rely on our gf/bf/whatever, and picky to the point of nuttiness.</br>  <br>It all worked out in the end.</br>  <br> Cont..? <br>No, leave us on the edge of our seats with this cliffhanger. Of course continue.</br></br>   Have two roommates in a 3br apt <br> One is a great friend, other is almost never there <br> when he does come in, he's always bitching about noise and how he has an exam the next day <br> i.e: I'm in my room watching tv with my headphones on at 10-11pm and he comes and knocks on my door and tells me to keep it down <br> motherfucker, i've got headphones on. if you don't want to hear anybody else pay to live by yourself <br><br>How did I solve my problems? Occasionally he would leave a bathroom door unlocked (He and my buddy shared a bathroom from opposite sides) when he left town. We'd go into his room and just move shit around, occasionally wipe our balls on his pillow. No homo.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>If I wasn't married, I'd still consider a room mate, preferably a short-term sublet sort of thing though. The fear of being stuck with somebody who is a shitbag for a full lease is brutal.</br></br>  1st year at university.<br>Shared a 2 bedroom unit with a friend.<br>He became all proud and brave away from home.<br>The house started smelling like the toilet.<br>Faggots coming around, walking around the place with their cocks hanging out.<br>I was afraid to use the butter for my toast.<br>Theses faggots are disgusting.<br>Took 6 months for the lease to run out.<br>Moved in to a 3 bedroom house with 2 chicks, best 2.5 yrs of my life.<br>Have to go through hell b4 u get to heaven.<br>Newfag are the worse.<br>Once they get through the coming out stage they become abit better.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah. If you sub-let can't you just kick them out if they're not on the lease?</br>  <br><br>Basically. Normally you would work out a month to month deal, so at the end of each month can kick or keep.</br></br>  <br> get to my room hop into my bed <br> one of my roommates is passed out drunk and the other isn't in the room <br> me and girl start going at it again  <br> blows me for like 30 minutes idk why but she did <br> after hops up on me and starts riding me for about 2 minutes <br> out of fucking no where my roommate walks in all pissed off about something (this is before I knew him well he transferred to my school that semester) <br> girl gets off me and cuddles next to me so he won't see her, my beds lofted <br>  be gets up on his bed and plays on his phone for 2 fucking hours  <br> me and girl make out and I finger her a little while she jerks me off <br>  start fucking her cuddle style for about 10 minutes idk why but I couldn't come <br> out of fucking no where my roommate wakes up and tells my other roommate to turn his phone off cuz the bright screen woke him up <br> roommate is pissed for sown reason and randomly fucking punches the ceiling then leaves <br> other roommate goes back to bed <br> I'm laying there dick still in this slut just watching this unfold <br> keep fucking her about to cum so turn her over ms eat her out <br> it's like 5 am now and my roommate has football practice so he wakes up and goes to shower <br> has no clue I'm fucking a girl kek <br> she rides me again and this time I say I'm about to cum, she hops off and blows me until I cum eating every last drop <br> get changed walk her out gives me her number text her for a day and don't ever again <br>Idk why but that bitch told everyone we didn't fuck and hates me for no reason now but yeah story about how my roommate is crazy and how I fucked C</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> If you don't want to hear anybody else pay to live by yourself <br><br>Well, that depends. When you're sharing a space you should both respect each others space to a degree. Although headphones in your room seems odd for him to complain about. I've got earplugs, so I use them to reduce the impact of noise from those walking around the hallway from me.</br></br></br>  <br>Who cares if they're dependent on friends? How does that affect your quality of life? Can't you just keep them in an enclosure and occasionally toss them some Pocky?</br>  Lived with this shitcunt friend of mine last year who used to blast ed sheeran while shaving...at 3am, when i'd have to be up for work at 7.<br>This guy had the easiest job in the world and spent ridiculous amounts of money while complaining that he had none and constantly asking me for money (which I never gave him).<br>He regularly ate my food and often left my frozen food out on the counter. Once I used his milk and he asked me to not do that anymore.<br>Never cleaned the house or (i'm guessing from his odour) himself.<br>A complete piece of shit who I doubt I will ever speak to again and I'm so glad to be out of that place. What's worse is that it was actually a really nice house..</br></br></br></br>  <br>Eww.</br>  <br>Fucking red dot Indians are some of the absolute worse creatures to live. Stink, dirty, greedy/cheap, loud, etc, etc... Seriously do some research about their country and find out how revolting it is. And they are CONSTANTLY on the phone. I. Fucking. Hate. Indians.</br>  <br>In his defense.. Ed Sheeran does make great 3am shaving music.</br>  <br><br>You think Indians are bad, Pakis are all that and THEN some</br></br>   move in with friends from high school <br> everyone mostly keeps to themselves <br> one of them lives in the refurbished shed out the back playing games all the time, one is rarely ever here and when i see him he's either leaving or just stopping by to pick something up <br> the other two are in a relationship and i never hear them having sex despite the fact that their door is open almost all the time because they have dogs <br> the dogs are absolutely fine and have never pissed or shit inside, only go in my room if i'm there, don't have to look after them at all, occasionally bark at things <br> sometimes people don't do dishes and i have to use a tray for a plate <br> the couple deal with all the paying bills and talking to owner business because they've lived here longer and it's all set up <br> rent super cheap, close to shops, close to bus and train stations, not far from university <br>thanks for not being shit roommates<br><br><br>Indian people are so fucking loud, jesus christ, I lived in a flat with my sister previously and we had like Indians on one side, some Pakis or some shit on the other, both of them talked loud as fuck, like yelling as normal conversation in their grating horrible voices, place smelled like curry all the time, constantly had tonnes of their loud shitty relatives over, walls paper thin on both sides and they wake up early as shit and start cooking REALLY loudly while yelling and singing, fuck me, couldn't move out of there fast enough</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If they're your roommates, that means you. They'll constantly come to you with all their problems, and if you blow them off they'll feel like you've wronged them and take it out on you in passive aggressive ways.</br>  <br>You know, if anybody ever asked me what I thought of Indians I'd say, "well, you've got your good and your bad just like every ra-politically correct bullshit politically correct bullshit". But deep down, I really think they're a bunch of foul smelling, ugly, creepy, loud and obnoxious skidmarks. Now I know this isn't true, but it's just the limited interactions that I've had wit-politically correct bullshit politically correct bullshit.</br>  <br>It's not an unforgivable offense, but the shitty things add up I guess.. to the point where anything that person could do would annoy the hell out of me.</br>   move in to shared house with 2 other guys <br> one guy is chill and we talk all the time <br> other guy is some weird white school shooter brony type <br> talking on the phone to my dear mother in india <br> she's hard of hearing so I have to speak up a little <br> brony creep bursts in to my room and starts yelling and screaming at me like he's going to kill me <br> ok ok man I'll be quieter  <br> my poor elderly mother can't hear me and I feel bad <br> speak up a little again <br> white devil almost smashes the door off its hinges and screams and spits in my face that he has lab and I don't know what respect is <br> then he slams the door loudly and leaves <br> I hang up on my mother and I cry a little because I'm scared of what is to become of me in this foreign nation with these angry lunatics everywhere </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> loud as fuck, like yelling as normal conversation in their grating horrible voices, place smelled like curry all the time <br>This is what I was/am going through. I'm willing to bet it's gonna go back to his regular old self in a bit. It's like trying to train a pedophile to fuck a woman.</br></br>  <br>I was kidding, that is an unforgivable offense. Sleep deprivation is a serious issue. It causes you to make shitty threads like this.</br>  <br> this guy </br>  <br>Yeah. I can imagine that getting annoying. I try to keep things all on the up and up as I say. The best roommates are the ones who aren't your friends. Because you don't have any of that shit to deal with.</br>  My best friend/roommate was living with me for years and was always loud doing his fucking drug deals at 2 am. He tried to be quiet though.<br><br>I bought a cell disrupter on chinavasion and hid it in an empty computer case. <br><br>Not only did it work so well that he had to leave to make calls, it ended late night parties and shit too at our house (I was always in attendance but didn't like the drug use iny own home).</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hello newfriend, I noticed you tried to greentext with complete and uter failure. Check out the FAQ; it'll knock a lot of that newfag off of you.</br>  <br>Cell disrupter?I never knew this was an option. I thought about it, but.. I've gotta get this.</br>  <br>Probably, they always seem so fucking oblivious to shit you tell them, like good fucking like trying to actually have a conversation with one, it's a challenge even communicating basic concepts like 'stop being loud all the time', or 'speak at a normal volume' or 'can you not make that absolutely disgusting deafeningly loud snorting noise every 5 minutes on the other side of my paper-thin bedroom wall while i'm trying to sleep at 6am', it's like they literally don't speak English even though you know they bloody well do</br>  <br>Never tell a story again. You just aren't any good at it.</br>  <br>Well I figured I'd think outside the box with this little issue and decided on yelling like a crazy person. Hopefully that'll pan out for me.</br>  <br>If you have a friend with which you share the same values and know for a long time, it's really cool. I live together with a really good friend of mine and we are both cleaning regulary, doing the dishes immediately. We sit together every day on our balkony drinking coffee or beer, he is just smoking on the balkony. Both of us use just our own food, but share the spices. He has a girlfriend, but she is cool and just visiting occasionally. Everything is just really chilly and good for over a year now.</br>  <br>Oh no. I thought that too if I'm honest. But I didn't want to actually bring it up. Anon was so proud and put so much effort into it. And in you march shitting on their dreams.</br>  <br>i forgot to say that i was often agrrsive so she was scared anyway</br>  <br>That makes her even downsier.</br>  <br>Just be careful, because in the US using them is illegal as shit. Not that that's always a case against doing something, but on the off chance you ever disrupt an emergency call... they will find you and you are going directly to pound me in the ass federal prison.</br>  <br>Eh had to rush it at work, coulda got into my detail</br>  <br>Yeah, I could see that. Me and Hutch. Solving crimes. A tall black guy somewhere.</br>  <br> had to rush it <br>I like that that was the rushed edition. Like there's a director's cut of this masterpiece.</br></br>  <br> it's a challenge even communicating basic concepts like 'stop being loud all the time', or 'speak at a normal volume' <br>It really was. You should've heard some of the shit I was saying. "Why are you yelling on your phone! You're on a phone! You don't need to yell! They can hear you! I can hear you! People in other fucking countries can hear you!"</br></br>  <br>If you truly are Indian I hope you get burned alive. <br><br> knowing he isn't Indian  <br> knowing he's making le joke <br> yet I hate Indians so much that I said that just in case <br> fuck Indians  <br> I would seriously kill them all if I could get away with it </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well.. I'll bet they're illegal here too then. God damn it.</br>  <br>some indian hate from /sp/</br>  <br> Indian smell like shit <br> Indian look like shit <br> Indian smell like shit <br><br>The smell so nice they said it twice</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Could make it more sexual and interesting, but I only really wrote it to have the story about my roommates being weirdos. I have so many story's about them</br>  <br> my detail <br><br>I take it you meant "more detail". But that isn't the case. It's shit. It's an awful story. It's bad. It sucks. It was a pain to read. It wasn't any good. It was not a good story. Do you understand better now why I told you to never tell a story again?</br></br></br>   move halfway across my country to go to another school <br> Move into a house renting the lower end of it from some family. <br> Their son also has a room downstairs so i kind of share it with him <br> He is some 30 year old nolife brony who doesn't work or do anything productive. <br> One night im about to go to bed <br> Keep hearing him skyping with some autists <br> go in, asking if he can keep it down a little <br> Oh yeah of course anon <br> one hour later  <br> Wake up Hearing mysterious sounds, kind of wet to describe it roughly.. <br> Go out of bed to investigate <br> It's coming from his room <br> grab a glass from my room to listen through the door to see what the sound could be <br> Put the glass on the door <br> door opens <br> oh shit.gif <br> He comes out naked with a big ass boner <br> I'm shocked <br> He freezes while his dick is throbbing with small bits of cum on it <br><br>Not really a roomate problem but still.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thank you for this Anon. I seriously hate Indians soooo much. Did you know that they still run off a caste system there? And also that they're one of the most polluted countries there is?</br>  <br>Eww. Did you both never speak of it like it never happened?</br>  <br>No one told you to read it faggot</br>  <br>I joked with him about it later on (a year or so)<br>But no, we never really spoke about it. Glad im out of that house!</br></br>  <br>I was trying to give it a chance. You went to all the trouble of typing it out I figured it was going to get better or that you would figure out how to tell the tale. But you didn't. What's it like getting your feelings so hurt over the Internet by an anonymous poster?</br>  <br> Did you know that they still run off a caste system there? <br>I don't know. That feels like one of those things that is probably more complex than I'm aware of. I don't think it's as straightforward as it sounds.</br></br>  <br>Oh look, another filthy Indian not understanding public space. I want to murder them all.</br>  <br>I love the "hi how's it going" little wave he does with his wanking hand. Fuck I would be mortified if this happened to me.</br>  <br>It isn't complex at all. You're born into your status. You can be born as an "untouchable" and the best job you can get being born into that status is a street sweeper. If you do a tiny bit of googling about that shittier country you will see how awful it is.</br>  <br>I'm crying thanks dick</br>  I have some nudes of her if you are interested...

Next time proof read what you write so you don't sound stupid.  <br>I'm an authentic African-American fellow from the city of Chicago.
