That's all that matters.<br><br><br><br>Just...?</br></br></br></br></br>  Broke up with my girlfriend and now regret it heavily, have done damage that cannot be fix.  I don't really know how I am doing. Just started a new job. Met a woman with very similar interests, but I don't know if she feels similar. Just taking things day by day.  Shit shit fucking shit.<br><br> no friends <br> no job <br> I love somebody that doesn't love me back <br> not like it matters, she has a boyfriend <br><br> wouldn't care if i died, contemplating suicide <br> ya depression <br> ya anxiety <br> moving to buttfuck wisconsin next tuesday </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shitty. Out of booze</br>  Ran out of drugs<br>So now I lurk</br>  <br>Things could be worse. After the posts I've seen on here tonight, that's pretty much my mindset going forward.</br>  <br>I can anon. You may be a giant faggot, but b would be lonely without you.</br>  you keep posting this thread.<br><br>i think i like it. a nice poetic touch to it</br></br>  <br>been there man. it sucks major</br>  <br>no it wouldn't, queer.</br>  came here for Jinx, so far I'm disappointed.  I just had an psychological test to enter the aeronautic area, results in 2 months, feeling like shit until then  <br>you are not alone, friend</br>  <br>If you are moving to a new place just leave all those bad thoughts behind. Become a beacon in the darkness.<br><br><br>Sorry.</br></br></br></br>  <br>its what im hoping for</br>  <br>I'm less disappointed now</br>  <br>Shitty. I don't know why, it's just been this persisting feeling I've had for a while now. Hopefully it'll go away soon.</br>  Good. Appraisal on house we want came in on target. 2 weeks to close.  <br>just lurk dude.... <br>just lurk.</br></br>  <br>Shitty<br><br>It feels real bad anon. I'm wasting my fucking life staring at a computer screen for no fucking reason talking to people that don't matter relative to my life.<br>The people who I actually care about and care about me are just a few meters away and I could get up right now and say I love them, or that I give a damn. But do I?<br><br>No of course not because I'm a pussy, or depressed or all of the above. Let it be tomorrow already.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Not shitty, but not good. Trying to get over anxiety about making an appointment with a therapist. I'll get there though.  <br>Why don't you get up and do it? It will be really awkward for you, but you just gotta break the ice and keep going. The rest will follow if you keep at it.</br>  <br>I'm feeling mildly not unwell. What's up with you, OP?</br>  <br>YOU'RE A KID YOU'RE A SQUID YOU'RE A KID YOU'RE A SQUID YOU'RE A KID YOU'RE A SQUID YOU'RE A KID YOU'RE A SQUID YOU'RE A KID YOU'RE A SQUID YOU'RE A KID YOU'RE A SQUID YOU'RE A KID YOU'RE A SQUID YOU'RE A KID YOU'RE A SQUID YOU'RE A KID YOU'RE A SQUID YOU'RE A KID YOU'RE A SQUID YOU'RE A KID YOU'RE A SQUID YOU'RE A KID YOU'RE A SQUID YOU'RE A KID YOU'RE A SQUID YOU'RE A KID YOU'RE A SQUID YOU'RE A KID YOU'RE A SQUID YOU'RE A KID YOU'RE A SQUID YOU'RE A KID YOU'RE A SQUID YOU'RE A KID YOU'RE A SQUID YOU'RE A KID YOU'RE A SQUID YOU'RE A KID YOU'RE A SQUID YOU'RE A KID YOU'RE A SQUID YOU'RE A KID YOU'RE A SQUID YOU'RE A KID YOU'RE A SQUID YOU'RE A KID YOU'RE A SQUID</br>  <br>Just got the promotion I needed to stabilize my financial situation. Now I can work an easy job and start persuing my dream as a stage director</br>  <br>I am neutral. Not good or bad. It's how I normally feel honestly.<br><br> <br>Don't just hope for it. Happiness that you deserve awaits you. All you have to do is reach for it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>trying to decide if I want to go to the club tonight. But im a beta faggot who cant dance but this qt3.14 is there and i wanna go. I really wish I just had some more confidence but I just cant bring myself to get out of this fucking shell. Sometimes i think I should just get in my car and drive and drive until I have no fucking clue where I am anymore then find a job and start over.</br>  Im too drunk to really type. I just texted an ex girlfriend who wants to text me. Need more alcohol before I can continue our conversation. Fuck you I shouldnt even post this. FUck you 4chan fuck you  <br>Yea its kind of hard to reach out and grab happiness when you keep relapsing into depression. like last weekend i was having the most fucking fun ive had in the past year, but the grips of depression were still pulling me down hard.</br>  I swear Iapologize like wilt fromFosters home for imGINARY friends.  feeling pretty content man, playing conclave with a close friend while /b/rowsing. how about you?  <br>I'm okay.<br>Me and my girlfriend of a year just broke up, and I don't know what to do to go meet people.</br></br>  <br>boo fucking who</br>  <br>an hero. let me sulk in self pity if i wanna fag</br>  <br><br>I'm doing good OP. Watching Lewis Black specials so I'm having a good time.</br></br>  I´ve been thinking of learning guitar, i read stuff on the internet and even went to check electric guitar prices and all<br><br><br>But everything i do is never done completely, i feel like if i even start playing ill leave it and dissapoint myself<br><br><br>...like i always do</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>got work in 5 hours. Haven't slept. Probably won't sleep. Roommate is gone for the weekend. Feel incredibly lonely. Everything feels hopeless. Especially any attempt to interact with women. Can't force myself to be gay, despite trying really hard.</br>  <br>I tried to type something that will maybe make you feel better, but I really can't right now. I don't even know how to fix myself, man.</br>  <br>I'm pretty shitty.<br><br>Mom might have Melanoma, all of the women I could potentially see myself either have boyfriends or I'm too chickenshit to ask them out before they get boyfriends. Like just yesterday, I was going to finally ask out the woman I like, only to find out that she obtained a boyfriend 2 weeks after I met her.<br><br>I'm shitty at meeting people, so finding another is going to be a task and a half. Its like life keeps saying "You don't deserve anyone." Including my mother as well apparently, since its trying to take her too.<br><br>What the fuck did I do to deserve all this shit? I'm kind to people, forgive things, courteous, and try to put other peoples needs before my own, and life just shits all over me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br/>  Today I came on my girlfriends face for the first time<br><br>twas very good and I'm still cheered up about it</br></br>  <br>FEELING SHITTY:<br><br>Broke up with my boyfriend today<br><br>got bit by a spider and it caused a blister that annoying as fuck<br><br>my fucking employer is driving me nuts<br><br>and im havign trouble with a commission art piece im workign on</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>depression is an emotion not a sickness, it's how you feel not what you're succumbing to.</br>  <br>Good luck telling that to some one whose bipolar. Or has clinical depression or the people who have the thousand other things that can give you depression.</br>  Shitty because I was seeing this nice girl and I went abroad and fucked some girl multiple times. Told her and she got pissed and won't talk to me, feel mega guilty and bad cause I fucked up  Feeling shitty, getting burnt out at work, not getting enough sleep. Drinking a Prairie Ale Bomb! and feel like I'm just wasting my life in a dead end job.  Things are okay, OP. Wish I at least had something to complain about. Life's not really great enough to say anything about, but nothing's really wrong. Been feeling like a Tuesday a lot. Not Monday at least, so there's no point complaining, but still not really a good time.  feeling shity. just ran out of weed until tuesday. scavenging my carpet for loose nugs  <br>I disagree, anon. <br><br><br>Sorry to hear that thing's are going to shitty right now for you. <br><br>Can we see the art piece?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  The shittiest shit that ever shit.<br>No friends, the ones I do have I cant talk about my problems to, depressed, trying not to self harm, being pitied by my family, social anxiety, suicidal thoughts, just a whole lot of shit honestly</br>  <br> thing's are going to shitty right now <br><br>Man I messed that up.</br></br></br>  <br>Not great. I finally started talking to this girl I've had a thing for since high school. We kicked it off great. Ask for her number "yeah Anon it's ____, I have a boyfriend so nothing sexual." Zero indication of any of this prior to tonight.</br>  <br>did she say it with a laugh or was she straight faced? she was probably just saying that as a formality. she'll want the d eventually, if you play your cards right.</br>  <br>Don't let tunnel vision bring you down. Still can be great friends with her sure that's not what you wanted but would you just throw her friendship away cause you can't be with her? You'll find someone else.</br>  <br>I'm taking a nice long dump. Feeling good!</br>  <br>sounds like a whole bunch of pansy-ass first world problems. just work on self-improvement and stop worrying about that pointless shit</br>  <br>I'm fucking pissed</br>  <br>She played into a joke, but I'll have to learn more about this mystery boy. May have to wait it out, or I'll have to break it up. Sadly I'm good at that.</br>  <br>I'm pretty fucking bummed. I'm leaving the state for college in about 5 weeks. I'm leaving my girlfriend, my best friends (Some have already left the state for summer quarter), my parents, and everything. I thought I was ready to go but it's just now starting to hit me that I'll be all alone until I start making friends down there. It's scary.<br><br>Also pretty good because I stole a bunch of cool shit today.</br></br></br>  <br>cool, no response from anyone, just what i need.</br>  <br>Yeah I'll keep that in mind. I still had a great time before the bomb</br>  Got a DUI, totaled my car, lost my job. At least I didn't kill anyone.  <br>bipolar just means you're emotionally unstable. all behavior come from who you are and what surrounds you. behavioral disorders are just people labeling bad behavior as a "disease"<br>If you're depressed then that's just your reaction to living a depressing life.</br></br>  <br>there's always a bright side. But damn DUI bro thats sucks</br>  I feel hype because<br><br>Y E L L O W D I A M O N D<br>E<br>L<br>L<br>O<br>W<br><br>D<br>I<br>A<br>M<br>O<br>N<br>D</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>"might have" So it's not a guarantee which is good, just keep up hope for the best possible news. As for the girl problem we all got em, majority of 4chin has social awkwardness. The best thing i can say is to just strike up a super casual conversation with a girl.</br>  <br>Sure thing bud</br>  Feeling shitty because I have no friends and no girlfriend and everyday is the same routine of going to work and then coming home and playing vidya until I go to bed<br><br>I never asked for this, it just sort of happened and I have no idea to get myself out of it because I'm a friendless loser.</br></br>  <br>I am the same way. Let's grow lonely together.<br><br>I just keep pushing myself into new groups and try to get experience at making small talk. That has helped me a lot with getting comfortable with strangers. Good luck<br><br>Sorry to hear about your mom.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She already had it once, surgery to remove it all. Looks like it didn't work too well. All the moles that were biopsied were pre-melanoma.<br><br> super casual convo <br>Would be a possibility if I wasn't a literal aspie.</br></br></br></br>  <br>who needs friends during the age of the Internet? just meet people online, as for the same routine take breaks from the video games and try literally ANYTHING different.</br>  <br>are you me ?</br>  <br>Dude I'm friends with 3 people that all have aspergers they seem like normal people. Hell even i can do a casual conversation and I have a speech impediment i get my sentences and words super jumbled sometimes.</br>  <br>I want to meet people in real life but I have no idea how to. Everyone I work with is like 20 years older than me and I haven't kept in contact with anyone from school.<br><br>I tried picking up a hobby and bought a guitar to divert my attention and make me seem more interesting as a person.</br></br></br>  <br> na bra fuck doctors, my opinions are facts. </br>    Ah yiss...the thread I was looking for. I was saying last night how I looked fwd to seeing this thread and how I was eating a pizza while my wife was on Netflix. Anyways....<br>Shit is same ol. I kinda feel like I'm in a rut. I just got home from work and ate and took a shower. My wife of 8 years said "Hey baby" from the bedroom where she's watching tv as I walked in. I said hey back, microwaved some kung pow chicken and sitting here on the living room watching the news. I could crash here on the couch or go to bed and there wouldn't be any dialogue between us at all either way, and this could repeat infinately 7 days a week if I allowed it to. <br>Sux.<br>She's not cheating, nor am I, we just both could care the fuck less. <br>She works, I work, bills get paid, we have our house and shit. <br>Typicalness. Whatevs.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>That's how you know you are comfortable around someone. When silence isn't awkward. Should cherish that, anon.</br>  <br><br> Valut 101 </br></br>  <br>Ur right. We have our Sundays , we do fun shit, I'm actually not complaining...just the Monday thru Saturday routine is a bitch.</br>  <br> fallout4.jpg </br>  <br>dude you can't get a hobby based on what you want other people to view you as. Just do stuff you find interesting. Shit I collect warhammer fantasy and the only people that do that shit are neckbeards and obese dudes. It's all about what you wanna do not what you should do to impress others. You don't need to act interesting to be interesting to other people.</br>  <br>Shiiiiiiiiit. What's your favorite warhammer fantasy book? Mine is the Malus Darkblade series. Gotrek and Felix is a close second.</br>  A twin ive been hanging out with doesnt like me, i like her, her twin sister likes me, i dont like her, yet my friend does, wut do 4chan  <br>The main counterargument to free will is that we fall into repetition, and even after realizing what direct change in action would lead to a new path, we never act upon it, because the change is never, ever, presented as a direct choice.

But apparently she likes me so she would rather probe me for my feelings of her and shit. <br>People like her are the fucking worst.

Just didnt know it til i ate it on some ice and broke a chunk of the labrum off into the joint<br><br>the gov't wont cover shit since i have insurance on the mortgage. They count that as income so according to them i make too much. I have to lose my house before they give me any help at all. I had short term disability but since i filled out all the paperwork when i was 20 i fucked up and didnt realize i needed to pay extra for long term.

Most of my friends are your average social university students, so they're out and about at whichever party presented the best combination of alcohol and women. Our house is a few miles out of town. It is very dark tonight. Have any of you ever felt a power in the darkness? I know it sounds kind of gay when you say it like that, but there's no other way to describe it. I have the sensation that there is some kind of energy in it. Anyways, to answer your question, I am feeling a strange mixture of curiosity and fear. Hopefully a friend comes back tonight, but I won't keep my hopes up.</br></br>  <br>Does it really make sense to force someone to lose everything before helping though? I literally have to be homeless before they will help. It can take months for shit to get going inde you apply. It doesnt make sense to have soneone lose everything and start from scratch and be an even bigger burden on the system then just when all i needed was a couple hundred a month to help me break even til i rode this out.

Especially cars with part specific windows</br>  <br>i recently had a surgery this summer and ive been having to use the pain killers to fall asleep or else ill just stay up all night doing nothing its fucking terrible</br>  I feel amazing. Actually anxious and excited. I met a wonderful girl a couple of days ago and we've really hit it off. We swapped poetry and stories we've written, share the same taste in music, and share a love of movies. She was depressed the other day and today I opened up that I was worried about her and she thought it was really sweet. I got her number and texted her for most of the day. We've made plans to hang out together in the city in a week where she's going to show me her favorite places. Best of all, she's so smart and introspective. On looks she's an 8/10, but her personality could make her the perfect catch in my mind. Here's the problem though. This has happened to me before. She's sending me emojis and long texts, but a part of me is afraid maybe she's just a really nice person. She definitely is caring, but I want to care for her and really make a relationship work here<br>I'm terrified that she may not actually care for me like I'm reading. I don't really know what to do. I've been mislead before.</br>  <br>now theres three of us in here... woo?</br>  this world turned out to be far, far darker than i thought. really hard to get over that. ever since i realized that i ended up researching a ton of awesome concepts and history.  Well, the Ash vs. Evil Dead trailer came out, so I'm feeling especially giddy. Seriously, I can't wipe this fucking grin off my face.  <br><br>what did you like most</br></br>  <br>I liked most of it. The floorboard shotgun was pretty fucking awesome. Wasn't really a fan of the music they used for the trailer, but I know it won't be in the actual show, so no big deal. That new monster/deadite thing looks really good too.</br>  feeling shitty because i'm a lonely loser  <br>I'm feeling super duper! I actually replied to one of these threads last night about my boyfriend playing too much vidya. But I'm okay now! I'm going to the mall with some buddies tomorrow, including my boyfriend, so I really look forward to that. c':</br>  <br>be lonely with me</br>  <br>BRUH I FEEL YOU</br>  <br>play vidya with your bf</br>  I feel like shit because my ass looks weird and idk why.  <br>It's 10 am and i'm getting high. Is that a bad or a good thing</br>  <br>Yeah, I should probably do that. Thing is, he always plays vidya with his cousin and some other dude I don't know, so I never get the chance to play with him. But I will once we have some spare time!</br>  Poorfag with advanced degree that works at walmart, IBS, but honestly being a white american is pretty sweet overall.  <br>we can both be lonely together</br>  <br>Why you feel lonely anon?</br>  Feeling like shit, my keyboard broke, I have to use a crappy, online one until it's fixed.  I am constantly feeling both shitty and great, making me an apathetic person. I'm sure many of you Anons can relate. . .  <br>... Or you could just buy a $10 throwaway keyboard.</br>  <br>It's built into my laptop.</br>  <br>I know how you feel, dear Anon. That misleading can really be crushing and devastating, but try to be positive on this one. Forget about the past and focus on your potential future with this lady of yours. Follow your heart and just take in those positive vibes. In with the good, out with the bad. I wish you luck on everything!</br>  <br>Then buy a replacement and swap it out yourself. It's literally 4 screws and a cable. It takes 20 minutes.</br>  <br>don't really have anyone close to me. sit on my computer all day doing stupid shit all by myself everyday</br>  <br>I felt the same ever since i broke up with my long term gf. It helps to occupy your body and mind. Have you considered taking time to improve on yourself? For example, i learned sleight of hand because it was something I've always wanted to learn. Anything that you have a passion for anon?</br>  <br>Go to work. Come home and sit on computer. Sleep. Repeat. That is my daily routine. I like to pretend that I am happy. We are broken human beings.</br>  <br>I do that. I legitimately am happy. My work isn't what I would prefer to be doing, my home isn't as comfortable as I would like it, my computer isn't as powerful as I want it to be, but my sleep is fucking PERFECT. My dreams are spectacular. My life isn't great, but when I lay down for the evening my real life begins. The joy I get from my dreams softens the edges of my waking life.</br>  <br><br>if you don't know her well enough to understand if she's just being nice then you shouldn't pursue a relationship. you're giving out way more love than you're taking in and that's unhealthy.</br></br>  <br>pretty passionate about a few things (mostly certain video games) but i'll never be any good at them.</br>  <br>yup. if only we could just fix everything with the simple push of a button</br>  Constantly thinking and comparing myself to others and getting so mad and jelous I don't have things others have resulting in me pushing away people who want me because I suck ass at believing they don't want something else  <br>Being passionate about something is good. And i know it's probably difficult but don't talk yourself down. Never say "I cant. I suck. Ill never ____" that is ridiculous. The only person stopping you is yourself. There is always room for improvement. What games are you talking about?</br>  <br>Wait for Fallout then,you fucking attention whore</br>  conflicted and confused. not sure about a lot of social situations and what they actually are. have an entire society trying to bring me down. so many lies about me. people don't even require evidence, they just believe every rumor they hear.  <br>It looks like a reaction to a chemical. I recommend you stop using detergent.</br>  <br>feeling kinda bad because i havent worked out any day of the week <br>Feeling great because i bought a mini drone and i cant wait for it to get to full charge so i can buzz that motherfucker all around my room</br></br>  I'm feeling great. I'm fucked up on whiskey.<br><br>So, on the fourth, I ended up cuddling and making out with my gay neighbor. It was great, but I told him the next day over facebook that I didn't want to keep going that way. He didn't reply. We avoided each other all week. I was so fucking worried I hurt him. Well, I just had a lighthearted, honest conversation with him, and he feels the same.<br><br>I never thought my first kiss would be with another man. It was so romantic. <br><br>Here's what I'm listening to.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=DBJ<wbr>fHuyGpsI&amp;index=2</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Happy friday, everyone!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Bored as fuck,quite fucking happy with my life.Have a small inferiority complex from non supportive parents,but now that I found the love of my life,we'll iron things out.Mostly just waiting for Fallout 4 right now  <br>Jesus fucking christ someone responded. Thank you man. What should I use instead?</br>  <br>You can try one of the organic/natural ones. You might not react to them.</br>  <br>It's Saturday,you cunt.</br>  <br>hyper as fuck and just enjoying my anime</br>  <br>checking my own trips</br>  <br>fuck<br><br>Someone accuse you of child molesting or something?<br><br>You may feel broken, but if you must compare us to machines, then I prefer the phrase "on standby"</br></br></br></br></br>  Shitty bc im trying to cope with not being my significant others first pick.  <br> not knowing how time zones work </br>  <br>little game called osu!. i click circles all day pretty much</br>  I hate a large group of connected people and meet them everywhere i go. Kinda scared about a few of their members because they're smarter and richer than me and I think I know what they want to do.  <br>Your best friend fucking your 2 years girlfriend isn't cool...</br>  I'm doing okay. I went out tonight, got drunk. My ears are ringing from the bar. Obsessed all day but I'm feeling okay now.  <br>Feeling great. I got a date with a 7/10 who I've been flirting with for a while.</br>  Shitty. I can't sleep and it's almost 5 am.  <br>Feeling tired. It's 4 AM.</br>  <br>Obsessed with what? A woman?</br>  <br>I've checked multiple timezones before posting to be sure.It's saturday everywhere</br>  <br>I love that shit. Have you changed your mouse sensitivity? It might help. Also practice obviously. To be a professional in something you have to invest 10,000 hours in that particular craft (forgot where i read this). Take your time man, just figure out what you are doing wrong and improve on that.</br>  <br>i know that feel anon just stay up all day and go to bed tonight but if you cant try warm exercising your self run in place pushups.<br>Not op by the way <br>I have stayed up 7 days before its painful</br></br></br>  <br>I feel strange. It's not shitty or good; it's just... strange and difficult to articulate. On the one hand, I finally manage to snag a job I've been after, so I finally have disposable income. On the other hand, I feel all of my good habits disintegrating and I worry I'll put the weight back on. Then there's the weird situation with my girlfriend and the fact that I have no idea what the fuck I'm doing with my life. Shit's hard, yo.</br>  <br>Yeah I had a bad break up about 2 months ago, and I haven't been able to get it out of my head.</br>  <br>Oh, my nights going greath so far. I just cracked open a bear and about to play some Terraria</br>  <br>I hope you feel better soon man, do they have legalized marijuana where you're at? Apparently that stuff helps a lot.</br>  <br>actually i play with a tablet, haven't used mouse since 2012. i've played enough to know by now that i'd only be one of the best if i got impossibly lucky. thanks for the advice though, i'll work on it. :)</br>  <br>kek, did you get that from that old greentext?</br>  my life sucks dicks and i ran out of weed  <br>I've always used detergent. Any idea as to why the<br> sudden reaction?</br></br>  <br>sudden reaction? did you quote the wrong post?</br>  I want to kill myself, but too much of a pussy. Like every god damn thing in my life.  <br>I believe!<br>DONT LET YOUR DREAMS BE DREAMS. Just DO IT!</br></br>  <br>What has driven you to want to take away the one thing every living creature tries so hard to preserve?</br>  <br>maybe one day :) btw, just wondering, are you "kaoru" or "haxsu" from osu! ? seem like the kinda guys to be here. sorry if you aren't, just curious.</br>  <br>As some one who has full blown bi-polar and has lived with it for the last 10 years medication free/ self managed. You are full of so much bullshit I just literally had to use my deodorant all over my room because the smell was wafting out of the computer from that shit post.</br>  <br><br>Dodging debt collectors, jobless, damn near homeless, my brother will be making over 200k if he plays his cards right and I just feel like such a piece of shit compared to him. He paid for my car insurance in January and I have to ask him for even more help. I'm a goddamn parasite.<br><br>Either I continue leeching off those around me and struggle to make my life less pathetic, or I shoot myself. Suicide is looking good. It has for a long time.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Expand son. Learn shit, be good at shit you love. Doing these things will help you learn to love yourself. Truth be told, being alone isn't bad. What is definitely worse is being with someone that makes you feel like you're alone.<br>And no man sorry :( I haven't touched my osu in ages i need to redownload it actually. I built my pc and still need to dl programs and such.</br></br>  <br>ah i see. i wish you the best of luck with your osu! journey as well!</br>  I feel fucking great. New relationships are great. I spent all day fucking and cuddling. I can't remember the last time I was this happy.  <br>You're in need. You are blessed to have a brother that is willing to pull you out. My own father wouldnt lend me 5 dollars. See this as an opportunity to start changing your life, not throw it away. First you nees to identify the problem. Second come up with a resolution. And you aren't alone. Seek advice if you don't know wtf to do. A man pays his debts and you owe your brother. It's the least you owe him. Are you willing to man up and find your solution?</br>  /b/ros, how do I talk to girls? I don't have any girl friends but i want to be in a relationship and it's really upsetting me that I can't even TALK to a girl, much less become friends or even start a relationship.  <br>fuck if I new man I wouldn't be here browsing b on a sat night. At that point where I don't know how to connect to people in general to the point I get so burnt out I am retreating into myself.</br>  <br>Girls are just people man. If you talk to them like you would with one of your best friends, they'll most likely respond. Girls are very intuitive so if you are genuine and you are yourself around them when you speak they'll appreciate that and might even dig it if you play your cards right.</br>  I feel like murdering some chickens.<br><br>I need more for the swarm. BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD<br><br>SKULLS FOR THE SKULL THRONE</br></br></br></br>  <br> cracked open a bear </br>  <br>Im more focused on self improvement than video game mechanics as of now. But I appreciate your enthusiasm! Any good maps you recommend?</br>  I'm pretty inbetween in truth. I'm probably in the best shape I've ever been, but I'm back home from Uni and it makes you realise how shitty some of your friends are. I have a wonderful family, but I'm sat like a faggot pining after an ex gf from about six months ago. She told me yesterday it wasn't gonna ever happen again, which sucked. I haven't really got a huge reason to be sad but... Here I am. Makes me feel even worse reading this thread and seeing people with real problems and I'm sat here feeling sad over, in reality, nothing.  <br>Pain is relevant anon. What you feel is as real as anyone here. But you are right about the girl, fuck that bitch. You don't need that bitch in your life. Bringing you down and shit. Be proud of yourself and your accomplishments. My next beer will be to you so cheers man.</br>  <br> &lt;- This guy knows what he is talking about.<br><br>But I'd like to add a few things:<br>-Don't be too shy, be "outrageous". You will meet plenty of other girls, so messing up with 1,2, or 10 won't matter.<br>-Be authoritative. Don't say "Will you go to the movies with me?", say "We should go to the movies". Turn your questions into statements/commands.<br>-Always have a plan, but don't overthink something. If you are going on a date, plan on things like location, time, food, and possible topics if the conversation gets slow. But don't plan down to the minute or extended conversations.<br>-Try to keep the conversation light. While serious, deep talks are important, they have their place. And it isn't during conversations with people you barely know. Also, don't change the topic too often or suddenly.<br><br>If you want, I could offer some more advice, but the main challenge is in your head. If you can't overcome the fear you've built up around talking to girls, then you won't be able to do it.<br><br>But I believe in you anon. Any and everyone can do this. So do it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Damn son. Preach it. Though you fucking up spilling the Alpha male secrets man. Now a motherfucking yugioh master named jimmy is going to steal yo girl. <br>Bullshit aside, this right here is sound advice. Take it to heart anon. Girls differ but you'll learn with experience.</br></br>  blank shitty feeling. on drugs that make me lazy and difficult to work with, about to lose highest paying job i've ever had because of absences due to it, but also don't care too much because for the first time in my life i'm confident in my sexuality and how i present. really, really want to quit my shit job, update my license, buy a motorhome and travel but i have no idea where i'd put my stuff without blowing all my money on storage.  <br>Hallie?</br>  <br><br>Dammit, I forgot something.<br><br>Don't place too much importance on relationships. While it is healthy to build/maintain relationships with people, dating and such isn't top priority. Before you go trying to get girls, you have to make yourself someone that girls would want to talk to and date. And a major part of this is being happy with yourself. And surprisingly enough, it has almost nothing to do with being fit. Being fit is good, but muscles =/= girls. <br><br>Have some good hobbies, learn stuff, become cultured. You will naturally meet people and you'll become better in the process.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  The ride never ends        Try to imagine a color that doesn't exist.
