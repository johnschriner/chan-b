The whole "miracle" thing isn't about either one of those events, but the combination of them. Though surviving a plane crash isn't a small thing in and of itself.</br>  <br> &gt; <br> cutters make the best lovers </br></br>  <br>too slow:<br/></br>  <br> i live in norway, <br><br>enjoy ur muzzies and being a 3rd world nation<br><br>you have lost your right as a country to post in our threads<br><br>kthxbye</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Norwegian AKA supermensch here.<br><br>Yes.</br></br>  "Miracles by their definition are meaningless.

LOOOOOOOOOOL, THIS IS REAL BRAVERY!  <br>HOLY SHIT I HAVE THAT SAME FUCKING BASS</br>  Unless she was like, being attacked by wolves, or bears, or ewoks, she really didn't do a damn thing that was impressive.... I mean sure, I wouldn't really like being in the woods for 2 days, but it's hardly some difficult feat to overcome.  <br>THE WOODS RAPED HER <br><br>WE NEED FEMINISM TO CUT DOWN ALL TREES</br></br></br>  <br> takes a picture of her scratched up tits after she gets back from surviving the woods and a fucking plane crash <br>pretty based if you ask me</br></br>  <br>2 days in the woods huh. like an entire lifetime. what an accomplishment</br>  <br>holy fuck 1 hour long tldw</br>  <br><br>*almost* two days.

Yes I could survive.</br></br>  <br> posts tits with no face or defining proof whatsoever <br>that's cool. Thanks for a shit thread. Not even her.</br></br>  <br>I'd bang her</br>  <br>if you put your hand over her nose and mouth, she looks fucking 10/10, no joke. Like some hot video game main character or something</br>  <br><br>OMG</br></br>   2 days  <br>Fucking pathetic.My parents left me in the middle of nowhere countryside when i was 12 years old because i misbehaved in car.I instantly started to look for some good wood and building my own house.Stole some cattle and breeded them,trained some black hikers to serve me now i have my nice little farm here in the woods but i dont get to appear on theguardian,why?Because of this fucking generation of no good niggers.</br>  <br>I'm not going to really contribute to this thread, but I wanted to say the reason her eyebrows are shaved like that aren't because of some edgy me style or some shit. It's because she does the other half with makeup to create her own arch that's visibly clean but still looks natural because the first half of her eyebrows are natural. You can get the idea here <br><br>Just for the /b/tards who don't have girlfriends and don't understand this shit</br></br></br>  <br>This sounds like a book probably written in the 1900's but i can't quite put my finger on it</br>  <br>No she doesnt. Ugly as fuck either way, also looks like a dude. Raise your standards bro.</br>  <br> Just for the /b/tards who don't have girlfriends and don't understand this shit <br><br>implying it's common for grills to constantly shave off their eyebrows</br></br></br>  <br>she looks like she could use some.</br>  <br> her 911 call is super emotionless <br> doesn't care about the other survivors <br> says "I'm the only one who survived" without tearing up or giving a shit <br><br>she has superpowers and caused the plane to crash, calling it right now</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Whatever anon.<br><br>My parents left me in the woods for 6 years and when I found my way back they electrocuted me to make sure I learned my lesson.</br></br></br>  <br> she has superpowers and caused the plane to crash, calling it right now <br><br>she was texting her bf while the plane crashed, giving no fucks<br><br>srs</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why aint He a suspect yet?He was the bomb.</br>    <br>Conspiracy theory: she was targeted and the plane crashed in order to kill her. Why, I don't know. But listen to the recording of the Lieutenant in the second video on the Guardian. He's completely emotionless and says "People generally just don't survive these type of incidences... We definitely want to hear how she was able to survive this"</br>  <br> 2 days in the woods <br><br>CRAZZZYYY!!!!!</br></br></br>  <br>Well hello there, heavenly blessed beauty, whose inner beauty is simply diving and everlasting, I would love to be your knight in shining armor. If you want to talk to a good friend, honest, sweet and tender, you can do with me at any moment, I am a good person, kind, loyal and sincere. My friendship that I offer you is clean and transparent. I congratulate to you, because you are very beautiful, your beauty, your charming figure, your pleasant and angelical smile, your personality, your happiness, your charm, your kindness, your beautiful eyes, your lips soft and exquisite, delicate your hands, your legs precious Your beautiful, spectacular and divine body, you have all these qualities and more, you are a wonderful and perfect woman, your gaze is tender and sweet, penetrating my soul. The beauty of a rose has no comparison with the sweetness of your face and the beauty of your heart. I am of the people, I like to have a good relationship with all my friends.</br>  <br>Could easily "survive" 2 days in the woods. You can literally just sit there and bide the time, boredom would be your only serious worry. Dehydration would come into play... but it's not like she was in the Mojave, water can be found. It would be a bit uncomfortable I guess, but that's it. Also, people who wander around without even basic survival gear on them are retarded. I'm not some tinfoil prepper maniac, but I always have at the very least a knife on me. She easily could have lost a backpack or purse or something so I can't blame her for that... But a knife and a lighter should be carried by every human being. Kudos to her though, she's not super ugly... I wouldn't mind throwin it up her ass in the woods.</br>  <br><br> “She’s just an amazing kid,” David Veatch said. “There’s more to her than she knows.” </br></br>  <br>Try surviving 2 days on the streets on the south side of Chicago as a white man then we'll talk</br>  <br>“She wanted McDonald’s. How do you go through that situation and just go, ‘I really want McDonald’s right now’?” [Newton Goss, her boyfriend] said.</br>  <br>from the thumbnail i thought it was preditor playing a solo on a drumkit</br>  <br><br><br><br>I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you’re referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.<br>Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called “Linux”, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use.<br>Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine’s resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called “Linux” distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>hell ive slept for 2 days, so wat</br>  <br><br>2 days alone in the woods is pretty good for an urban Emo chick. I'm glad she survived but her achievements were not sufficient to be considered a "Hero". Thats just the Press creaming themselves.<br><br>On a related not, I would love to fuck her in every hole.</br></br></br></br>  <br> “She wanted McDonald’s. How do you go through that situation and just go, ‘I really want McDonald’s right now’?” [Newton Goss, her boyfriend] said. </br>  So does it make you a hero if you manage to save your own life?  <br>you'd just wake up in an anthill as the rescue helicopter found you</br>  <br>Well if you were in the crash with her, say, during the winter while it's freezing, you'd have to fuck in order to stay warm.</br>  <br>I hope she writes a book about it or something in the form of a novel. I wanna hear that story from a first person perspective. Love those stories.</br>  <br><br>Yeah... I'd dig out a snow cave and make a bed of Pine needles. We would make sweet love in the missionary position... for warmth, of course.</br></br>  <br>She may have been in shock, just saying.</br>  <br> I hope she writes a book about it or something in the form of a novel. I wanna hear that story from a first person perspective. Love those stories. <br><br>You know when you hear news stories about children being abducted and held and tortured and raped and they don't give many details?<br><br>Those kids must give long depositions or otherwise relate exactly what the experience was like and how it felt and what was done to them and how it felt being penetrated and forced.<br><br>Where can I legally find that info? is it in books or online?<br><br>I want real stories by real kids who were brutalized, where can i get this? it must exist</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck yeah</br>    <br>Chapter 1:<br>Plane crashed, I was hungry, walked around a bit.
