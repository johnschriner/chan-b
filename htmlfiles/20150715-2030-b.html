Thanks</br>    Requesting gardevoir                    How is everyone doing tonight?<br><br>Feeling shitty? Tell me why.<br><br>Feeling great? Tell me why.<br><br>Thanks to the original Jinx-chan for the thread.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  HA! I just realized something! The girl who I'm taking to the movies might not bring her brother! I misread the text because it was broken into two parts. So there is hope!  <br>There is always hope.</br>  Hi same guy with the problem who doesnt feel like he's happy with what he has even though he has basically everything he wanted when he was younger. like I said I dont feel like I want more or less. I just want to be happy with what I have.  <br>Thanks for dropping by. Thread isn't getting much action.</br>  <br>Nice!! Good luck anon. I hope all goes well and you get to hang without her brother being there lol</br>  <br>Im reading a book called The Alchemist's Daughter and it is making me reflect on my own life and how i have encountered similar situations that are in the book. I guess im ok.</br>  Can anybody suggest some melancholic piano pieces? Not confined to just piano, anything is appreciated. This is what I'm listening to now:<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=g19<wbr>zI4iTrIo</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Maybe you need to take a break from having the comforts of home, maybe take a vacation or go camping or something? Also small hobbies help. Find something you like alot (vidya for me) and try getting really into it</br>  <br>It sounds like the problem is that you aren't happy with what you got. So you shouldn't try to force yourself to be happy with it.<br><br>You must be missing something in your life. Try to find out what it is, and get it.</br></br></br>  I mean, fuck knows why I'm doing this, but it seems like spilling my guts to strangers via the internet is therapeutic in it's own way. Put plainly, I feel like shit, because the "girl" I was dating (m2f trans, just recently finished up everything) left me, because she decided she'd rather be a lesbian. I feel... cheated, I guess? I invested almost 4 years of my life into her, helping her, being supportive, etc. It sucks to think in the end I was a person of convenience to them, and nothing else, being traded out the second something new pops up. I feel like relationships are dumb anon :/  <br>Does it have to be piano? I don't really have any piano, but I have some nice classical music.</br>  <br>Shit man. I know that feel. One of my exs left because she 'thought she was gay' then after a little bit she's back to guys. Some people just don't know what they want and can't be tied down. Maybe that's how she felt. Anyways I'm sure you'll be able to find others anon</br>  <br>No, anything else is also appreciated.</br>  <br>:D<br><br><br><br>I feel like crap, because the things that used to give me joy don't anymore. They feel empty and more like work. <br>It's nice to not be OP, because now I can be on the other side.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ow, I'd feel right cheated for that. You stuck with them even though most would drop them right there, and BAM. Nah, they'd rather not be with you. My sympathies anon.<br><br>That last thread started slowly. It just takes time.</br></br></br>  Feeling great. My friend and I are listening to playlist of 80's music thats 5 hours long.  <br>Mozart's Requiem.</br>  Feeling depressed and afraid of being alone forever. I know it's a silly feeling but I don't have much of a social life at all anymore and I don't feel like I have a personality anymore. This and being a general introvert has always made it hard to meet new people. Infact I haven't really made any friends outside of high school, and it's been almost 10 years now and I've lost all my former friends. Fuck  <br>Yeah, and I appreciate you doing these threads. Being the OP means that you help with other's problems, but don't really get help with your own.</br>  <br>I guess the worst part of it all is something I've taken as a constant in my life for years disappeared overnight. I mean, I'm fucked up as well, got my fair share of problems, PTSD and shit, but it ones one of those things where, hey, things are shitty, but at least I have someone to support me when I need it. But now I don't have a reasonable coping mechanism, and I'm just falling apart at the seams.</br>  <br>We're here for you anon. You may not always be able to talk to us, but just know, that no matter where you are or what time it is, we care for you. We are your friends.</br>  <br>Look for new things to find enjoyment in. Also I find it helpful to set personal goals like working out or quitting bad habits which helps get me out of depressions</br>  <br>We always ask you how you're doing, though.<br><br>I can empathize with your position. It feels like everything is going in circles, nothing is changing nor exciting. I used to just sleep the day away and I still do every now and then. I've got two people to stir things up in my life, though. Something to look forward too and it keeps me hopeful. Best of luck and hopefully you won't get stuck in a circle forever.</br></br></br>  <br>Im listening to that right now its crazy that someone suggested this.</br>  I have two cavities and slightly swollen gums (from plague buildup) because I'm terrible at brushing my teeth.  <br>As soon as I heard "sad piano" I thought of it. Even though it has no piano.</br>  feelin pretty shit, cut contact with a girl i was into<br><br>I thought we were trying to make things work again, but she just wanted to keep me around for god knows why. <br>Decided to just cut contact completely when I found out she's starting to date a new guy.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, we love you, anon. We're not something you can always come to (nights and all) but we're constant. Oh, and did they really leave you forever? Straight up? Just like that? Pretty cunty, if you ask me. I'd be livid.</br>  <br>I like listening to that kind of music when i read. <br><br>Id also like to apologize because i randomly jumped into your conversation.</br></br></br>  I feel shitty, there's this girl that broke my angry breaky heart and she chose another guy. Now she thinks that he's cheating on her, my beta ass saved their relationship. I joined a band that wants to do prog metal even though I really don't like that genre. My family life is falling apart due to my addict sister disappearing for a few days on a binge. So I don't really know what to do  I'm gonna go to sleep but I want to wish all of you anons a goodnight, and hope that these threads helped you guys alot (not OP just a lurker trying to reply to as much as possible). Godspeed  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ja3<wbr>C0uTRmc8</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>It's fine.</br>  <br>didn't notice the thread came back.<br>why are you still up?</br></br>  Sad. Lonely. The usual. How are you feeling OP?  <br>good book? I've been looking at getting back into reading but the only series that really attracted me was something called angelfall and I have a feeling it might be some twilight tier bullshit</br>  <br> Anon from before here <br>glad to hear that everything worked out well for you.</br></br>  <br>Yeah you guys do always ask me how I am. Sorry. I am just so used to responding with the same old fake "Fine, and you" response that I never really take it to heart and respond with a genuine response. It's a real problem of mine. Sorry.</br>  <br>this is nice</br>  <br>Different OP. And it was put back up because some people joined late in the last one and didn't have time to talk.</br>  <br>http://<span>youtu.be/AB6sOhQan9Y  [ ]<br>It's just sort of sad if you've played the game, but it's still a beautiful piece</br></br>  <br>awfully nice of you to start up another one.</br>  <br>Try it. The worst that could happen is that it's not to your liking, but that's part of the fun in reading I find. Investigating and personal research. Always on the hunt for gems.</br>  <br>are you the guy who posted this pic the other night? and just before? <br>if so I'm glad you identify yourself, good to know people are coming back</br></br>  <br>Thanks for this. <br><br>Check out "Doves" by them.</br></br></br>  <br>Feeling a lot better now I'm the anon from the last thread who was horny and decided to go to a brothel. It was top notch banged a 7/10 asian qt in her late 20's. Best 120$ i've spent this month.<br><br> on a side note I also found out what my dick looks like on acid pic related. </br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, packed their shit and everything. Fuck knows where they are now. I mean, there's this voice in my head saying she was cheating if she up and left with no trace that easily, but I can't prove that. And as much as I'd like to, I can't let myself get mad over it. I've got issues with getting angry, patterns of suicidal behavior in my past and all, so if I get mad and let this fester, it's just going to cause more harm to me. I just feel... numb, you know? Like going from a room filled with colors and sounds to a room of nothing but white noise and shades of grey.</br>  <br>Thanks.Though as I've said before, people should always be nice, and I don't deserve praise for doing what I did. And it isn't even my idea. You can thank Jinx-chan for the original thread.</br>  <br>Don't be sorry. It sounds like you're sad when I read that. I do that all the time. I don't really talk about my problems here much either. I'd much rather just help people, to be honest, so I can understand.</br>  Idk how to feel... I've been talking to this girl from work. I've known she has a boyfriend but he recently broke up with her... I was trying to make something happen but like a day later they were back together. She still talks and texts with me a lot tho and I've made it obvious I'm into her. I haven't been in this situation so idk what to do but it sucks.  <br>So whats you night like?<br><br><br>I just started working at a library so im trying to get back into reading again.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Doing shitty. Ive fallen deeply in love with my first cousin. I didn't meet her til last month and now she is all I think about. She is deeply into religion so she can't and won't sin. So I don't even have a chance.</br>  <br>Didn't you find out what your dick looked like on acid last night?</br>  <br>At the moment, I'm feeling apathetic. Better than being the depressed suicidal faggot I was less than an hour ago. I should be happy but I'm not. Really. I'm not.</br>  <br>It was shitty, but it turned around. So it's pretty okay.</br>  <br>this is true, will buy tomorrow, everything is pretty much shut here right now</br>  <br>Yeah, I'm pretty much any pokemon and Okami picture as well. I felt like it'd be a friendly thing to do.</br>  <br>Yeah I did in the dreamwhatever thread it was pretty cool.</br>  <br>i'm givin you praise whether you like it or not Anon.</br>  <br>Hm I'd wait for the inevitable rebound. Shitty relationships like the one she's in won't last long.</br>  <br>I normally use Guilmon pics, but I could only find maybe 10 good ones, so I'm thinking about picking something else.<br><br><br>Thank you :)</br></br></br></br>  <br>I will always post this flandonut picture, and nothing else.</br>  <br>mmhm.</br>  <br>A hollow, empty and dead kind of feeling. I used to get that a lot. I'm pretty "meh" now, but I remember that feeling. It's more painful than just being sad, because at least then you still feel something. Hopefully you've still got people around you that care. That always helps.</br>  <br>Thank you, really</br>  <br>That's what I figure too. Just feel like I missed my chance last time. Ah well thx for the confirmation.</br>  <br>No problem.</br>  feeling like a loser  <br>it is rather stimulating, though last few books I got were for christmas <br> some jk rowling book called the casual vacancy  <br>kinda sucked</br></br></br>  <br>That picture is oddly familiar. I think 4chan hwill prevent the same pictures to be posted over and over, so make like 10 with very small modifications to them.</br>  Work sucked, but at least I've finished part 6 out of 8 of JoJo. Almost there.  <br>Thats good. my day has been nice. I cleaned the house and rearranged my closet. I even finished all of the laundry. I do wish i went outside more thought.</br>  Is anyone here actually happy with there life?  <br>I would say I'm fairly content.</br>  <br>God bless you and this thread. Life is hard sometimes. People rarely get it right. People aren't taught how to love properly. People make mistakes. People suck. People are wonderful. Just take comfort that we are all in this together and in 100 years none of this will matter.</br>  <br>I would say about 15% of people in these threads fall into the "happy" category</br>  <br>Is that based off a Louie CK bit?</br>  <br>I like it anon, for what it's worth I think I spoke to you the other night &lt;I watched steins gate 3 times in two weeks&gt; if that rings any bells <br><br>I've always wanted to try okami but not sure which console to get for</br></br></br>  <br>I will look into it. Though i think i remember seeing something with a similar name when i was shelving books. Thank you for the suggestion</br>  <br>Oh no, I'm quite honestly just going to post that one image once. Apparently people like being in the midst of other familiar faces. So I'll make a habit of at least somewhat announcing myself. But I'm not a true avatarfag or anything. Frankly I find them annoying. Nor could I be bothered to make like 20 slightly smaller and smaller images.</br>  <br>Unfortunately, I'm quite the loner in the real world. I do private computer repair, so other than picking up a system from a client's house, or something of the sort, I'm pretty much alone in my house, and don't talk to people/interact with them. Guess that's why I'm here. We may be anons, but at least it's a chance to talk out my issues with someone real, albeit through a computer screen.</br>  bored as hell.<br><br>quit job. love life, but bored.<br><br>Green Day said it best, "when masturbation's lost it's fun, you're fucking lonely."</br></br></br></br>  <br>Mostly. But my brother killed himself first, cheating me of my chance. I had to stay alive for my mother. If he hadn't done it I would have.<br><br>Now, many suicidal years later, I'm pleased more often than not.<br><br>So, if you're miserable, it might get better. Then again, it might not.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not really, but I persist on because offing myself will just burden other people</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Oh, you're the guy that recommended NHK to me. I remember you. What's up, man?<br><br>I recommend the Wii version because drawing becomes faster, but never get fleeting foot, or whatever the dodge move's name is. It's broken on the Wii.</br></br></br>  <br>what makes you happy?<br><br><br>i'd imagine it wouldn't be that many. there's plenty of people who like to talk and express but not enough people to listen and respond IMO<br><br><br>why did he off himself and why were you going to?<br><br><br>what makes you want to off yourself?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Get a hobby anon. Have you thought about maybe building models, learning an instrument, or taking up drawing/artistic pursuits? I find those sorts of things help me fill the gaps in time quite nicely.</br>  <br>For the most part im happy. Im having trouble coming to terms with sad events and not having any family and only being 21. Its lonely.</br>  <br>yeah dude, not too much had a pretty terrible day<br> went to family therapy <br>kek^<br> all parents did was whinge about how I used to be too paranoid <br>but gladly enough came home to find this thread and here we are, I don't have a wii but they aren't too expensive so I might look into it, thanks! <br><br>how are you might I ask</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>what happened to your family?</br>  <br>Well, it would have been pretty funny. I actually just had a few pictures and I feel my post is empty without one. I mostly had Okami pics, so it just stuck. It is a bit faggy, but oh well.<br><br>Yeah, this thread is oddly therapeutic at times. I hope this made you feel somewhat happier to talk about. Sorry to hear about your shitty state of affairs.</br></br></br>  <br>Ouch, I hope your heart recovers soon and stronger than ever. Don't do things you don't enjoy, life is too short for that. Try and find a band with a genre you actually like, then find a way to turn your passion into a paycheck!</br>  <br>my dad died and my mom did drug and ran away.</br>  <br>The reason I want to is that I try and help other people but I don't know how to help myself, I hold it all in because I'm scared of burdening people. If I Buffon them they won't like me and I'll be alone and being alone is a truly scary thought</br>  <br>how old were you when dad passed and mom ran off? who you living with now?</br>  <br>damn.. *buys hypothetical drink*</br>  <br>Been working on that. <br><br>Skating and running help, but only for a while. As much as I'd love to golf, it can get expensive quick.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm fine. Neither here nor there. Feeling neutral. Sucks that your family isn't getting along. I know how that feels as my family rarely even talks to each other. Got any siblings?</br>  <br>pretty sure you and me have a similar mindset when it comes to talking about how we feel.</br>  My girlfriend of 3 months has had a pretty fucked up life and suffers from depression and got out of an abusive 4 year relationship 4 months before we met and now we're thinking of splitting up for her benefit, so she can deal with things on her own. The things is I really fucking like her and I'm torn between the 2 choices, whether to stay with her and support her or let her grow on her own - or could I stay with her but let her deal with her problems independently?  <br>It'd be hard to say what makes me happy.<br>I guess its happiness at being alive, being sentient? <br><br>I feel soul crushing depression too. Normally about once day. But I feel joy. Joy at the simple fact I can sit here and connect with people on a personal level. Joy that I can feel emotion Joy that I'm here, right now.<br><br>Like I said, it's hard to say why I'm happy. Just like it's hard to say why I feel sad. Sure I could say that my sadness is caused by loneliness, or chemical imbalances. Just like I can say I'm happy because I'm not poor, or that I'm happy because I'm comfortable. But people can be happy, or sad, despite those things.<br><br>So why am I sad? Why am I happy? There really is not 100% right answer. But my best would be that I'm alive and I can THINK.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    Girl says she loves me yesterday, posts something today on her blog about how perfect her man is and how dirty and deep she's getting in with him, how he's gonna punish her but is sweet as fuck and stuff. <br><br>We've fucked but she ain't talkin' about me. She also doesn't know I have her blog. <br><br>Also, my shitty brakes cut out when I was going 50 mph in rush hour traffic and I had to squeeze in between the lanes of cars in a chevy s10, but the only damage done was I took off the cover of someone's mirror. <br><br>Heart was pounding the whole way home though.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>makes sense since you're james bond, you are not alone there</br>  <br>Sending a lonely high five your way bro! Awww yeaaah depression!!</br>  <br>Eh, I think just being able to actually put it out there, to see the words on the screen helps, in a weird sort of cosmic way, because I can look at my problem on the screen and focus on it all day, but the second I step back, it's eaten up by a sea of other problems, of people with happy lives, of people helping, and it's a weird sort of perspective thing. It's just one post in an endless sea, and like all things, in time, it'll be forgotten, and over with. Sure, it sucks now. But it's a temporary state of being. It's just another hurdle, and I've been over much larger ones when the lines are drawn. I made it out of the military alive, mostly intact, I have a job I enjoy, a place and a car that I own. There's a lot of good to outweigh the bad, and I guess letting it be out there helps me see that, so y'know, thanks anon.</br>  <br>Shitty, because i stay awake until 3AM waiting for the super mega prime day and is fucking bullshit... and i have to work at 8...<br><br> 4:08AM </br></br></br>  <br>I try to carry other people's burdens with my own and it just gets to a point I can't take the lyric that describes it the best imo is from Unloveable by The Smiths <br> I don't have much in my life <br> But take it, it's yours </br></br></br>  <br>My dad died when i was 15 and my mom left about 2 months after. I was living on my own for a while but now i live with someone. <br><br>Thanks but i think things will be ok.</br></br></br>  <br>Anon i'd love to give you some long typed out shpeal on how that was deep and super emotional but i just can't stomach it at the moment.<br>i get what your saying though and am glad that your able to feel.<br><br><br>james bond, you've confused me Anon.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was poorly typed anyway. I spotted at least 3 mistakes.<br><br>I'm kinda distracted because I'm watching a movie.</br></br></br>  <br>good to hear, content is nothing to complain about I suppose <br><br>it's sorta always been like this but I guess I'm only 22 and there's plenty of time, I have 3 younger siblings, one is in the navy and hates it, one is your typical onedirection fangirl, one is your typical sports guy, and then there's that one guy who plays too much vidya and only leaves the house for university *whistles absently* <br><br>how about yourself?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>True true. Not having an income source does kind of put you on a limited budget. You really gotta diversify what you're doing when you have endless time, otherwise it gets repetitive. A struggle I know all too well. What did you do before you quit your job?</br>  <br>your digits were 007 hehe, but yeah it's hard to feel like a burden</br>  <br>what hurt more, your mom or your dad? who you living with now?<br><br><br>sucks trying to make everyone else feel better when there isn't anyone around who will do the same for you doesn't it?<br><br><br>i got the jist of what you were going for, just didn't feel like lieing and typing out some long paragraph.<br><br><br>ah i see, kek. yup. especially when its every other day.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Cant sleep. Slowly realizing gf can't make me cum because I bate too much and she is a clueless virgin.</br></br>  <br>she's a virgin though, thats something worth holding onto.</br>  <br>My dad. I hate my mom. I live with my bf now.</br>  <br>how close where you to your dad? girl or just a fag?</br>  <br>Anytime, dude. Best of luck out there in that crazy world.</br>  <br>make her lay on her tummy and cross her legs and hit it from behind</br>  <br>nice trips but im not.<br/></br>  <br>Just because you know what it's like to be a sponge that know one is willing to wring out is enough to make me feel a little better</br>  <br>this is true, I try my best to carry around other people's problems but sadly I think that isn't the best way to make friends, I'd like to be there for people to take my mind off of myself but I think that's pretty abundantly clear to whoever I talk to so I pretty much deflect new people unless I'm wasted and in godmode</br>  <br><br>Hitting it from behind still doesn't do it for me after 15-20 minutes of work. Either my condoms are shit or I need a pill or something to turn up the sensitivity.</br></br>  <br>He was the best. We always went fishing and to the museums and libraries. I grew up in Florida and we went to the beach almost every day. We even had a garden together. Im a girl. I didnt want to say it but you asked.</br>  <br>These any good?<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=G-V<wbr>g2YS-sFE</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Y8e<wbr>QR5DMous</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=TAg<wbr>jyN9Bo4Y</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br> condoms <br>now here's your problem, how does she feel about you pulling out?</br></br>  3 weeks after being stood up by girl and given half assed apology, girl asks me to meet again for coffee. girl cancels on the day due to 'bad mood' and asks to see me same time tomorrow. Come today, after asking if she still wanted to meet today, she hasn't texted back at all.<br>why do i let her do this?</br>  <br>I have two. I have a sister who is the middle child, but still acts like a self centered, childish twat, who likes me for some reason. I also have the oldest brother, who pretty much gave me my personality when I was growing up. He's also really unlucky. Both of them did bad in school, when when I started getting A's without effort, my parents looked at me like I was some sort of golden child. Somebody who will just succeed in life. Unfortunately, I just don't have any motivation.</br>  <br>dude.. the murder I feel at this</br>  <br>Im sorry lol<br><br>damn that sucks.</br></br></br>  I love all of you. Some of the best people I've ever met. Even if it is just over the internet.  <br>You've probably already hit this conclusion, but just stop showing up yourself and drop that shit.</br>  <br><br>Not even remotely interested in playing that game. Shit scares me enough to distract from the experience anyways. I'd settle for trying to teach her how to properly do oral. I mean, if I can manage to finish her off when she's my only experience, how hard can it be to play the skin flute?</br></br>  <br>not to interrupt this convo, but I highly reccommend the ps3 version of okami. Normally I'm not one to make a big deal about graphics, but okami is a beautifully hand drawn game, half the fun is in the art style. you'll definitely want to experience it in HD</br>  <br>yeah its nice being that person for someone else that you wish would show up for you.<br><br><br>yeah, can't save everyone, can't make everyone happy.<br><br><br>favorite memory about him? you lived in florida your entire life? what was the garden like? sorry, must not have been keen on hiding it though. how'd you meet the bf?<br><br><br>kek. no harm done Anon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>One-itis. You need to be able to jump ship at the first sign of this kind of shit. Flakes are never ever worth your time.</br></br>  <br>These are perfect. Thank you, anon. I have added them to my playlist.</br>  <br>Worked as a manager for a big company in their warehouse.<br><br>Almost every day for the last 3 months I started repeating to myself, "I hate my job," as I was walking in the door. I managed 100+ employees and hated life. So fuck it, I quit. It put them in a bind, but fuck them anyway.<br><br>I need to find some place to travel. Starting to look into places to hike around me. That's cheap!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>We had two pretty decent dates, but then after getting stood up and her trying to pin the blame on me because there was no 'confirmed time' even though she gave me a time and place but just happened to fucking vanish that day. like any normal person I wouldn't do anything about this but she's way god damn pretty and I'm somehow willing to sacrifice dignity. Just don't understand how anyone in their right mind can consider this normal behaviour.</br></br>  <br>Indeed, I feel like being at least a little intelligent kinda opens doors certain ways of thinking, questioning the reasons behind doing things etc rather than just going through a day like every other lemming on the planet, maybe it's just me, but motivation is not an easy thing to find</br>  <br>love you too, anon</br>  Laying around in bed, lonely I guess  I'm bummed. Moved for a good job but now I don't know anyone for 1500 miles. <br><br>My girlfriend moved with me so I have her, but no friends and to top it all off I have no idea how to meet someone to buy weed from.</br></br>  <br>Hiking is an awesome idea, especially if you won a smartphone, or halfway decent camera. You can capture some really neat scenes and images just wandering through the woods, or a state park or mountain, or whatever type of thing you have near you. I have a few friends who do that sort of thing, and they come back with some really stunning pictures sometimes.</br>  <br>hope a long road of happiness lays itself in front of you for years to come Anon.</br>  <br>drunk and listening to sublime.
