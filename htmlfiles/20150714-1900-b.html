[ I think I have footage of blowfly girl /b/. Want to see?  <br>A girl that put maggot infested meat in her vag and kept it there for a few days. She masturbated while it was in there, and eventually passed out and woke up in the hospital.</br>  <br>The old copypasta, you mean?<br><br><br>Holy shit.</br></br></br></br>    Is it normal to be more attracted to 11-14 y/o females rather than girls your own age?  No it's not (however it's more a matter of your comfortability with a certain stimulus)  yes, and we control ourselves, then masturbate furiously  <br>Depends a little on how much older than that you are.<br><br>Nice dubs btw, very appropriate.</br></br></br>  workplace confessions<br><br> former job as mcdonalds cashier <br> at one point was the most senior staff member, thus allowed to work the drive thru on the nightshift, usually it's just me <br> would put sign over credit card machine and say "sorry credit card reader broken, cash only" <br> if customer only wants something small like a drink or sauce (we used to charge for sauces) <br> i take their cash and give the stuff to them for free <br> its slow but every night i do it i can make about 70 or 80 bucks </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>First, as already stated, he takes the order then decides depending on the payment whether to put it into the system (legit) or do it all off the books (pocket money, doesn't tap shit on his screen).<br>Second, kill yourself for writing a made up SQL query and trying to look cool. Like holy shit, made up table names and everything, this could have been explained in English you fucking retard LOL. gl in Information Technology 101</br></br>  <br>Kek</br>  <br>Why does he have to justify how much he makes?

His voice doesn't match Joker at all. He sounds like a scene teenage boy.</br></br>    I can see the complains coming from people who cried about Heath Ledger's joker. "It looks like a shitty paintjob", etc etc. But we all knew that in the end it was fucking great.<br>This is not the case. The joker has been completely changed in what I think seems to be every possible aspect. He's got these tattoos, the only shit we've seen of him was shirtless, his pants were half down revealing his underwear a little, as if it was a skater's spin on the joker. And for reasons unknown, he has a lot of silver teeth. <br>Joker was meant to be an average guy turned crazy, not a teenage boy in his teen years. This version of the joker doesn't even look like he could dress in the purple and green suit.</br></br>  <br>I am also going to enjoy this flick, here's my money VPN industry.</br>  Hey /b/, sup?<br>Im Marshall Bruce Mathers III (aka Eminem or Slim Shady).
