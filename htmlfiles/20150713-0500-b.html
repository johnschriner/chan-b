Thank you for continuing our prospour. I second this idea.</br></br>  <br>brb wulfwic fag time.</br>  <br> You are part of a young, small, but established civilization, ruled by an autocratic leader. <br> <br> Lately, the first dynasty of that archaic realm have been weakened by claimants, and society is plunging into chaos. <br> You seize this opportunity to escape the tyranical grip of your masters, and decide to lead a tribe of your own into the unknown, far enough from your motherland to avoid future retaliation. <br><br> May your legacy live beyond the threads. <br><br> ¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤ <br><br> Rules: <br> - Pick a name for your tribe, and send it into a direction to explore (N-NE-E-SE-S-SW-W-NW), until you decide to settle. <br> - Once settled, give directions to your settlers to explore and extend your territory. <br> - Make a peace deal, or attack another tribe if its territory is bordering yours. Last two digits are your attack/defense power for the next round (01-98), 00 is a critical failure, 99 is are a critical success. <br> - Trips and quads triggers an event, either good or bad. <br> <br> World: <br> - Strategic provinces can't be conquered until they are totally surrounded. <br> - Mountains are infested with hordes of wild rabid semite animals living underground, and thus impassable. <br> - Rivers and small bodies of water are crossable with rudimentary boats. <br> - Large bodies of water can only be explored and crossed if tribe control a maritime strategic province and develop a navy (DLC TBA). <br> - Some areas are patrolled by wild armor-thickened negroid beasts, and can't be crossed until superior military technology is developed (DLC TBA). </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Whorefuck <br>What happened with my assassination attempt? Also continue colonising</br></br>  <br>I agree to the afk deal, but not one nation</br>  <br>What the hell do you mean no explosives? I'm doing a realistic discovery of it.</br>  <br>The Reich colonizes teh north province at the mouth of the river.<br><br>We research centralization and infrastructure.</br></br></br>  <br>Bvoluroth conquers southwest in search for a sea connection for trade with autismia</br>  <br>Isis continues its assult upon the capital, however if the citizens of al-andalus are willing to submit to shariah law, and accept allah as the one true god, we may consider peace</br>  <br><br><br>thx nignogs</br></br></br>  <br> Al-Andalus <br><br>Long time ago, we tried to establish peace with our RockHarder brothers. We're alone now, but our Gods are with us. With the power of our faith in Fjella, the Life Mother, and Allah, the World Maker, we shall not fail! We will defend against ISIS invasions! We shall recover the land of our ancestors!<br> Defend against ISIS assaulters </br></br></br></br>  <br>Autismia expands West<br><br>You know, just continue in that direction. I have to go now, if anyone is willing to take over my country, they are free to do so. I'm a shit rp player anyway</br></br></br>  <br> tfw muh Wall is safe </br>  <br>Assassination on such a great distance is more than tricky. You have no news.<br>Previous assassination tried by CoR failed.</br></br>  <br>-CoR Islands, Continue colonizing the Islands and building up the Civilian Fleet.</br>  <br>Bvoluroth takes the claim</br>  <br> Also KKK is supposed to have taken all empty provinces to the north already </br>  <br><br><br>just saying</br></br></br>  <br>also another flavour note (CoR correct me if im wrong) Fjella resides in the lake to the south of your capital</br>  <br>You as a btard knows about the recipe.<br>Your tribe doesn't. We're at a antiquity level of technology.</br></br>  <br>that is true<br>Also the beginning of a temple is one the lake as well as Mecca in the Mountains to the East. Both are religious holy sites.<br>Side note With no contact to the lake my religion will be changing soon.</br></br></br>  Trips names my M4A4 Bullet Rain!<br><br>Will call it anything, even nigger holocaust if it wins and i wont back down like the faggot OP of yesterday.</br></br>  nigger holocaust  ''ErecrileReject''  I want to die  Name:<br>4skin Licker</br>   sem   "This is the shittiest skin i could possibly get for this skin, it's even worse than Desert Storm because it looks like an autistic jew from the outskirts of Krakow made it.

I got no connections, eduction or job experience. Jesus Christ it sounds hard to get a job.</br>  <br>howto make money online?</br>  <br>Engineer. Essentially looking after mostly infrastructure, but over the years picking up quite a bit of experience in virtualisation, storage (SAN's), routing/BGP, load balancing, firewalls, servers etc<br><br><br>First pay of this financial year.<br><br>When i started this job, my annual salary was $50K</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  Is is really this insanely difficult to find a job nowadays?  <br><br>Really depends what country and what profession you work in/are good at.</br></br></br>  I'm in the same position. I have a BA in Communications from a state university. I have two internships under my belt. I have a LinkedIn account, great resume, blah blah. I have worked at a grocery store for 12 years to get by. I have applied to about 20 jobs per week for the last three months to begin my career and haven't found shit. It's about who you know, not what you know. But if you don't know anyone in a position of power, (like 95% of people) you're pretty fucked. The odds are against you. I've contemplated giving up a few times, but the will to make more money is strong.  <br>Here is how one of my old resumes look</br>  <br>b a Truck Driver &amp; roam the USA like a homeless person with a fuel card.</br>  <br>4k a month does not = 200k a year. <br><br>To be honest 48k a year is still pretty poor for an IT role. I did an application support role moved into problem management then process/service design and now I'm on $88k a year. When I joined fresh out of uni I was on what you earn.</br></br></br>  <br><br>why don't you take civil service tests</br></br>  <br>it fucking is for Australia I'll tell you that, the timing of trying to get a job is pretty difficult.<br>Been looking since the start of this year and the only thing i've gotten in on is a paid-free course of getting a certificate 3 in Business Administration</br></br>  Theirs this good looking bitch who comes into Walmart...Oh wait, my autism is...  Plant Engineer/Manager 125k +bonus<br><br>Pick a Skilled trade you are fond of. Start at that point and work yourself up. I started with welding then moved up to engineer and so on. Just don't stop trying to move up</br></br>  <br>It's best to apply for jobs on craigslist that include office work or call centers. By all means do not take a job with commission. Why? You will NOT make money and its in no way a steady job you can count on. Call center work gives you skills you will need for any job. It gives you typing skills and, if it s a great place, Forbes training. You can put Forbes Training on any resume and people will eat it up. You may want to google some free online forbes crap. <br> Apply for call center gigs *you can even google maps "call center". Give em a call and ask for HR. <br> Apply for every Job Placement firm like AppleOne or UltimateStaffing. They will have different jobs each company so its best to have them all under your belt. For gods sake dont walk out on a job you dont like or show up late. They track that shit and will never give you another job. If you dont like it then talk to your hiring manager and talk to them. <br> PHYSICALLY go to the place you really want to get hired at and ask for the boss. Hand him your resume and tell him you've applied online and just wanted to introduce yourself. </br></br></br></br>  Go to a temp office nigger. This is what you get for being selective for the first ten months of searching  <br><br>  It's about who you know, not what you know <br><br>Yup, this is me  and I have to agree, you are quite right. I was sorta lucky that i knew the CEO of said company quite well before working for him. This is also quite good in the workplace. They say dont suck up, but if you know what you're talking about you dont really need to suck up. If people see potential in you, and you earn their respect (not demand it which is a mistake many people make), you will be promoted without any issues.<br><br>Get an entry level job somewhere and earn respect!<br>NOTE: Some people higher up than you will be earning more than you despite them doing less work. This is unfortunately the way the world works. Don't let this get to you, eventually the lazy folk will be found out and you can sit humble with a "i tild you so" attitude. if/when you hit the maximum potential at your current job, dont be a retard and quit when they wont promote you or give you a payrise. Instead quietly seek out a new job and dont quit your old one until you have been accepted elsewhere. Additionally, dont settle for less unless you really want the job.<br><br>I get paid weekly, shitloads easier to manage.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Because you're aiming too high. <br><br>You're going to need to do some work in fast food; McDonald's is always hiring.</br></br>  Graduated uni at 2013 with a BSc (Hons) - Network Systems, passed my Cisco CCNA in routing and switching. Volunteering to teach the silver surfers basic it skills (over 40's)<br><br>Been unable to find any work in any IT field, the only feed back im getting is im too over qualified and under experienced. No clue what to do and cant find any places to intern at for experience</br></br>  <br>Find a call center to work at. They hire literally anyone as long as you can usea phone, and you'll get 6 weeks paid training. The training is basically just showing up on time to get paid, usually a little higher than your area's minimum wage. Sustain yourself for those six weeks until you find something better,I'd until you can no longer stand the job. Be warned, you'll want to kill yourself after 6 weeks on the production floor</br>  <br>i've done this, it worked. <br><br>also if you want to know what your competition looks like, go on craigslist and post an ad advertising your ideal job that you make up, when people's resumes flood in to apply, just look at their resumes<br><br>good luck op<br><br>btw craigslist is a great fucking source for jobs.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Get a customer service job for an ISP or something.<br><br>All of the best engineers have one thing in common. At one stage in their life they did customer service, probably a 24/7 shift at some provider. This is VITAL in IT regardless of your role. Being able to communicate and proving you can navigate various systems (which service desk people do quite a bit) along with having proven communication skills is essential.</br></br></br>  <br>What he's saying is true.<br><br>You can't be this dude even if you do everything right. He knew someone and had a skill set you don't have plus I'm sure a shit ton of education.<br><br><br><br><br>Do these things and you probably wont have to do fast food like I did. You'll get comfortable in fast food and then it will be hard to leave. People there try to drag you down and management is demeaning. <br>If you have to then apply with everything I told you and a manager at a fast food place will grab ya and try to make you manager. Best fast food places to work are Dell Taco and Carls Jr. They seem the least stressed out.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Go to a temp agency they will send you to a random job depending on what business contract them also try an employment agency I got a good 10$ per hour job through them. You might have to work with niggers, but very little talking with them.  <br>If you're desperate enough, there's always day labor. Go dig ditches with drunks and methheads.</br>  Try selling Kirby vacuums? They will hire practically anyone.  <br>Iv been trying for 1st line support and help desk recently, im getting interviews and good feedback but they keep going for the candidates with more experience</br>  Sorry if I didn't lurk enough, but where are you OP?  <br>nope. its me.<br><br>Believe me, just work hard, be passionate about your job, earn respect, be willing to do the shit work knowing there is light at the end of the tunnel, and you will go places.</br></br></br>  <br>Be a cop.</br>  <br>Well what this guy said is half true:<br><br><br>  Fake a website <br><br>Dont fake a website, actually make one. Show that you understand IT. That you can setup a basic website, get email working, know how DNS works, what an IP address is, how a firewall works etc</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is what I did but I do not reccomend as it's kind of scary.<br> Lived in California and lost a really decent job weed wacking for the city. <br> Piled my shit in my little car and drive to Las Vegas to live with some guy I used to play DotA with. He seemed pretty decent on Ventrilo. <br> Work your ass off as there are TONS of jobs in Las Vegas for the down and out. Dish washing, busing, janitorial work. <br> Once you get the balls apply for call center work in a casino since they all pay about $13 an hour that moves up to $18 after a year. All of those positions are entry level and they WILL hire you if you sound nice and don't use slang like a slack jawed niggah. <br> Find a call center cutie and get married after two years.  <br> With both of you making decent money and with the promotions that the casinos have you can afford a great apartment. Seriously I have a two bedroom apartment in the nice side of town for $800 a month. <br> Casino's have an Employee Dining room. It's a free buffet and you can eat whenever you want. <br> I did this and it worked out for me. I could have easily been one of those bums as there are A LOT OF THEM but I tried hard and clawed my way to a halfway decent life. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  Be a cop. <br><br>Is military out of the question?</br></br></br>  Roll for your ever-loving waifu  Quads get.
