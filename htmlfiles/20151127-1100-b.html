At least i was listening to The Rolling Stones and the Grateful Dead around the same time so that balances out the cringe a little. Right guys? Guys?<br>I wanna fucking kill my self.</br>  <br>Rage against the machine isn't bad dog, unless you only heard the three songs on the radio.</br>  1/10 bait thread  <br>I'll agree with Slipknot and Korn, but Rage against and Nirvana?</br>  tfw I still love rage against the machine and nirvana  <br>Do it faggot</br>  <br>Only Nirvana from that but also<br> The Used <br> Green Day/MCR (my gfs did and I would buy the CDs and shit). <br><br>When people say "I wish I were a kid again" they forget how shitty being a kid was.</br></br></br></br></br>  limp bizkit  <br>Lel def not rage against the machine....everything else I can agree with</br>  <br>Smashing Pumpkins<br>The Cranberries<br>Atari Teenage Riot<br>REM<br>...the list goes on and on</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ill second your limp bizkit and throw in some Saliva &amp; Godsmack</br>  <br><br>yes, exactly</br></br>  <br>give it a few more years, you'll look at people who claim to like these bands like the rest of us look at people who will randomly break out into:<br>CRAAAWWWLLLIINNGGG IIIIINNNNN MMMYYY SSSSKKKIIINNN!!!</br></br>  My chemical romance<br>Blink<br>Fall out boy<br>Panic at the disco<br>Linkin park<br>Korn<br>Slipknot<br>Anything from Japan<br>Green day<br>Good Charlotte<br>Nickelback<br>Simple plan<br><br>If you listened to any if these you were a faggot</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I went to a my chemical romance concert once. I thought Helena was a catchy tune. I was 17 ;_;  <br> Anything from Japan <br><br>Don't fuckin diss Hironobu Kageyama</br></br></br>  <br>Look dude, i like em aswell and i still listen to them at times but it edgy as fuck. Not slipknot edgy, more like the longhaired smelly dude with a che-guevara shirt cringey</br>  Retard-O-Bot was my favorite band all through high school. Tried to listen again recently and hated myself for spending money on their t-shirts.  <br>Oh my... You even bought their tshirts...</br>  <br>oh man at least I was only 15 when I liked them.</br>  <br>Linkin park..</br>    OP here. so what you ex-confirmedfags listen to now?<br>I'm on oldschool jungle, 2-step garage, jazz, classical, lounge, maybe a little opera if the feeling takes me<br><br><br>16yrold detected MODS UNDERAGE B&amp; FOR THE TAKING</br></br></br></br>  I was obsessed with Craig David when I was about 8. Yes, I am a male. Yes, I cringe whenever I think about it now. <br> mfw </br>  <br>I cringed just reading the fucking name</br>  <br>%triforce</br>  <br>OP ere, at least craig david was a gateway to garage... him still shit tho</br>  <br>It's not like I went out and bought their albums, I just thought Helena was catchy. 2005 was an interesting time in music. Music videos still aired regularly on mtv, and from time to time there was decent shit. The Widow, Doorbell, and Helena were all songs I heard for the first time side by side. I decided I wanted to see a concert and The Mars Volta and White Stripes weren't coming anywhere close. So I settled.</br>  <br>There will come a time when you cringe at the memory of this post.</br>  <br>Lol wut? 80's pop Nip pop music. I was only kidding. The DBZ intro music always gives me nostalgia tho</br>  <br>Maybe you should try reading rage lyrics instead of listening to it.<br><br>Tl;dr Op is a huge faggot</br></br></br>  <br>I was on their street team, too. Dyed my hair to fit in with everyone. Regret is strong.</br>  Linkin Park, Limp Bizkit, Eminem and techno.  Who cares?  <br>Wait... What? So, their "street team"... Was this some fan club where you volunteered to put up posters from time to time when they came around? Tell me about this street team.<br><br> dyed hair <br>Kek</br></br></br></br>  <br>  what do you listen anon? <br>  Hironobu Kageyama <br>  ok...... </br></br></br>  <br>OP ere, nostalgia being a feeling of "oh shit maybe i am heavily autistic"?<br>...yeah I remember the western dbz theme too.<br>dragonball is tolerable if you watch it subbed tho lol but DBZ? nopenopenope</br></br></br>    Music is objective and if you like anything that was ever popular you are literally gay.  <br>You people need more social interaction in your lives</br>  <br><br>Slim Shady LP through Eminem Show + Relapse are actually good though. Em is only cringe if he's the only music you listen to, get a wiffle cut, and dye your hair blonde.</br></br>  <br>Yeah fuck the system and you OP. You cockpilot.</br>  <br> The grateful dead <br>Why? They're fucking boring and awful.</br></br>  Alright...I'll admit I was a former fag...<br>1. Limp bizkit<br>2. Insane clown posse<br>3. Nirvana<br>4. Linkin Park<br>5. Staind <br>6. Puddle of mud.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Damn I wish I was as hip as you.</br>  <br>OP ere, em is abit of a fag, but he was OK in the slimshady days, even still I would take some real hiphop over slim anyday</br>  <br>"Dragon, dragon, rock the dragon dragon ball zzzzeeeeeeee! Eroughereeaarrrrr!!!!!!!!!"<br><br>Lol I have the nostalgia feels for the jap version because I watched it on bootleg vcds I got from GTZ before it was localized.</br></br></br>  <br>haha this much projection</br>  <br><br>Fuck you nigger, RATM was and is the shit. And I'm 50 goddamn years old. Check your shitty music tastes at the door, faggot. Fucking Korn and Slipknot. Kill yourself.</br></br>  <br>i'll project you in a minute</br>  <br><br>Trips have forsaken me. The Grateful Dead is fucking amazing bro. They're just one of those bands that have so much fucking music that it's just as easy to expose yourself to their garbage as it is to their good shit.</br></br>  <br>I am 42 yo and back in 1993 I already found RATM shitty "rebelious" music for teens. I still do. With more cringe.</br>  <br>Are you an SJW?</br>  <br>shut your toothless faggot mouth oldtimer<br>this oldman sees it</br></br>  <br>I had like 15 no limit cd's. From master P to soulja slim.</br>  Mindless. Self. Indulgence. Kill me now.  <br> jungle </br>  <br>Seriously, Rage Against the Machine is the shitiest music ever. That guitar that sounds like a synthesizer is shite. Crappy music. Lead singer is a jew.</br>  <br>Hell no. Fuck SJWs and fuck you faggots also. Get the fuck off my lawn and my /b/.</br>  <br>I literally can't... I am literally having flashbacks, and not the fun kind where walls are breathing, patterns are melting and everything is fucking hilarious... more the kind where I was jumping around infront of my TV trying to shout along with the DBZ theme with my 9yo interpretation of the lyrics.. just don't... i fucking cant</br>  <br>Put stickers up all over town on anything, hand out flyers, etc.<br><br>Got in trouble in school because I was giving flyers with "retard" written on them to everyone.<br><br>Went to hot topic and begged the cashiers to play the ROB cd they had in stock, as well.<br><br>Did pretty much the same thing for Mindless Self Indulgence.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rage is hardcore SJW music old man. How could you not know?</br>  <br>i'll jungle your mother ina minute you faggot. jungle is the be-all and end-all of electronic music, anyone who says otherwize is a millenial who listens to dubstep</br>  <br>fair enough, but don't feel too much shame, that's why we're all in here.</br>  <br>The question is, did you get paid? Kek. Did Johnny Urine smell like urine?</br>    <br>looks like you just took the bait... dont feel too bad tho son...</br>  Blood on the dance floor - bewitched  <br>Pink floyd</br>  <br> Are you a colored person?</br>  long time agoo when I was child    <br> ipod <br><br>there's your problem, kid</br></br></br>  <br>Hahaha<br><br>Seriously though, is it hard not having anyone you meet in person like you?</br></br></br>  <br>Literally nothing wrong with Pink Floyd. The only issue is with faggots that think the Wall and Dark Side of the Moon are GOAT. Their not even the two best Floyd albums.</br>  <br>No, I'm white. Lets pretend we playing rock paper scissors, what you say beats jungle(at least as far as electronic music is concerned)?</br>  <br>Why in the world would you play a guitar to make it sound like a synth line. Just utter and complete shite. One guitar player I would do anything to avoid sounding like. Nirvana and Korn or ok although I hate that drop tuning a lot of bands use but at least they're not as bad as RAtM.</br>  <br>Fuck no, the band didn't have any money.<br><br>And Jimmy Urine smelled like something dead. He was also a real prick and seemed to enjoy making out with my 14-year-old friend a little too much.</br></br></br>  <br>Gangster Paradise</br>  <br>your quads says every band you listed there is for fags, by fags.</br>  <br>So you did that, of your own volition, without pay? Holy tits...</br>  Pic related  <br>Dark Side of the Moon is great. Every song is great.</br>  <br>Dragonforce</br>  <br>I'm with you there, anon. Sure they come across as edgy and stuff but that's not to say they don't have some pretty good songs.</br>  <br>Time and Money are the only songs that can be enjoyed without listening to the album as a whole. Maybe Eclipse. And Brain Damage. But Brain Damage is shite.</br>  <br>You're so salty. It's a band dude. Chill the fuck out. <br><br>Wanna know some real Cringe? <br><br>Junior High, I was huge on Hollywood Undead. I look back with regret upon even enjoying it</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Looking back, a lot of it was me being beta and trying to make out with this one girl because she had lip piercings that made my dick wiggle.<br><br>Never happened.</br></br></br>  <br><br>None of those are cringy, apart from maybe Korn. Also if you enjoyed any other slipknot album than the first one chances are that you whack off to images of boypenises<br><br>But Nirvana? well if you jumped on the nevermind bandwagon then I can see how you feel that they are some sort of angsty poppunk group to be regretted but there is more to them than smells like teen spirit.<br><br>The cringiest music I listened to as a teen is the socialist theatre propaganda music my dad gave me which I thought was the coolest, edgiest thing ever (they are singing about the capitalist oppression of the people. im such a badass for listening to this. woohoo...) and the huge amount of pretentious classical music I had accrued.<br><br>I don't regret any stage of musical education though. It's like being pissed at the fact that you were learning 1 +1 = 2 in kindergarten instead of applied calculus</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Mfw Hollywood Undead was so terrible no one even knows what I'm talking about </br>  <br>if someone talks about Dark Side or the wall, I don't care. I'll care a bit if they talk about WYWH. but animals or meddle. then you're a real fan</br>  <br> I don't regret any stage of musical education though. It's like being pissed at the fact that you were learning 1 +1 = 2 in kindergarten instead of applied calculus <br><br>I can appreciate this.</br></br></br>  <br>i know it still and my 21 year old cousin still listens to them<br>he is viriginn</br></br>  Manowar  Limp Bizkit<br><br>I wasnt even that young.</br></br>  <br>I still listen to most of these so fuck you snd your daughter who I will seek out snd fuck and her mom who is your wife and her children who also again reiterates your daughters tight virgin vagina pussy cunt fuck doll.</br>  <br>Holy shit kill yourself</br>  <br>damn... this is that "I'm blue" band, right?</br>  <br>Limp bizkit</br>  <br><br>Fuck yeah, Fearless and Pigs(Three Different Ones) are my favorite Floyd songs. Embryo is up there. I remember seeing Australian Pink Floyd perform Pigs on PBS and loving the shit out of their live rendition. To this day I can't find Pink Floyd performing anything but an abridged version. Les Claypool's Flying Frog Birgade put out a killer live version, but Les' vocals just don't cut it. The instrumentals are off the chart though.</br></br>  <br>Indeedy do</br>  <br>There were lots of faggots who were big on it too. Don't sweat it dude.<br><br>But honestly I'm glad I wasn't lol.<br><br>My cringe music?<br><br>Slipknot<br>Korn<br>Icp</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I got the first CD of the band Kittie when I was in high school. Cringiest band in this thread.  <br> ICP <br><br>Fuuuuck. Did you consider yourself a juggalo? I cringe for you. How about Kottonmouth Kings? Shizen</br></br></br>  <br> great gig in the sky </br>  <br><br>I only saw a live version of dogs from a recent (2003 maybe) RW concert, and I really didn't like it, so I didn't go looking for any others afterwards. I'll search these up though.</br></br>  <br>Not a bad song, but there's many greater Floyd songs.</br>    <br>great song, one of the best ones</br>  <br>Anything from Japan?<br>Do you even Nujabes?</br></br>  <br>Was it from In The Flesh-Live? I quite liked that version. Doyle Bramhal III is amazing (he was the singer and one of the guitar players in that version). I saw him in 2007 as a member of Eric Clapton's band.</br>  if I know that what I like is pretty lame, or pretentious, does that make it less cringeworthy than if I was a crazy fan who didn't realise?  More of her please  <br> he hates faggots, he's a faggot <br>pathetic. but yaknow what? carry on. it's infuriating people worldwide, so it works in my favor. you are more and more hated every time you spout this deluded nonsense, and its happened like 5 times in this thread alone. absurd. you lot really are fucking insane.</br></br>  <br>Can't argue with that; successful troll is successful<br><br>You're still a faggot though</br></br></br>  <br><br> Futiley attempts to declare victory despite suffering absolute failure. </br></br>  Hey Faggots,<br>My name is John, and I hate every single one of you. All of you are fat, retarded, no-lifes who spend every second of their day looking at stupid ass pictures. You are everything bad in the world. Honestly, have any of you ever gotten any pussy? I mean, I guess itâs fun making fun of people because of your own insecurities, but you all take to a whole new level. This is even worse than jerking off to pictures on facebook.<br>Donât be a stranger. Just hit me with your best shot. Iâm pretty much perfect. I was captain of the football team, and starter on my basketball team. What sports do you play, other than âjack off to naked drawn Japanese peopleâ? I also get straight Aâs, and have a banging hot girlfriend (She just blew me; Shit was SO cash). You are all faggots who should just kill yourselves. Thanks for listening.<br>Pic Related: Itâs me and my bitch</br></br></br>  Hey guys,<br><br>My name is Jenna, and I'm asking every single one of you to help me. My boyfriend is this skinny, greasy-haired guido who spends every second of his day looking at his stupid ass hair. He is everything bad with today's youth. Honestly, do all men brag about having fucked their "bitches" last night? I mean, I guess it's because of peer pressure and trying to be accepted, but he takes it to a whole new level. This is even worse than drinking beer all day and listening to Heavy Metal.<br><br>Don't ignore me. Please, help me. I'm pretty much desperate. I was a regular at the literature club, and vice-president of the science club. I also had a thing for classical music? I used to get straight A's, that is, before I met him (He just made me blow him; Shit was SO gross). He's a faggot, and I want to kill him. Please help me!<br><br>Pic Related: It's me</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh look.. it's the guido post again<br><br>Old copypasta is old and tastes like fish assholes. Kill yourself.</br></br></br></br>  What the darn-diddily-doodily did you just say about me, you little witcharooney? Iâll have you know I graduated top of my class at Springfield Bible College, and Iâve been involved in numerous secret mission trips in Capital City, and I have over 300 confirmed baptisms. I am trained in the Old Testament and Iâm the top converter in the entire church mission group. You are nothing to me but just another heathen. I will cast your sins out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before in Heaven, mark my diddily-iddilly words. You think you can get away with saying that blasphemy to me over the Internet? Think again, friendarino. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of evangelists across Springfield and your IP is being traced by God right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggorino. The storm that wipes out the diddily little thing you call your life of sin. Youâre going to Church, kiddily-widdily. Jesus can be anywhere, anytime, and he can turn you to the Gospel in over infinity ways, and thatâs just with his bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in preaching to nonbelievers, but I have access to the entire dang- diddily Bible collection of the Springfield Bible College and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your sins away off the face of the continent, you diddily-doo satan-worshipper. If only you could have known what holy retribution your little âcleverâ comment was about to bring down upon you from the Heavens, maybe you would have held your darn-diddily-fundgearoo tongue. But you couldnât, you didnât, and now youâre clean of all your sins, you widdillo-skiddily neighborino. I will sing hymns of praise all over you and you will drown in the love of Christ. Youâre farn-foodily- flank-fiddily reborn, kiddo-diddily.

You're one of the libtards who just regurgitate what you're told, not knowing what it means. Just go tax the 1 percent and ask for free handouts. After all, thats exactly what will help our society. Ever heard of the trickle down effect? Better to have a productive economy than one that continues to ask for handouts from the producers.</br>  <br><br>Depending on how close it is to your apartment...<br><br>Hide a speaker, and blast the "horst Wessel" song in their direction to see if it can be picked up on CNN</br></br></br></br>  <br>You. You are what's wrong with America. Not even about killing someone who is qualified, but killing a candidate because his or her ideas dont agree with yours.
