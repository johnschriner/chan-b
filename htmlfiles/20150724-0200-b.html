[ Can we get a disappointing movies thread going?  Pretty much every cape shit movie made in the last 10 years.  Bump, actors don't fit roles at all - semi-okay plot<br>comedy + this = trash</br>    dumping  <br>damn nigga</br>    <br><br><br>this is not a get thread</br></br></br>    <br>how did it disappoint? its just a very long episode with deeper and more developed jokes.</br>  <br>Shit what is this one?</br>  <br>i enjoyed that movie, it was good for what it was... light pop sci fi "tantalise people into space"<br><br>people who called it hard sci fi are just idiots</br></br></br>    missed opportunity  rolling 88888  <br>reroll</br>  <br>This movie is a joke, the bad guy is name "man" and love is the ultimate force in the universe.<br>Its just as logic as power lvl in dbz</br></br>  <br>How can you not like the Terminator? It is a timeless classic for a reason.<br><br>I'll be back. One of the best quotes of all time because it was both funny and true.<br>They don't make movies like this anymore.<br><br>It is like my uncle, he sent me a Christmas card which sad "Santa Claws" - You see, he wrote Claws instead of Clause. Now that's comedy, today's comedians could learn from that card.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>MURPH</br>  spooky shit  <br>Is it that bad ? I still need to watch it</br>    <br>Is it worth watching just for yolandi ?</br>    <br><br>What is a MURPH</br></br>    ded tred<br><br>Too bad it started well</br></br>  <br>This movie didn't age well. It was made before 911</br>  <br>You clearly did not saw Interstellar<br>Lucky you.</br></br>  <br>it's okay, could've been done much better imo<br><br>i fucking hated it, up to you</br></br></br>  I was 10 and like everyone else I thought how can they fuck up Mario?  <br>Interstellar. No good Sci fI these days.<br><br>Where's muh 5th element</br></br></br>  Birdman.<br><br>I was expecting so much from this movie, but the writing was just bad and there was just plots that went nowhere and some that just showed up without any back story.</br></br>  How has this not been posted.  <br>Meh I dont know if I have the time, Rocket League is killing me right now</br>  I thought it would be sci-fi. It turned out to be a bunch of stilted preschool dialogue and montages of looking at clothes, with an asshole "supergenius" who just happened to act like an average pseudo-intellectual asshole. <br><br>Between this and the absolute abomination that was "Her," I'm fed the fuck up with the state of modern sci-fi and am just about convinced it's my duty to pull out the trusty pencil and singlehandedly rescue the genre.</br></br>  <br> NOT 2 DAY SAYTEN</br>  <br>Waaaaat? This was funny. Had many a sensible chuckle.</br>  <br> singlehandedly rescue the genre <br><br>Nice</br></br></br>  <br>I could've written that post. Except the rescue part. I wouldn't wish filmmaking on my worst enemy.</br>  Really over hyped and boring  YOU HAVE TRIGGERED THE RARE WEEABOO<br><br>TRIPS KILLS IT, BUT ONLY IF YOU REPLY DIRECTLY TO THIS COMMENT</br></br>  <br>because it doesn't fucking exist, and it never will.</br>    <br> film needs more 9/11 </br>  <br>No one on /b/ currently ever saw that they wouldn't be born for 10-20 years</br>  <br><br>REPLY TO THIS IMAGE TO KILL IT WITH TRIPS</br></br>  <br>I've seen it and it was pretty good.</br>  <br>Soul power is the strongest force in the universe you faithless white nigger.</br>  don't deny it fags.  <br>It was quite good back when saddam was the biggest boogeyman we could imagine.<br><br>The music is still impressive to me, but so many other movies followed with edgy Shit that it just sounds like another edgy production.<br><br>I remember at some award show the Lindon Symphony Orchestra was playing ''uncle fucker" when trey and Matt took the stage at an event.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Birdman is god awful. The script is Troll 2 level foriegn. The performances are super off too.<br> Movie where main plot point is dude doesn't twitter or some shit. </br></br>  not sure if b8<br/>  Oh my fucking god this movie looks so fucking shitty you can't believe..life has disappointed me in yet another sorry ass cast  <br>Robin Williams singing blame Canada at the Oscars was amazing,</br>  <br>Keep talking to your imaginary friend.</br>  <br> disappointing <br> implying you actually expected that film to be good </br></br>  <br>I agree with Interstellar.<br>I heard a lot about it but it just seems a bit off. I am not a scientist or anything like that but even I know that ghosts don't exist. <br>So even if you fall into a black hole you won't become a ghost. That part ruined the movie for me a little bit. You would just fall forever, a black hole doesn't have a bottom to reach that is why they are called black holes to begin with.<br>So he should live for a long time, like 80 years or so while falling down the hole then die of old age.<br>But he came back a young ghost and not as his old 80 year old self?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You did not understand the clue, its not love or this fleetly bullshit... its the people from the future using their love for each other as a guild to lead them where they need to be to change the futures past and prevent the catastrophy.</br>  <br>what i hate most about this is that the rock guy is now a mean ass faggot. In the original movie he was atleast comedic, fucked it up.</br>  ITT: plebs criticizing something they don't even understand.  <br> but the writing was just bad and there was just plots that went nowhere and some that just showed up without any back story. <br><br>wow, you suck at movies</br></br></br>  <br> stilted preschool dialogue and montages of looking at clothes <br><br>wow, you fucking suck dude</br></br></br>  <br> terminator story <br> timeless classic <br><br>hehehe, funny, its a time travel story</br></br></br></br>  <br> You would just fall forever, a black hole doesn't have a bottom to reach that is why they are called black holes to begin with. <br><br>aaaaaand thats utter garbage</br></br></br>  <br>but ghosts do exist. I use to live with one and it would fuck with my brother and me monthly :(</br>  <br><br><br>actually good movies<br>you're just cynical</br></br></br></br>  <br>Jurassic World. <br><br>Decent to see at the cinema, like most films, but totally meh after watching it at home</br></br></br>  <br>its a cinema movie, i wonder what was in the first one that made it this good but i guess it could very well be the "it was the first"</br>  <br>Satanic trips of truth</br>  <br>I understood what the movie was going for, but it wasn't anything like I thought it would be and there were just so many problems with it. I'm also a pessimist so I'm pretty good at being disappointed.</br>  <br>  Live life like you were about to die the next day <br><br>Man, I'd be fucking depressed and probably cry a lot if I was going to die tomorrow. I would most likely just spend time with my family to say my good byes. <br>Take care of all the shit that needs taking care of so my family and friends doesn't have to worry about it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> They don't make movies like this anymore. <br>because the 80s are over and we don't circlejerk anymore about steroid pumped one liners.</br></br>    <br>Nothing about the Mario movie is good......</br>  <br>I think it's still amazing to this day.</br>  <br>Not the sharpest knife in the drawer, are you?</br>  actual shit movie here:<br>fuck off weebs it was shit. worst acting in movie history</br>  <br>This movie wins for most disappointing movie... hands down. I've never seen a worse turd than the Super Marios movie. There was a TON of hype because Mario was a relatively new thing in the early 90s and kids were crazy about that shit.... then everyone went to go and see this shitpile that was losely based on Mario, at best. Script was shit, directing was shit, plot was shit. Worse thing about it is it captured none of Marios wacky antics... it was just sort of a shitty depressing sci-fi with some of the same names as Mario characters.</br>  <br> 2015 <br> not owning a knife block <br>wtf kind of pleb keeps sharp knives in a drawer?</br></br></br>  <br>Did you even watch the movie? This was a masterpiece.</br>   &gt;/tv/   <br>No one. Hence the expression.</br>    <br> giant monster movie <br> good acting <br>Pick one</br></br></br>  <br>faggot weeaboo</br>  <br>if i was going to die tomorrow id try to do the things i would otherwise never do.<br><br>like rob a bank or maybe do something fun but expencive, like rend a water park for me and my friend, probably would pay people to do catering in the waterpark, and 10 prostitutes to help me make it enjoyable<br><br>anyone here want to be my friend? the water park would maybe hold 25 people, 5 catering and 10 prostitutes... :'(</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wow that's a lot of retardation here.</br>  <br>The new james bond movie will be shit with lots of action but no substance. Mark my words</br>  <br>Better than last year's Godzilla.</br>  <br>first king kong</br>  Going to be shit.  <br>knife blocks are unhygienic, and for restaurants they are banned in the EU<br><br>try again faggot, knife hangers ftw, let those knifes hang free like my balls.</br></br></br>  <br>Not watching it because the torch is a nigger.<br><br>I'll watch it when there's a movie about Martin Luther Coon played by a white guy.</br></br></br>  <br>My parents just took me out of the theatre, soooo many walked out I remember when they saw "bowser"</br>    <br>Yeah, now you circlejerk about gay vampires.<br>The shift in male role models explains a lot of the current faggotry — both around here and at large</br></br>  <br>That was your dad at night silly</br>  <br>dat loop<br>also checked</br></br>  <br>Almighty Lucifer has spoken</br>  <br>If anything I think her, along with whatever the crack head guys name is, are what made me hate the movie.</br>  <br> pessimist  <br>you mean edgy 14 year old?</br></br>  I can't even remember the name of it.<br>It is about this boxer, I think he is slightly retarded, in Philadelphia. Then some slow love story with some chick, I think she is slightly retarded, and he ends up buying turtles of her.<br><br>He is a no one but he still gets to fight the world champion. He gets his ass beaten but is like superman or whatever and stands up in the end.</br></br></br>  <br> this guy went to see the movie thinking it was about superheroes </br>  <br>You keep your butter knives in a knife block?</br>  <br>I went into Genysis thinking it would be the worst garbage I ever seen, it wasn't bad, acceptable actoin movie with some fun lines in it.</br>    <br>wtf i watched that trying to recognise what movie it was from and then it turned gay fast...</br>  <br>You do know its a comic book movie?</br>  <br>Thanks, Will Smith.<br>The fuck is he doing there, seriously?<br>"Let's go be heroes," or some shit in the trailer.<br>Let's go an hero.</br></br></br></br>  <br> torch being a nigger  <br> Probably /pol/'s favourite movie for 2015 </br></br>  <br>Careful with that one. It's so old it might fall apart.</br>  <br>He's an ignorant, unimaginative faggot whose mind has no ability to digest anything but the analogue of babyfood.</br>  <br>Debe.. <br> The fact that they're fucking kids is pretty effin' ridiculous</br></br>  <br>I didn't though. I went knowing it would be a drama that had little to do with superheros except that the guy use to play one.</br>  <br> bryan cranston shows: awesome <br> bryan cranston movies: utter shit </br></br>  <br>your butter knives are sharp?</br>  <br> its rambo u fag</br>  <br>Mine our</br>  It was okish but where are the bloody brits?  <br>Drive. checkmate, faggot</br>  <br>Same as you, but I think the best scene was when Kyle and Arnold were loading magazines in that father vs boyfriend kinda way.</br>  <br>Just like any other Daniel Bond movie.</br>  <br>/thread</br>    <br>These super hero movies are fucking terrible... They reboot them every 2 years.</br>  <br>Will Smith lost his credibility 10 years ago. He should just go home and retire.</br>  <br> disappointing movies <br>Nearly all movies made after 1997</br></br>  <br>Jaden should take over.</br>  <br>Yea i liked the relationship between pops and khaleesi, the main character was a total flatline, but seeing the future war shit was awesome, want more laser movies. Plus fighting young arnie was great.</br>  Don't forget seventh son.. holy fuck  <br>Underrated to the max.</br>  <br>you went into that thinking it was a sci-fi movie. when it was, in fact, a romance chick-flick.<br><br>the kind of shit that Lana Wachowski's would want to watch.</br></br></br>  <br>Found the redneck.</br>  <br> better than most movies made in the last 10 years </br>  <br>How did they justify his aging?</br>  What does /b/ think is the gayest sport? I say bicycle racing, like Lance Drugstrong did.  rugby<br>/thread</br>  This will 404      <br>poast moar hooligans</br>  Let's test if it will  <br><br>The only powers these two have are that of giving me raging erections at the thought of drowning them in a gutter.</br></br>  If I whacked these girls over the head with a spatula or a wooden spoon would they cry/respond?  <br>Kek</br>  <br>Nigger</br>  <br>Trio</br>    <br><br>Their lives already did.</br></br>  <br>Poor souls</br>  <br> souls </br>  God isn't great  Yarr.    Probably get flamed for this but hey its my day off so whatever. These girls are just like you and me and abortion is wrong under any circumstance. Hell they are probably both sharp as a tack! Just have no way of showing it. ITT:<br>Buncha butt hurt babies these girls get more attention than any of you faggots ever got.</br>  I have a family member just like this. The Hartley Hooligans rustles my jimmies so badly. This is awful shit that shouldn't be exploited.  If you're serious you should seriously go kill yourself    <br>And I thought my parents were embarrassing, I'm sure his mom put his and his date on the spot to take a picture with them. She pretty much just killed ANY chance of him getting laid that night.</br>  <br> they are probably both sharp as a tack! <br>They literally don't have the brains needed to be 'sharp as a tack'. That's what anencephaly is. They're missing a major portion of their brain.<br><br> The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) describes the presentation of this condition as follows: "A baby born with anencephaly is usually blind, deaf, unaware of its surroundings and unable to feel pain. Although some individuals with anencephaly may be born with a main brain stem, the lack of a functioning cerebrum permanently rules out the possibility of ever gaining awareness of their surroundings. Reflex actions such as breathing and responses to sound or touch may occur." </br></br></br></br>      <br>But these kids are microcephals, not anencephals.<br>Like this guy:<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=oPh<wbr>N47BLdIw</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  Oddly satisfying thread part 2<br><br>Oldie:<br/></br></br>                                                      <br>i like them all but this one especially</br>    <br>lol the moon is above the thunder</br>  <br><br><br><br>i got alternates to these but the files are over 4mb</br></br></br></br>    <br><br>All fun and games till you came..</br></br>              Meh, I don't have more things worth posting.    <br>yeah i keep on accidentally posting duplicates</br>        <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Source on these: http://newroman.net/canvascycle/</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> aw yeahh</br>      <br><br>MOAR<br><br>op is gay posting lame gifs</br></br></br></br>        this always cheers me up when im having a bad day  <br>i can hear it with my eyes</br>      <br>then contribute nigger</br>          <br><br>nah</br></br>        <br>Mmmmm!</br>  Wow thread                                                  isn't there already a hentai board        <br>Yes, hentai.<br><br>Not for western porn.</br></br></br>  <br>Stupid sexy greenskins.</br>  POST YOUR NAKED FEMALE CHARACTERS<br><br>please &lt;3</br></br>  <br><br>Yes there is.</br></br>  www 8muses com<br><br>You're welcome.</br></br>        Post your characters &lt;3                              You have 10 seconds to prove you're not an Amerifuck<br><br>  I can leave the house without the risk of being a victim of a mass shooting </br></br>    I'm 0-2 in world wars  <br><br><br><br>so far i know, America is the entire continent.

Cheating on a guy then maing him raise the kid is just cruel.</br>    <br><br><br><br>It was more a defence reaction. If she didn't do as they said, the group could have potentially turned on both of them and beaten them up. She actually did the smart thing by going along with their requests.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is that smoke from the friction or just watery mist? I wonder if you could set something on fire with a certain type of bullet. Probably not. Also kek</br>  <br>This is quite a good bait.</br>  <br>I can confirm this the love of my life suddenly made new friends and seemed more interested in them and making a cool college impression then me and started doing lesbo things with another girl when we were planning to start a family and have a kid and buy a house together well I would buy the house, so I left her... Girls even if not virgin can turn into unloyal whores at the drop of a dime. Thank God I was only 22 when I learned this.</br>  <br><br><br>Then why are the pictures of professional quality?</br></br></br>  <br>Dude trusted my girl too much, it seemed in line with what I said before (can't blame him for that). 'Sides, if a chick's coming on to you hard and practically has her tits out already, you're not gonna be all like "brb gotta verify with your boyfriend first, wait here". He apologized profusely, helped me with the bitch's shit, paid for the beer and all. Can't really blame him for boning her tbh, and I don't really care either way. I found out, she was out, end of story. Not his fault he wanted to go a round with her.<br><br>Also, kek at all the dudes going "haha anon got rekt", considering I kept my word and moved her shit out at lightspeed. If you're that insecure about your masculinity and staying power that you immediately dump a broad for suggesting she wouldn't mind fucking other people (something that we all would like, let's be honest here), then I'm not so sure I'm the one who got rekt in this case. Whatever makes you feel better though!</br></br></br>  <br>That's pretty fucked up anon</br>  "i will show you how to drive thris truck, come with me"  <br>lol.</br>  <br>never thought i'd see someone i know from real life<br>what's the name of that girl?</br></br>  <br>You did get rekt, because it was your fault you couldn't wrangle your bitch, so she moved on to someone who could. The guy sounds cool though.</br>  <br>Wtf is that mound above his fat little dick?</br>  <br>She just gave up kek</br>  <br>who you know? i guess it was tugce</br>  <br>But where is the video?</br>  <br>prove<br>you know and ask name?</br></br>  <br>only pics?any vids</br>  <br>M'yeah, it's real alpha to be that paranoid faggot that messages his girl every few minutes to check on where she is and with whom. It's also my fault that she apparently couldn't keep her legs shut for people outside of our bond of trust. Believe whatever you want to believe, when I'm in a relationship with someone I'm with that person, it's not that hard to say "no" or keep promises. Can't deal with that? Then toodles, go find another dude, not as if I don't have enough opportunities for pussy as it is. I'm not going to call polygamous people depraved or whatever, do whatever makes you happy in life I'd say, but I'm just monogamous and that's all there is to it.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Sadly there is no video, or never found it</br></br></br></br>  "sorry im late honey, theres much to do at work" she called  <br>Yes, yes it does...LOVE OF THE of BEING GANGBANGED OUT!</br>  ITT: butthurt betas  <br>It's funny how you guys are all casual about this, staying friendly and asking for sauce. <br><br>But if I post a video of a twelve year old girl giving a bj is all MODS MODS MODS <br><br>this Shit is illegal too dipshits</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>i know yusuf onur dilay, that's all.</br></br>  <br>gtfo with your autism.</br>  Some people like killing hamburgers, some people like killing sodas, some people like killing other people, some people like killing eyes.<br><br>Go to 8:15<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=0LB<wbr>2tISgoBw</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;629885267 <br>I NEED VIDEO!</br>  <br> men lie about it less. <br><br>Well i guess if you post it on 4chan then it must be true</br></br></br>  <br>where he from where you know him, post his gf to him</br>  <br>I wouldn't mind.</br>  <br>MODS MODS MODS</br>  <br>is he erally a cuck? he knows her girlfriend sucked dicks at erasmus?</br>  <br>Video?

NIC, Sound Blaster, ATI Mach32 video card (on the incredibly odd yet incredibly fast VLB bus) and 16 megs of ram. The I/O card can handle four hard drives; I'll install DOS one one with plenty of games (I grabbed a torrent with [nearly] all DOS games ever made and it's time to nostalgia) and some sort of UNIX clone on the other(s). <br><br>Linux and its monolithic kernel aren't going to work, save for DSL linux. I love me some DSL. <br><br>NetBSD is also planned. NetBSD runs on pretty much anything, even such a low-spec machine. <br><br>The battery on the 486 still holds a charge.

My father was immediately dismissed from his pain management after being fed and addicted to morphine from them for over a decade. His PCP isn't doing much to help him with withdrawals or managing pain from degenerative disc disease, which is why he was in pain management in the first place. Legally his doctor CAN'T prescribe him enough morphine to help anyways. <br><br>Any suggestions will be appreciated. My dad went from an upbeat, easy going man who was able to do basic house and yard work to being almost completely chair bound. A few more weeks and he won't be able to even walk himself to the bathroom.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Look up poppy seed tea<br><br>Or Poppy pod tea</br></br></br>  <br>Do you have a source with guides on how to do this? Did some quick searched just now and thers a lot out there saying half the seeds are shit and don't work, or that they make you sick or are easy to overdose.</br>  <br>Heroin, bro. Not even kidding.</br>  <br>Thanks but no thanks.</br>  <br>It's not a difficult extraction, browse erowid, do your research, and don't rush it.<br><br>If your father has been taking opiates the way you've been saying, you'll be fine playing around with this stuff, just do your research, it is still dangerous.<br><br>Pods preferred, heavily. With seeds there's no way to "predict" the yield of morphine, and since it's left in solution OD is an issue for people without tolerance. Don't overdo it, don't be an idiot, you'll be fine.<br><br>If you're not a poor fuck and have your own land, fuck it, grow your own poppies. Make sure you grow opium poppies though.

Is there info about growing on there as well? (is it legal?) My dad said he would be interested in growing.<br><br>He's tried kratom and got some good results from it but its expensive and since he's on disability he can only afford so much. I do think opiates would definitely help him ween off the morphine eventually as that is his ultimate goal.<br><br><br>In the state of Ohio, virtually no pain management clinic will help him because some THC showed up in a urine drop. They are overrun with patients and are pressured to drop them for any reason to save on money. My dad was smoking weed here and there in an effort to not have to take so much morphine. any form of marijuana is illegal here but he was never notified he would be dismissed as a patient and barred from pain management if any THC showed up. They say he has an áddiction' problem with marijuana...even though they're the assholes who started him on the morphine in the first place.\<br><br><br>Thank you</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Have fun with liver failure  <br>Legally the doctor can do whatever they want. They're all just turning into asshats who think "first do no harm" means no pain meds until you're on your deathbed...and then enough pain meds that you might as well be dead you're so fucking pickled. A pain management clinic if you have the money, they're legal drug dealers...every law has a price. Next...actual drug dealers. Find a junkie, tell him you'll buy his death note if he let's you follow him. Lastly I love the guy suggesting you do it yourself with tea. Fuck the police, fuck the system, they don't care.</br>  Try kratom. Made my withdrawls go away. I can work and function normally on one cup a day.<br><br>5 years opiate abuser here.</br></br>  <br>Shit man that's awful. As someone who uses weed to manage a health condition I know how frustrating it is when people think it's something it isn't. Hope your dad's situation improves.</br>  <br>My dad's liver is actually quite healthy and has been ever since he overcame an alcohol addiction. They give him tests and scans about every 6 months to monitor his organs because of all the morphine he takes and the doctors said he's very healthy in that regard. Its his bones that are falling a part.<br><br><br>Perhaps he is restricted by his parent health system or my dad's insurance, but he said he definitely cannot prescribe to him the same level of morphine he was being given before. My dad has to go in his office almost weekly now to beg for a few more pills to help.<br><br>Thankfully the kratom takes the edge off the withdrawals, but the pain he's going through is imaginable.  do you know a particular strain that has helped you? he's tried a red strain...borneo I think, and he said that he noticed a difference but didn't have enough to experiment with amounts. If there is something more powerful than that, we'd love to hear about it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Fentynal is used for pain management and morphine should have been for break through pain. Bad move on the docs part for ducking that up.  look up cold water extraction. its not morphine but is codeine. might help out a bit and its pretty easy  Dont bother increasing morphine dose, just convert to equipotent dose of a stronger opioid and get the doctor to prescribe that.<br>Fentanyl is a good option; depending where you're from it's often done in a patch.</br>  <br>I think primo indo is suppose to have the greatest pain relieving qualities. Quick kratom is the site I've been using. Shipped in 2 days, and always a free sample included.</br>  If they're using morphine for long term pain control they're doing it wrong anyway.<br><br>Sustained release baseline pain management achieves a better overall management. So using controlled release oxycodone or a transdermal patch (buprenorphine can be a once weekly patch)<br><br>Morphine is by far the worst to use long term as it shows tolerance and dependence the quickest (as you've probably noticed).</br></br></br></br>  after 30 days you can go to a different clinic an as long as you test negative you can get back on the meds (at least in florida)<br><br>or a much better option is look up suboxin or subutex drs/clinics in your area say you are withdrawing they are opioid meds for people coming off pills made for withdraws and they are also painkillers , they come in strips you put in your mouth or pill form<br>I'm on them right now and all i had to say was i had addiction issues n i got a script</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>My dad's got fentynal, oxycontin, morphine, flexeril, elavil and dilaudid. He literally has a large safe with all his medications in it, one because my sister has sticky fingers and would steal his meds to sell on the streets, and two because he would lose track of them if they weren't all in the same place. Each one did a different thing and he had a system of what to take for what activity he was doing and when.<br><br>Now the powerful pain relievers are gone. His degenerative disc disease is very advanced at this stage and he is debating getting surgery on his back (just last year he had a cervical removal and fusion surgery and nerve cleansing on his neck).<br><br><br>Will do, thanks.<br><br><br>Nice, I'll check it out!<br><br>I really do appreciate the suggestions everyone.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> A hospital <br><br>/thread</br></br></br>  <br>suboxone ?</br>  <br> do this suboxin is that shit and they give it to anyone, it is made for people with addiction issues so a positive ua for thc means nothing!<br> i had to fail a ua just to get a script addiction specialist drs prescribe them try looking that up</br></br>  <br>suboxone or subutex is the best option <br><br> growing poppy may take a little wile </br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I've heard it was just addicted and dangerous is heroin...any truth to that?</br></br></br>  <br>*addictive</br>  <br> I use my self diagnosed anxiety as an excuse to smoke weed and not feel like a loser about it <br> I understand chronic, severe pain and opiate dependence  <br><br>Fucking teenagers</br></br></br></br>  <br>dARK Web for a shit ton of money.<br>street corner for cheap.</br></br>  <br>fuck no</br>  <br>you cant even taker other drugs wile your on it because it blocks your opiate receptors and its powerful pain blocker gives you energy makes you happy n talkative , withdrawing from subs is nothing compared to other shit i know this personalty</br>  so op what ru gona do?  <br>Look into and do some research on all the suggestions here and talk them over with my dad.</br>  <br><br>tell your dad i wish him the best of luck<br>, that i miss him and will love him from a distance and if you ever have to sing karaoke and don't know the words just mumble loudly</br></br></br>  tell him now  Let's have atheist thread        YLYL    <br>Not the same guy you responded too, but you are correct, it is 4am here in Hawaii</br>  <br>Lost so hard, fucking saved. Ive seen it before but that's just SO FUCKING GOOD.</br>  R34 cont    <br>Bean Bag Buccaneers is a two player children's game, the object of which is to pick up your treasure chest on the central island and sail back safely.<br><br>Each player has a giant sailing ship as their main game piece. Each ship has a removable sail, two trigger-action side panels, and a huge spring-driven cannon. Players take turns moving forward along a prescribed track and shooting bean bags at their opponent's ship. A hit on one of the side panels will force it to pop off and give the player a free shot at the other side; a hit forcing the sail off becalms the ship for a turn.<br><br>To add to the pirate flavor, each player also has an eye patch. Wearing these will slightly affect depth perception and add a marginal bit of sport to the shooting.<br><br>This game retailed for the somewhat impressive sum of $16 back in 1962. With its huge plastic ships (close to a foot long), giant vinyl play mat, and the eye patches, it may well stand as one of the more overproduced games of the early 1960s.
