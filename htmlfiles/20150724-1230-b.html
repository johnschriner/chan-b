Just make sure you're on silent or else the phone will ring. If it does, just act like your answering, reject the call and be like "lost you, sorry about that."<br><br>It gives you the ability to be a little klutzy and not pay attention, possibly invade someone's personal space a little more. Of course, apologize... Don't be a dick.</br></br></br>        OC    back, my sister left so... more oc  <br>sweet oc breh</br>    I really need 3 girls at the fence somewhere in public with yogapants facing racetrack or something like that        <br>MOAR !!</br>  god dammit my sister is back again brb 15min  <br> asking for it </br>  <br><br>This people.
