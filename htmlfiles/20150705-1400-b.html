I'm assuming 'pad' is something to do with TOR, correct?  <br>wrong, pad is clearnet</br>  a little bit of search and foun it, but i entered a link and nothing (uo9jnu17qt7v), its like empty, (and yes, i didi it the proper way, because the other one posted abobe, asked me for password).<br><br>For the new ones, yes, keep trying with tor ;)</br></br>  <br>Also Tor is being purged, avoid anything illegal there for a few days.</br>  <br>Is that why I cant access it through TOR? Also, from what I've gathered its something to do with cp. I want in.</br>  <br>its purged after an hour , new one is up.<br>uo9jnu17qt7v</br></br>  <br>Figure it out yourself, and avoid talking in the clearnet about cp like you just did dumbass.</br>  <br>I almost believed it till this post.</br>  <br>what is password?</br>  <br>whats the proper way?</br>  <br>just put this link into tor and got nothing.

The Jewish girls I've dated have not been Zionists, they were totally fun to hang with and fuck. But the one that was, she was why Jews are hated.</br>  Hey man. I'm a jew and I'm not doing anything. I got a meh job. I like to play vidya. Why the hate?  <br>  meh job, vidya </br>    <br/>  <br>no man. i really have a very okay job. im middle management at a hotel. i like to play some videogames too. i guess im just confused like why you hate me. if you have some conspiracy theory about jews controlling media like whatever. i think youre wrong but i get why you would hate those jews. i am not those jews. im just a guy tryna make ends meet man. like what did i ever do to you?</br>    <br>cool man.</br>  <br><br>I don't even know whether if you guys actually hate Jews or it's just another meme.<br><br>Atheist Jew here, Zionist but not hardcore. Not cheap, not evil, and i dislike religious Jews.</br></br></br></br>  <br>trying too hard.<br>Jews are far more intelligent</br></br>  <br>You are on /b/. People will hate you if you are left handed. Cancel the manicure, loose the skirt and stop crying.</br>  <br>  writes left handed </br>        <br>how can you be a jew if you are atheist? Some Godfrey Elfwick shit right there</br>  <br>don't feed the trolls homie. simple minds will find a simple answer (e.g. "secret jews control the world and are why i'm not a success."</br>  99% of anti-semites are poor.<br><br> prove me wrong </br></br>  <br><br>I live in a non-religious Jewish society, i celebrate Jewish holidays, I speak Hebrew, I used to believe in Religious shit etc.</br></br>    i just hate jews.<br>/thread</br>  <br> of anti-semites are poor. <br>Burden of proof is on you. You made the claim.</br></br>    <br>gross</br>  I went to a private law school in south Florida. Fuck jüden. <br><br>Also I'm not rich, made it with hard work and dedication. My family is from Argentina (since 1945 for some reason) so you can guess I wasn't very popular.<br><br>Anybody who doesn't see that jews are the most intolerant, hypocritical, self-serving pieces of shit is lying to themselves. Don't believe me? Go ahead and try to marry a jew if you aren't one.</br></br></br></br>  <br>t<br>Out of order counselor. Facts before feels. <br><br> You know I'm right </br></br></br></br>  <br>99 percent of people, when learning the truth about you "people", become "anti-semitic".<br><br>I am glad I live in the time when you things will be purged yet again.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Don't fall on this. Jew is a race, not a religion.</br></br>  moar jew hate. theres better ones out there  <br> stay poor yurop <br><br>Letting the Greeks fuck you in the ass. So sad.

I haven't cum in two days, and normally I cum 8-10 times a day.  <br>I beg to differ</br>    I'm, here for business and business alone.  <br>Rename your cock to Old Faithful. Continue storing up your cum for days. Then, finally jizz everywhere.</br>  <br><br>Nahh it totally isn't~</br></br>    <br>Why don't you ask her to do terrible things to you then, hm?</br>  <br>I know, but I NEED someone. I haven't came in so long and I've got so much build up I need to get rid of...</br>  <br>You remind me of travis touchdown.</br>  <br>I want to but I'm nervous.</br>  This entire thread is cancer  <br>Let's make a transaction.</br>  <br>It does that anyway. I have a hyperactive sex drive. I can cum 8-10 times a day if I have quick 5-10 minute faps, or if I edge for a few hours at a time, I cum 3-4 huge loads. <br><br>I would love to get my semen tested for potency. My latest fetish is being a breeding bull for slutty wives/girlfriends.</br></br></br>  <br>ask in other thead before it 404 but is this the person that commission that character?<br><br>I love your character so much</br></br></br>  <br>Sponty, go do viciously lewd things to  .

I got a pair almost exactly like em.</br></br>  <br>I was about to ask if you wanted a hand job ,but I see people already want the voluptuous "rabbit"</br>  <br>I love her character too, I fapped so many times to her.<br><br>I came 8 times today but seeing the character posted makes me rock hard again.</br></br></br>  <br>I sell more than just glasses.</br>  Favourite anime thread  SAO is terrible, though. Ultimate wish-fulfillment protagonist, shitty side characters, worst love interest, less than average plot, etc.<br><br>Why the fuck do people like it?</br></br>  <br>Get our of here with that story free babby anime.</br>  <br>Because they enjoy it.<br>I liked it, but only first half of first season and bits of first half of season 2, the rest is garbage.</br></br>  I've been watching SAO II on Toonami, with /co/, and it's fucking horrific. Like the writing and plot is so bad I cannot help but watch it just to laugh at how awful it is. Haven't watched any of the first SAO, but I really cannot imagine it's any better.<br>As for myself, my favorite series overall is probably Code Geass. Despite how the second half got kind of crazy and absurd.</br>  <br>Why would you like something thats terrible? You deserve better.</br>  Haruhi    <br>Shit man, some people like traps, ponies and other disgusting shit.<br>And me, I somehow enjoyed parts of sao, but still, there's tons of better things I've watched</br></br>  I actually really enjoyed Boku no Pico, no joke, the 3rd episode kinda sucked but the first 2 episode were very enjoyable. I also really liked Kodomo no Jikan a lot, it was more than just a shallow Loli anime  <br>i tried this show and it just got so boring i couldn't keep watching</br>  my taste &gt; your taste  <br> tons of better things <br> Favorite anime thread </br></br>  1: Mirai Nikki<br>2: Tokyo Ghoul<br>3: Seraph of the end<br>4: Log Horizon<br>5: Deadman Wonderland<br><br>Bow down to my shit taste.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  It's either this or Mushishi.  I hate anime (except for SoL shows). Cartoon are for children you faggots  <br><br>Welcome to the NHK probably</br></br>  <br>Actually, Log is probably above Seraph even though season 2 was kinda boring.</br>  <br>It's absolutely detestable. one of the worst anime I have ever seen.</br>  <br> My nigga </br>  Ive only seen a few Animes but my favourite so far has to be kill la kill  K-on is my favorite.<br> inb4 "u watch moeshit XDDD" <br>fuck off.</br></br>  finished it recently, one of the best ive seen in a while  easy  This is how pretentious I am.  <br>It completely falls apart after the ~6th episode. The art is very nice, though.</br>  <br>thats fine and all<br>but dont deny you watch moeshit<br>get some good taste or deal with the fact you're weeaboo trash</br></br></br>  <br>It looks like you are into tragedy and some gore. <br> Not having Fate/Zero on the list <br>Rozen Maiden Master race</br></br></br>  <br>unless you're a girl, you are a massive faggot for calling it your favorite.</br>  <br>Did someone say desu?</br>  This is better than any of the shonen bullshit in this thread.  <br/>  <br>The whole Fate/ thing is confusing me though, i really want to get into it, but there are so many different ones i don't know which one is season 1...</br>  this or Hunter X hunter 2011    Watched most of SAO. Not good, but not bad either. I'd say it's subpar.  <br><br>just watch fate/stay night unlimited blade works by ufotable the two seaons ended last week<br><br>then theres fate/zero which is a prequel, you can watch them in either order <br><br>fate/stay night is a VN so the other ones are like different routes and shit so just focus on the new unlimited blade works and zero</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not every day I see a fellow fan.</br>    <br>First there was "fate/stay night", which many people consider crap.<br>Then came fate/zero, which is a prequel to all fate stories<br>And then fate/stay night unlimited blade works(anime, not the movie, which is crap)<br><br>And then there are some spin offs like carnival phantasm or fate kaleid liner</br></br></br></br></br>      <br>Fate/Zero comes first series wise, and then Fate/StayNight(UBW) is its sequal. With that being said, don't watch it first because it is so much better than StayNight and you will be disappointed. Stay Night also doesn't take itself quite as serious.</br>  <br> being a straight male <br> not liking cute girls being cute <br><br>Pick one faggot</br></br></br></br>  really underrated imo    <br>ya i know the feel. mushishi especially gets looked over. Both have perfect pacing and are gorgeous.</br>  <br>I lov ethis meme! :D</br>  1. Steins Gate<br>2. Samurai Champloo <br>3. Jojo <br>4. Higurashi <br>5. Katanagatari<br>I don't know what this says about me but here it is</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> being a male <br> watching loli idols pandered at male audience that has no problem sexualizing or fawning over how "cute they are" <br> not realizing this shit is whats destroying anime </br></br></br>   Desu     <br> Mushishi especially gets looked over <br><br>Maybe, but it's not that rare to see it in people's top 10 lists.</br></br></br>  Get on my level /b/ro's!  Fate/Kaleid liner is obviously the best  <br> not realizing that's been in anime since fucking forever </br>  Not really sure but I really enjoyed Gunslinger Girl      <br>thats the point, its been there but it used to be a part of it but now shit like k-on is making it the center and shit is being pandered to that and ruining quality</br>  <br>Mah niga</br>  anyone know a good anime with with an anti-hero, like death note, code geass ect. can't find many, because all animes are about 100% good guys saving the world.  Well, i have to watch all the fate series now. God that's going to take a long time...  <br>Darker than black</br>  <br>either this, FMA Brotherhood, or Hellsing Ultimate</br>  <br> successfully fulfilling audience expectations as tastes and demographics change <br> killing anime <br>You're a faggot. You're a faggot that doesn't know shit about anime.</br></br></br>  <br>Why seraph? It seemed so average</br>    <br>hellsing ultimate,<br>maybe not really an anti-hero but alucard aint exactly a good guy<br><br>first season of gundam 00 is nice because the protagonists arent really portrayed as heroes, theyre just going around blowing shit up and destroying the worlds military for their own reasons<br><br>terror in resonance has two protagonists that are kind of anti heroes</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i respect that. a few more of my favorites.<br> Absolute top tier. <br>  Ghost in the shell <br>  Trigun <br>  Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood <br>  Baccano! <br>  Dragon Ball Z <br> <br> Recommended <br>  Death Note <br>  FLCL <br>  Psycho Pass <br>  Hajime no ippo <br>  Naruto: Shippuden (because why the fuck not) <br>  Eden of the East </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  CCS is the greatest achievement in televised animated media.<br>You can't even argue.</br>    Recommend me a GREAT artsy anime thats NOT: Lain, Tatami Galaxy (all other anime by that guy), Mononoke, NGE, FLCL. <br><br>Madoka is shit.</br></br>  <br>I just really enjoyed it for some reason, it hooked me from the first episode and i have no idea why. I usually don't like the "Revenge is the only thing in life" type of main character (Fuck Attack on Titan btw).</br>    <br>Ergo Proxy.</br>  <br>Top tier taste my friend</br>  <br>That one is even worse then madoka. Pay attention to word GREAT.</br>  <br>Ill tell you why not.<br>Because the amount of filler is absurd. I am sitting here waiting foe the final arc to be over. And it would be in no less than 10 episodes if every episode didn't cut to have filler. and then every 2 episodes are filler episodes unrelated to anything.<br>I like the show, but jesus fuck.</br></br></br>  <br>If by FLCL u mean fooly cooly gtfo plz</br>  <br>Oh, sorry, I thought you had taste.<br>Perhaps try One Piece.</br></br>  <br>gankutsuo</br>  <br>Every film directed my Mamoru Oshii. Everything by Satoshi Kon. Most of Isao Takahata's works. Anything blessed by Katsuhiro Otomo. Ergo Proxy (though BY GOD IS IT PRETENTIOUS). Mushishi. Tekkon Kinkreet. That'll do I guess.</br>  <br> GITS <br> Trigun <br> Baccano! <br> FLCL <br> Hajime no Ippo <br><br>Shit man, you got some great taste.<br><br><br>Mushishi.<br><br>Also, Madoka may be overrated, but it's far from shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   /b/ has better taste in Anime than /a/ <br>Kudos.<br> Why does /a/ like moeshit and SoL so much anyway?</br></br>  <br>Naruto is great if you skip the filler. It would be easy for someone to watch it now because they have the benefit of being able to look up what to skip.<br>But for someone watching it as it came out, it was fifteen YEARS of good parts separated by massive lengths of shit.<br>Yeah there was the manga, but that was a lot of reading then and over 700 chapters.</br></br></br>  <br> Satoshi Kon <br>May he rest in peace.</br></br>  <br>watched it 3 times. :/</br>  <br>Because fans of the genre like anime. Y'know, the kind that gets made with regularity by Japan.<br>You're a shallow poser with disdain for the ACTUAL audience.</br></br>  <br>Already know/watched everything you mentioned. Mushushi wasn't anything special.</br>  <br>i dont get this anime, whats so good about it? its like csi miami with samurai.</br>  <br>Because /a/ is full of weebs?<br>And anyone who is here and not a newfag trans or fb thread might be an oldfag</br></br>  <br>Becasue aside from /tg/, every board is shit at its own subject since they've been immersed in it for so long.<br><br>/co/ is awful for comics and cartoons discussion, /v/ is shit for video game discussion, /mu/ is shit for music, etc.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;625862157 <br>no go away unless it's anime related</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;625862157 <br><br>What?</br></br>   625861887 <br>Its pretty uncreative and cliche with or without the fillers</br>  <br>In that case, get looking into Kihachiro Kawamoto.</br>  <br>It has a nice art style, character development and a decent storyline with pretty nice action scenes, I'd recommend watching it on a quiet night</br>  Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches.<br><br>And Lucky Star too.</br></br>  Terror in resonance.. 10/10<br>Here is a good review.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=oQ5<wbr>_BN8A55o</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Yes! I loved yamada kun.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>My niggas.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>read the VN can't go wrong with that.</br>    <br>You have fucking TERRIBLE taste.<br>It was shit. Everything after the first couple of episodes was fucking retarded and cliched.<br>If you read any social commentary into it you are, as my father used to say, a pillock.</br></br></br>  Probably GTO or Ano natsu de matteru.  Probably pleb tier anime taste but loved psycho pass, death note, gurren laggan, attack on titan, FMA + FMA:b, knights of Sidonia. Yeah all good IMO    FLCL  So?  <br>I also loved GTO, Shingeki No Kyujin, SAO, Absolute Duo, Plastic Memories, Death Note, and Fate animes.</br>  <br>VN? <br><br>VIsual Novels? <br>Where can I read it?</br></br></br></br>  Am I the only one that found the second half of GYAKKYOU BURAI KAIJI: ULTIMATE SURVIVOR hard to watch?  <br>I felt attached to the characters and thought it was good development.. I wish maybe they could have gone to 24 ep.. Maybe it wouldn't have been so rushed.</br>  <br>Psycho pass was amazing... And so was death note.. Yea all those are great.</br>  <br><br><br>hahaha, im not the person your insulting. YOUR IN AN ANIME THREAD! whatever you consider to be better than anybodies fav anime you must realize this: you watch anime too, the same animation that has sailor moon. No matter what you say, still think of yourself as a gigantic faggot.<br><br>ps. i am a huge fucking faggot whos about to suck some cock. try and insult me</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty much anywhere.. If you google anime visual novels you can download a bunch.</br>  Detroit metal city was pretty good.  Bokurano isn't my favorite anime, which I've already listed in this thread, but I think it deserves an honorable mention.<br><br>It also has a pretty cool title song.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=05p<wbr>646nlYS0</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>Desu</br>  <br>Development was cheap and predictable, and the plot was absurd. Being rushed at least meant it didn't clutter into the next season.</br>  Aldnoah zero.. The first season. Second season was shit. But give first season a shot.  Daily lives of highschool boys was pretty good  <br>HARUHI SUZUMIYA</br>  <br>You've crushed my dreams. Atleast admit the OST was God tier.</br>    boom    <br>original <br>I don't think cute stuff is bad heck I liked Kanon for it's sentimental/cuteness but K-on is just over the top moe with no sense that it just kills your manhood (though I like some of their music).<br>And that's why I think you're a huge faggot.</br></br></br>  <br>Agreed, though it was going in a downward spiral from the first episode . At least I think so</br>  <br>OST was p fucking great actually, I had forgotten.</br>     2015 <br> still not recognizing the works of the master himself Anno as the greatest <br> NGE <br> Plebs </br></br></br>  Saber is best girl.  <br>You just can't handle fun you miserable faggot.</br>  <br>shecked</br>  <br>Who are you quoting</br>  <br> NGE <br> not gay </br></br>  <br><br>hahaha, you seem to be missing the point of this thread. I'm sitting here downloading everything im intersted in, it's suggestions. People like you are whats ruining the culture. <br><br>"well i think my cartoon that I WATCH is better than the cartoon YOU watch, and i'll call you what im secretly hiding from the world. FAGGOT!"<br><br>your such a fucking loser. <br><br>ps. once again..... im a huge faggot whos about to suck a huge cock, no joke. Try and insult me you fruitcake</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> NGE as your favorite anime <br> calling others plebs </br></br>  Genshiken master race.  <br>underageb&amp;</br>  <br>Should have ended with Kirito walking down the hallway.</br>  <br>Guess that makes me as pretentious as you, because I loved this show.</br>  Problem with SAO is after the ending of the 2nd season it wasn't as exciting anymore.. I want something where they're actually putting there life on the line. Not fucking anime adventures 2.0  <br><br><br>did you just call someone a poser on /b/? hope that boosts your ego</br></br></br>  What's your favorite manga, /b/?<br><br>Hard Mode: No Berserk, since we all know how great it is<br><br>One of the best mangas of all time with one of the worst endings of all time, reporting in</br></br></br></br>  <br>Crab a cutest</br>  <br>Yostuba&amp;<br>Obviously.</br></br>  <br>Theres heaps which one to begin with LOL</br>  <br>Battle Angel Alita, and the sequel manga Last Order<br><br>Honorable mention goes to One-Punch Man</br></br></br>  <br>Onepunch Man</br>  I want to say Berserk, but the anime adaptation was too short and the movies are shit.  <br>Not read too many but from what I have read I'd have to go with TWGOK.</br>  <br>Saya no Uta</br>  Only anime I can watch over and over again. Classic  <br>Fate Series<br>SAO<br>are some really good ones.</br></br></br>   Terrible Taste: The Thread   <br>I like how the MC could have cucked the king of his country. Also yeah its underated as fuck no ody mentions it.</br>  <br>Tomoko - /b/ as a girl</br>  <br>Best anti-villain, coming through.</br>  Can't believe Black Lagoon hasn't been mentioned.  <br>And like the insecure faggot you are, you don't actually share with us your own shitty taste in anime.<br><br>What's the point in even posting, then?</br></br></br>  <br> tfw everything up and including the Osaka arc was fucking incredible <br> everything after was so shit and you can tell the author just had enough of it and just wanted to end it <br><br>Such a shame. One of my favorite mangas of all time, and the author just didn't give enough of a shit to give it a good ending. There aren't many mangas these days that shy away from killing off its main characters. Gantz was really unique in that regard. <br><br>Almost nothing in anime/manga history can even come close to the intensity of the Osaka arc. Literally perfect in every single fucking way. I've never been on the edge of my seat when reading a manga until that shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>        <br><br>what anime is this?</br></br>        <br> There aren't many mangas these days that shy away from killing off its main characters. <br><br>One manga immediately springs to mind.</br></br></br>  I like Maoyuu Maou Yuusha and Spice and Wolf.<br> I'm okay with slutty redheads. </br>    <br>If Hellsing Ultimate didn't use any of those stupid anime tropes like the original did, it would be the perfect anime.</br>  <br>TTGL</br>  <br> Whines about terrible taste in the thread <br> Says his favorite is TTGL <br> Meanwhile TTGL has been posted a few times already in the thread <br><br>You trying to say your own taste is shit?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This show was pretty dope, kind of reminded me of battle royale.</br>    Rurouni Kenshin  <br>So you're a complete pleb when it comes to anime and just decided to shit on everyone else.<br><br>Don't get me wrong, TTGL is pretty cool, but to have it as your favorite just shows you don't have much to say about this topic.</br></br></br>    <br>I liked it better when he was killing people...<br>Samurai X Trust and Betrayal.</br></br>  Initial D  <br>No one is safe from the JOHJ.</br>  <br> I want something where they're actually putting there life on the line <br><br>Read Gantz, trust me. Even if the ending is shit, the rest of the story is amazing, and it feels like the main characters are putting their life on the line because they are, and no one is truly safe from plot armor (until near the end, that is, which is another reason why the ending was shit)</br></br></br>          <br>Wait a minute... Isn't that...</br>  Good ass anime...  <br><br><br><br><br><br>You must be at least 18 years of age to use this website</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> Even if the ending is shit <br>The ending is literally the only good part. Everything else is just fanservice, either in the form of gore, guns or boobs. Also vampires and guys with psychic powers, because why the fuck not.</br></br>  <br>Terra Formars. Giant roach men from Mars killing everyone. Absolutely no one is safe. Especially not your favorite.</br>  <br>BECK<br>It's also my favorite chinese cartoon<br>Imma bet my waifu that the majority of you dont even know beck</br></br></br>  <br> The ending is literally the only good part. <br><br>You cant be serious, can you? The ending was shit. Yes there was a bit of fan service in the manga, and lots of gore, but there's an actual fucking story there, and it's incredible.</br></br></br>                <br>Space niggers killing everyone. It's pretty cool.</br>  <br> there's an actual fucking story there <br>Without the ending, the story is literally just "here are some dudes killing aliens". There's also some pleb-tier drama, but that's shit as well.</br></br>  niggers are gonna have trouble knowing if the sounds outside are gunshots or fireworks  I’m not even going to bother with greeting the likes of you, I’m just gonna get to the point.<br><br>Whenever I read about some of you faggots claiming to have a great job, making 100k a year or receiving this or that education,<br>I roll my eyes and laugh. It’s cute really, because let me tell you a little something about myself:<br><br>I'm a Junior Chief Executive Officer. I’ve got degrees from Harvard and Oxford and I'm only 23 years old. I make 470k+ a year,<br>and that's just a starting salary. While you suckers are still working your blue collar jobs or attending clown college in the<br>hopes of scoring a Mickey Mouse degree, I'm travelling the world 24/7, flying Elite class, driving the finest handmade automobiles<br>or sailing $25 m yachts. Money, women, respect, the whole shebang. I’ve got it all.<br><br>Sometimes I look down from my airplane window and think about all those "little people", getting up at 6AM, driving their little Hyundai's<br>to their cubicles or building sites, and coming home at 6PM to eat their pork and beans before having pathetic and gross sex with their ugly<br>wives. But when a smoking hot stewardess comes over to bring me my $18.000 bottle of whiskey, I forget all about them.<br><br>Tomorrow I've got a meeting with some other executives over in Dubai. And guess who gets to decide whether or not our firm will open up a<br>new office over there? That's right: me. I even get to decide what shape the building is going to be. And no, I'm not going for the world's<br>largest tower. I don't need to overcompensate: I've got an 11" dick already.<br><br>Anyway, I've got to go now, because that smoking hot stewardess I told you about? Yeah, she brought her friends. They want to climb the REAL<br>Burj Khalifa. In my pants..<br><br>Pic related, that's my wife.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  gr8 b8 m8  <br>tldr.op is probably a faggot anyways.</br>  G8 b8 m8 would r8 8/8  Still OP. <br><br>Still a faggot.</br></br>  Can i get 200 dollars?  <br>Your wife after I slapped her ass*</br>  Can someone explain why cheating on your girlfriend or boyfriend makes people jealous and mad?<br><br>I wouldn't give a fuck if my girlfriend decided to gave sex with someone else and I've told her that.
