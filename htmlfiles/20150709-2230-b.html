Fire on earth is a chemical reaction, where as the sun uses nuclear fusion. The gravity of its self fuses hydrogen atoms together which produce radiation and helium, once all the hydrogen is used, the helium starts to fuse which is what causes a star to expand then implode.  It could not fit inside of your moms pussy. But my dick could.  Everything came from dust.  <br>you might wanna re think that one, chief</br>  Saturn would float if you put in on water  <br><br>The Electric Universe Theory, OP. Check it out some time. http://www.thunderbolts.info<br><br>But to discuss just one aspect of it, the proponents of the theory believe that the myths and legends handed down by our ancestors used to mean something more than just a bunch of silly stories. That they actually witnessed a reordering of the solar system, that the sky we're looking at now was different back in their day, and that a great catastrophe changed things up.<br><br>Take this topographic map of Mars, for instance. Mainstream theories tell us the northern hemisphere was an ocean, and that triangle configuration of mountains in the midwest were volcanoes.<br><br>The EU proponents claim that a massive electric discharge between Mars and another planet caused the features we see. That the equatorial scar we see was the site of the largest discharge, which is why there is a canyon extending to the north and a mountain range to the south. That the same features can be recreated in a lab, whereby discharges will deposit material on positively charges surfaces and excavate material on negatively charged surfaces. That the entire northern hemisphere underwent this excavation, which accounts for its relative smoothness. The tubes of Mars people were talking about for a while are actually glassified dunes where electric currents carved out torturous paths.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Its a common misconception that the moon creates the tides. <br><br>It's actually the mass of my cock creating a large graviational pull.</br></br>    The expansion of space is accelerating. There might come a time where every point in the universe will be moving away from every other point in space at the speed of light.  <br><br>More EU Theory.<br><br>This is the caldera of Mons Olympus, the largest volcano we see in our solar system. It's several times taller than Mount Everest. Notice how there are craters centered on other craters, and can even be seen being carved into the larger, main crater?<br><br>This is because electricity follows the path of least resistance. At some point the arc jumped from the lowest point (the center) to the highest point (the rim) and began creating a new crater there.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>laughably inaccurate.</br>  <br><br>Not at the speed of light, objects with mass* cannot reach this speed. <br><br>*Yes photons technically have a mass, hence the reason solar sails work</br></br></br></br>  If you were to have a ship that was "immune" to the forces exuded by a black hole, you could see its effect on the universe around it. As you drew closer, you could see what is known as a Red Shift, where infrared and radio waves are "slowed down" and brought into the observable light spectrum. After that, the observable universe around you would begin to shrink to a single point behind you as relative space is warped. Once the point has disappeared you will be at the point of no return. You will be so close to the Event Horizon of the black hole that space is so horrifyingly warped that no matter what direction you try to go, it will always bring you closer to the Event Horizon.  <br>Interesting, thanks!</br>  <br>Also chemtrails are controlling our mind</br>  <br>you consider finite to be a big word? Imbecile</br>  If you replace all antimatter in the universe with matter and vice versa it would behave roughly the same.  <br>Nigger, you have any idea what is the difference in potential required to make outer space conductive even on short distances?</br>  <br><br>There's a dude on YouTube, something LaPointe, where he discusses a theory of his called the Primer Field theory. It's very similar to the EU Theory, but he focuses on bowl-shaped magnetic fields and how he believes the unifying force of nature, the most smallest particles, are actually these tiny bowl-shaped fields. It's a pretty good series of videos, even if he sounds like the Ben Stein the Clear Eyes guy.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Very interesting, yet completely retarded.</br></br></br>  <br>it's spacious</br>  <br>what happens next?</br>  <br><br>I imagine it takes quite a difference. Venus has a comet-like tail that routinely extends toward Earth's magnetic field. Perhaps that would explain our phase-lock with the planet?<br><br>http://www.space.com/19537-venus-co<wbr>met-atmosphere.html</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Somehow I can believe it<br>Can the same thing happen to Earth?<br><br>mybodyisready.jpg</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We're talking space expansion, not the speed of the objects in it.<br><br>And yes, I know I'm talking out my ass here, its just something I was wondering about. What would be the next step, if something like this did happen? Technicaly, it would mean the end of the flow of time, as everything would be outside everything else's light cone. You could call it a singularity, just inverted.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Fuck if I know, beyond the Event Horizon lies the singularity and I don't even WANT to begin to think of what that shit would do to you, magic ship or not. <br><br>Black holes are fucking scary.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If you keep going in a straight line, you end up back where you started.<br><br>Also, there may be eleven dimensions, we just can't find 7 of em.</br></br></br>  <br>Btw, if photons technically have mass, how did they achieve the speed they have? I thought it takes infinite energy to do that, and that the mass of the object in question would become infinite as well?</br>  They used to believe long ago, or at least it was a theory pumped out by someone affiliated with the Pope at the time, that the rings of Saturn was actually Jesus' foreskin<br><br> The More You Know </br></br>  I need some space.  <br>all is one...

Elegant.</br>    <br>nigerism at work, it will never, or can reach 0 kelvin cause the energy required to do that would be larger than the allocated energy for the extrusion of spacial bodies (which already produces heat), so when we get to the verge of "0.1" kelvin, universe will start shrinking, as predicted.</br>  <br> taking bait that obvious </br>  <br><br><br><br> Spaghettification <br>If you get close to a black hole you get spaghettified.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But won't it start heating up as it shrinks?</br>  Against movie logic, you don't explode or "boil" in space without a suit. What would really happen is as you float there in a zero pressure environment, all the fluid in your body would start to expand. So, if you were lucky enough to not asphyxiate right away, the last thing you'd hear before you die would be your bones vibrating from the expansion.  <br><br>That would happen long before you had a chance to see any of the cool shit, but the thought experiments in the earlier posts were under the assumption that you had some MAGIC SPACE BOX that allowed you to not get torn apart on the atomic level as you neared it.</br></br>  <br><br>Of course, my man. We're just waiting our turn.<br><br>I'm a creationist. I believe in a god, gods or some group of individuals that maintain the continuity of life. There's all sorts of math when you look at the layout of Earth and the origins of rivers and their ends. There's a line of ancient sites around the Earth.<br><br>I imagine planets are born, and they have an abundance of life and the ability to sustain the minds of the gods. And then they age and the clockwork mechanism of our solar system has a built in catastrophe designed to put everything (and everyone) in its place.<br><br>So I imagine the asteroid belt once looked like Mars, and Mars once looked like Earth, and Venus currently looks like how Earth used to look, and in the middle of our Sun a new planet is being created. On the surface of the Sun, Birkeland currents spiraling over each other are accreting hydrogen atoms into heavier elements, which then rain down into the center of the star to form the planet. At some point, a critical point will be reached and the planet will be ejected.<br><br>I also imagine history is timed to coincide with these events. So for all the people that think the Jews are controlling to world, and wonder to what end, there you have it. They're God's chosen people alright, and their job is to keep us from discovering the truth, because what the fuck would YOU do if you discovered the world were ending?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Also, a couple astronauts were exposed to vacuum, during training exercises. Its speculated a person can survive a minute or two in vacuum, but he'd be conscious only 14 seconds of that time.</br>  <br>I'd end it first and take all the credit.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=wdJ<wbr>yafSBCb0</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Being from Italy I simply enjoy the fact that spaghettification is an actual scientific concept.</br>  <br>You're a fucking retard with not a single clue on how the forces and laws of this universe work.</br>  Empty space has mass  <br><br>I cant even begin to imagine what it would be like to be "spaghettified". At a certain point during the process, say if you were going in feet first, the dilation in time relative to your feet and your head would be different. <br><br>Meaning, time would be moving more slowly at your feet than at your head and the difference between the two would only become greater as you got closer. <br><br>I guess you could say it would be relatively painless, as the pain impulses from your lower body wouldn't be able to reach your brain due to the dilation.... That actually makes it worse, knowing your should be able to feel that shit and not being able to as your atoms are stripped away. <br><br>FUCK YEAH SPACE</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> empty space <br> empty <br>No such thing as an actual vacuum m80. They're always filled with some particle or another.</br></br></br>  <br>You make me want to stop taking drugs.</br>  <br><br>I never claimed I was a learned man, but there's a lot of shit I've read up on the EU theory over a long time that eventually convinced me.<br><br>Take for instance Saturn's rings. What the fuck causes the spokes scientists have seen in them? What maintains the intricate system altogether?<br><br>David Lapointe has a good explanation for them, which he demonstrates with his bowl-shaped magnets with electric currents running through them:<br><br><br><br>The bowls even have auroral glows in them where Saturn has it's auroras.<br><br>How the fuck is the E ring around Saturn composed entirely of tiny, several-micron-wide particles? There's a long drawn out, far-fetched explanation for how one of Saturn's moons is still volcanically active or whatever, but then they discovered the same fucking ring around Uranus, so that pretty much buries that shitty initial explanation and scientists write it off as "we need more research".<br><br>There's so many problems with our standard model, that eventually it HAS to collapse on itself.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the moon is experiencing tidal locking due to its close proximity to the planet, causing one side +- a few degrees to face us at all times.<br>planets do this too when they're closer to the sun (having been electrically produced and magnetically ejected by it somewhere around its equator).<br>over time, bodies spiral away from the sun (because the sun is moving and is in fact being itself drug along by another star) and gradually stop tidal locking, as the moon will do one day with earth.</br></br></br>  <br> FUCK YEAH SPACE </br>  <br>A vacuum isn't empty. It has particles popping in and out of existence. Those particles are popping in space. Even the space between those particles have mass.</br>  <br><br>Sorry, the David LaPointe video with the Saturn spokes is here:<br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/2NogyJ0k8Kw?t=3217<wbr></wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  There exists credence to the theory that the universe is simply a 3 dimensional hologram representing a 2 dimensional cartograph of information. Look into the holographic theory or simply read "The Black Hole War" by Leonard Susskind.  <br>This is all wrong. There are things in the Universe that are currently moving away from each other at greater than the speed of light because the Universe is expanding. From their reference frames they are not, but redshift tells the story<br><br>also photons do not have mass. Their momentum is what pushes solar sails</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Well.... Great. Does any of this actually have any scientific grounding?</br></br></br>  <br>Wrong.</br>  <br><br>So, God is a 15 yo faggot playing a video game?<br><br>That would actually explain a lot!</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Ever read Halton Arp's stuff about the redshift?<br><br>http://electric-cosmos.org/arp.htm</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>How do you get momentum without mass? Isn't it basically speed*mass?</br></br>  taht it was cerated by GOD THE HOLY FAHTER BLESSDE BE HIS NMAE  <br>Spaghettification is due to gravity's inverse square law.<br>The time dilation stuff is general relativity.</br></br>    <br>Yes. The force from gravity on a point is inversly proportional to the square of the distance you are from the massive thing. So to use an extreme example, if your feet are 2m from the center of a black hole and your head is 4m away, your feet will get pulled on twice as hard, thus stretching you out. Mass also distorts time, so your feet will be experiencing time slower than you.<br><br>Once you get in the event horizon, would signals be able to travel down your body, just not up again?</br></br></br>  <br>Prove it.</br>  <br>Like the inside of a combustion engineds combustion chamber. It goes back in after the temperature for expansion cools enough for gravity to suck it all back in then it condenses into the tiniest hottest singularity for a split instant and BOOM new big bang new universe for it all to start again. Real problem is this inevitably leaves behind some atoms and energy in the insane void that is space so eventually it will just stop working or being effective.</br>  <br>Nope. Momentum is mass * velocity / sqrt(1 - velocity^2/c^2)<br><br>Since v^2/c^2 is usually about 0, at slow speeds, momentum is indeed close to mass * velocity</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>This black hole bullshit scares the fuck out of me and I love it</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sorry that didn't actualy make sense because it's still 0 if mass is 0. The thing I forgot is that for photons, v=c as well, so it's 0/0, which is undefined. Thus, for photons, we have to use a different expression entirely, where the momentum is E/c (energy over speed of light) or h/lambda (some random constant ~ 10^-34 divided by the light's wavelength)</br>   come to /b/ <br> find a better space thread than most of what I've seen on /sci/  <br><br>okay, this is weird.</br></br></br>  <br>Actually it would be like your feet went through an eternity of being ripped apart but you feel it in an instant as it went towards your brains relative time. Of course your whole body would feel this to different degrees. The real fun happens when neurons at the bottom of the brain fire slower then those at the top and it starts effecting your thought processes. Most likely you'd suffocate as the lungs would be running at a slower extended time so they'd be using ALOT more air to breathe in what your brain would perceive as a second and shove out impulses like normal. Basically the brain says breathe at a certain interval but your lungs have already gone through 30 of those with only one signal from your brain. You'd piss and shit yourself just before you suffocate but AFTER mind numbing excruciating pain but before you become a mental retard as all thought processes operating at different timeframes essentially partitions your brain into areas of low activity on an atomic level. You'd also go blind pretty quick.</br>  <br>According to the EU theory how old is the life on Earth and how long we have left?</br>  <br>Accelerating expansion leads us asymptotically to a cosmic horizon that is at a _fixed_ distance (not one constantly moving away). That's because the horizon distance depends on curvature, and in our universe curvature eventually only depends on the cosmological constant (which is, obviously, constant). We live in an asymptotically de Sitter space.<br><br>One of the corollaries of this is that a Bekenstein-type bound applies to our Hubble volume, making for a finite number of distinguishable quantum states possible within it, which means, among other things, that any entity within it from now till eternity can have only a finite number of possible different thoughts. After some time, if life lasts indefinitely, its thoughts would become just identical repeats of past thoughts. This happens much before Poincare recurrence.</br></br></br>  Haven't seen this posted yet  Ayy lmao  <br> There's all sorts of math when you look at the layout of Earth and the origins of rivers and their ends. <br>Numerology strikes again.</br></br>  this thread with this picture....<br><br>i've seen it multiple times...<br><br><br>what the fuck<br><br><br>who is making these<br>is it one person???<br><br>i want to save this pic and make one in a few weeks<br><br><br>maybe i will...<br>maybe i wont<br><br><br>muahahahahha</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>The rings spin. Throwing heavier shit outward. As the rings spin they maintain different levels of static charge at varying rates that keep the various rings partitioned from each other by differing charges. This whole thing keeps its momentum but the moons revolving through them like a paddle keeping them on course and charging them more. This is all set off by saturns gravitational forces pull the shit around as it spins creating gravitational eddies that the moons ride in the wake of. The moons volcanically active cause tidal forces from said eddies keep mashing shit internally causing friction. Now whats REALLY interesting is its bigger than the fucking earth perfectly hexagonal on the northern pole storm it has.</br>  <br><br>You'd also have to take into account all the blood being pulled to your feet, so you'd pass out before all the real fun began. BUT IMAGINE IF YOU WERE SPINNING AS YOU FELL IN! <br><br>Did I mention I love space?</br></br></br></br>  <br> a Bekenstein-type bound applies to our Hubble volume </br>  <br>its nearly as big as youre mum lol</br>  <br> ALOT <br>There's no such word. I suggest you learn English first and astronomy later.</br></br>  <br> youre mum </br>  <br>Better example of its size. It would go to pretty much saturns orbital ring.</br>  <br><br>Either hemisphere of your brain experiencing noticeable time dilation at different rates! What would that even feel like?! I'M GETTING FAR TOO EXCITED ABOUT THIS!</br></br>  <br>what about Big Rip</br>  <br>Sirius is the biggest planet on this picture.</br>  <br>fucking hell bruva where is that gif from?<br>also, used to love space as a kid. whenever I eat mushies, my CEV's always include walking on/floating over different planets, and galaxies everywhere a lot of the time.</br></br>  <br>Nothing. It would be like tiny useless micro brains each an atom thick that could only communicate effectively to its own level of atoms but our neurons are many many many atoms thick. Even if it was at an individual neuron level it would only be between neurons on that same level and all neurons aren't connected to each other so you maybe get some groups of 3 neurons talking on a single level and thats it. You'd be a vegetable witnessing the greatest sight you'll never remember.</br>  <br>Fuck you. I'm doing damn good for an english as a 3rd language and drunk.</br>  <br><br>To the first bit, pretty sure its Dead Space 2<br><br>To the second bit, I have no clue what you just said.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Deadspace 2.</br>  <br>Big Rip means acceleration goes infinite at a finite time in the future. That requires dark energy to be something other than the cosmological constant, called phantom energy.

By how you live not by a stupid and annoying quip at Taco Bell. That's not preaching. The gospel is not meant to be soap boxed at all just revealed to others through the contrast of your actions in the midst of life versus the normal responses of the masses. I think that's what the Bible means by go and preach to all the world. The problem is ..nobody does that. A lot of Christians are assholes; exactly the opposite of what they should be doing. They live perfectly clean lives but look down on others. I just can't deal with that at all anymore.

Lets say a star that is just RIGHT on the edge of collapse, but still maintains itself. Would dilation of time on its surface be the same as the dilation experienced at its core? <br><br>And if it is, would that affect our calculations for the life spans of stars? Or would it be negligible at best?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Just do a 360 and walk away /b/ro</br>  <br>Wrong, faggot!<br>There are around 100,000 elephants, and the average elephant length is 6 m, which means there are only 600 km of elephants. If you laid them end to end according to your diagram, around 20% of them (the portion nearest to the surface of the earth) will survive; the rest won't even reach orbit, let alone anywhere close to the moon. Faggot.</br></br>  <br><br>but due to the weight of the top elephants, the bottom of the elephant tower would die, thus causing the it to crumble, leading to the deaths of the upper elephant tiers. <br><br>Take that, polydextrotheists.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Would dilation of time on its surface be the same as the dilation experienced at its core? <br>No, greater effect at core due to mass pull.<br><br> Or would it be negligible at best? <br>Negligible but depends on the radius of object.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But what if they fucking fall?</br>  <br>The original configuration has the elephants in a line. To keep them in line while the earth is rotating, not succumbing to the Coriolis effect, already presupposes that you're using anti-gravity. And, of course, that would keep them from getting crushed.<br>QED</br></br>  <br><br>How about I presuppose my boot up your ass! You and your damned magic anti-gravity elephants.<br><br>QUID QUO PRO!</br></br></br></br>  <br>Mind blower: atoms have enough mass to effect space time let alone shit like earth, jupiter, the sun, or black holes. Yes the time dilation is different. The close to center of mass the more dilation then the outer edge of space dilation caused by the mass itself. Surface time on earth is more dilated than in the orbit so 2 brothers born 3 mins 34 seconds apart are now 3 mins and 42 seconds apart after one did a 6 month stint on the ISS.</br>  <br> boot up your ass <br>Careful, I might like it.</br></br>  betalgeus is the largest known star  <br>What if we throw them to relative velocity?</br>  <br>Not any more.</br>  <br> to effect <br>Nigga, I suggest learning English first and gravitational physics later.</br></br>  <br>See<br/></br>    <br>It's because more people come to /b/.</br>    <br>Proof?</br>    <br>Is that proof?

Its digital and so are we. Having a natural speed limt for anything (speed of light) makes no sense. Someone had to set the parameters. Youre nothing but a simulation by a computer that is powerful enough to simulate every single brain in the universe the creation of galaxies and everything else that exists. All of this has been programmed by a dude far in the future. God created man in his own image. This programmer dude is human and he created us to be humans just like him. He can do anything he wants to us. He is therefore our god. Does that make you sad or angry?it shouldnt. It only shows that we as humans have developed into something else in the future and that is to be gods. You dont believe this theory? One day we will have computers powerful enough to simulate worlds or universes and at that point it is proven to be possible. If it is possible, there is a big chance that we are already in a simulation because we can no longer say it cant be.  <br>And the pixelation too.</br>  <br>that would mean in the future there are computers capable of simulating brains that invent computers simulating brains that invent computers simulating brains that invent computers simulating brains that invent computers simulating brains that invent computers simulating brains that invent computers simulating brains that invent computers simulating brains that invent computers simulating brains that invent computers simulating brains that invent computers simulating brains that invent computers simulating brains that invent computers simulating brains that invent computers simulating brains that invent computers simulating brains that invent computers simulating brains that invent computers simulating brains that invent computers simulating brains that invent computers simulating brains that invent computers simulating brains that invent computers simulating brains that invent computers simulating brains that invent computers simulating brains that invent computers simulating brains that invent computers simulating brains that invent computers simulating brains that invent computers simulating brains that invent computers simulating brains that invent computers simulating brains that invent computers simulating brains that invent computers simulating brains that invent computers simulating brains that invent computers simulating brains that invent computers simulating brains that invent computers simulating brains that invent computers simulating brains that invent computers simulating brains that invent computers simulating brains that invent computers simulating brains that invent computers simulating brains that invent computers simulating brains that invent computers simulating brains that invent computers simulating brains that invent computers simulating brains that invent computers simulating brains that invent computers simulating brains that invent computers simulating brains etc. etc. etc.</br>  <br>wat</br>  <br><br>and what i meant with this was that it's an infinite loop and therefore it would not compile faggot</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>DESU DESU</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Exactly.
