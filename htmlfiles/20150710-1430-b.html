Probably asking about that place just to be nice.<br><br>I'd move on.</br></br></br>  <br>It means "no". You're not getting laid. She's not interested, but she doesn't want to hurt your feelings.</br>  Can you fucking read you autistic fuck?  <br><br> what does this mean <br><br>she laid it out crystal fucking clear man, I wish more women were like this</br></br></br></br>  <br>Satan speaks the truth</br>  She hungry  Friendzone buddy  <br>it means you need to remind her that just because you wanted to spend time with her doesn't mean you're obsessing over making her your girlfriend. Tell her you thought you were friends and her message is really weird.<br><br>Real men don't fear being friends, if she's worth getting involved with it'll happen.<br><br>Pretty dramatic and high maintenance on her part in my opinion.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't fucking talk about your plans with her damnit rookie mistake</br>  <br>You've been friendzoned</br>  <br>It means you get to go to dinner with a qt and not pay for her. Again, just to reiterate, DON'T PAY FOR HER.<br><br>You should definitely go, ask her if she has any single friends and shit. Bitches hate when they don't have the upper hand in a friend zone relationship, so just let her know you're just her friend and you'll still be on the prowl for dat pussy.</br></br></br>  <br>This op, turn it on her and she'll doubt herself a little bit and that is your window</br>  <br>waste of time. Just leave her be. dont text back. sure, be nice and say hi when you see her but dammit dont waste you fucking time. You only have 50 more years or so to live. make em count</br>  <br>Reply: My god1 I just wanted to know if you wanted to grab dinner and drinks - it wasn't a marriage proposal. But cool - we're friends. Later, buddy.</br>  <br>this</br>  <br> she's worth getting involved with it'll happen. <br>she is. she is a level-headed person, not a mom and has a job. thats all i care about.<br>I guess i will stay in touch but will keep it low. <br><br><br>saying i wanna hang out is so lame and college-y<br><br>won't be paying for her if there is a next time.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Tell her that you only wanted to be fwb  As has been said before. Message her back that she has the wrong impression and you're insulted she misconstrued your friendship for anything more than it is. Just friends. Flip the fucking script. Either she thinks she's too good for you or you ugly. Either way, flip the script, go out with her, DON'T PAY FOR HER. Remember, you're friends. She is your equal. And ask about her friends. Let the bitch know you have the balls in this friendship.  <br>I love you /b/</br>  If you dont act like a man now, you are going to be in the friendzone... so tell her that you give a fuck and shit like this, fuck her  <br>That wasn't let's hang out that was here it's what we're going to do these are the plans. Always works better if you don't let that information out</br>  you know what to do  <br>i dont think i m going to burn the bridge. I am in late 20s. the crop is thin out there.<br><br><br>it was not any friendship to begin with. i was clear about my intentions from the beginning.</br></br></br></br>  That she wont have sex with you. Trust me, Im female (yes I know Im a know and tits or gtfo yadda yadda)  <br>"Being single is fun - Good luck with that.<br>I'm not interested in you as a friend though, so looks like there is no point in us continuing to communicate."</br></br>  <br>Will you also let him know that could change in an instant if he makes an impression?</br>  <br>She is Not Interested in you....BUT she would still like you to pay for drinks and foos when she is board.</br>  <br>yeah no it aint. Fuck man. Late 20s is your prime. You can have any woman you want. Just be yourself and be nice and any woman will want you.</br>  <br>SHE'S CRAZY! RUN AWAY AND LIVE TO FUCK ANOTHER DAY!</br>  <br>this</br>  <br>You act like being friends with a girl is terrible. For all you know she could just be really focused on her career/grades/whatever and not want to date at the moment. Women are weird creatures who do that shit all the time.<br><br>As long as OP doesn't become a groveling beta-fag there's nothing wrong with going to dinner or having drinks with a "friend".</br></br></br>  S/fur<br>Stay a while, and listen.</br>  thank you guy!      <br>No Mister Cain, anything but that!</br>  I'll stay and listen          <br>2001 much?<br><br>I wouldn't suggest getting too close.<br>It seems I'm more of a nomad.</br></br></br></br>            <br>Nah man its fine!</br>      So this where all the neckbeards hang out!        <br>Nah, that would be the loli thread</br>    <br>I don't wish to bum you out.<br>This trait has been passed down for a good 4 generations.</br></br>  <br>welcome to your home</br>  ayyyyyy guys    <br>Bruh we are like friends now come on<br><br><br>Ayy lemayo</br></br></br></br>  <br>You can't see the neckbeard when we're in our suits</br>          Good evening fellow travelers    <br>Back to getting to know each other...<br>What do you wish to know?<br><br>Kek</br></br></br></br>            <br>Soup welcome to bread<br><br><br>Music?</br></br></br></br>        <br>I listen to stuff from the 80s, a few instrumentals, and very little modern.<br>Ever heard the term "The good ol' days"?</br></br>    <br> Music? <br>makes the people<br>come together</br></br></br>              <br>Hello<br>How are you today?</br></br>      <br>Yeah multiple times lol<br><br><br>So what kind of music do you like anon<br><br><br>Im all good, you?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>              <br>I practice what I preach.<br>So I like Madonna, for instance.</br></br>      <br>Damn thats some good music</br>  <br>Things are good, plus there's bread with no shitposting so far. :)</br>                <br><br><br> been clicking the wrong damn links so much for some dumb reason lately, haha </br></br></br>      <br>What kind of links are we talking about here?</br>                  <br>Arguably.

I'm in Pittsburgh currently, and wondering if I should check out the convention. Thing is, I'm not much of a part of the community, and I don't know if I'd really fit in. Any thoughts?          <br>Hello, Neo.</br>  <br>Go for it, what could go wrong. i wish i could be there and see whats its like</br>    <br>Just go? It's not like the furries will ostracize you for not being furry enough.<br>And if they smell you can leave.</br></br>    Hey all      <br>Evening.</br>  <br>Everyone fits in. Unless you dont want to.</br>        <br>Perfect description of these threads.</br>  <br>Hello</br>              ayy lmao    <br>Ayy lemayo, i need some scales to fill up a folder</br>    <br>This. I'm a recent join to the fur community and gotta say these are some of the nicest people around. Some may be a little...off but for the most part good peoples</br>        <br>"fill up"</br>        <br>Seconded. <br><br>Ruski checking in from mobile. <br><br>Hi everyone!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fur on human...I dknt see this often...</br>  <br>The ones that are "Off" Are often the ones that gets steretyped by the outsiders<br><br><br>you know it ;3<br><br><br>What are you doing on mobile ruski</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i dont have much of it</br>  <br>Yes<br><br>Not one to point fingers, but a certain name was gone all of a sudden like Clark Kent's absence for every Superman appearance. Feels obvious who it might have been.<br>I have this cousin who gets belligerently drunk and will call my mom or my sister up to have yet another vaguely abusive conversation with them. But they can see here on the ID so she tries to hide it with that 'star-something-something' trick that hides your number so it says 'Anonymous' on the ID. Yet this is the only time they ever see anonymous on the ID so it's pretty easy to tell most of the time it's still my cousin, like we can't tell it's her.<br><br>Like I said, not one to point fingers but I won't be surprised if I find out it was him.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Hello, Ruski.<br>What are you doing on mobile?<br>Is this about that store trip?</br></br></br>        <br>Something warped your perception of furries.<br>Probably moderate furries.<br><br>It's like politics.<br>You have moderates, left and right wing.<br>And you have extremists.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> newfag <br> thinking oldfags are nice people just because... <br>naive level incomprehensible.</br></br></br>          <br><br>Thanks for the replies folks. I guess I'll keep considering it. It's not like I have anything planned for this weekend anyhow.</br></br>      <br>At what point are you considered an extremist?<br>I'm a far right winger, but I'm not sure if I'm moderate or an extremist.</br></br>          <br>A friend once said in defense of his religion "the biggest idiots are often the loudest"<br>and I gotta say he's right</br></br>      <br>Opps kek</br>  <br>Who?</br>              <br>Explains why my kind is called the minority.</br>      <br>Yepp<br><br><br>It was cockwizard.<br><br><br>Do it</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>        <br>I believe the shitposting may have been cockwizard, but I am imagining that this is the consensus for the s/ threads at this point.</br>  Well, I've been tabbed out for a while listening to more of the pseudo stuff.<br>I think I'm done with that for now.<br>Any ideas on what to do next?</br></br>  <br>Most people seem to agree on that. Hard to credit though, they have very different posting personalities. <br>Cw is always an ass and shitposter is thoughtful and well spoken.</br></br>  <br>It's not important where I draw the line, and the actual problem is a lot more complex, I think.<br>Some furries are genuinely mentally disturbed, not just a little strange.<br>I guess objetively it's the severerity of the disturbance to their daily life that makes one a furry extremists.<br><br>Still, too crude. Furry lifestylers aren't necessarily bad.<br>It's actually pretty hard to pin-point exactly what makes for the worst furries.<br>It might be very general factors, like being stupid and autistic.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was talking politics, but ok.</br>  <br>Ah, I expected you were talking about him.</br>  TAIL HERE<br>FRESH OUT OF THE BAN<br>it's good to see you guys. But I still can't see your names since I'm on mobile</br></br>  <br>get mobile NS</br>  <br>I'm almost sleeping right now. Maybe tomorrow.</br>  <br>get on your computer niggah</br>  <br>Can't do it right now</br>  Hey em, if you're around here, dodge this<br>*looses arrow*</br>  <br>*Dodges*<br>Aha got you this time tail</br></br>  <br>Go for the knees, Boo.</br>  <br>I don't feel particularly sure myself, I am merely guessing. But I wonder if it was just a change-up of how he typed out his posts just to seem like different person's words. Still nothing to confirm this of course.</br>  <br>Chlorine gas again?</br>  <br>Finally. You've been training while I was out?</br>  People always post pin-ups or stills. They're so damn boring.  <br>oh fuck i remember that lol<br><br><br>Yeah ive gotten better</br></br></br></br>  <br>So... can I go all out?<br>*readies arrow*</br></br>  <br>Yes, but it makes the least amount of people mad, as you being the first to complain shows.<br>Had there been dicks everywhere I wouldn't even be reading this thread.</br></br>  <br><br>Sorry about that. Was out with the doges. <br><br>Now I am back. :&gt;</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh i dont know about that</br>  <br>Sleep thight pupper</br>  Hey stoners I just paid 250 dollars for this I have added a 25 cent piece for size comparison. Did I get a good deal?  <br>Heres a close up</br>  <br>Looks like a bag a leaves OP go get your money back</br>  Hard to judge based on looks. What is the weight? Or can you spend 250 on weed and not 10 on a scale?  <br>Nah that's like an ounce of lower quality outdoor. Not seeded but nothing special.<br><br>Up where I am I could get higher quality outdoor than that for $140 an ounce.</br></br></br>  <br>Actually, bad deal, most of the weight seems to be leaves.</br>  <br>By $250 you mean that's the amount of money you spend on the grow set-up, right? That is definitely someone's first ever attempt at growing and harversting</br>  Quality over quantity any day  <br>Supposed to be 2.5 ounces</br>  <br>I mean, the bud portion looks pretty decent for some OK outdoor. Too many leaves though man.</br>  <br>im not even saying this to be a dick but that is the worst looking weed i have ever seen. <br><br>but i live in california.<br><br>you got ripped the fuck off, go get ur money back</br></br></br></br></br>  This looks like mids at best.  <br>In that case, good on you m8. Can't beat that price, even if there are some schwaggy leaves in there. Grats.</br>  You shouldn't even be smoking outdoor anymore it's not the 80's anymore. Only hydroponic or indoor or LED.  <br>I mean, if it is actually 2.5 ounces that's not bad really. I don't think it is though. Get a fuckin scale.</br>  <br>Back when I smoked I preferred outdoor. There are a few cannibinoids that can only be found in plants that are grown in real sunlight.</br>  <br>Bought it off old hippies that grow it in Cali I know the trim is not perfect but there isn't much leaf material in it. Tastes better then shit I get at dispensaries</br>  <br>That's some pretty shitty schwag there OP. Why on gods green earth would you pay $250 for that? Are you some kinda moron?</br>  <br>I guess you're alright but it's schwag so you gone need a couple thousand bowls to get you up.</br>  <br>Probably why it tastes so good</br>  Doesn't look very good but I'm not the one smoking it so I don't know.  <br>It's better then shit you smoke faggot</br>  honestly normally iam not one of those stoner fags with the strains here and there . but dude . ur weed really looks like shit sorry . if u have the chance id return it for another strain  <br>2 only</br>    <br>Just remember that it's going to start drying up if you keep opening the bag bruh. Take a gram or two out and place it away from the stash.</br>  <br>Seems better then dispensaries</br>  <br>ust grab a tuppaware box or similar and stash the stuff in it and just keep a few g out like that guy mentioned</br>  <br>Got you covered</br>  <br> hey /b/ i just pulled a bunch of lawn grass and put it in ziplock bags to make a thread. </br>  <br>It ain't about the size, its about the amount in weight relative to grams. I would say that would be a ounce for that price</br>  <br>looks like some mids to me<br><br>it's looking a little brown, and whoever trimmed it half assed it, but I'm sure it's gonna smoke regardless so I wouldn't even stress</br></br></br>  <br>*wink*</br>  <br>well in that case i hope u gonna get high as kite .</br>  yo nig that some leafy crap....faggot...  I'd say it's a good deal, but the quality doesn't seem to be very good  <br>lmao thatd be some fire in teh 80s</br>  <br>kek<br>That fucking sucks</br></br>  <br>Yeah outdoor always seemed to have a deeper and more complex taste to it.</br>  <br>do you know what strain this is?<br>pic my setup tonight</br></br>  It was just grown fucked up, shitty strain way too leafy  <br>If you like to smoke large quantities of less quality weed...<br><br>I've gotten that much for $100 from a guy in San Francisco.</br></br></br>  <br>will post a bit of stoner tracks &amp; comics.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=x3o<wbr>ZBiG2VxU</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  Terribly trimmed you should've bought from someone else  <br>https://soundcloud.com/thekoa/karin<wbr>-park-shine-koa-remixfree-dl</wbr></br>  Gonna piggyback off of OPs thread since we have come to the obvious conclusion that his weed is shit. <br><br>Any of you guys use dugouts? Got this one for 9 bucks or something off Amazon and seems pretty alright so far. Figure I'll throw mids, shake or whatever other scraps I have in there so I can get a nice tingle on the go.</br></br>  If you smoke you will get cancer, doesn't matter anyway you're already dead to me.  <br>i recently started to use acti-tube filters for smoking. should be way less bad.</br>  Can somebody hook up a /b/rother with some edibles in Katy TX tonight I'm desperate and got 60 bucks and my dealers out of town  looks dank but less trimmed did you sample? It woul smoke harsher but still be dank. Idk if its fire though. If its better than mids its a deal  Don't know about the quality, but if it's low it can still make real good eats... if you do a good extraction I did that last year from an acquaintance's stems and leaves (he had to harvest early) and was high for about a day and was seeing geometric shapes of brilliant light pulsing to my heartbeat, memories playing before my eyes, and hearing music in the sounds of construction machinery. <br>OP, go get high as fuck and tell us the change in quality/ change in weed quantity! A visual assessment is hardly any good for you unless you are selling it or giving it as a gift to a weed snob (or really want to talk to people).</br>  <br>Shit weed probs outdoor from street seeds with 1-4% thc max and amount is like right but when you take out seeds and sticks you get ripped off all in all</br>    <br><br>You've obviously never seen weed before then.<br><br>Exit, queero.</br></br></br></br>  <br>gaiz plz</br>  <br>lol i wouldnt smoke that if you gave it to me for free.<br><br>and im not even trolling.</br></br></br>  who ever trimmed you buds suck .. dont look like any thing i would wana smoke  <br>Which country OP? Cuz if you're from murica or Netherland you should've gotten way more.<br><br>But your shit looks like some mexican dirt weed so you pretty much got ripped of anyways</br></br></br>  <br>moshi moshu</br>  <br>It looks uncured. does it feel moist?</br>  <br>250$, mate your weed look strange/10<br>grow some in your house, you will have 300gram every 3 month really easy.</br></br>  <br>who ever made this pic is a genious.</br>  <br>Son, your Mother and I are very disappoint. Pot is for us old folk. Now, go get your money back and exchange for cocaine/heroin.</br>  <br>lots of leaves - ripped</br>  <br>I'm really a fan of dugouts. It's just such a low-key way to bring weed places. They're no good for smoking with pals though.</br>  <br>Also, see if you can get out of the house tonight. Jim and Sally are stopping by for Ganja Jenga night and your an embarrassing little faggot</br>  <br>Oh, maybe pick up some chips when your out.. And some dip</br>  <br>Thats Oregano dumbass (a common kitchen spice), I hope you didn't smoke any of that.</br>  <br>Nevermind about the chips. Jai'MoiyNeshixa just got here and is whipping up some of her famous jumbalaya</br>  Thank fucking Jeebus I live in British Columbia.<br>Don't know where you live OP but if you like weed you should really emigrate.</br>  Can't post pics, but my latest ounce smells metallic and tastes and smells a little like freshly cut carrots.<br><br>Anyone know what might be going on? They are big green nugs with red hairs and plenty of trichs. <br><br>Super stoney, just tastes and smells weird. One nug was brighter green than the rest and it made me gag, so I dumped my grinder into the toilet. The rest are not as foul as that one. <br><br>Halp?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Have you seen your mother by the way, Jimmy told me a zinger earlier I.. Hey, where is Jimmy..

Not a problem if you're north or Wales.<br>To be honest, I have something similar. I flinch whenever people touch me and get nervous. Probably why I've never had a girlfriend. I suppose you're jealous that people can depend on each other yet you feel like you have to do things alone, hence the mistrust.</br></br>  <br><br>no shit, sherlock</br></br>  YLYL thread          <br>How is that garbage funny again?</br>  You all just lost XD    <br>this isn't a cringe thread.<br>get out with that jimmy rustling bullshit</br></br>  <br> ▲ <br> ▲▲ <br> ▲<br>▲▲<br>Get out</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Comedy gold.</br></br>    <br>You dont know le funny rage comics!?
