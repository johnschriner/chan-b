Because you touch yourself at night  <br>Nah right after waking up, helps the morning wood go timber</br>  <br> tfw we are the boogeymonster that lives under ever tumblrbrat's bed. </br>  <br>they are terrified i dont think boogeymonster describes their fear for us</br>  <br>IDK but it feels good to win without actually doing anything at all.</br>  <br>Because if we raid them there is a noticeable difference in their "world<br>If they raid us its just business as usual. 50 shitposts for every one decent thread.</br></br>  But because of that raid, 4chan and Tumblr have this weird angry-love thing going on.  <br>we should scare them a little bit more</br>  <br> warfare <br>I bet they think they were hit harder then Hiroshima with the raids. These tubblr faggots overplay everything and it's fucking hilarious.</br></br>  <br>Like an unhappily married couple.</br>    I love how we are winning by doing absolutely nothing.   629331077 <br>I laughed</br>  We must keep them constantly in fear.  So they aren't even checking their Tumblr for a while day?  <br>If you click on a post number you can properly link it, newfag.</br>  <br>*We must keep everyone constantly in fear.</br>  <br>Especially FAUX News</br>  these tumblr fags used greentext in the comment section of a "best of tumblr" page (I just saw this on a liked photo). when they bring 4chan to social media it's shit like that why we shit on them.  fags need another raid  <br>Also don't save the thumbnails open the image first</br>  <br>really they do</br>  oh no we are raiding their safe house blogs who will stop us.  <br><br> muhmaymayarrows </br></br>  <br>The Internet Police Department?</br>  <br>it's pronounced mee mee</br>  <br>Do I please you now</br>  We should raid those fags tomorrow and then take down the site  <br>Pff, dumbass, it's the Cyber Police.</br>  <br>not according to my nigger on jewbook you dumb fuck. </br>  <br>Barely. A blowjob would help considerably.<br>(Hope you like cottage cheese, I'm uncut)</br></br>  <br>we too hardcore for the police<br><br><br>that sounds like a good idea or just spread the rumor that we changed plans because they found out and have them fear again</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, I mean the real IPD. They even have vans that can't explode.</br>  <br>  don't post selfies because 4chan can edit them <br>kek, they learned from last time.</br></br>  <br>this.<br><br>keep them in suspense</br></br></br>  <br>Keep them on edge forever until they eventually stop using the site altogether out of fear and autistic depression. Then we take reddit.</br>  <br>Don't even go there, newfag, The Cyber Police have more than just vans that don't even explode, they have total control of the interwebz and 4chinz can get shutdown immediately out of no where. So before you shitpost about a made-up "internet police", you need to think about the real cyber police who lay their lives on the (on)line, faggot.</br>  <br>could you explain to me how you would take down said site and i dont want to hear your DDoS shit. You have no knowledge of network security, web servers or for that matter what the fuck a DDoS entails even in beyond "flooding with packets bro" if that. I hate niggers like you who much off someone ones hard work. Don't pretend to be something your not just beacuse you watched a few youtube videos and hang out on the "darknet", you fucking CSI:cyber mother motherfucker</br>  ITS BECAUSE THEY ARE PIECES OF AUTISTIC SHIT WHO CANT FUCKING STOP AND THEY KNOW WE HATE THEM FOR IT  <br> you need to think about the real cyber police who lay their lives on the (on)line <br>Stand up members of the community. An heroes to us all.</br></br>  we can raid them random date and then place the blame to another tumblr user.  <br>RIP in pieces</br>    Well, /b/ is officially fucked...  <br><br>if your serious about that contact these guys they are people whom are dedicated to ruining and fucking over people on the internet</br></br>  <br><br>they are already in fear from everyone who called them out of their shitty behaviors.</br></br>  <br>Either you're new or your stupid.</br>  <br>aint nothin bad bout , since its the usual shit here</br>  <br>you're both summerfags</br>  <br>forgot to put link<br>raidforums.com</br></br>  <br>There's always gay porn.....</br>   <br><br>until they stop eating and become/b/rophobics</br></br>   629335498 <br>You dumbfuck, thats a shitty website for shitty twitch raids.</br>  <br> my sides </br>  This thread will be monitored for the duration.  <br>Kek</br>  <br>I'm really more of an early-autumnfag.</br>  <br> create 4chan accounts <br>My sides</br></br>    <br><br>filename... <br>and no timestamp</br></br></br>  Still don't understand how the psychical site hasn't been knocked offline, I'm pretty sure there are plenty of people on 4chan more than capable of taking the site down for more than a month  <br><br>It was probably a bait, fucking summerfag</br></br>  Let's just raid them again FFS.

We all loved how they took stance on the evil Anonymous. Maybe they could expose Tumblr as a nest of evil criminals sharing tips on how to steal from honest, God fearing, hard-working Americans?</br>  <br>This</br>  So......why don't we raid them?<br><br> Make a chat <br><br> Invite <br><br> Let shit take its course <br><br>We now haven't had a successful raid of non - Twitch shit for a year. That's pathetic.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>kekked everywhere</br>  <br>people already had reported them.</br>  <br>Ahh, I love watching the summer go by.</br>  Damn they even have a blog to keep up to date on how we will raid them. No wonder most sites hate them  <br>blew air out of my nose harder than usual</br>  <br>We should raid them the day after they expect, that way all their guards are down and we have max impact.</br>  <br>This</br>  <br>Funniest shit is all it takes is one fucker to scream the sky is falling and theyre all running for their safe spaces</br>  <br>Means they are organized, Thats smart.</br>  <br>keep change the raid date.</br>  <br> So why are tumfags scared so much of us raiding them? <br><br>they aren't.<br><br>they welcome it.<br><br>it let's them cry about being harassed and victimized, so they get sympathy from their peers.<br><br>the same reason feminists set themselves up to be harassed on social media. <br><br>the negative attention feeds their addiction.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>makes you more tired throughout the day though</br>  <br>Cloudy with a 60% chance of a shitstorm.</br>  <br>Mr. Freud, aren't you supposed to be dead?</br>  <br>This. Some set up us the raid.</br>  <br> "Someone" should do it  <br>Exactly my thoughts</br></br>  i once met someone on tumblr who identified as pluto  it has occurred to me that we dont even need to raid them. we just need to say that we are, then every little thing that happens will be blamed on us. theyll tear eachother apart thinking that they are 4chan members and we dont even have to do anything  <br>if they have an entire blog dedicated to possible attacks, that means somebody is leaking all mentions of raid. We must hang the nigger that is warning the tumblrina before he spills on this possible raid</br>  Instead of a raid just make them think there is always a raid "comein"    because theyre all attention whores and drama excites them.  <br>FUCK. I just deleted that screencap of the persons tumblr you're talking about. Anybody have it?</br>  <br> i once met someone on tumblr who identified as pluto <br>Joke's on them. Pluto isn't even a planet anymore.</br></br>  <br>eh. we only managed a couple of hours in 2010 and most of that was tricking them into ddosing themselves<br><br> stole our may mays war <br> the year 4chumblr was made </br></br></br></br>  <br>i like the "#Kid safe" personally.</br>  <br>Has to be made<br><br>Kek'd</br></br></br>  <br>Opposite honestly.

You?</br>  <br>ayy</br>  <br><br><br>I shit you not , these are three of my favorite bands</br></br></br>  <br> not realizing that undone is the best song on that album </br>  <br>You into The Strokes?</br>  <br>Pinkerton is the most underrated album of all time imo. Such abrasive passionate lyrics and such cringey, yet beautiful lyrics make the album painfully fantastic. I believe this is the album that inspired emo music too, so thats a plus</br>  <br>They had like one song. so kewl tho rite?</br>  <br>You just reminded me that I have some Modest Mouse on my "To jam out to" list. Thanks friend</br>  <br>yea , they're great</br>    <br>shut up faggot the entire album along with Pinkerton is a masterpiece</br>  Red album was pretty good as well guys  <br>I agree with that. I find it interesting that this album flopped and was considered one of the worst albums of the year by Rolling Stone but is now loved by nearly every Weezer fan</br>    <br><br><br>Call me a faggot but I'm into Modest Mouse's more emo existential crisis type music.<br><br>"Parting of the Sensory" is like my fucking life anthem. "Bukowski" is ok too.</br></br></br></br></br>  Butthole Surfers are king  top fucking kek    <br>Nah, Pinkerton is god tier.

I was a Bully. And probably the only one on 4 chan  <br>kek</br>  i had a reputation so horrible that it attracted a small band of outcasts and surprisingly this made me popular  <br><br>Not for the first three years. I was an annoying motherfucker. But after that? I was on the comedysportz team so I did a lot of improv comedy on stage. People thought I was pretty cool when I was doing that shit.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Youd be surprised. I used to be very popular. Sadly my social anxiety kicked in during UNI and it went all tits up.</br></br></br></br>    <br>I met my closest friend thanks to 4chan.<br>Cool guy.<br>We would always hang out after school and stuff.<br><br>He was my hand<br><br> Best Friends </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>where did you go to high school, was it in Houston?</br>  i was real popular with the Dean of students  <br>I was.<br>There were only about 9 black kids in my high school, and I so happened to be one of them.<br>They called me Token, because I was the "Token black guy".</br></br></br>  Who the fuck are you?   <br><br>Nah man, california. They got Comedysportz over there though, huh?</br></br>  <br>I had a baby face (still do) and was late to hit puberty. I wasn't very popular and only had a small group of friends from another school.</br>  yea actually, i played guitar in several garage bands with my friends. we all sucked but always played everything really loud. back in high school, chicks were dumb enough to find guys playing rock music to be super hot.  <br>While I hung out with mostly nerds, I honestly never really stood out in any way. I was basically just "another guy" who nobody payed much attention to. I was nothing special, but I wasn't a nobody, either. Kind of in that nice middle.<br><br>Didn't change the fact that I couldn't care less about the majority of people at my high school, especially in my junior and senior years.</br></br></br>  I had a reputation as a "alcoholic anon", a budding Steve-O you could say. So I do my thing, fuck up and now I can't be a soldier. Dreams are made to be broken am I right /b/?  I was a nerd, and overlooked by others.<br><br>The further away I get from high school, the better.<br><br>The best thing about getting older, as a man, is watching women reap what they sowed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah dude we had something like 14 teams in the city, it was fun. I did it all four years. good times.</br>  <br>ayy lmao</br>  <br><br>Of course. I was the most alpha of alpha's. I mentored every member of every sports team in how to play that sport. At prom I railed every single attractive date in a big line that they gave as "tribute" to me. I also had a 4.2 GPA, graduated valedictorian of the entire nation, and went on to become an astonishingly handsome and wildly successful billionaire.<br><br>I have no reason to lie about this.</br></br></br></br>  Always had drugs so yeah.  Oh, yeah. I was the QB, the prom king (twice), and won "Most Popular", "Most Likely To Succeed", and "Best Smile" in both the junior and senior yearbooks. Got a football scholarship, got signed, and, now, I'm making $2.3 million a year.<br><br>I just browse /b/ in between all the training and parties and stuff.</br></br>  <br>Nope. I was the one to sit in the library rather then go to lunch</br>  <br>Nah, I was terrified of most people but you would never know it. Anxiety I guess. Ate lunch in the stall every day for 4 years.</br>  yep. captain of football, party boy and top 10% academically. good college career too but here I am on /b/ drunk at 11 on a monday. cheers fuckers  <br>In a way, yes. I wouldn't say everyone knew me, and I definitely wasn't one of those popular jocks, but I knew people.</br>  <br>No<br><br> ITT: people will try to convince you they were popular in hs </br></br></br>  <br> I'm going to lie on /b/ </br>  Popular to the point of being very uncomfortable with it in junior high. Switched schools and flew under the radar in high school. Still friends with 'cool kids' but maintained my privacy.  <br>yep</br>  <br><br>It was good times. Tried out for the college team and didn't make it so I ended up an improv team at my community college. Few of us are with Groundlings now, so I'm pretty proud of what we all did.</br></br>  Surprisingly yes.<br><br>Got asked out a shit ton, had some experiences, had a shit ton of cool friends, and I don't think anyone even disliked me. If only college could be the same.</br></br>  I was, I was a huge jerk but that attracted popularity. I sat at the table with all the attractive people, hung out with them, we became a big group of friends. Although I went to a CTA (career and technical academy) so we had no sports so no jocks or cheerleaders, which made it easy to go up the ladder  <br>god no. broken family, malnourished &amp; heinous amounts of munchausen syndrome by proxy. extreme poverty, bad locality. thankyou to those who helped me as being a creature less fortunate than they. was cool in my own world though, seperate from the rest</br>  Yeah. Wasnt a jock, wasnt really bad. Kept to small group of friends mostly but i was cool with everybody. I enjoyed the fact that even though i wasnt the most popular guy, i dated alot of the popular girls. Nobody tried to bully me or fuck with me and i didnt do that shit to other people. The really hood/ghetto/gangsta dudes were cool with me and so were the nerds. My high school experience was great. And college was even better!  Went to 3 different high schools- was on the football team and extremely popular in the first one, cut too much class and did alot of dumb shit, got into trouble and left after 2 years. 2nd one I mostly kept to myself and focused more on school trying to catch up on work but still cut class and hung out with friends. Started slipping into old habits so I left again. 3rd school I kicked into serious mode and worked my ass off, knew everybody but never cut class and stayed in school all day. Graduated on time with honors and scholarships.  <br>was bullied from age 10-12, then beat up my bully pretty badly. Then went to highschool where i was once again bullied, yet semi popular. Then got a pretty hot gf when i was 15, then cruised through highschool pretty much. Now im in a frat so no one really fucks with me anymore</br>  <br>I'm in a small town for college (bout halfway between San Antonio and Austin) so we don't have any kind of improv stuff but I'm planning on moving to Chicago after I graduate so I hope to get back in the swing of things then</br>  i used to be the typical looser but then i fucked a ugly fat chick. she told everyone i have a giant dick so i became popular. good old times.  <br>I'm completely serious. I'm just on /b/ until my driver gets me to the next club. Then, I'll be fuckin' bitches, all night.</br>  <br>Small penis Jew detected</br>  Everybody knew me but I wasn't necessarily very outgoing. I would often find myself in conversations with a lot of different people. I would get invited to a lot of things from a lot of different groups. I rarely would ever go, but when I did people always enjoyed having me around. <br><br>I don't know if I was like textbook popular but everybody knew me and enjoyed being around me I guess.</br></br>  <br>Downey?</br>  Not popular per se, but I could hold a meaningful conversation with 90% of my class. Definitely gained popularity when I graduated.  <br>But I was that level of crazy when I'd still get invited to all the parties but wouldn't get the girls. No one really wants to fuck the guy that ate cigarettes for a party trick. The guys still fucking loved me. <br><br>Still, fucked six girls by the time I was eighteen and only two were prostitutes. <br><br>So I'd honestly say I had it worse than the rest of you "anxiety" AV club cunts.</br></br></br></br></br>  I think I peaked in middle school. It's all been downhill since then   Be black <br><br>Known by everyone. Not popular, but not hated by anyone (openly, anyway).<br><br>It sucked because I'd have random people coming up to me saying "Hey anon!" and I would know who they are, but never learned their names.<br><br> Was on prom court senior year </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was semi popular in high school. My junior year i played football and knocked the opposing teams quarterback out cold then proceeded to stand over him and point at his unconscious body and say "something is wrong with this guy". Apparently everyone saw me hovering over him and pointing at him and thought i was gloating and calling him a little bitch when i was just saying he was hurt. After that a bunch of people i didn't know knew me and would shout out my name in the hallways. Apparently someone caught it on camera but i never got to see it.</br>  lolnope  <br>I was always in the dead center of popularity. I was able to associate with the whole spectrum of kids from the most uncool to the so called cool kids,</br>  <br>I went to four proms. I was prom king. I only got laid after one of them. Didn't play sports, was a representative for student council. I worked at a restaurant and a mortgage company after school. I was never popular, actually had more friends in the grade below me. Now I keep in touch with maybe three people</br>  <br> I was a Bully. <br> probably the only one on 4 chan </br></br>  <br>Captain of the football team, ex won the superlative for most attractive, strongest kid in the school. Always had an attractive gf. I wasn't particularly popular though, due to my lack of social skills and the fact that changing schools halfway through high school made me sperg out, costing me old friends and making it hard to make new ones.</br>  Yup.  <br>This describes me to a tee.</br>  <br>   ▲ <br> ▲ ▲ <br>Yes actually</br></br></br>  <br><br>They said you drank too much.<br><br>They were wrong. you were just doing liver crossfit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That bitch is honestly ugly. Look at her face! 6/10. And to answer the question, yes I was popular in school.<br><br>Protip popularity doesn't mean shit when you graduate.</br></br></br>  I was hugely popular in high school. Most of the students knew me and I was on a first-name basis with half the staff.<br>Things quickly went downhill since then.</br>  <br> Ausfag here. Years 8 &amp; 9 I was barely a blip on the radar. Years 10, 11 and 12 I was pretty popular after people found out I could outdrink them, and I showed my IT power level. The last part was a huge mistake.</br>  <br>nigger</br>  yes. very.  <br>this fuckin guy, every fucking thread lol</br>  <br>I really really really like this image</br>  nah. i knew a lot of people, but had few friends. saw some wild stuff, got ripped off, ripped off a few people, somehow managed to get laid despite blowing most of my good chances and you know what? i still have no idea what to do with life.  <br>Mah niggah.<br> tfw the girl who friendzoned you is a divorced meth head, with nudes all over the internet now <br> the older guys who ripped on you and fucked her within a month of meeting her are all tied down with kids and minimum wage jobs <br><br>It's bizarre how life works like that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was popular and had tons of dates during junior high and the first two years of highschool, but weed, xanax and opiates took over and i ditched most of my friends for drugs. Also I kept my videogame/4chan/pc game/anime/chess/battlebot obsessions away from my "cool" friends. I started browsing in '07, and I'm 22 now, been sober for a year now lol</br>  <br> that bitch is ugly no way id fuck her <br> shit, I heard she had sex with everyone I don't want a disease <br> why would I talk to her I bet she's stupid and shallow as fuck <br>I bet everyone in school thought u were the crazy kid</br></br></br></br>  <br>Blowing my fucking mind</br>  <br>Congratulations on being sober. It can be tough.</br>  <br>its amazing that i was there for the pic they found it in. anyone got the original?</br>  <br>Nice bro! Making moves, pretty inspirational</br>  <br>thanks man. yeah heroin, xanax and booze are a tough motherfucker</br>  Not really. During my senior year, I was popular as fuck to all of these hot ass sophomores who wanted to fuck me, and a few juniors. But among my own graduating class? Nobody fucking knew me  <br>made it through school on the middle scale.I grew up and was best friends with jocks, i hung out with and gamed with burn outs, and i was a computer nerd who was in a shitty band playing bass... got laid a couple of times....got shot down a couple of times....fell in love and was friendzoned....fell in love again and got the girl..... all in all it was a good time with good memories but nothing out of the ordinary.</br>  1 being no one would notice if i died<br>10 being prom King and fucking at least 5 of the 10 cheerleaders from each grade.<br><br>I was about a 6-7 by junior year id say.</br></br></br>  <br>What is this?</br>  <br>Ayyyy lmao</br>  <br>Is it warm in here? Sure feels like summer in here...</br>  Freshman year: I had a few friends, was mostly focused on my girlfriend<br>Sophomore year: started smoking weed and popping pills. Friends expanded into other drugs users<br>Junior year: Began taking psychedelics. Started being much nicer to people. Amount of friends I had really grew<br>Senior year: was friends was almsot every group of people. Popular yeah. Cool? People just liked me and thought I was nice.</br></br></br>  Actually, yes. My smallish friend group was known as the "Smash Bros." because we set up a projector to play Melee every day before ad after school. Random person ople would even challenge us.
