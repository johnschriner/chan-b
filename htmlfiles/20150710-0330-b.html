[ What's up with Lia's snapchat?  What? Sauce also wahts happening    i just checked her snap. Topkek on that shit.  <br>WOW wtf, hacked obviously, trying to be lizardsquad by the looks</br>    Was her snap name  <br>What is her snap name</br>  <br><br>dappyhays</br></br>  Apparently iCloud hack according to Twitter handle in the pic  <br><br>dappyhays</br></br>    This is exciting. Bumperino.  <br><br>That's someone else</br></br>  <br> tits are blurrier than the rest <br> no timer or text <br> quality too good for snapchat <br> Picture isn't even the right size <br>Try harder next time</br></br></br></br></br>  Lizard fags. Have only teased shit that's probably not even real and posted that fake nude on her snapchat, and some dicks. Idk where OP got that pic tho  <br>He never said that pic was from her snapchat, and it's not anyway.</br>    My life will never be complete until I see a video of Lia with several black men fucking her.  <br> no timer or text <br><br>I have plenty of pictures saved from Snapchat that have no text or timer. <br><br>Not saying this is real, cause it's obviously fake, just saying that if picture doesn't have text or timer, it doesn't mean its not from snapchat</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you think so?</br>  <br>Fuck off cuck.</br>  <br><br><br>Totally her</br></br></br>  Nigger geek hacked her and spread weed picks too early before she takes a real nude picture of herself  <br>stupid greenhorns man</br>  Who is this and why is she being hacked?  <br>everyone want to see her boobs</br>    <br>I don't just want to see her boobs. I want to induce milk production and make her my human cow. Can you imagine how much money people would pay for just 1oz of Lia milk?</br>  <br>kek</br>  I bet she has a weird angled nipple or some other shit. They're also not that big.  <br>still adding people?</br>  Everyone is shaming her for smoking. What do these faggots expect of a teenage girl  Only thing this dumb ass did was post a pic of Lia smoking which everyone already knew she did, and post some fake nude. Now he's probably ruined all the slutty attention whore snapchats Lia would send, which are way better than what he had.  <br>This. If this guy doesn't post any nudes soon, he's just a fucking asshole that ruined the summer for everyone. Imagine all the bikini pics we would get.</br>  <br>This</br>  she is so fucking overrated. Im not saying shes ugly or le pointy knees meme, but good lord shes so fucking average with a weird face.  Honestly why do people ruin things. All you needed to do was to find the email associated with her icloud.    the hacker savaged only wants attention he has hacked Lil b and other famous celebs but gives the acc's back but before he does that he want's recognition from them    <br>You want to believe that sooooo bad</br>  <br>This is all we got /b/ros</br>  Everyone just pray for nudes.  <br><br>Kek, you fags will never have nudes.</br></br>  No cringe thread ?!<br>Lets go!</br>      <br> implying that's cringe </br>      <br>I twitched</br>  <br><br>Damnit that is fucking funny</br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=N8P<wbr>1oGF2nnA</wbr>  [ ]  <br><br> why do grillz friendzone me </br></br>    <br>those shoes are the shoes of a based god who gives no fucks</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Y3p<wbr>mMZDko60</wbr>  [ ]<br>this is my jam...</br>  <br>In the context that she is to stupid to understand the significance of that place it is cringe.

After Hurricane Katrina and with Bush's wars, Kanye sought means of making things more difficult for the President.

However, Al Qaeda was not interested in any western investments, and they were also losing the war against US forces.<br><br>Mohammed Al'de Bin, a shadowy business person with links to Syria and America's Muslim communities made contact, and began funneling the donations from several institutions.

Fuck off faggot</br></br>  <br>Hi Anon. I see you called someone a "faggot" I'm assuming you meant this jokingly, but I've been mulling this over in my head for several days and it does not sit right. Let me please (re)iterate you on this word. Not only does it aim hatred at a large group of people that I myself and many of my friends are a part of, the word has the power to tear down and undermine a fight that we have been fighting for decades. I don't know where you stand on the issue, but I'm assuming you value your rights to equality as a citizen of this country. You may think that this is only a word, a mere configuration of letters, but this word is the foundation that keeps LGBT people held in the depths of inequality, while men like yourself toss around hateful slurs in a joking way thinking immaturely that you are immune to hurting anyone. This is not true. Next time you throw this word out (however jokingly and privately you may thing you are using this- in this era NOTHING is ever private), think about those who have struggled for the right to feel safe in their own country. The word "faggot" creates a hostile environment and makes many LGBT people feel unsafe around those who have enough power in society to use such words. Don't make me feel unsafe. I have a right to my safety. And although I have tremendous pride in being a mature, strong, bisexual woman, it really sucks when your words get in the way of my pride.
