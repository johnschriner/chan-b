I'm not a fan of waking up feeling like garbage  <br>fuck outta here</br>  <br>I second this.</br>  <br>i prefer cunt</br>   high <br>Beer is for poor fags with pee-fetish</br>  Rather get high, but since I hold a job that piss tests, I just get drunk.  <br>My nigga<br>Dem dubs</br></br>  beer. wnjoy party, relax, convo,alone,any time is good for a beer,talk about life...anyway..cheers  <br>A serious alcohol habit is way more costly than smoking pot, man.</br>  <br>Trips of truth<br><br>You don't know shit about shit, calling the civilized Niggers, nigger</br></br></br>  high but dry <br><br>sippin' on Cotes du Rhone</br></br>   <br>none, I smoke crystal meth like a fucking man</br>  I have never been either so I do not know  <br> being a pothead <br> civilized </br></br>  I prefer the social drunkenness, when i dont care what i say or do. However i fucking hate hangovers. Weed actually treats hangovers, is much healthier and is fun to do alone.<br>Weed wins coz booze is fucking poison</br>  <br>just fuckof then</br>  <br>Both at the same time. <br><br>Savoring the flavor while being stoned makes me kinda get all the Twilight-like nonsense that wine 'connoisseurs' talk about on their reviews and shit. <br><br>I don't understand why for so many folks those two are somehow a mutually exclusive dichotomy.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This guy is right im an alcohol ive spended 300-400 a month on just myself in beer.</br>  <br>Cause smoking crystal meth doesn't get you high</br>  <br>Nah.<br><br> two bottles strong liquor a day: 30 bucks <br>At multiple points in my life, smoking that away was ezpz, and it was good dutch weed too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh shit shots fired</br>  <br>Ok I'll fuckof now</br>  <br>Neither, but at one time of my life I did enjoy both. I would get drunk on a 6pack or more everyday and then finish off with some bowls of some of that high test.<br><br>I neglected my life during this 5 year period of my life. I became fat and unhealthy, I ruined all my relationships and then I ruined my relationship with the girl I loved to death. <br><br>Drugs helped me neglect life and neglect the things that mattered most.<br><br>I have had a few days since where I drank 6-12 beers but just makes me feel tired and not on point. <br><br>I don't enjoy either anymore</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Drunk any day</br>  <br>sure! go on</br>  rather smoke weed.  Far better than neither  Depends on the situation, but I prefer being high.  <br>diazapam?</br>  <br>vape green, it is the healthiest drug and method</br>  Drunk with people, high when I'm alone. Honestly it just comes down to what I'm feeling like doing.  <br>I too am a alcohol</br>  <br>what is it ?</br>  <br>Shove your mouth fedora up your ass, neckbeard.</br>  No to both. Alcohol is horrible for you on all levels. Weed is ok to do once in a while. But why not just live a sober life and have that occasional party.  <br>Virgin</br>  <br>I whole heatedly prefer the high of weedies over the drunk nonsense I seem inevitably drawn to doing/saying while drinking <br><br>Plus the no hangover thing of weed is a game changer<br>Even though the hangover from alcohol forces you to take a day off, or at least seriously consider it<br><br>Though the only thing that I dislike about weed is how it demotivated me. Plus all the snacks.<br>With booze I could pound down 14 beers, be the man, and still go to work in 5 hours<br><br>Sucks though, newly 21 and can't smoke weed cuz work<br>So booze is my only outlet<br><br>And I'm actually starting to abstain from that as well cuz overweight<br><br>So basically I'm fucked.<br>Is this what growing up feels like?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Drunk all day long</br>  <br>Cuz that is for cucks <br> mostly weed <br> occasional drinks </br></br></br>  <br>Fixed you fucktard hippie</br>  There's nothing better than feeling unvulnerable and do all the idiot shit drunk and the next day being left withthe pain, shame and guilt for last night, also the depression from it with the hangover. What a joy.  <br>Not sure if this nigger is trolling or not.</br>  bit drunk, then a bit high.  <br>getting drunk is something that affects you for much longer, including feeling like shit the next day and often that same day.<br>not many people do things they really regret when they're high, but that happens all the time when drunk.<br>Being drunk is just much more extreme than being high, it's not really a fair comparison.<br><br>Maybe drunk versus taking acid, would be closer to a fair comparison.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you answer beer your a fat shit who makes bad choices.</br>  <br>sober 6 days bro, but in a few minutes im about to fuck up those 6 days fucking nightmares and been angry im trying to just drink on weekends pretty fucking hard, and its just beer, feel like I haven`t slept in a day or two.</br>  <br>both faggot drugs, drunk is okay but there are far better</br>  driver was an alcohol  <br>Get some benzos. They cut the withdrawals down a lot. Just be careful and don't use them for longer than you need to.</br>  <br>I'm not actually a alcohol</br>  <br>well I absolutely LOVE the taste of beer, but there are also different levels of drunk. There are much more levels of being drunk than being high.<br><br>Weed, IMO is the better drug just because you aren't as physically impaired if you smoke too much. Also, no hang over.<br><br>That said, I also LOVE to drink. I don't tend to get drunk off of cheap beer for the sake of getting drunk, but I don't mind splitting a case of craft beer with a friend and maybe finish it off with a glass of whisky or bourbon<br><br><br>As far as mixing them go, if I smoke before I drink I have a wonderful time. If I smoke after I've already drank a good bit I get really sick, pic very related.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Fucking both.<br><br>Get drunk every time you go out and your outings will turn into blackouts so you won't remember nothing.<br><br> Get stoned every time you hang out and you'll sit on your asses all night doing nothing.<br><br>Do both and you'll have fun.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Both so i can communicate to Dr Satan</br>  <br>Only ever been high once and never been drunk. What do?</br>  I'd take a beer over weed anytime  <br>kok</br>  <br>how much beer a day?<br>I drink 8-10 beers every night. i know its too much, but I'm fucking depressed.</br></br>  <br>I had half my body rebuilt after getting blown up then crushed inbtween a vehicle and a wall while in the military.<br><br>I'm full of metal and chronic pain, so I'm <br>on a cocktail of about 20 different pain meds on a regular basis just to function.<br><br>Life is currently a constant high</br></br></br></br></br></br>  both. <br>newfag nigger</br>  <br>Neither. Stay pleb.</br>  <br>Can't tell if sarcastic. If not, beautifully said. <br>If yes, I'm not. I like the feeling of unvulnerability. I do stupid shit. And the pain in the morning shines a strong light in my cockfuckery and everyone elses.<br><br>Weed makes me paranoid and lazy at the same time. The worst of both worlds.</br></br></br></br>   drink poison <br> consume medicine  <br><br><br>such a hard choice.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I too drink 8-10 beers a night but im happy</br>  I don't want to ruin my lungs, but I've been known to torture my liver on occasion.  <br>Get a bottle of vodka and a few friends and take shots</br>  <br>well I may have a neck and a beard but fuck you too guy</br>  cannabis and beer are for faggots<br>anyone tried the real stuff?</br>  <br>ayy lmao</br>  <br>okay ivan</br>  <br>Both. Weed n beer.</br>  <br>this is the oldfag we were looking for</br>  <br>I got Benzos Klonopìn 2 mg used to mix them with beer, when im not drinking I just take 1 pill it feels like the effect wears out in an hour or two.<br>but I did a little breakthrough this month thank God, couldn`t eat before sipping 3 lts of beer before very nasty thing to be addicted to something.</br></br>  <br>stay virgin</br>  weed every day, but I do like a nice craft beer once or twice a week as a treat. one pint really gives you a strong buzz if you generally dont drink much. Always have it early in the day though with plenty of time to wear off before sleep :)  <br>I don't wake up feeling like garbage from smoking weed. Drinking, yes, but weed, no. In fact I usually feel good.</br>  <br><br>Drunk for parties, high when alone or with a friend or 2</br></br>  <br>Both baby!</br>  High all day long. Can't do my job while drunk. Drinking a lot usually makes me feel like shit as well.<br><br>I like to be drunk, its fun and social, but only a couple times a month do I feel like drinking. And when I do I always get the urge to smoke weed anyway.</br></br>  I acctualy enjoy crack 3 times in a week. Trip is hard and yiou know the drug is fucking you. Yeah I'm not into job for now. Have 2 kids and I love my life  <br>Since beer usually tastes bad to first time drinkers (it really is an acquired taste) and wine always tastes like shit- I'd recommend buying some hard stuff (vodka, whiskey, gin) and mixing it with coke or some sweet shit like that until you can hardly taste the alcohol. Then you can chug down half a liter's worth of hard liquor without even knowing it and you'll be fine.<br><br>That's how I started, back in the day. It's what most kids do in the beginning.</br></br></br>  smoke weed everyday  <br>about 7 to 8 lts a day, and one meal.<br>lasted about a month or two like this till I got dehydrated, I don`t even like the flavor of beer anymore I feel my body just needs it.</br></br>  <br>this.<br>mix vodka with juice or red bull or something</br></br>  <br>that sounds like an interesting life im not going to lie</br>  <br>I suppose I am old... probably been drinking beer before you were even born.</br>  <br>wooooow!<br>u must be sooooo grown up for doing HARD drugs!<br>upboated :^)</br></br></br>  <br>Vicodin with Advil? Some opiate. <br><br>Did that for years for real pain issues. <br><br>Opiates or benzos are a dead end road and fuck with your head a lot.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you have a little girl?</br>  <br>I like filling a cup and drinking it all at once then I'm good for the night.</br>  <br>i too eat just one meal a day, sometimes nothing for 2 days, but than a shitton of food, and lots and lots ob beer</br>  <br>2 girls</br>  <br>Ya, but the massive scarring, pain that still seeps through even the heaviest of meds, and the loss of certain range of body motions kind of sucks.</br>  <br>how do you get dehydrated with 8 beers a day?</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>i would prefer to smoke a little high quality weed, but cold beer is nice too, i like a pilsner or lager beer, i dont like ales or malt liquor</br>  <br>Depends.<br><br>Beer is better with a group of friends, weed is better alone or with a couple other people. Weed is also better if I have to work the next day because no hang over.</br></br></br>  <br>High. Drinking makes you stupid and there isn't much euphoria, the side effects are also shitty.</br>  <br>Neither. I'm not 16 anymore.</br>  <br>i like doing that too, but with 8 bottles of beer</br>  <br> Refer to below <br><br/></br></br>  <br><br>that is how alcohol works idiot</br></br>  neither they're both trashy drugs I stay sober or I'll do some h or coke a couple times a year fags  <br> more levels of being drunk than high <br>o boy</br></br>  both &gt; weed &gt; alcohol  <br>ding ding ding right answer</br>  <br>yeah i know that, but there is not that much alcohol in beer, just 6%, i dont think you can get dehydrated on beer</br>  <br>Sure, me too. I was giving tutorial level tips tho. this is normal mode</br>  <br>Drunk.<br><br>I don't feel high from smoking, just stimulated.</br></br></br>  <br>hard drugs are pandoras box - open at own risk</br>  <br>Drinking and smoking under the age of 18 leads to permanent loss of mental capacity.<br><br>Which would explain your post.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Samefag </br></br>  if you do weed then you're a dumb nigger who should hang yourself  <br>Both beer and coffee are almost worthless as a source of water since you piss it right out.</br>  <br>Either works.<br>It's entirely different and only a casul would make a comparison.<br>For instance, you can gradually dose up with alcohol while with weed you pretty much get high and that's it.<br>You can't really get any higher than high.<br>Totally stoned out of your mind maybe but it's hardly different or useful.<br>Also, being slightly high isn't worth jack.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's American beer, try imported booze, much higher alcohol content</br>  <br>This has always confused me since its mostly water, but it definitely happens.</br>  I get drunk and stoned and then smoke meth.  <br>Take cover. Niggers wroth guns</br>  <br>Shit that was wrong with me is in no way the same, but I can comeserate with you about unrelenting pain and opiate cocktails. They have to come up with better pain killers.</br>  acid guys reporting in  <br>I prefer smoking, mainly for health reasons I also like being high way more than being drunk</br>  drunk at parties so I can socialize with girls<br><br>high when i'm kicking it with friends at my house or something</br></br>  <br>Shrooms and LSD are great if you can mentally handle it. <br><br>Pretty much everything else isn't worth the risk. Addiction rate and side effects are too high.</br></br></br>  <br><br>You would think wrong, a persons body uses a lot of water during digestion. These guys talk about how they only eat one meal and can only eat after drinking. This has a lot to do with gastric emptying and how digestion works. Alcohol takes water to be processed. So even small amounts like 6% in a beer can lead to chronic dehydration. This is long term dehydration not acute dehydration, which is what most people think of.</br></br>  <br>Don't be mad loser.</br>  alcohol, because i'm not a nigger  <br>Vodka</br>  <br>Drunk with friends, high alone</br>  <br>I was talking about intensity of intoxication. I've smoked dabs and I've drank entire bottles of liquor. The bottle fucked me up more than the dabs did. I'm also not say that there aren't intense levels of being high.<br><br>I've never been "disabled" from being too high. I have been non functional when hammered</br></br></br>  <br>I'm german.<br>how much % alc have the beer in your country?</br></br>  Drunk  <br><br>I drink with buddies to enjoy myself, I smoke to help me get to sleep when my head starts going to places I have trouble keeping it out of.<br><br>I like to have a couple beers, pack a small bowl, sit back on my couch and clean my leverguns sometimes on a quiet saturday night indoors, however. Being cross-faded is great, just be sure you hydrate lots.</br></br></br></br>  Mushrooms.  <br>ok, thanks anon, good to know</br>  <br>Bich pls. I'm German too and anything less than 30% vol. isn't an alcoholic drink.<br>38% if you're Russian.</br></br>  <br>dude, i was talking about beer</br>  <br>Fuck it, just do both. Vodka along with my bong, is great.</br>  Just to clarify, coming from an old air force doc that likes to have a few brews and light up from time to time:<br><br>Beer is stronger outside of the US. Go to Canada for the tough stuff, you'll be drinking Miller light by the quart because after a few months on Labatt, it'll be seltzer to you. <br><br>Also, beer makes you so dehydrated so quickly because alcohol, like caffeine, is a diuretic, and will cause you to urinate more frequently. You don't really 'absorb' the moisture from it, think of the water like a greased sled for the alcohol to hit you on.</br></br></br></br>  Neither<br>I like to be in control of my body at all times :^)</br>  <br>5%-7%, I've had some imports as high as 11%, and been to some counties where the beer is at 17%</br>  <br>vodka instead of water in the bong?</br>  <br>Yeah, it's non-alcoholic.<br><br>At least it should be considered such.</br></br></br>  <br><br>You are welcome anon.</br></br>   high <br>I just feel better the next day. I can sleep like a baby and dont have headache or some shit</br>  <br><br>ironic shitposting is still shitposting. Please be a part of the discussion, not the problem anon. Just because the summerfags are the worse this year than they've ever been doesn't mean you need to try to impress them by jumping on the new meta. Just talk, nigr. We're here to hear what you have to say.</br></br>  <br>Talking about beer fag, not liquer</br>  Depends on the situation.<br>I get high to chillout, beer for social situations, pushups (speed, meth) for work, downers (heroin) to completely calm down and psychedelics for experiences. <br>If you can't handle them, it's not the fold of the drug but the users... Just hobos get addicted.</br></br>  <br>then drink some belgian beer. Im from Austria and have a few friends from Belgium, their Beer is actually insane</br>  <br>You know nothing about American beer. You can get local craft beers almost any where now days with 6-15% alcohol.</br>  <br>pretty sure you're from bavaria?</br>  <br>I feel like I'm going thru that stage right now anon. Any advice?</br>  <br>go away</br>  <br> complaining about shitposting on 4skin </br>  I prefer weed, I will drink but not often and only in social situations. I also take it easy when I drink, I got most of the urge for it out in high school. <br><br>Today I am dropping acid though, excited to see how that goes.</br></br>  <br>Same both ! I'm drunk right now but being high is good too. Hope being high in few hours !</br>  <br>Figured me out...<br>Now cheers!</br></br>  <br><br>Those are craft beers, anon. I'm a vet that's been stationed everywhere from Texas to Germany. STANDARD American lagars and pilsners are pisswater. In Germany and Canada, the heavier beers are the normal beer you'd get everywhere. The alcohol content is by far much higher on average. Relax, we have the best bourbon, nobody can deny that. Beer is something we need to grow up with, though.</br></br>  high alone, drunk with friends  High<br><br>Go beat your family you fucking drunk.</br></br>  <br><br>I have a strong feeling you aren't actually old enough to know who that character you posted is. <br><br>And yes, anon, some of us were here before 2012 when it all turned to shitposting. I remember when you would be a roody poo, and I remember spamming TPC for lulz. Just remember yourself that you don't HAVE to shit in the pool, there are actually people around that you could be talking to and doing fun stuff with.<br><br>I'm sorry you chose to be summer.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>srsly tho, the American craft industry has really come into its own over the last 5 years or so.<br><br>A lot if it is based around IPA and other ale styles, but there is a huge selection.<br><br>Stone Brewing Co. was my go-to back when I still drank. Loved the Bastard beers.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Have a nice flight!</br>   Having a dick contest about the percentage of alcohool in your beverage <br>Just drink pure ethanol if that shit is your primary concern you fucking faggots.</br>    <br><br>American IPA in a nutshell<br><br> GUYS JUST DUMP MORE FUCKING HOPS IN, THE HIPSTERS WON'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE! </br></br></br></br>  <br>as a german i tell you,<br>you need to try czech beer</br></br>  So basicly, im an intern at rockstar and they wanted me to design the cover art for our newest title.

Can you give me some legitimate pros and cons of circumcision?<br><br>My stances are this:<br><br>Pros: Little to no dick-maintenance, less chance of catching some serious diseases during childhood, less sensitive (gives the poor kid a chance with his first girl)<br><br>Cons: P. much mutilation, uncircumcised looks nicer but I don't care much about aesthetics or aerodynamics, I mean if he finds a girl/guy who likes him, I think they'll overlook whether or not he's circumcised. More sensation during sex/masturbation- a double-edged sword. I don't want my boy to be a quick shot.<br><br>I don't really know how much better/worse sex feels with regular circumcision. I mangled my dick pretty bad when I was young by jumping onto a couch with a hardon hips first, so my experience doesn't help much here. I hardly feel anything during sex, and I'm pretty sure that's because of the scar tissue.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>umm<br><br>Its not your call really, he can make that decision when hes adult himself.<br><br>Why should any parent have a right to mutilate their children.<br><br>Only arabs and Americans do this essentially.<br>Religious habit that is now rationalized with poor excuses about deceases, which is hardly a real reason.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I lived 22 years without circuncisión and 3 circumcised.<br><br>For me, is better a full penis, not a half penis.</br></br>  <br>Why were you circumcised when you were 19?</br>  <br> less sensitive (gives the poor kid a chance with his first girl) <br> but ruins it for him with the rest of his life</br></br>  <br>I enjoy sex with a totally, legitimately, actually mutilated penis though.</br>  Uncircumcised forever. Women love the shiny dick look and I love the sensation of it. Do it for your kid.  Ameritards cutting their childrens penises.  <br>dont know if bait or retard but you are a piece of shit if you think your thoughts should be a reason to mutilate the genitals of an infant<br>7/10 made me post</br></br>  <br> Little to no dick-maintenance <br>same with uncircumcised</br></br>  <br>chtching what disease? wtf? being circ is more dangerous, foresking is there to protect+ HUUGE plus: fapping with foreskin is soo much better and easier.</br>  <br><br>You dumb mongoloid dick having nig. You have no idea what you are saying, just a knee jerk, don't make his dick look good and make him better with women all the while my son loves his dick because it looks good and is still sensitive as fuck.</br></br>  <br><br>now that we're on this topic, guys.. i have a serious question<br>I'm a teenager, I got my schlong mutilated when i was around 6-7.<br>I had my first time almost 2 weeks ago and had sex about maybe 5 or so to this day.<br>I can't cum. The first 3 times, my dick just went soft after 10-15 minutes of fucking and i later realized how to maintain fucking but I still can't cum.<br>I fucked my girl for about an hour or more and I still couldn't just flat out cum, maybe If i tried really hard and went rough as fuck I could.<br>Is it because im circumcised or because of masturbation habits, overwhelming, scared etc...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I once had some weird infection(uncut here) all it took was some weird creme on my head and was good to go. Was 3 or 4 or something. <br><br>That aside, Uncut has been fine. Im totally happy to not cut a chunk of my dick off.</br></br></br>  <br><br>The anteater dicks don't like to hear that we have more sex and it feels just as fucking good. It's really one the only things they can cling to and repeat over and over again.</br></br>  <br>He was circumcised at 22, and is now 25. If he stated that correctly.<br><br>And I'd assume religious reasons. Or he had hideous elephant foreskin or something.</br></br></br>  <br>Im just saying how would you feel about someone else taking decisions on your dick</br>  <br>In my experience uncut guys take forever to cum. I only have so much time and energy here</br>  <br>but I'm cut though lol</br>  <br>back to tumbler with you fat whore<br><br><br>and as for you OP. get it done if not for any other reason than health reasons</br></br></br></br>    <br>"Because pulling off a bit of skin that is made to pull and protect your penis just to clean it is too much work. Nah better mutilate it."</br>  <br>How about you don't do it, and let the kid decide if he fucking wants to later in life.<br><br>Also <br> Less chance of catching disease <br>If you live in fucking India<br> Less Sensitive <br>Teach your son how to wash his fucking dick</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>OP its very very simple, do not circumcise him and let that be his decision, im not the first to say it nor will i be the last, its really that simple.<br><br>What i will say is that it looks like youre going to be a good parent, you care enough to really think about decisions that will affect his life, and you also seem concerned and accepting (a guy/girl, shit like that)<br><br>Dont cut the skin off his dick, even i, who had phimosis and had a weird infection thing because of it fully advocate leaving the foreskin in-tact. Godspeed OP, godspeed.</br></br></br></br></br>    Pro : Exist in the covenant with god<br><br>Con :</br></br>  Circumcised amerifag here<br>Had son<br>Did not circumcise<br>Extremely easy maintenance with no cons I've seen<br>Wonderful feeling knowing I didn't mutilate my son for zero ACTUAL purpose. He can make that choice if he wants.<br>Everyone I know who circumcised their son said they regretted it. You'll regret the screams of your child knowing you caused it pain intentionally.<br>Don't circumcise.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  If dubs no mutilation  <br>it's his dick, if he wants to mutilate it, let him... it's not your choice to make! :D let him live with it, I mean you don't cut your feet off cos they get cheesy do you?</br>  OP, as someone already stated, it's not your call. If he really wants it done he can do it himself when he reaches an age where he can make that decision.<br><br>Also the only thing he's (very) slightly more likely to catch is a UTI, which is easily cleared up via antibiotics within 2 - 3 days. It can also be easily prevented if you teach him proper cleanliness (aka, pull skin back when you are able to and wipe with a wet rag in the shower). As for the "quickshot" myth, uncut men usually last longer due to the increased sensitivity. They can better determine when they're about to orgasm, allowing them to control it better. <br><br>There is no pros to circumcising him aside from a slightly lowered HIV transmission risk, but consider that Female &gt; Male HIV transmission is super rare anyway along with the fact that a condom will also prevent HIV without needing to lop off a part of his dick he can never get back.</br></br></br></br>  <br>At 3-4 you shouldn't even be retracting your foreskin, it's intended to be fused to your glans, probably the reason you had an issue to begin with.</br>  <br> mutilate your body for health reason <br><br>if you can't survive having skin on your dick the way nature intended the child have shit genetics (yours) and was meant to catch those diseases to cull the herd<br><br>quit following a jewish practicion of mutilating penises</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You literally can't spell though.<br><br>http://www.medicinenet.com/circumci<wbr>sion_the_medical_pros_and_cons/arti<wbr>cle.htm<br><br><br>You'll get there. It could be that you were overwhelmed. I had the same issues, but now I'm wondering if it's an actual nerve issue.<br><br><br>It already happened.<br><br><br>I can start and end a fap session in about 10 minutes. I last for a half hour to an hour, but I'm capable of quickies with my wife.<br><br><br>Penis cancer is a thing too.<br><br><br><br>Legitimately I don't think any man would decide to get themselves circumcised. Additionally, parents make a ton of decisions for children. That's probably for the best, since parents are more experienced than children and know that, say, eating a whole cake is probably a really bad idea.<br><br><br>I'm not religious. At all.<br><br><br>Limbs are much more useful than Foreskin, I think.<br><br>Can I have some actual pros and cons that aren't inflammatory appeals to emotion?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>The disease thing is a myth. I live in Australia, a country where almost everyone is uncircumcised, and yet I bet our rate of disease or std or lower than even the US. And if it really did cause disease, do you really think we'd still have foreskin? evolution would have ensured that either foreskin doesn't exist anymore, or there's be at least some people who are born without it. And the sex part, i'm uncircumcised, and I lasted about 30 mins my first time. (I blame that on nerves, second time I lasted maybe 10 seconds lol.) I typically last about 10 mins these days. <br><br>Also circumcision should be his choice! let him do it later if he wants to. I considering it so wrong that Americans usually circumcise. It's worse than cutting a puppy's tail off because it "looks better".</br></br></br>  <br> implying that Op won't have to pull back his son's foreskin and clean it, thus basically masturbating his son <br><br>All joking aside, why would you? The only thing you should care about is that your son has a healthy penis. He'll get made fun of either way, he'll be a quick shot either way, he'll be able to find people who like his dick either way.</br></br></br>  <br> I'm gonna have a son. Can you give me some legitimate pros and cons of circumcision? <br><br>The stories and information posted here are artistic works of fiction and falsehood.<br>Only a fool would take anything posted here as fact.</br></br></br></br>  Hey OP if you have a daughter are you going to give her tit implants and a labiaplasty from birth  <br>Oh...<br><br>...Well, I guess that answers that.</br></br></br>  <br> Little to no dick-maintenance <br>What. It takes like 3 seconds to clean your dick while showering. And if you are about to receive oral sex, you should wash yourself beforehand either way. <br> less chance of catching some serious diseases during childhood, <br>There's no real evidence for this<br> less sensitive (gives the poor kid a chance with his first girl) <br>I don't know if this is true or not, but it's hardly an argument for mutilating his dick in either case.<br><br>Let your son decide for himself when he's of age. To be honest, I think the practice of circumcision (specifically the ethical part of it) is absolutely disgusting, but I try ro refrain from polemics for the sake of civility.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Sorry but my foreskin protects the head of my penis, keeps it moist, I am in my 40s and my cock looks GREAT... I look at American men in porn with their dry old dicks... and I feel sorry for them, yeah you can get high on cocaine and fuck for hours, but real women don't really like that, I can make my Mrs cum in about 5 minutes of sex... There is no good reason to mutilate a babies penis...</br></br>  <br> Can you give me some legitimate pros and cons of circumcision? <br><br>The advantages of protection against HIV, penile cancer, and transmitting HPV to partners are only really significant on a population level.<br><br>The disadvantages are inflated by nutcases and are largely restricted to the risk of permanent injury from the procedure itself, which is exceptionally rare.<br><br>In short, do it if you have a cultural motivation for doing so, but I wouldn't worry about it otherwise.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Theres also the factor that circumcision as an infant tears the fusing of the foreskin and the glans which is supposed to separate during childhood and causes scar tissue on the glans. Circumcision as an adult doesn't do this, if they want to do it, do it as an adult.</br>  <br>it's bullshit!!!!<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=W6Z<wbr>D56C0aLc</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=8JV<wbr>SkDaG8K4</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>    <br> and fuck for hours, but real women don't really like that <br><br>Cause they end up sore as fuck, so do you usually tbh.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh yeah! forgot to mention CON: Circumcision can shorten the penis by up to an inch... imagine that! losing a whole inch of schlong..</br></br>  <br><br>Are you fucking joking? Go fuck yourself.</br></br>  <br> which is exceptionally rare. <br> Sixteen prospective studies evaluated complications following neonatal and infant circumcision. Most studies reported no severe adverse events (SAE), but two studies reported SAE frequency of 2%. The median frequency of any complication was 1.5% (range 0-16%). <br>So nah, not exceptionally rare. Uncommon</br></br></br>  <br> Little to no dick-maintenance <br> i am an lazy cunt who will also put that annoying piece of a son in front of some tv for "caring" <br><br>Animals like you shouldn't breed at all.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Little to no dick-maintenance <br> i am an lazy shit who will also put that annoying shitpiece of a son in front of some tv for "caring" <br><br>Animals like you shouldn't breed at all.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>that escalated quickly tee hee</br></br>  <br> Pros: Little to no dick-maintenance,  <br>Wrong, whn caring for a circumcised baby you have to take care of the wound. With an uncircumcised child it is like caring for any other part of the body. The foreskin isn't supposed to be pulled back until around puberty. This causes a high chance of the head not developing correctly.<br><br> less chance of catching some serious diseases during childhood <br>Wrong, it is very uncommon for serious complications to occur. EVERY child is born with phimosis, but most of the time it takes little effort around puberty to stretch it. <br><br> less sensitive <br>That isn't a plus. How would you like it if your clitoral hood was removed without your consent?<br><br>Let him decide. If he waits to get it removed at a later age it will have less of aa chance for complication.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know where all the hype about dick-maintenance and disease came from regarding this issue, but i can assure you being uncut has very little on penis health. I am uncut and i have not once in my life had a dirty penis or a disease because of my foreskin. Leave it on, it makes no sense to cut it off, if he really wants it done when he is old enough to ask himself them he can always do it later, cant stitch it back on though.</br>  <br>wow i was basically in the same situation; i had had sex maybe 7 or 8 times, but then a few days ago I had sex with this girl twice in a row and came both times. she was on top and I didn't have to work as hard. I think maybe it was harder for me to cum on top since I was basically exercising and I don't have any endurance.</br>  You're asking 4chan for whether or not your son should be circumcised? <br>Seriously how fucking retarded are you? And of all boards you chose /b/, kill yourself faggot.</br>  <br>This is how easy it is to fix phimosis on most people if it continues through puberty.</br>  <br>Uncut reporting for duty.<br><br>My first time I actually fucked for about 40 minutes and got too tired and didn't even finish. How long you last is more about your mental state and how often you jerk off, the cut/uncut thing probably doesn't change much because I know tons of cut guys who nut way too quick.<br><br>Also, the cleaning isn't that big of a problem if you're a normal person and shower at least once a day (it's faster/easier than putting soap in your ass crack tbh)<br><br>In regards to girls' opinions: I've had maybe one girl out of twenty ever say she's not a fan of uncut, but we still had sex regardless, she just prefers cut. Cut or uncut is not a girl's first priority when having sex with a dude unless they've got some issues. <br><br>With that said, sometimes I wish I was cut because I personally think it looks better but fuck going through that procedure.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Prevention &gt; fixing</br>  <br> You might get an ingrown toenail <br> better rip out your toenails so it can never happen </br></br>  <br>Well put!</br>  <br> So nah, not exceptionally rare. Uncommon <br><br>As you said, most studies reported NO severe adverse events. They happen, but mild complications are about as common as pathological phimosis, and significant complications are so rare as to be difficult to measure.<br><br>Medically speaking, this isn't an important issue (except in west Africa). Arguments about circumcision in the developed world are more about signifying values than health.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> you might get tooth decay <br> better rip out your teeth now while you are at it </br></br>  Why would you take a knife to a penis? Why would you let some insane old jewish tradition hack off the dick of your kid when you are not a jew?  I did it and let me tell you<br>My dick looks better</br>  <br>What are these "mild complications" you speak of, and can they be fixed as easily (aka, by the person at home without seeing a doctor) as most cases of phimosis?</br>  <br>Would you remove his eyelids?<br><br>The foreskin provide the exact some function, to protect, hydrate and lubricate.</br></br></br>  My stance is don't get your kid circumsized. When I was a kid my parents got me circumsized, and the doctor ended up mangling my cock. I needed two hypospadious repairs, just because of getting circumsized  <br>Your cock doesn't look better than this.</br>  <br> mild complications are about as common as pathological phimosis <br>This is true. As a gay person I have seen a lot of dicks. The ones of circumcised people who did it later in life look way healthier than those who had it done as a baby. Mine was done as a baby and has a lot of scar tissue. Some blood vessels were damaged causing a big sensitivity loss and grey patches. It can get a lot worse though, so I got off fairly easy.</br></br>  <br>Mild complications are those that have no permanent impact on sexual or urinary function, primarily mild wound infections that resolve with no sequelae after treatment, bleeding/oozing that persists for a short period beyond the procedure.</br>  Your comment about the quick shot isn't really true with being uncircumcised.<br><br>The foreskin is sensitive to allow pleasure during sex, and lets the owner feel a gradual increase in pleasure until they ejaculate - helping control and understand that sensation a little better.<br><br>With a circumcised penis there is minimal pleasure or sensation until orgasm and so premature ejaculation can remain a lifelong ordeal.<br><br>Correct me if I'm wrong, since I'm uncircumcised and only know half the story</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Most of them are permanent deformations that require going under the knife to fix. Such as the skin before the glans being rotated, skin bridges, etc. There are also unfixable complications such as nerve and blood vessel damage.</br>  <br>Is there a way to fix that? <br><br>AND FUCJING SHIT THANK YOU LORD! I've been wondering the hell was on my dick for years as the doctor only says "lol it's normal" shit...</br></br></br>  <br>How about let him decide, cause all cirumcision kids say its the best etc cuz of butthurt, but no person with a foreskin would want it gone, and those who do regret it. If your kid wants to get rid of it later, let him make the bad choice himself</br>  <br> With a circumcised penis there is minimal pleasure or sensation until orgasm and so premature ejaculation can remain a lifelong ordeal. <br><br>I've been both. There has been no noticeable difference in sexual sensation for me.</br></br></br>  <br>I can just second your statement. I was cut as a child and sex is near sensation-less for my dick until right before orgasm.</br>  <br> Might get a brain tumor </br>  <br>Circumcision is about as logical as chopping off someone's eyelids, it's there to protect sensitive skin, it's genital mutilation.</br>    Get him cut. Looks WAY better (foreskins are gross,) less maintenance, less risk of health problems, no real loss of sensitivity, etc.<br><br>Basically, a bunch of upside with no down.</br></br>  <br>I dunno man, maybe a constant regime of anti stretchmark cream and or moisturiser?</br>  <br>dont you want your son to get blowjobs??</br>  <br>You're wrong. I'm circumcised, and feel PLENTY of sensation prior to cumming.<br><br>There. You're corrected.</br></br></br>  <br> "lol it's normal" shit... <br>I know that feel. As a young kid I was almost obsessed about finding out what happened to my penis, because I could tell it wasn't supposed to be the way it was. It just looked too unnatural. Any time I asked my parents played stupid. I didn't find out until high school sex ed.</br></br>  I wouldn't circumcise him if I were you. Circumcision provides no functional or health benefits, and sometimes it can seriously damage the penis. Like sometimes they cut off too much skin wich makes erections extremely painful and makes intercourse difficult. The foreskin is also one of the most sensitive parts of the penis, although as a circumcised man, I think masturbating is still pretty pleasurable. I also think that circumcision is simply unnatural, and that masturbation is probably a lot easier if you're circumcised. I remember when I was a kid, before I even knew what circumcision was, I was masturbating, and thought that it would be a lot easier to masturbate if I had more skin around my shaft so that I could just slide the skin over the glans instead of having to use lotion. So obviously I was pretty annoyed when I got older and learned about circumcision. In short, from a physical point of view, circumcision is a bad idea.<br><br>There are really only two other possible reasons to circumcise your child: social and religious. <br><br>A lot of people have argued that even though circumcision provides no health benefits, it's still a good idea to circumcise your kid because if you don't he'll be mocked by other children for being uncircumcised. This is a stupid reason to mutilate your child's penis because foreskins are totally natural, and being uncircumcised is actually the norm in East Asia, many European countries and in many parts of Latin America. Also, kids make fun of other kids for all the time for all kinds of stupid things, so even if he was made fun of a little bit he'll get over it. It might make your son a little upset when he's a kid, but when he grows up he'll be thankful that you didn't mutilate his penis.<br><br>There aren't many religious reasons to circumcise. The only two religious groups that really have to circumcise their kids are Orthodox Jews and maybe Muslims, I'm not sure though.<br><br>tl;dr - don't circumcise your kid, it's just a really stupid idea</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It disgusts me that you would even think of that. Leave it up to him in the future because personally I would have hated it if I was circumcised as an infant without my consent</br>  <br>CON: he could have fucking phimosis and get too old to tell you and now he is a 24 year old virgin who probably cant have sex but he cant be sure<br>but in the event a miracle happens and he finds out he cant have sex he will have to go the doctor and tell him "yea doc i JUST noticed i cant have sex with this thing, fix it" by the way im 24 fucking years old</br></br>  you might as well remove all of your child's teeth in case he ever gets cavities while you're at it   Everyone with circumcision says it is good <br> They had no choice <br> They know no better <br> People who aren't circumised that decide to do it regret it <br> People still try to say its better <br> I kek all day long <br> Green text </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  sometimes they cut off too much skin wich makes erections extremely painful <br>I had this puberty was a painful experience until until about a year after my penis did most of it's length growth. It took about a year for me to stretch the skin so erections wouldn't hurt, but if I was uncut it would have been no time to stretch and fix phimosis from what I have heard.</br></br>  <br>Or you fucking check for that like a responsible fucking parent who isn't a lazy cunt or adhere to archaic bullshit like "oh no, it'd be taboo to ensure my son's penis isn't fucked"</br>  <br>I feel sorry for people like you, I love my dick, its not even big, 5 n half inch, but I would have it over an 8 inch circumcised dick. <br><br>I hope you get it fixed annon, it can be really hard when the "Man" part of you isn't doing its work. I wish you luck man. honestly</br></br></br>  <br>You had shitty parents who just didn't educate you or get you any proper medical exams.<br>see<br/></br></br>  <br>Why would it stop you having sex? Also wtf don't you do something about it? be that stretching with steroids or getting circumcised.</br>  <br>con.: It's not natural and protection will be lost</br>   creating a wound and making it sit in a shit and piss filled diaper until it heals <br>yep cut is definitely cleaner</br>  <br>im not sure that it actually does. the thought of it slipping down to far while thrusting is painful. like thinking about slowly pulling out a nail does.</br>  <br>Getting it as a baby and as an adult are different. Babies need it to protect the glans during development. When you wait until you are older it has time to develop.<br><br>Most uncut would never want it cut.</br></br></br>  <br>Sometimes I experience this problem myself and it gets harder now that I'm on antidepressants. You can either live with it and realize that you can/will last longer than most uncut people, or smoke weed to make it easier for you.</br>  <br>dude the whole cleanliness thing is a lie. Anyone genitals are gonna be fucking nasty if you haven't showered for a few days. Im uncut and have never had any sort of infection, just wash it like any other part of your body.</br>  <br>Just do it, I tore my frenulum on two separate occasions fucking, barely felt it when it happened. Hurt afterwards though.</br>  <br>Chicks dig the foreskin; that's been my experience</br>  <br><br>my gf literally tells me to hurry up during sex, like literally.... becasue she gets sore. and yes she is horny adn she likes it but her cunt is jsust not that lubricated on her own and even with lube its a bitch</br></br>  <br> Anyone genitals are gonna be fucking nasty if you haven't showered for a few days <br> this <br>No chick would blow a guy who hasn't showered in several days because it would be obvious either way. I'm cut and when I went camping, and I forgot to bring stuff to bath with, it got pretty funky down there.</br></br></br>  <br>Same here, no girls I've met have actually said they prefer it without, always find it odd people say they do</br>  <br>Yeap and then if you wanted sex in the next few days, good fucking luck with that.</br>  <br>  </br>  <br>At least you're considering the option whether to cut or not. Health wise you're risking serious complications from circumcision for what? to reduce the chance of an urinary infection? Just think about it for a minute, how would you feel knowing that your son could lose or seriously impair the use of his penis from this procedure? <br>Ultimately the choice should be made by the person whos gonna live with it, not you.</br></br>  <br>In america it's usually chicks in high school who say that because they haven't actually seen an uncut one and just go off what they hear. One chick was determined she wouldn't sleep with an uncut dude, but had no idea what they even looked like. When college rolls around most might learn otherwise if they didn't find a long term relationship by then.</br>  This is coming from an eurofag.<br>As child my foreskin was attached to my glans so I had to get operated. Doctors said circumcision was possible, parents denied it.<br>Operation hurt like a fuck bitch till days after and it put a scar on the bottom of my dick but I'm glad I still have my foreskin.<br>If I'd pull it back and post a pick none of you fags would be able to tell I'm not circumcised. <br>You Americans are the only faggots who cut dicks for no religious reason, retards.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah true that, chicks just follow what others say. Girls are meme's</br>  <br>But my benefits..</br>  So that's why America is always invading people for oil . They need lube for their jew dicks.  <br>Once I heard a chick parrot and stood by the fact that anal sex had no chance of spreading STDs, because her boyfriend told her so.</br>  <br>kek</br>  <br>You can always mutilate yourself later. You can't unmutilate yourself later.</br>  lol @ people who have to clean their dick <br>fags</br>  <br>GUURRRRRLLLLZZZZ PRRRRRFFFFFF<br><br>dumb as fuck</br></br></br>  <br> who have to clean their dick  <br>This is why you can't keep a girlfriend. They see your nasty unclean dick and run away. All guys need to clean their dicks.</br></br>    <br>I know! top kek at people who shower</br>  Leave the body alone, just like the almighty designed it.  Parents who circumcise their child (boy or girl) for non urgent medical reasons belong here.  <br>I believe he forgot the bazinga.</br>  i would never have sex with an disgusting cunt cheese, uncut vagina.<br>fucking disgusting.<br>cut vagina all the way.<br>also its aesthetic and most guys prefer it.</br></br></br>  <br>cheers</br>  I'm from a country in which maximum of 1% of the men are cut ( this is because of our culture and the history we have with muslims (the country is Bulgaria)). The main thing I want to tell you is that for sure we have a lower precentage of HIV occurances/man than the USA and up to date I've not heard of a single case of penile cancer. Blame it on my ignorance if yoy wish but cutting a piece of skin on top of the head of your penis can surely not fucking lower the chance of cancer. This is simply how cancer does NOT work.  <br>top kek picture</br>  <br> log </br>  <br>also kek at picture</br>  PROS:<br>- less smegma buildup<br>- notably lower chance of smeg-duct (forget what they're called) buildup, blockage, infections, cancer (not much chance)<br>- easier hygeine (a little)<br>- don't have extra skin acting like a built-in slippery-water-wigglie (pic related) when what you really want is friction<br>- very small chance of scarring, and chicks dig scars<br>- decrease in unpleasant feel when you've already nutted but she still suckin'<br><br><br>CONS:<br>- lessening of sensitivity in glans due to full-time exposure<br>- possibility of a less "pointed" or streamlined glans often preferred by bottoms<br>- no peasant (for some) aesthetic akin to anteater, third eye or Eskimo<br>- generally less to work with when doing amateur Puppetry of The Penis<br>- can't join the ranks of smug tumbler-like anti-circumcision-ists<br>- difficulty building up manly pheromones around cockular area<br>- far lower possibility of phimosis (popular with a certain niche crowd) and complications thereof<br>- no chance of scarring from circumcision procedure, and some chicks dig scars more than uncut cocks</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I know this post was bait to start a shitstorm, but I seriously hate that I was circumcised as a baby. Give your kid the choice and he will be very grateful. I wish i could have my foreskin back and see what it felt like.  <br>Penile cancer is a rare form anyway. You would have better luck removing limbs to reduce a chance of skin cancer.</br>  <br> pros <br> less sensitive </br></br>   less chance of catching some serious diseases during childhood <br><br>this is a fucking retarded and non-existant reason.</br></br>  circumcised = jew slave  Fcukign fagsts    <br> aerodynamics <br> aerodynamics <br> aerodynamics <br><br><br>Set him up for the helicopter dick</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> uncircumcised looks better. </br>  Are you a fucking jew? <br>Yes. Cut his whole little shmeckle off.<br>No. Don't cut your kids dick. It is there for a reason, otherwise, we wouldn't have evolved to have a foreskin.</br></br>  <br>Intact is better, just consider that the worst thing that can happen with intact penis is phimosis, and the worst thing that can happen with a bad phimosis is... circumcision. So basically circumcise someone as a child is like cutting an arm for avoiding possible arm amputations... nonsense</br>  - Reduces the chance of penis cancer the same way that being shorter reduces your overall chance of cancer. There are literally just less cells. If I chop my arms off I'd have less chance of getting skin cancer, why? Less skin.<br><br>- There are far more risks to having surgery than not having surgery. EVERY surgery, however minor, comes with risks. The wound could become infected and the penis ruined. It'd be safer to wait to see if there are problems with your childs penis before getting surgery. It's a completely unnecessary surgery. Plus I don't know what % of kids you think catch a "serious disease" from their uncut dicks, in reality it's probably not many.<br><br>- I think the idea of uncut dicks being dirty is an American thing. That idea doesn't exist here where people don't get cut all the time. It's not an issue, my dick isn't unclean. Again I wouldn't take my fingernails off because they get dirt under them, and my nails actually do get dirty under them, my foreskin doesn't.<br><br>- Reduces sensitivity. A) There are nerves in the foreskin. B) The head of the penis rubs agaisnt clothing, causing it to become dry and damages the nerves with all the constant rubbing.<br><br>I honestly can't understand why anyone would get their childs dick cut. It's disgusting.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  If you're not jew, don't do it. If you're jew go to Israel and go fuck yourself  <br>Let him decide. If you cut your son's dick you're basically a wanna be jew abusive parent.</br>  <br>If he wants to decrease his sexual satisfaction by having his dick mutilated he can make that decision for himself when he's an adult.</br>  It's a weird thing to do.. but whatever you do make sure it doesn't end up "two-toned", where you have 70% of the dick tan coloured and 30% pink.  For science I would like to see anyone who supports being uncircumcised dicks in this thread because I'm almost positive you guys are overweight virgins with excess skin  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>  muh mutilaaayshunn <br>  can't read it without hearing it in a deep south retard accent <br><br>I chuckled. Fucking tumbleroids.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>shalom faggot. Don't be mad cause your parent mutilated your tiny dick</br>  <br>two choices OP, technically it's just skin. Personally, I'm cut and I wouldn't have it any other way, consider I'm a dirty guy. I want to be able to not wash for 2 days without worrying about dick cheese.</br>  <br>Typical response from the anteater harborer</br>  <br>This is unintentionally a b8 thread so Ill just post this and leave. If done at a very early age the body adapts. High nerve density =/= pleasure. The cheek is arguably the most nerve dense external area on the human body with the exception of the clit. Don't know how many people can easily cum from that. Also there is a good reason why cutfags an average last just as long. If sensitivity was reduced by as much as some people imply then cutfags should last much, much longer. The final point is sex is 80+% mental. If you don't believe me jack it to the mental image of your mom eating your dad's shit. Or you know sex in the missionary position since this is /b/. <br><br><br>Cut = less chance of STDs, less maintenance. <br>However basic hygiene isn't that hard and condoms exist for a reason. So it doesn't really matter. But what ever you choose know that you chose it. If you don't get them cut and they need to for some reason later in life (VERY unlikely) you fucked them. If you choose to get them cut, obviously, there is no going back.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No swiss fag in fact. Still got plenty of that jew gold</br>  <br><br><br>I wonder if the anti crowd is a tumbler feminist raid? Not likely, but certainly possible.<br><br>And /b/ rises to feminist bait like no other.</br></br></br></br></br>  It's mutilation......nuff said  How about instead of forcing this on your son, allow him to decide for himself when he is an adult?  As nature intended or hacked off with a knife? I dunno man, that's a hard one!  Unnecessary cosmetic surgery thrust upon the genitals of newborns that desensitizes the most sensitive and pleasurable organ on the body. It's pretty fucking creepy actually.  <br>dat logical fallacy tho</br>  <br><br>Get out of the 3rd world shithole you are living in, where parents feel they have the right to to determine if they should circumcise they child or not. It´s not your decision to make faggot. If he feels the need to mutiliate his penor, your son is free to do so when he´s at the right age.</br></br>  <br>Teach your son how to wash his dick. That'll prevent those diseases better than circumcision. If he wants to get circumcised later in life, let him decide to.</br>  <br> health reasons <br>Yeah, because there are no risks to damage your health/body with circumsision.<br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David<wbr>_Reimer</wbr></br></br></br></br>  Behind my ear it gets smelly and greasy every fucking day even though I take thorough shower every morning. I wish my parents had done me the favor of cutting these fucking these off at birth.  <br>why the fuck would you want to mutilate your sons dick are you retarded ?</br>  <br>just keep it</br>  <br><br>You wot m8? my fallacy is as nature intended, who cares if some people thing a dried up prune cock is better than a lovely shiney moist purple sensitive dome like mine... ?? Stumps are cleaner and feet, but you wouldn't want them...</br></br>  <br> implying the odds of a complication are anything but negligible provided you don't do it in some back ally </br>  <br>yeah, even tho i take care of my hygiene every evening my teeth are moist and are basicially a breeding spot for bacteria.<br>i have to brush my teeth multiple times a day.<br>i wish my parents just did me a favor and cut of my lips.</br></br></br>  <br> actually said he used the appeal to nature fallacy in his defense <br> uses another logical fallacy while he's at it <br>Jesus christ man.</br></br></br>  <br>let him decide when he's 18 you faggot.</br>  I had the procedure done when I was 6. I however had to get it no matter what due to some medical issues. All I can say is later on in life you don't notice it as much and really it should be your son's choice when he is old/mature enough to decide for himself.  <br>Yes but how is mutilating your son´s penis for the odds of having a health problem because an uncircumsised penis better?<br>Except if you live in a hot or desertic country in africa or middle with poor hygene I don´t see why you should worry about health problems that never happen.</br></br>  Wait, you get more pleasure if you are uncircumsized?!?!?? Fuck my parents  Cons: There is literally no reason to do it. Let your son decide you loon  <br>It's not less sensitive. Don't buy that bullshit. When I'm jerking odd I don't grab and twist my fucking cock skin.<br><br>Circumcision was started by the Egyptians who found it made them more sexually sensitive and active.<br><br>Don't let your kid have a freakish anteater penis.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Dude, circumcision is BARBARIC MUTILATION.</br></br>  <br>They cut off literally the most sensitive part of your dick (Frenulum)</br>  <br>This was happening with my missus until she found out she had a yeast infection and a UTI.<br><br>I'm only 5" and any more than 5 minutes of fucking and she would get sore. <br><br>now after getting her problem sorted out I can pound her for much longer, which is nice because I take 10+ mins to cum most sessions. <br><br>And no i'm not bragging I wish I could be faster a lot of the time. <br>I'm uncut btw, my dad was cut and wanted me to be but my mum used to be a nurse and refused to let them touch me thank god.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> yet I bet our rate of disease or std or lower than even the US. <br>Not applicable. You have no american niggers. I presume aboriginals dont have three times the rate of HIV infection than the rest of the australian population</br></br>  <br>this<br><br>also most likely these complications happened when circumcision was done so young that it just heals itself wrong.<br><br>Wait until the boy can make his own mind and when there is less of a chance of complications. It's his cock.... not yours.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Your foreskin wasn't supposed to leave your glans until around puberty.</br>  <br>It really is rare. Both sides have negligible risks and benefits. It really doesn't matter.</br>    <br>Because <br>didn't spell it out for you, here:<br>https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/st<wbr>rawman<br>https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/ap<wbr>peal-to-nature</wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br>  Let your child decide later in life whether or not they want to be circumcised. Doing it as an infant can cause extreme damage and loss of sensitivity. There is no reason whatsoever to do that to your kid.  <br>Female circumcision is typically the removal of the clit, thus all external stimulation. The equivalent for males would be a penectomy.</br>  <br><br><br>¡Buy French Horn lessons, bitchies love a man whom can play the french horn!</br></br></br>  <br>If you do it later in life the loss of sexual pleasure if immense. Not matter what you choose, you choose it for them at birth.</br>  <br>Nope, that's a very rare and extreme form. It's usually removal of clitoral hood/Outer Labia</br>  <br>Don't you dare mutilate that dick.</br>  Studies have shown that women not only feel more pleasure during sex from someone who is not circumcised, they're also three times less likely to feel pain. Women are three times more likely to have pain from sex from someone who is circumcised... On top of this, scientific evidence shows that it does remove a lot of feeling from the penis, finer touch nerve receptors retract from the surface once the foreskin is removed.<br><br>It's a no brainer.</br></br>  <br> - less smegma buildup <br> - notably lower chance of smeg-duct (forget what they're called) buildup, blockage, infections, cancer (not much chance) <br> - easier hygeine (a little) <br>these 3 mean exactly the same thing<br><br> - don't have extra skin acting like a built-in slippery-water-wigglie (pic related) when what you really want is friction <br>people and women don't want friction, retard <br><br> - very small chance of scarring, and chicks dig scars <br>wait wat?<br><br> - decrease in unpleasant feel when you've already nutted but she still suckin' <br>that's called pleasure<br><br><br>0/10 bait you jew piece of shit, lel</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, but then why mutilate when you can always do it after when there is a real medical need?</br>  <br><br>You are fucking full of shit, post sources you Shitlord of /b!</br></br>  <br><br>Yep, it was bait, fucking kike pieces of shit trying to fuck everything up.</br></br>  <br>My wife worked for a urologist for years, and circumcision is best, hands down. Less disease, cleaner, smells better, etc. And less sensitivity is a fallacy. <br><br>On the other side, never met a woman who cared either way, outside of the smell if he doesn't clean that uncircumcised bitch often. Have read fags on the web though who like the cheesy stink of an uncircumcised dick, so if he's gonna be a fag, leave it alone.<br><br>Otherwise, get that dick fixed.</br></br></br></br></br>  maybe don't cut your kids dick up because of YOUR reasons. its his dick...not yours  <br><br>How the fuck would you know you cut dick Jew fuck?<br><br>If you had it chopped you wouldn't know.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because doing it after sucks ass.</br>  <br>so don't do it at all</br>  <br>says the kike</br>  <br>I'm so WASP, I don't even tan.</br>  <br>imo its a decision everyone has to make for themselves. it doesnt really matter as long as hes a child and after that he still can decide to get circumcised, but not to get un-circumcised<br>tldr: dont do it</br></br>  <br>Dude just google search "women feel more pleasure uncircumcised" and you'll see DOZENS of results ranging from professional studies to women's magazines to forums of personal discussion. There are a ton of resources out there.<br><br>an article that covers a few areas though based off of a fair scaled study is here: http://sciencenordic.com/male-circu<wbr>mcision-leads-bad-sex-life</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Sure, Shlomo.</br>  <br>I call bullshit. The tip of the dick is inside her where there aren't many nerve endings. Smells like propaganda.</br>  <br>how about simply cleaning your cock?</br>  <br>do you even know what the foreskin does during sex?<br>http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=76c_<wbr>1314310545</wbr></br></br>  Psychology today, one of the worlds leading journals has an amazing article which is, at its bones, about trauma.. But it debunks several circumcision myths backed by sources. See here https://www.psychologytoday.com/blo<wbr>g/moral-landscapes/201109/myths-abo<wbr>ut-circumcision-you-likely-believe</wbr></wbr>  <br>It's widely discussed, do a Google search, that many women find sex with uncircumcised men more pleasurable as the foreskin adds additional friction, often collecting at the base near the clitoris offering more clitoral stimulation.</br>  <br>Same here. <br>German, cut, 25. Father of a 1-year-old. Always said that I would get my kid circumcised, but now I think that the skin should stay. <br><br>But! I got my circumcision because of a phimosis. And I think my little boy got one too, we are going to have it checked in a few days.<br><br>I just hope he can stay uncircumcised.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>one of my friends didnt know about cleaning under his foreskin and he got a little phimosis in his preteen years (we're good friends and talk about our shit openly)<br><br>I am uncircumcised and my dad taught me how to do it in the shower, after I learned how to roll my foreskin back it began to stretch on its own i just remember during puberty when my penis was growing and the stretch marks from fapping lol. as long as you teach your kid to clean their dick you should be alright against phimosis. sex feels better for the woman via uncircumcised penis too just FYI.<br><br>GL with ur kid</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I had my son circumcised. I was there when it happened. No screaming. I don't regret it at all.</br>  <br>This. It literally doesn't matter either way.</br>  pros:<br>cons: everything</br>  <br>Don't be THAT piece of shit, OP.</br>  <br>The foreskin acts as a solid lubricant. It also helps trap juices in leading to less of a chance for her to dry out.</br>    <br> less sensitive <br>That's a con<br><br>Don't ruin it for your kid</br></br></br></br>  anybody who thinks there's a significant difference is just a faggot.  <br><br>Just leave it on and let him choose when he's older instead of choosing for him now.</br></br>  i fucking hate when people say "uncircumcised is more sensitive" which is unfactual bullshit.  did you know it was actually hard for me to pull my foreskin back when i was a teen at 14? pulling it back took me years just to pull it all the way back so i can see the rips of the tip damn was it hard  circumcised men all say the pro is no maintenance. so basically you dont wash your cock? thats fucking disgusting. if you do clean it im sure you spend the same amount washing it then a man who isnt circumcised, therefore the only pro you had going has been neutralized.  <br>I'm a cutfag, and might I add you do have to clean it quite well<br><br>when i was 5 i never really bothered and fuck smegma<br><br>It's not different.</br></br></br></br></br>  Even tho I'm circumcised and I can still jerk off and shit, I'd rather have a foreskin. Just make sure when he's old enough to bathe himself that he understands just keeping good hygeine and washing under your foreskin will prevent diseases. Really no big deal, leave the foreskin.  <br>whatever you do, dont seperate the foreskin from the glans with force.<br>if it sticks to it and cant be moved, its supposed to be that way.</br></br>  Stupid question, what are the religious ideas behind getting cut anyway?  gfdsa  <br> god made man perfectly in his image <br> you must cut off a part to make it perfect <br>What's hard to understand?</br></br></br>  <br>kek</br>  <br>i didn't circumcise my son when he was born and i was forced to it at age 4.<br><br>i regret i didn't do it in the first place.</br></br></br>  hey /b/ poorfag here<br><br>can anyone buy me a small pizza please</br></br>  Get a job feg  Deutschlandfaden, weitergeführt!<br><br> wie alt? <br> schon mal ein mädchen mit zunge geküsst? <br> schon mal eine straftat begangen? <br> was gibt es zum abendessen? <br> wovon leitet sich das wort "wegschwoten" ab? </br></br></br></br></br></br>  so ihr penner ich weiß ich stell diue frage jedesmal, aber die ist ernst gemeint. aachener da? was geht? lass mal was starten. falls fems perfekt falls nicht brolike im park ein bierchen zwitschern etc pp?  <br>warum hast du dir nicht eigene fragen ausgedacht?</br>  <br>achja sorry...samefag<br><br> wie alt? <br>28<br><br> schonmal ein mädchen mit zunge geküsst? <br>ja!!!<br><br> schonmal eine straftat begangen? <br>nein!<br><br> wovon leitet sich... <br>HÄ bitte was...ich bin aachener ich kann kein deutsch kek</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>war wohl zu faul. bin ziemlich müde wegen überstunden zurzeit..</br>   &gt;Lieblingslied im Moment und Alltime  <br><br> &gt;Marke eurer Autos/oder Wünsche wenn nicht vorhanden. <br><br> &gt;Gruselige Ereignisse die euch passiert sind. </br></br></br></br>   wie alt? <br>23<br> schon mal ein mädchen mit zunge geküsst? <br>Nein<br> schon mal eine straftat begangen? <br>Fahrerflucht<br> was gibt es zum abendessen? <br>Erst in 2 Stunden Shabbat<br> wovon leitet sich das wort "wegschwoten" ab? <br>Nie gehört</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>24.<br>Fast jede Woche.<br>Ja, Drogen gekauft und unter Einfluß gefahren.

This was an LDR and I flew over to stay with her, it was the first time we met, and i stayed with her for 6 weeks.<br><br>anyway long story short i took pictures of the conversations she had with her ex with my phone almost every time she forgot to take her phone to the shower or something (which i will not post). <br><br>not even a month gone by and shes already dating someone else. i have her friends following me on instagram and stuff. i was wondering if it could be considered "harassment and stalking" if I post the photos of her cheating conversation with her ex. we argue a lot and she threatened me with a restraining order.<br><br>is it restraining order worthy if i post the conversations on instagram for all her friends to see? as a guy i was kind of abused by her when we were together, so i want to go "all out" and just explain everything on instagram because it's been on my mind for so long that i have trouble sleeping at night,.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>These guys are a couple of tumblr shill, fucking mooks. <br><br><br>Op I'm not sure of the legality, but the world needs to know how much of a slut you ex bitch is. Also I feel like if you post them on here you can't be held responsible for what happens to them afterward.</br></br></br></br></br>  Texting lol... such amateurs... <br><br>I have 2 mistress going on right now and i'm not gonna fucking text them. holy shit people are dumb.</br></br>  <br>Fuck dude.
