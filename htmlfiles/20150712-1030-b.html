Real fun deck</br>  <br><br>loved me some B/R control in the day. Don't know if this card is still even played.</br></br>  <br>black/blue/white edh<br>lands are kinda bitch to get</br></br>  I don't play regularly anymore, but if i do its either legacy, modern, or edh<br><br>Affinity ftw</br></br>  <br><br>so you make 1/1's by turn 6? I'm shaking.</br></br>  <br><br>Black Green Infect/Bloodrush deck<br><br>Any pointers?</br></br></br></br>  Any faggots play modern online and wanna get anally violated?  <br>I play it in sideboard in modern to kill combo decks.<br><br>Also, this is the most fun card ever.</br></br></br>  best flavor text in magic  For Legacy I have BUG Delver, Burn, Affinity, Death and Taxes, and High Tide basically built.<br><br>Working on Elves and MUD. 2 Cradles to go still on elves.<br><br>For EDH I have a strategy schmategy deck with shit like puzzle box and possibility storm.<br><br>Working on an elves EDH deck and debating whether adding a 2nd color would be fun.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    looking forward to seeing what this bad boy can do in modern  <br>Its by turn 5, and its stack so i get 1, then 2, then 3, so ill have a total of 6 1/1's. And if they get wiped by something like that ill just get almost as much next upkeep. And they have haste</br>  <br>That card is hilarious</br>  Either straight green or black green elves. There's a beautiful new elf card that comes out next week that i really want I'll look it up and reply to this  I miss my necro deck.  I have no favourite color. I like em all, simply because there's so many different ways to just overpower your oponent which in the long run is the main goal.    <br>yeah you play it turn 5 and get 1/1's from turn 6 and onward still seems super mediocre if not totally horrible</br>  <br><br>stop reminding me how much saviors sucked.</br></br>  <br>I don't get it. I'm not familiar with the modern meta but how does this kill combo?</br>  love playing doom blade in my mono black, also obsessed with stab wound, some shit just too good  <br>Maybe on paper it looks pretty bad but its worked pretty well for me. But i do have much better cards in there, like this one</br>  <br>Do people who only play the PC versions belong in this thread? I'd play with actual cards but I don't know a single person in real life who plays</br>  Fun  everyone knows white is the best color  <br><br> What's your favorite color(s)? <br>Esper (W/U/B)<br><br> Any decks you are trying to build or recently built? <br><br>G/B or G/U Strength from the Fallen is the most interesting deck going into current rotation. I have an Abzan control deck which I'll slot languish into and test out there and maybe Dark Petition but it is mostly stock from pre Origins. I think someone will have a very good showing with SftF at Pro Tour Origins, the deck has all the pieces IMO to be good. <br><br> Any cards you're looking for? <br><br>Any good legacy cards, I'm looking to get into it. I'm approaching a time where I can get a lot of free time so I'm looking to make a run at going to multiple GP's and Pro Tours.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Or legacy storm</br>  <br>I play irl, I'm even going to play an tournament tomorrow actually</br>  <br>my god did ice age suck</br>  <br> playing online <br> netdecking <br>fuck off fag</br></br></br>  <br>Use deodorant please sir. Good luck though</br>  <br>are we talking a budget format where your cards cant be worth more then a certain amount? because then i guess i could see it as being a casual contender, or in limited</br>  <br><br>you must be joking.</br></br>  <br>I always use deodorant. What i need is a goddamn gas mask for that tourney.</br>  <br>but so far i havent been able to stop being a poorfag so modern is the most i can muster to compete in</br>  <br>Kills Exarch and can't be countered. <br>Abrupt Decay is better for that, though</br></br>  I do EDH with Memnarch as my commander. Blue/artifact obv.  <br>That card right there mang. Garbage.</br>  <br>I immediately thought about storm when I saw this. I still feel infernal tutor is the way to go to use he LEDs.<br><br>But storm can get mana ramped other ways and has little problem playing instants.<br><br>However it is a 5 cost to watch out for with ad nauseum.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>2overpowered4me</br>  Jesus, it's been a while I guess. I don't recognize half this shit.  <br> 5 mana for a tutor and maybe dark rit <br>A whole lot of nothing. 5 mana makes it useless</br></br>  <br>I'm on a budget, so right now I'm building a very cheap dimir mill deck. Just to play with friends and it's really fun, nobody seems to know how to counter it. I need a couple Mirko Vosk though, it fits and the art is really cool</br>  <br>I had a mono white equipment deck back when Mirrodin came out.<br><br>One of the least expensive decks I ever made, but it worked very well. Still one of my favorites.</br></br></br>  <br>I mostly just play casually with a bunch of friends. We have tournaments with just each other with like 10-12 ppl. Im not trying to make a really competitive deck or anything. Im too lazy to look up pics of some other cards i have in there like aurelia, angelic skirmisher, or avcyn.</br>  Junk rites  <br>so you dont think storm will break it?</br>  I have this one guy in my playgroup who can't do anything but build/play mill decks and it's ducking annoying. Especially in EDH, he's always the first to die cause he can't make an alliance with anyone and gets btfo or kills himself  <br>Built a green/white deck built around buffing creatures. Idk how good it is since Ive only played 2 ppl with it and it still could be tweaked more. This is for standard</br>  <br><br>I know right? you could play as many lotuses as you wanted, fuck lands and fuck the DCI.</br></br>  <br>Don't know how Legacy storm does, but it won't do shit for storm in Modern.</br>  <br>Green all the way. Love me some cheap giant monsters.</br>  <br>Oh i have a friend that made a pretty decent mill deck. Such a fucking bitch to play against when you discard like 5 lands.</br>  <br>I always thought that was a pretty good card for being a common.</br>  <br>It's fuckin great for games with 4 players. people generally lose track of the creatures they kill and lose</br>  <br>what makes you say that travis woos waste not strom deck have been making so waves and incorperating this into it shouldnt be too hard</br>  <br>I like zoo that plays red green and black</br>  blew my mind when they brought her back for timespiral  <br>Fucking green deck players with your ridiculously fast mana generation</br>  <br>I don't play Legacy because it's nonexistent in my area. I don't know if that's a Legacy deck or not<br>I haven't seen anyone playing Waste Not in Modern, and I've only seen storm once in the past year. I've been to a lot of modern tournaments in the past few months. Nobody plays Storm in Modern</br></br>  <br>I mosty like white, but red is also neat, i play a red/white boros themed deck, with soldeirs, and i of couse play jeskai aswell</br>  http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/C<wbr>ard/Details.aspx?multiverseid=24718<wbr>4<br><br>Aura Shards :)</br></br></wbr></wbr>  <br>Yeah, thats what i do too.</br>  <br>Hehe its always fun to have a nice combat trick when you attack with your 1/1 heroic and they block with thair 2/2 and you buff it with first strike, i love it xD</br>  <br>Favorite deck I've ever built: Simic-color EDH deck with Vorel of the Hull Clade as commander.<br><br>The point of the deck was to accumulate as many +1/+1 counters on one creature with unblockable or trample as is necessary, then attack.<br><br>One game, however, my opponent was completely incoherent and couldn't manage to scrap together any kind of threat towards me. So I just bided my time, accumulating more and more counters on one creature, until he finally could put something threatening on the board.<br><br>At that point I attacked for 12,268 damage.<br><br>The turn before I almost played Take and lost the game by drawing 6,000 cards.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I miss old school MTG from the 90's.</br>  <br>jund</br>  Yellow  <br>My nigga.<br>It sucks when everyone in your local area is playing either Tron or Burn.<br>I'm lucky if I get paired up with Twin once a month</br></br></br>  <br>You can still play with a lot of those cards. The creatures are a lot more powerful today, but the instants and sorcs from back then are still better</br>  <br>This is a very good idea.</br>  <br>Doing clones, inventing fun cards, or both?</br>  <br>This</br>  GolGaryGakdos.<br>Red, black, and green nah boi.</br>  i pre-released origins earlier , went 2=0 every single round <br>played green white <br>ask me anything</br></br>  Im a black mage, mostly playing standard while my modern deck is coming together. Im playing mono black recursion in standard with despoiler, titan of erebos, bloodsoaked champion, and tasigur alongside discard.quite fun.  Green/White in my favorite  <br>Also Ajani</br>  <br>That's called Jund.<br>It's one of the best decks in Modern right now</br></br>  Made a pretty sweet scarecrow tribal edh deck last week. pretty fun to play  <br>Of course it is! But I don't like jund, I prefer GolGaryGakdos</br>  <br>No preference for color.<br>Trying to assemble a couple of Tiny Leaders decks.</br></br>   What's your favorite color(s)? <br>N/A... don't care.<br><br> Any decks you are trying to build or recently built? <br>I've been thinking of running Living End lately... still not sure the meta is right for it. Mostly been playing Affinity, RDW, Twin, &amp; UW Kiki lately.<br><br> Any cards you're looking for? <br>BGS graded beta cards<br>Certain summer magic cards<br>8th edition test prints (not the shitty condition ones that just popped up on eBay)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  This was a good blue flying card no draw backs just a 1/1 flyer for 1 blue GREAT DEAL!  Izzet is the best color combination imo. Im buildiing uwr control right now in modern  <br> Was  <br>There's a 3/2 flyer for U with no draw backs today<br><br>You're gonna be pretty disappointed with it. Control's not really viable in modern right now.</br></br></br></br>   Control's not really viable in modern right now. <br>UWr Control (w/Geist) won a pptq here lately. It's not really that bad. There's one store I go to and two weeks in a row I lost to that deck (with Twin). Geist is such a beater.</br>  <br>Faeries is a good control deck. expensive as hell, but fun to play.</br>   Faeries is a good control deck. <br>I like Clique as much as the next guy, but I wouldn't go that far.</br>  <br><br> What's your favorite color(s)? <br>Esper and Orzov (White, Black, Blue)<br><br> Any decks you are trying to build or recently built? <br>dark ritual + laboratory maniac combo deck (foolproof combo with sone hexproof aid, I discovered the combo myself! have won 90% of the matches)<br><br> Any cards you're looking for? <br>a good goblin to base a deck on</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   I discovered the combo myself! <br>Doomsday combo decks have been around for ages.</br>  <br> I discovered the combo myself! have won 90% of the matches <br>Dredge has been around for a very long time. It's babby's first Legacy deck.</br></br>  <br>Prosh, sacrifice based deck, devour and such. My favorite is being able to say, as a reaction to that, i kill you.<br>My other is pure flavour, ravnica deck with all guild leaders and champions from both releases and guild lands<br>I love ravnica</br></br></br>  <br>Lab maniac is in dredge these days? Didn't know that.<br><br>Then again, no legacy in my area.</br></br></br>  <br>Try playing 5 color ravnica</br>  <br><br>so what? I did not know these before and discovered it for myself. why don't you let me have fun and pride? I'm new to this game</br></br>  <br>how long has everybody been playing for?<br>just before m13 for me</br></br>  <br>I feel ya, bro. I came up with cephalife when testing for a GP. Then some faggot got 2nd with it at a GP right before and my sweet deck was all over the place.</br>  <br>Been playing since right after Theros.<br>Stopped playing Standard when Journey came out.</br></br>  <br> how long has everybody been playing for? <br>Since Ice Age/4E.</br></br>  <br>how do you deal with edicts and grave shuffle effects, exiles, your board getting over run? i take it you're just playing kitchen top magic atm?</br>  <br> fagani <br><br>Fucking undecided bitch, doesn't know if he wants to be white, or red/white or green/white, it is like the whore of planeswalkers.</br></br></br>  <br>I know yugioh level counters, have you heard of our lord and saviour Thromok the insatiable<br>Devour x is one helluva thing</br></br>  <br>Here's how he should do it.<br> Mill self entirely <br> Get all the Narcomeba's out there <br> Dread Return targeting Angel of Glory's Rise <br> Get back Lab Maniac <br> Do anything that makes you draw </br></br></br></br></br></br>  I'm playing R/B/W creature control/sacrifice/burn/direct damage  <br><br>I loved lorwyn block.</br></br>  <br> kithkin ugly as fuck <br> fairie ugly as fuck <br> i love ugly as fuck creatures: the block! <br> mfw </br></br></br></br>  <br>Colors:<br>Blue&gt;Red&gt;Black&gt;Green&gt;Artifact&gt;White<wbr><br><br>Building:<br>Pauper infect.<br>Built:<br>Pauper Mono U Delver, Pauper reanimator<br><br>Looking for:<br>Legion loyalist and some goblins to make a goblin modern deck.

I have participated only in one event so far I did a booster draft. events are rare where I live. playing legacy and EDH with friend is easier and more fun</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Esper is the only colours that exist, play mostly EDH nowadays with Sydri, Galvanic Genius combo, Sen Triplets Artifacts and Bruna, light of Alabaster Voltron which I'm building currently  Hey /b/, 69/72/27 names my new wow character  Elayne  Hitler  Akasha  26 really fuck  <br>ImATrap</br>  Arcimboldo  <br>thisgameisass</br>  krdjhnrikjnds  4chin  lil_star  <br>Bluegreenish Earstranger Thunderboobs<br>Also Quarian leg plagiarism</br></br>  <br>Hitler would've been taken anyway I think</br>  The Game.

Your brother is a very cool guy. When we play this game, people usually don't follow through but he went all the way. We spent over half an hour fapping to the thought of you and your brother getting it on. As freakish as this sounds, it's because we like you both. You posted his information and that was pretty cool of you. I'm guessing you're not too different from him. I'd like to think that maybe you'd hang out here from time to time and not take it all so seriously. <br><br>Sincerely, some random faggot anon on the internet.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We got dub, op delivar pls</br>  Kinda weird that she would post that.
