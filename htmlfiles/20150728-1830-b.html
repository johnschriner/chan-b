Which means that the entire visible universe was at one point at said central point.<br><br>It's a much more reasonable interpretation of observable evidence than, "God dunnit."</br></br></br></br>   mfw a catholic invented the big bang theory   Just as ridiculous as an invisible man in the sky creating everything out of nothing  <br>Nice bait kid, try harder next time</br>  Fuck OP, I'll show this instead  <br><br>I'm only christian because it is the easiest way to get into child prostitution rings.</br></br>  <br> mfw people are retarded enough to not realize the difference between Theism and Deism. <br><br>Atheist Taoist here, kill yourself.</br></br></br>  <br>Thinking god is a giant invisible man in the sky, and still imagining yourself as an intellectual. You're just as ignorant about the concept of god as every bible thumping backwoods retard.</br>  <br>Enlighten me then, you bible thumping backwoods retard.</br>  <br>Yes yes god the spirit and all that jazz but really the whole religion is ridiculous</br>  <br>another dumbass argument with bogus premise.<br>But bonus points for not using cheesy picture.</br></br>  can i slap your face so i can prove i made a future question?  Yep  Christians actually believe there was a guy before there was anything and that guy created everything  <br>yeah..come on...like...come on guys..really? but but the science and what abut the STEMs? we dont know the math for it so it never happened. mm...k.ay</br>  <br>If we really all came from Adam and eve we'd all be some inbred retards</br>  <br> Theists literally believe there was absolutely nothing, not even empty space, and then in a few billionths of a second all the mass and energy in the universe just suddenly appeared out of nowhere.  <br> It's so ridiculous when you sit down and think it through. </br></br>  <br>The guy may actually have created time during this. <br>[spoiler] do you know that are theories that says that time was created along with the big bang?

I do feel dirty living here, though.</br>  <br>How was the Stampede?<br>Couldn't go this year, too busy masturbating/working.</br></br>  <br>nb reporting in</br>  <br>Penticton BC reporting in</br>  <br>Qc here</br>  <br>This.<br><br>Why is Ottawa our capital, again? Because of the pretty river? I would vote Toronto or Vancouver.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes it does, there's quite a few countries who's capital city isn't the main one. Australia being the prime example.</br>  <br>Man believe it or not but it happens, i get my fill of sea roaches while mainlanders pay top dollar for soggy month old meat. <br> ive got 3 in my freezer right now lol. </br></br>  250 Trail. Anyone??? lol  <br>Jealous as fuck, you newfie.</br>  <br>you're fucked in the head<br><br>416 doomztown: it's lit</br></br></br>  <br>scam milk</br>  <br>because york was too close to america and the americans came and burned it so they moved it to ottawa</br>  <br>Is this some gangstalking shit?</br>  <br>Calgary, more like Edmonton</br>  <br>Yeah, those are places that can legitimately be called Canada's centre.<br><br>Australia is one. Another that comes to mind is Washington. Any others?<br><br>oh no we can get live lobster, it just costs an arm and a leg per kg compared to frozen.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If it doesn't sound familiar then you aren't in on it. People making me out to be a more interesting person than I am. Not a big deal, really. Just curious.</br>  <br>Sounds like a laugh if true. Its bothering you, though?</br>  <br>Yeah, but not tinfoil hat style. GPS on car. Badmouthing me on forums. Etc.</br>  <br>You're still not making any sense</br>  <br>you don't seem properly socialized; did you grow up in parkdale or something?</br>  <br>That's pretty much tinfoil hat, m80</br>  <br>reporting in from the most easterly part of Canada</br>  <br>I'm both sane and rational. We've simply had different experiences.</br>  NOVA SCOTIA BUD  <br>Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon?</br>  <br><br>Oh shit nigger, you better not let me catch you surfing on /b/</br></br>  <br>Hahaha new brunswicker to be exact, newfies are a class all on their own. <br>Also ive workerd at lobster processing plants for a little while and youd be suprised how big those fuckers can get. <br>Once had to break a claw with both my hands on the edge of a steel table, it was about half a foot wide.</br></br></br>  <br>Not really. I'd rather have a lot of friends but not friends who are disloyal to me, so it's a trade-off. After twenty years it's a way of life. Change what you can and accept what you cannot.</br>  canada will never have cool wireless providers  <br>You're funny. The landmass above, that stretches to the east more.</br>  <br>Words to live by, brother. If that shit really is happening to you, I'd say it'll have made your life a bit more interesting than the rest of ours. So enjoy the ride.</br>  <br>plz don't rub it in</br>  anyone wanna trade places with me? edmonton is a fucking shithole.  <br>How cold does it get there in the winter?</br>  <br>Kek, my bad.

During a normal winter you have to plug your car into your house to keep it from freezing.</br></br></br>  <br>that's a california judge: loli legal</br>  <br><br>come at me bro</br></br>  <br>i guess so. at least downtown is going to be better but it still sucks here.<br><br>only thing about edmonton i like right now is that the oilers got mcdavid.</br></br></br>  <br>i fucking love asians</br>  <br>because they are brown</br>  416 In dis shit  <br>-20, around there sometimes more, sometimes less. Our summer this year have been around 5-15c with occasional 27c weather</br>  <br>we use block heaters here in the winter too. -30 to -40 degree weather turns you into a raging alcoholic.</br>  A reminder of that storm we had last winter. <br> *shudders* </br>  <br><br>306 not Regina</br></br>  <br>DO YOU RUN THROUGH THE 6 WITH YOUR WOES?</br>  <br>People hate Toronto because so many entitled assholes come from there. Not saying you are, just that that's usually what your province produces.</br>  <br>Sheesh, I bet. I'm thankful for the shitty humid/rain weather of Toronto. Only our January's get around -30.</br>  <br>aw ye look at that Quebec is legal</br>  <br>Northern eurofag here. Winnipeg is tropical paradise compared to this.</br>  <br>show the niggers in millhaven that neat infographic when they are sodomizing you with a broomstick</br>  <br>He better or he's a traitor to this country</br>  <br>is that macs by kwantlen park?</br>  any wins of morgan?  <br>yeah, i don't know why toronto gets a bad rep. edmonton is horse shit compared to your city.<br><br>in the winter it's dark until 10 am and turns dark again around 4. depressing.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, while we edmontonians have poles in our parking lots specifically for plugging cars in<br><br>Ehhh I don't think the arena is gonna bring as much to the table as everyone thinks. Don't get me wrong, having a replacement for Rexall is gonna be great, but it doesn't bring anything of note to the surrounding area, so it's a bit out there to suppose the downtown arena will.</br></br></br>  <br>because thats where the parliament building is? use your head ya hoser</br>  <br>I call bullshit. But I could be wrong.<br><br>Where exactly you at, eurofriend?</br></br></br>  <br>Here's a wreck beach photo for the attempt it looks like garbage anon fuck</br>  <br>bitch look like she got jaundice get her some immunoglobulin</br>  <br>jokes on you. I love getting fucked in the ass</br>  <br>Lapland. Here winters are sometimes -35c.</br>  <br>Bonus points faggot</br>  <br>well played.</br>  <br>Yeah, but you lot have the benefit of being old world european and shit, dense cities made of sturdy material.</br>  <br>no fuckin clue, thats some dirty ass Surrey shit though eh</br>  <br>Northern Finland? That's pretty friggin cold, bud. Although I've gotten that kind of temperature before here in Toronto. I'd say Winnipeg and you guys are about on par for cold-ass winters.</br>  <br>Canada and northern europe both has their own good and bad sides. It's just what kind of environment pleases you the most.</br>  <br>Capitals can be moved, they often are. Moscow may not have been made the capital of Russia because it was better than St. Petersburg, but it was and still is better than St. Petersburg.</br>  <br>yeah it's bs... but it's here and i'll deal with it just because we're going to be on the hook for some of it because rich katz needs us taxpayers to cover some of the costs.<br><br>honestly besides some casinos, drinking, and maybe catching stds, it sucks here. wish they didn't focus all on downtown and maybe do something in the surrounding area.<br><br>i used to think edmonton was the best place ever until i went to other cities and realized we're an insecure group of people.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>aw, you know how it is, we all like to bitch about where we come from<br>We'll all settle down in a few years, for now just let us have our griping</br></br>  <br>You can tell these are not professional thugs because the gang signs they be throwing up are all fucked up like they doing sign language at Nealson Mandela's funeral. <br><br>I just got a Hello Kitty cake in my captcha =^.^=</br></br></br>  <br>Heyyy Penticton&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Naramata reprting here. wanna meet up?</br>  <br>Lapland is area that covers northern Finland, Sweden and Norway. Winters, perhaps they're equal indeed, but I checked Winnipeg's temperature and there are +10c warmer then here right now.<br><br>Then again this is unusually cold summer.</br></br></br>  <br>It's actually ingenious he uses a city cone to claim a parking spot and blends in with his own garbage so ppl have no idea he's sleeping there ... <br><br>Nobody messes with traffic cones</br></br></br>  <br>I think I know this semen demon</br>  <br>it's unusually hot in western canada right now. droughts and wildfire everywhere on a bigger scale than we're used to seeing.</br>  <br>that's a weird way of spelling only one stanley cup</br>  <br>My old school as well. Currently an islandfag in Campbell River.</br>  <br>I think it's best that they stick with the downtown and increase access to it, rather than make it exclusive domain of people rich enough to park there or live there. The problem on working on the surrounding area is that north american cities just develop too thinly, we'd be left with islands of good areas all 20 min + traffic apart. Other cities have it set up so that you can get piss drunk in the cool part of town and get back home without paying 80 dollars for a cab.</br>  <br>Yeah man, smoke from the fires out in the midwest has made its way all across right to Toronto, where it looks like smog.</br>  TURFWARS 2<br>Same rules apply. <br>Turf wars.<br>Dubs decides what happens.<br>War can begin once both teams have a name, dubs decides. <br>Both currently have a population of 10/30.<br>Trips+ doubles your population cap.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Phil Collins isn't a nigger any more  <br>Please</br>  this was trips from before<br><br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;630922444 </br></br>  <br>Exodia's left leg tries to kill Phil</br>  All the communists in the world support the reds by ship them Kalishnkovs and RPGs  <br>roll</br>  <br>MOria nukes map.<br><br>She survives nuke, and becomes a ghoul.
