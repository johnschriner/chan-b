Humanity has rejected me. The females of the human species have never wanted to mate with me, so how could I possibly consider myself part of humanity? Humanity has never accepted me among them, and now I know why. I am more than human. I am superior to them all. I am Elliot Rodger... Magnificent, glorious, supreme, eminent... Divine! I am the closest thing there is to a living god. Humanity is a disgusting, depraved, and evil species. It is my purpose to punish them all. I will purify the world of everything that is wrong with it. On the Day of Retribution, I will truly be a powerful god, punishing everyone I deem to be impure and depraved.  <br>Goddammit anon.</br>  a door<br>a floor<br>a store<br>a boar<br>a clarinet</br></br></br></br>  Lighter fluid, a rubber band, nail clippers, gushers, &amp; hair.  <br>a coaster <br>a guitar pick<br>a zip<br>a coat hanger<br>a lightswitch<br>#420can'tblazeit</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>fag.</br>  <br>Fans<br>Sunflower seeds<br>Bow and Arrow<br>Jackie Chan.... <br>DAMN IT!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ayyy lmao</br>  <br>You can use microwave as well.

He was picked because he had mathematics and mechanical engineering background. Get a part time job or internship related to the job you want.

I'll probably work during the summer, but I don't know if I'll have time after. I could still do both, of course, but it'll probably take several more years to get my diploma, and I don't even know if I have the willpower to do that.</br></br>  <br>Thanks.</br>  <br>Thank's anon I feel a little better</br>  <br>The only girl I ever loved died 2 weeks ago. I'm finding it very hard to continue with my life considering she was the only real happiness in my life, and I was hers.</br>  this thread warms my heart  <br>what kind of work is it, anon?<br><br><br>I'm actually in a similar situation. I'm going to have to delay graduation because I have to work full time, it's not ideal, but I need to live.in your case if money isn't an issues I'd look for internships like that other anon mentioned.<br><br><br>that makes me glad. hang in there</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Pic related. Do wat? Can't move to Sweden because it's now 20 percent sand niggers. Nowhere left to do because niggers have invaded every White place on earth.  <br>I cant stop fapping to lolis.</br>  Well I'm having some really shit cluster migraines and I can't seem to get rid of them.  I actually have no problems whatsoever<br><br>I'm trying to come up with something but I can't<br><br>Life is good</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah...yeah, you're right. I was hired over people who had far more experience in my field. There's a long list of other things that should make me proud, but I feel better now.<br><br>Thank you. You're a good dude/chick.</br></br></br></br>  I want to quit my job because it's 5 yards away from where my best friend died and I can't stop thinking about killing myself every night I'm there. I work graveyard shift at a gas station.  <br> I'd look for internships like that other anon mentioned. <br>Yeah, the job I got offered was programming, so I'll probably go do that.</br></br>  <br> I have slow healing finger tendonitis and have to game with an uncomfortable hand set up until it fully heals. <br><br> I'm training up to do a BS hard tandom obstacle course with friends and I'm the unfit one of the group and my progress is going slower than expected <br><br> Same friends and I want to play inhuman amounts of competitive to get our first ranks in CS:GO but that faggy system tells us to fuck off almost every win to do Garrus tier "calibrations" for 21 hours </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why can't I just go out and be social. I've done it so many times, and I feel awful when I'm alone, but I still can't get myself to just go out and hang with friends. I can ask my friends in 2 seconds if he wants to meet. Why won't I do it?</br>  <br>I'm so very sorry to hear that. the only thing I can know for sure is that she'd want you to live on. she wouldn't want you to give up on life.you need to keep going on, for her sake.<br><br><br>and you warm mine &lt;3<br><br><br>is that really bothering you?<br><br><br>for how long? have you visited a doctor?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    Graduated 2015 and everyone drifted off too fast.<br><br>The only friends I have now are on Steam (some I know in real life). <br>Other than that, my parents want the best for me: College, good job hookups, wife -- and I don't want it, I just want to NEET.<br><br>NEET life is neat life.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I know that feel friend.</br>   work in store <br> great with customers <br> get compliments everyday <br> boss praises me for my GOOD SERVICE SKILLS <br> all coworkers like me <br> or not <br> single <br> no friends <br> sit inside when not at work </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>aw, thanks! good luck, anon.<br><br><br>and you too, good luck!<br><br>I'm really sorry to everyone else, I have to get going now! It was nice chatting with you all</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah visit a doctor bro. My ex died of a blood clot in her brain bc she thought it was a migraine and the doctors didn't catch it in time.</br></br>  <br>Calibrations you say?</br>  <br><br>Also, if you can, try to get into supervisory/management positions. It's harder, but hiring managers love to see that shit. It's a good work around if you can't dive directly into an internship/job that relates to your field of study. I used to run a factory operation and was promoted to trainer. When I sought another job, they hired me based on that since I had no experience working in the new job's field. <br><br>People who can be in charge are hard to come by, so cultivating that talent makes you very attractive for other/better jobs.</br></br></br></br>  I'm edgy  <br><br>Yes.<br>I feel sick everytime after I do it<br>But I cant stop either it feels so good and gets me off so fast</br></br></br></br>  <br>I bet on Cloud 9.</br>  <br>Seriously guys I'm only 19 and I feel like I've reached the peak of my existence. I'd rather blow my brains out than go on living. What should I do?</br>  <br>Well, <br> all this LGBTQAAOFWGKTADAF shit has me worried that we really are being distracted from something...big...like TPP and Jade Helm <br> number of friends rapidly declining <br> family not really talking to me anymore <br> fear of post-Uni future <br> a bit constipated <br> haven't had a gf in 10 years, and it's tearing away at me <br> I miss the country I lived in before I started school here <br> a bit broke; jobs are kinda scarce for some reason here <br> mid-term Wednesday on International Politics <br> skilled in Japanese, but want to re-learn Korean, but can't find the time since the JLPT is coming up <br> want to go on a trip, but no cash <br>But, I"m trying to stay optimistic</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I hate feeling alone yet, I probably deserve to be alone</br>  <br> fell in love with best friend of 2 years <br> she didn't <br> okay.jpg <br> had no contact for 3 months <br> distracted me with work and working out <br> met again, everything was fine again <br> much fun, much physical contact <br> she later excused for that <br> feel I'm not over her yet <br> ended friendship one week later <br>feelsbadman.png</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>k, thanks for the advice.</br>  <br>I've been to a lot of doctors, yeah. Neurologists, orthopedists, migraine specialists, you name it.<br>Just take a lot of pills and sometimes do coke if it's really unbearable.</br></br>  <br>Wait dont go... please</br>  I need more anime faces in my life op  <br>When I found out a family friend's new boyfriend pulled a Kurt Cobain two days after I met him I couldn't stop laughing. I was genuinely glad to hear it.<br>He seemed like an asshole.<br>I fucking laughed about a guy blowing his brains out in front of my family.<br>I'm the real asshole.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>This was me exactly when I was 25 (28 now)<br><br>As fucking stupid as it sounds, getting in to D&amp;D is what improved my social life. Got an inkling to play one day and mentioned it to a co-worker, who immediately volunteered to host a game for me. That started a landslide as we invited other co-workers/classmates to play. I felt super embarrassed leading up to it because I always associated being a loser with D&amp;D even though I've always secretly wanted to play. We ended up having a blast and became quite close. Been hanging ever since, started more games to meet new people, more social than I've ever been before.<br><br>I guess stepping outside your comfort zone and having hobbies that require engagement with other people is what did the trick.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Abandoned even on 4chan.</br>  <br><br>I poured my heart and soul into my Maths grades since they've been rather low and this last exam I barely passed. This Semester I passed with a C and I feel I need to do better, but, no matter what I try I can't seem to get any higher. What should I do?</br></br>  <br>I can relate to that not many people want to create relationships of any sort after work.</br>  <br> I can't seem to get any higher <br> get any higher <br> higher <br>420 blaze it nigaaa</br></br></br></br>  <br/>  <br><br>Private tutoring? One in one with your teacher?<br><br>I understand your frustration. It's the teacher's job to teach concepts in different ways to help you understand, so try talking to him or her to go over concepts again.<br><br>Also figure out what type of learner you are. Visual (charts, graphs), auditory (listening), tactile (physically handling objects) ? Playing to your specific learning style helps immensely.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sheetmetal</br>  Got an internship recently, all through nepotism, and I'm not fit for it at all.<br>I can't quit cause then I'd probably be disowned.<br>I can't fuck up the job either cause the guy who got me the job would get ostracized.<br>Only reason I even applied for it was so my dad wouldn't throw a hissy fit about me not giving a shit about my life.<br>On top of that, I don't know what I want in life. I'm doing a degree that I enjoy, so far anyways, I'm at a good uni, I'm doing well in my classes. I just don't know what I want in life.<br>I kinda want to run away. Any advice on how to do that? I've got about two grand saved up and I'll be paid a decent bit from that internship until I get fired.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Have you tried not doing coke? You're probably addicted.</br>  <br>My plan is to simply leave the country when I finish Uni. I intend to live and work elsewhere, and NEVER come back here unless I absolutely have to. I have an internship that I enjoy, but since there have been so many new interns during the summer, I've been kind of on hiatus. <br><br>My advice? Just run. See where else you can use your skills, plan everything out, and just go.</br></br></br>  <br>gonna go bowling with some workmates as a work thing tomorrow, but i dont know.. it just doesnt feel genuine and nothing will change</br>  <br>yeah i know i tried asking a few if they wanted to hang out but they all said they were busy etc</br>  <br>:(</br>  <br>I'm not addicted to coke, but what has that to do with my migraines, Anon?</br>  <br>Ok<br>Whats the sauce?</br></br>  I believe that consenting adults have the right to marry the person they love. It's not constitutional to treat gays as second-class citizens and not extend full marriage rights to them.<br><br>That said, homosexuality is unnatural and disgusting and being gay/lesbian/trans/anything besides straight male or female is a mental disorder. Nature intended for males and females to be attracted to each other to keep the species going, two males or two females goes against nature.</br></br>  <br>Lurking in agreement</br>  <br><br>I believe that b8 thread should be recycled continually by the same copypasta trolls until the end of time so that the copypasta troll can argue with himself back and forth, posing as different people, spewing out his carefully articulated garbage while drawing in people coming and going into a web of noisome bollocks<br><br>(and boring everyone's tits off)</br></br></br></br>  <br>this</br>  <br><br>Nature has many different forms. Fish, for example, spray their sperm on clutches of eggs then fuck off to the next clutch.<br><br>Humans are social creatures and our primary means of ensuring reproduction during our primitive years was by forming tribes and forging close, personal connections to the people within the tribe. Bisexuality came about as a means of both solving disputes and of bringing the tribe closer together as a whole. Our closest animal relatives often engage in homosexual relations, as do a myriad of other social animals.<br><br>Arguing that homosexuality is unnatural just shows that you don't know what you're talking about.<br><br>It's fine to be disgusted with homosexuality. That's your prerogative, but at least rationalise it with some legitimate reasons.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>don't lump us trans people into this shit</br>  I believe that b8 thread should be recycled continually by the same copypasta trolls until the end of time so that the copypasta troll can argue with himself back and forth, posing as different people, spewing out his carefully articulated garbage while drawing in people coming and going into a web of noisome bollocks<br><br>(and boring everyone's tits off).</br></br>  I believe that b8 thread should be recycled continually by the same copypasta trolls until the end of time so that the copypasta troll can argue with himself back and forth, posing as different people, spewing out his carefully articulated garbage while drawing in people coming and going into a web of noisome bollocks<br><br>(and boring everyone's tits off)..</br></br>  I believe that b8 thread should be recycled continually by the same copypasta trolls until the end of time so that the copypasta troll can argue with himself back and forth, posing as different people, spewing out his carefully articulated garbage while drawing in people coming and going into a web of noisome bollocks<br><br>(and boring everyone's tits off)...</br></br>  I believe that b8 thread should be recycled continually by the same copypasta trolls until the end of time so that the copypasta troll can argue with himself back and forth, posing as different people, spewing out his carefully articulated garbage while drawing in people coming and going into a web of noisome bollocks<br><br>(and boring everyone's tits off).....</br></br>  Gonna hi-jack this thread saying that theism is a mental disorder that people /choose/ to force on their own children, their own genes, their own flesh and blood.  I saw a gif that showed per state the legality of gay marriage. It showed that there could be a constitutional ban and/or statutory ban. Whats the difference and does this mean every state has a constitution? I thought only the entire USA as a whole had a constitution.
