No really do you understand?<br><br>Women are children, they need to be told what to do. stop thinking about why women do what they do it has no reason it's just whatever seems fun to them or "feels" good at the time.<br><br>Would you ask a bunch of 11 year olds to decide what to do with your family finances? Where to go on vacation? What car to buy? What in investments to make?<br><br>Do you sit around asking why 8 year olds are fucking stupid? no they just are and you except that<br><br>All of human history we've known this stop pretending like we forgot.<br><br>Women are at best a responsible teenager.<br><br>So quit wondering why they are and start acting like men. We are asking teenage girls how to act as men...no wonder it isnt working.<br><br>What we need to do is start being men again. Women don't know it but they are literally crying out for a real man to come in and end her shit tantrum <br><br>Be a man, let women be women and the problem will right itself</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Wow something nice on /b/<br><br>The world is gonna end pretty soon IG</br></br>  <br>Why is my post dubs?</br>  <br>This. Right now men, especially white men, are listening to women's bitching more than ever in all of history, and actually doing what they ask, thus turning ourselves into little pussies. This is what they ask for, this is what they say they want, but they really don't. When you end up a mangina, you're no longer really a man, and are no longer attractive to women, even though you were just doing "as they asked". Then they go fuck tyrone because tyrone doesnt give no shit 'bout no ho.</br>  Women a program to find the man who offers the most security. So don't jump from guy to guy until we find one. It's really all about money. It's very similar to the way that men are programmed to have sex with as many women as they can.    <br>/thread<br> this is the truth </br></br>  Spatial awareness, for fucks sake.<br>I swear to god women don't possess a field of view wider than 10 degrees.</br>  /r/mensrights is leaking  <br> /r/mensrights <br><br><br> &gt;/r/reddit you fucking summerfag </br></br></br></br>  Here, here, here we go So they're finally here performing for you, If you know the words you can join in too.

Oh yeah</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Spot on.<br><br>All women are insecure, unsure of themselves, and slaves to their emotions. They can't tell you what they want because they don't know what they want.<br><br>Children is a perfect analogy. They want a Daddy. Someone who will tell them what to do so they don't have to make their own decisions, and to make them feel safe and loved.<br><br>They don't need a partner. They don't want some faggot in skinny jeans with gauged ears to talk about the latest episode of whatever insipid shit they watch on TV.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>whatever feels good and does good for them they will do at whatever expense without a second thought, they have no real retention</br>  <br> Women don't know it but they are literally crying out for a real man to come in and end her shit tantrum <br>This is the essence of the entire feminist movement. They are begging for a strong-handed male to bitchslap them back into the kitchen, then tie them up and fuck them senseles.</br></br>  <br> where do you want to go <br><br>i dont know<br><br> what do you want to eat <br><br>you pick<br><br> what day works best for you <br><br>*crickets<br><br>its obvious when you realize they refuse to make decisions or be responsible for anything.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>right on anon. all they want is suck cock until they are in their late twenties - early thirties and look for a guy to "settle down with". then they become frigid moms and divorce the man</br>  <br>What the fuck is she even doing here?

Fedora tipping into the mirror.  <br>this is true. However relationships are an important part of life. I know plenty of independent women. Sure they are driven by their emotions and pretty crazy at times, but there is a place for them in society besides bearing children. Now that we are out of the stone age its not just about brute strength anymore.</br>  <br>I'm not disagreeing with you. Im just pointing out the clear saltiness in OPs post. I'd be willing to bet a lot of money that OP is not currently getting laid.</br>  Is this why I hate women?<br>Because they act like fucking children and give me nothing?<br>Shit... fuck this world. Fuck that my brain is set to desire women.<br> 2015 <br> still not able to feel attracted to men <br>fml</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm 26 and never had a relationship with anyone.<br>Are you telling me I'm dead?</br></br>  <br>so they bear children, then divorce the man, raise the kids as a single mom, then go back to their career while they still get alimony <br><br>seriously, all these women are looking for some beta faggot to marry, knock them up, then run off with the kids and the money because they are so "independent "</br></br></br>  <br>Op here im salty at idiot s asking the same fucking questions about women.<br><br>Personally I get laid plenty.<br><br> fucked my FWB last night even though she was on her period <br> used a condom <br> its not even that much blood. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>good for you, women aren't worth long term relationships. I blame their obsession with chick flicks and drama</br>  <br>perhaps<br><br>Ehh that doesnt happen too often. I do agree that custody and alimony laws are kinda fucked up though.<br><br>sure pal</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, OP. You are wrong. They are not like children. <br>They are like dogs.</br></br>  <br>Bravo</br>  <br>would you have a kid these days? divorce rate is 60%<br><br>50% in the first 3 years alone too. because of the pressure of her having a kid. That's the moment she stops loving her husband</br></br></br>  <br>All of this is true, op. There's no use in bitching about it. Attain success and watch gleefully as faggot manginas around you become defeated, miserable, beaten down dogs.</br>  <br><br>NO. dogs are bros</br></br>  <br>more like cats really, dogs are nice</br>  <br>how old are you, 12? did your teacher hurt you?</br>  <br> perhaps <br>Nah. I'm pretty much alive. I have no debt, no job, and I play video games all day. My life is perfect.<br><br> mfw all those strong independant womyn who hate white, cis men for having power positions are actually bread'ing me while I do literally nothing good for society, and whenever someone calls me a leech all I need to say is that I wouldn't want to take the job from a strong independant womyn and that I'm sorry for being a white male and I've now retreated as to not offend any one </br></br></br></br>  <br>Stoop down to their level on dates only. Play on these dumb cunts emotions and flawed mentality filled insecurities and you will get pussy like there is no tomorrow. Never see them as people, just human toilets.<br><br>Also, listen to Tom Leykis.</br></br></br>  <br>GOOD dogs are bros.</br>  <br>25<br><br>and no <br><br>18 years old 26 year old English teacher flashed me her white lace panties on the last day of senior year.<br><br>Since that day i have wondered if it was intentional.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  today I witnessed a hambeast dominating a mangina on the street. she made him carry her purse, slapped him, talked down on him etc. It was awkward as fuck and I tried to make eyecontact with him and nod "no", but he looked down the whole time like a broken shell of a human being  How many of you autistic fucks have actually dealt with a feminist cunt? Other than being emotionally dependent and ridiculous no girl ever tries to stand up to me.  <br>any single mom qualifies as a feminist cunt to me</br>  <br>If you just sort of stand firm to their nonsense they shut up real quick</br>  <br>Ya if they think they fit a fatherly figure than fuck em</br>  <br>You kidding? They're some of the easiest whores out there. Single mom's have always been the easiest pussy in my experience. They're usually much dumber than your average cunt too.</br>  <br>They also threw out their men somehow.</br>  <br>for real. a boy can only be taught how to be a man by a man. and daughters are maybe even worse because they will learn you can raise a kid on your own<br><br><br>because they're desperate for that rebound?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I dont understand how single mothers fail so miserably but single father seem to raise decent kids.</br>  <br>Nope. The dudes usually leave on their own. Either way, I don't give a fuck. I'm just there to release my load into a condom using any of their fuck holes. Bitches are lower than dogshit in my eyes. I never fall for their bullshit.</br>  <br>I don't give a fuck. Good pussy is good pussy.</br>  <br>Because they're inferior.</br>  that being said, don't forget that a small percentage of women are vastly superior then the majority and sough after accordingly. It's just like the job market. The losers of society will get stuck with dregs of the opposite sex because nobody else will open their lives to them. I've seen so many beta man cater towards women with shit genetics and it's cringworthy. Men are slaves to their sexuality. <br><br>Don't delude yourself into thinking you're some sort of intellectual because it took you 25 years to make some obvious observation that doesn't change anything about your pathetic lives except maybe sleeping a little easier at night. <br><br>Your insecurities is pouring out of your post.</br></br></br></br>  <br>children cant raise children</br>  <br>Why are you so emotionally dead?<br>Jesus once said<br> "Truly, I say to you, unless you turn and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."<br>You're emotionally dead inside and you're fucking jealous that you sold your innocence to "reality" and you take it out on anyone who hasn't sold their soul to the machine.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I had that game</br>  <br>Date older when young, date younger when old, faggot.<br><br>Only an idiot would want to have the same vagina for the rest of their lives.<br><br>Also, check the stats. Marriage and having kids is becoming obsolete for most American millenials. We've wised the fuck up.</br></br></br></br></br>  well shit better rethink my life  <br>Yeah, but Jesus was a kike, and you can't trust those bastards.</br>  <br>you better not knock anyone up bud</br>  <br>Im posting because too many fags on this website ask obvious questions about why women act like women<br><br>they havent had a man to tell them whats what,<br><br><br>Im not, if anything I feel more alive than ever once I accepted this simple truth.<br><br>Men&gt;Women&gt;Children</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>how women think:<br>children &gt; woman &gt; man<br><br>how men think:<br>woman &gt; children &gt; man<br><br>either way, nice guys finish last</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just a bimbo for the betas</br>  <br>nice trips<br><br>There is no place for nice guys<br><br>Women want a winner, nice guys dont win in real life.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> what every butthurt feminist/mangina says when they lose the argument </br></br>  all women are cheaters and whores.  <br>she swears she never take a selfie like this. I find these in her notebook.</br>  all women are natural liers  <br> is becoming obsolete for most American millenials. We've wised the fuck up. <br><br>kek, nothing wise here</br></br></br>  <br> men are wrong for being sex obssesd/objectifying <br><br> disagree with me and your a faggot virgin who cant get laid <br><br>the amount of projection form feminists is bordering surreal<br><br>Feminists like liberals are what they claim everyone else is Greedy, insecure, racist, biggots</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  And in general, American women are the worst transgressors of this shit. Seriously, gentlemen, if you have to wed, wed a foreigner.<br><br> WORDSOFWISDOMLLOYDWORDSOFWISDOM </br></br>  <br>See...the problem with what you said is well..lts just not true. I have bought and sold only what I wanted to. What I want is someone who will stick around. Thats more than enough of a dream for me because ill bet you 100$ most of us will never find them and we know it as we sit here every night like this.</br>  <br>its shit because the kid doesn't have a dad to either:<br> teach son to be man <br> scare daughter's BF <br><br>Most if not all of you are being full blown autistic.<br><br>It's because you devalue traditional family values that they start to loose their meaning, while the world around you starts to degenerate into filth and shit with a fuckton of unhappy people. When you make good money, you start getting bored with your life. You want a wife and kids, because once you get old you will have no one else around and you will have lived for nothing. Your life will be basically nothing, because all you amounted to to other people is sex or maybe a friendship here and there.<br><br>TL:DR L2 life as an adult, faggots.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>HE</br>  <br>nah, I'd just stop searching in the trashbin. There are good women here, you just meet shitty people.</br>  <br>You have to bullshit and simply say he's wrong instead of realizing the simple truth, your life is fucked up because you don't know how to be a man.<br><br>Being a man isn't about accepting some arbitrary reality. It's about creating the best possible reality you can. It's about making your reality better.</br></br></br>  <br>Great bait. Elaborate cuck.</br>  <br>or maybe women change into shitty people once you let them walk all over you</br>  <br>But what truly matters is that you had an awesome time. Unlike married fags who are mostly miserable fucks.<br><br>Life is pointless anyways, everyone is forgotten with time. Might as well have as much fun as possible while you're here.</br></br></br>  <br>Give it time.</br>  <br>Accept* not except</br>  <br>this. everyone knows having a kid means the end of your life. even in an age of rationality and contraception women still have the instinct to breed, and breed they will. "because they always wanted to be a mother". there's no better way to destroy an otherwise perfect relationship<br><br>seriously, I know many married men. and I'm not jealous of any single one of them</br></br></br>   In and out of relationship with same girl for 2 years now <br> Be 18 <br> Can confirm OP <br>She lies, does legit whatever the fuck she wants because she wants to, never takes what i say into consideration, I bitch her out and give her serious talks but doesn't do anything. women are children and because of the way she acts, I treat her like one and have to set rules for her since shes not mature enough to realize what not to do in a relationship. Its honestly embarrassing and feels like baby sitting more than dating smh. I love her too much to leave her again and put waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayy too much effort into making her a better person and fear what she might do when shes single.<br><br>What do i do /b/ros?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>never knock her up, never get married<br><br>that's all you need to do</br></br></br>  <br>also just date more mature girls. dump this child. never accept bullshit either, have some pride dammit</br>  <br>Well thats a given<br>but what can i do to straighten her up and make a woman out of her</br></br>  MFW op is just frustrated  <br>can't rush those things bro. I'd say suck it up and fuck her until either she grows up or you can't take it no more<br><br>dumping her might make her less naive tho, so you'd be doing her a favor really</br></br></br>  <br>there's some good points tho, even if it's satire</br>  Is having sex honestly worth it? I'm a kissless virgin at 18. No game, never had a girlfriend except one... for 2 weeks, eighth grade.<br><br>I mean there's one girl that likes me right now, but thanks to having no car or game I have little hope. I can masturbate at any time, and do so daily. <br><br>I find going to work and making money is better than 5-15 minutes of fun. Hell, even though coke is over rated it lasts longer than sex. Oxy lasts a couple hours. Weed is fairly cheap and lasts a long while.<br><br>Sex requires so much effort, time, money, all that I don't have. Is it that worth it? Be honest. And love is fucking gay so don't tell me anything of that</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Yes it's great  <br><br>love isnt fucking gay you imbecile. Youre right, sex itseflt is not that great and I`d rather masturbate anytime then go im a club and break my ass in four to try to get a girl. But making love to a girl, you haven`t truly lived until you experience that. Trust me</br></br>  Yeah, sex is pretty awesome.  <br><br>If you can get it cheap enough, yes.<br><br>Most of the time, not worth the money.</br></br></br></br>  <br> love is fucking gay <br> kissless virgin at 18 <br>Definitely not lying there</br></br></br>  <br>Ooh love is just soo great man you get heartbroken for fucking weeks not caring about life. Then you realize you wasted so much time when you could've had lots of sex, money, time, not when you're in gay ass love</br>  <br>Let it come to you. It's worth it, but too much effort to put yourself out there. If you don't try to get laid now, you will in a couple of years. If you do try to get laid now you can probably lose your v-card in a year. But again, its a matter of if you want it that bad or not. And if not, no its' not worth it. Its' awkward and most people can match the standard that porn will give you.</br>  Who vapes here?

I live across the street from your run of the mill typical suburb irish pub. Every fri/sat night without fail there are a group of 2-3 cougars/milfs that come in that just want to let off some steam or they have a night out without the kids whatever. The whole key is figuring out which one will fuck around on their husband or is recently divorced etc and separating them from their friends in some capacity. Once you do this a couple of times and it gets around you can fuck and keep your mouth shut about it, they start finding out and seeking you out. All winter I literally fucked a diff milf every other weekend. They're the best, zero hangups or expectations. Find your neighborhood upscale irish pub in the burbs and these girls are a dime a dozen.</br>      <br>See her everywhere, who is she?</br>  <br><br>Hot!

Heh, no. I actually started college in another country before transferring here to the U.S. Certainly, there were no parties there, and I don't go to them here (not that I'm invited anyway). <br><br>I guess my own 'parties' are my evenings spent watching anime and playing vidya.</br></br></br>  <br>Dude left his socks on. Fucking savage.</br>  <br><br> college grades 70% based on attendance, 20% about turning shit in on time (even if it sucks) and 10% learning <br><br>sure he will do fine. you can be black out drunk 5-6 days a week, do drugs and pull a 3.0 GPA and be dumb as a box of rocks as long as you turn in your shitty assignments/show up to class occasionally</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck Norman</br>  why do you amerifats wanna fuck a girl and see a mans face..that's just stupid  <br>But truthfully I didn't join a frat because I have way too much social anxiety and I don't want to live my life as I want to because I'm too afraid</br>  <br>You're going to be so bummed when you apply for jobs and nobody even asks about your gpa...</br>  <br>Where are you from?

Liberal arts? Btw I take my coffee like I take my women....hot.</br>  <br>I do all sorts of extracurriculars and have two different joint study programs in my field of study to put on my resume, ON TOP of my high grades. I just see no merit in poisoning my body and literally inhibiting my state of mind in order to have fun. It's asinine and for those who can't function correctly in the real world.<br>Faggot.</br></br>  <br>You must be retarded if you think that things can only have one name</br>  <br>The bait is strong with this one.</br>  <br>lol K. Enjoy your wrong perception.</br>  I remember my first real college party. It was at Notre Dame. Wasn't really that fun because it was summer and the only people there were just Chicago kids who took the train/people who lived in South Bend over the summer, but it was still alright. Nobody could drink their vodka straight though. Every time I'd pour myself some, someone would be like "hey, do you wanna mix that with orange juice until you can't taste the vodka?".  <br>That was the shittest thing I've ever read.</br>  <br>LOOK AT THE FUCKING FORMATION<br><br>damn you smoke too much pot</br></br></br>  Gonna be a senior this fall at Ball State!  <br> tfw quit 3 days ago <br>Also<br> implying anyone gives a fuck what you wanna call it </br></br></br>  <br><br>You are the biggest faggot in this thread.

How do you like it ??</br>  <br>wow, defensive much? you might have more fun if you loosen up a little and try to balance enjoying life with all the stupid shit you do to try to impress potential future employers. seriously</br>  <br>what do you do during the summers? I just hired a grad with a 2.3 over a 3.8. Why? The 2.3 volunteered for the same nonprofit every summer. He was given management responsibilities. He had real world experience, was fun to talk to, and had some great college stories. <br><br>The 3.8? Aside from honor societies, he wasn't involved in anything social. He didn't gain any management experience during the summers.<br><br>I hope you're doing something other than studying...</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  </br>    <br>Kek enjoy living in a life of debt missing out on the best years of our life you fucking faggot</br>  Go Noles!  <br>Go White</br>  <br>Major is marketing. I love BSU, definitely wish I have more than just 1 year left</br>  <br>And on the 8th day, God created FSU, so that man would have something to laugh at.</br>  THINGS TO REMEMBER IN COLLEGE, by: someone a lot older than you...<br><br> don't break the seal <br> always wear a condom (seriously) <br> if you're not a bitch when you ask, asking a girl to come over, drink, and watch netflix is basically asking for sex <br> try not to mix up your alcohols, it just means you're drinking a LOOOT <br> if she wants to hang out and watch a movie, she wants to touch your penis <br> always, always, let her touch your penis <br> if she always brings up how you met, shows up in your dorm randomly and wants to talk, or whatever, drop what you're doing and talk to her because she probably wants to touch your penis <br> college is your free pass to easy pussy <br> the easiest pickup line in college is, "What's your major?" <br> find the guy who is over 21 and befriend him, do whatever it takes (I saved this ex military guy's life when he had an allergic reaction and almost died, he bought me whatever i wanted whenever i wanted for the next year or so, and partied with us) <br> most girls don't find potheads super attractive, you can smoke weed, but strive to not appear to be a burnout <br> knowledge is sexy, do well in school and party on the weekends, it will take you places <br> always party on the weekends, seriously, make plans and follow through <br> get a job for the week, you'll meet people if you work somewhere cool and you can party with them and have money to throw down when you do <br> avoid hard drugs, it becomes a lifestyle <br> did i mention, always let her touch your penis? <br> utilize the campus gym, maintain a healthy lifestyle and diet, your metabolism is churning and you recover super fast, if you eat right and exercise you'll set yourself up for a lifetime of the fit look <br> the freshman 15 is REAL <br> do campus events, be open to meeting people... banged a girl I met at a campus "ho down," where we all half-assedly dressed up like cowboys <br> be friends with people in your dorm, but make your core group people outside your down. if you fuck a girl on your floor, it will get messy. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Senior ar Arkansas Tech inna few months   guys cant even form an eiffel tower <br> guys cant even score a bitch by themselves <br><br>i just hope every idiot at shit tier schools have taken out loans and will go bankrupt by 40</br></br></br>  <br>Roll tide indeed</br>  <br>What at Arby's? We're talkin Goldman Sachs. 3.8 don't cut it, tho.</br>  <br>I attend Case Western Reserve University and have 3k to pay each year after scholarships are rendered. That's 12k debt max after getting a bachelors at a rather prestigious university.<br>In the summer I work with aforementioned joint study and make anywhere from $14-$17 per hour. That covers the 3k per year with no loans necessary and I get work experience in my field. I'm good, faggot.</br></br>  <br> always wear a condom <br><br>Fucking dropped</br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit Im doing marketing too! Well that's the plan atleast I gotta go through pre business first of course. Have you got any internships yet?</br>  <br>does the guy on the left not have a ball sac?</br>  Arizona State grad<br>First party in dorm my freshman year and walk in to see a slut getting eiffle towered next to a beer pong table</br>  <br>Jesus Christ. Actual intelligence on /b/</br>  <br>I was at Case for a semester before I transferred out. They have money to burn it seems. They offered me a half ride just because I'm technically a minority. <br><br>Gender ratio sucks. The girls at Case Western are like parking spots. All the good ones are taken. All the available ones are far away or handicapped.</br></br></br>  <br>thanks</br>  Literally have an eiffel tower story.<br><br>In a frat and were throwing a mixer on Halloween with another frat and two sororities at our chapter house. My friend had recently broken up with a bitch who was an absolute nutcase, but they still occasionally hooked up. It's about 4 in the morning and she stumbles into the house wasted as fuck.<br><br>I watch her stumble up the stairs to my friends room. A couple seconds later I hear her BANGING on his door and run up to see what's going on. She keeps yelling DAN YOU PIECE OF SHIT. My friend had a girl in the room and apparently she heard her talking when she tried to break open his door.<br><br>Me and my friends are losing our shit. She turns around and storms back downstairs. She starts talking to random dudes grabbing on their dicks and acting real slooty trying to revenge fuck someone Dan knows. The last I see of her she's all over two dudes from the other frat.<br><br>Fast forward next day. Me and a few buddies are piecing together last night smoking a bowl. One of my buddies gets a text "holy shit dude you won't believe this." Passes around a picture of my friends ex getting eiffel towered in our motherfucking chapter kitchen. <br><br>She finds out about the picture and tries to press sexual assault charges. Cops interview a bunch of people and decline to press charges. Her reputation is ruined because she tried to revenge fuck in the middle of a party. A year later she is arrested for a DUI, paraphernalia, misdemeanor possession of pot, and a controlled substance driving to another state trying to confront her knew bf who she thought was cheating like a psycho. Dropped out of college. Years worth of Karma catching up. Knew her since highschool and she cheated on all three of her bf's. My friend Dan literally broke her by breaking up and not playing her games.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dan?</br>  <br>Nope no internships. Yeah they are good experience, but they aren't mandatory in order to get a decent paying job. It's mainly about networking yourself and creating solid connections with ppl</br>  <br>Life's to short to be a cog faggot as for myself I'm 21 and living the life as a man of trades doing tons of drugs and drinking tons of booze</br>  <br>who exactly are you networking with while in college? also, where do you currently work?<br> im another marketing fag, not the same one </br></br>  <br>Great tips anon. Appreciated</br>  <br>Capped.</br>  <br>So much truth. I'm an author and get told to write a book about how I succeeded in college and this was pretty much the outline. Good man.</br>  <br>Yeah, the girls are shitty. But I'm here for the education, not the pussy. The education for what I'm doing(Physics + Mathematics double major) is pretty damn good so I just abused the hell out of them giving away assloads of money and managed to sit pretty at 59 grand a year in miscellaneous scholarships.<br><br>"If you want to get laid, go to college. If you want an education, go to the library."<br>-Frank Zappa<br><br>Usually he'd be right, but I'm that faggot who just multiplied my education BY the library.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah sounds like my ex. Crazy girls lure you in with awesome sex and then fuck with you hard</br>  <br>I know it's cliche but LinkedIn helps a little but I'm currently in a business frat at my college and that helps out with networking due to many sponsors our frat has. Also job fairs are a decent way to network too.</br>  Frat bro here<br><br>Screw what everyone says about being in a frat is for faggots who pay for friends, had the best years of my life in college thanks to my letters, quite literal fuck-a-thons and chinese firedrills with slamming girls....Proud to be a zeeb haha<br><br>Honestly, join a frat, and not the "oh those guys" frat, cuz thats social fucking suicide</br></br></br></br>  going to a shitty community college in the fall because saving money<br>who Onondaga here?</br>  <br>No, sorry.<br><br>I have an insatiable curiosity about how the Universe(I personally believe multiverse but whatever) functions. I can't alleviate that curiosity by doing drugs. I need some hardcore science and math for that shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Case has some insanely good academics. Only triple major I ever met was at Case. <br><br>Seriously though. Money to burn. They smelled "diversity" on me and just bukkaked money all over me.</br></br></br>  <br>So you suggest joining a business frat to a freshman? Starting in late august.</br>  <br>I got a couple of college party stories<br> be mid january  <br> first week of classes <br> theres an event for cancer research, but the way to raise money is to get drunk for a week straight from 8am to 3am the next day <br> friend suggests i should buy a toilet seat and wear it <br> do it <br> decide to go to the following event with it on <br> the event is called boat races which is 10 people with 2 beers in front of them 6 guys 4 girls you start a one side then go to the other and then back so the last guy has to chug to beers goal is to finish all beers before other team <br> black out after the race <br> black in making out with a random girl and shes giving a me handjob inside the venue  <br> end up at home with her  <br> wake up the next day find out the people from the venue are looking for me  <br> apparently someone stole a toilet seat from the place and thought it was me because i was wearing it <br> become known as toilet seat <br> mfw girls come up to me and i have no idea who they are and want the d </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>All pretty good except for:<br><br>Campus events are usually trash other than sports games and events that everyone goes out for.<br><br>What's your major is about the least interesting thing you could ask a girl. It's pretty much the epitome of uninteresting small talk and if you're still using it past freshman year you're fucking up. Don't use it unless you can't think of literally anything else to say.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Also I'm currently working for my towns local parks dept for a summer job. While at school I work at a dining hall on campus.</br>  <br>I got a grant for living in Appalachian Ohio. Literally just for living here I got free money. Also "underrepresented" because I said I was Native American and gay. Am I? No. Did I get free money anyway? Yes.<br><br>And yeah, the academics are great. There's a reason it costs more than Harvard I suppose lol.</br></br></br>  <br>Yup. Crazy girls are great one night stands. Luckily my friend ended up coming out on top. One of the only guys she hasn't completely fucked over of a long line of guys since high school. The fact that my friend broke up with her instead of her cheating on and then breaking up with him destroyed her confidence and literally ruined her.</br>  <br>Honestly, it's up to you. I didn't join until this past semester due to a negative image on frats. However, the business frat that I am in is extremely helpful when it comes to preparing for the business world and I wished that I would have joined freshman year.</br>  <br>Well I guess that makes you less of a faggot then. I'm taking an astronomy class next semester and I'm pretty hype about it. What's your major? Physics?</br>  <br>You're just proving his point more and more</br>  univeristy at buffalo here been having my fun at college <br> lost my virginity to a lesbian <br>  got head on a frat floor and slept in a bush <br>  went to my ex RA's house parties <br> set off a fire alarm while smoking in the dorms <br> fun shit and still somehow got a 3.0</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What is going on with left guy's dick?</br>  <br>What's your frat called, I'm interested</br>  <br>Joining a frat is basically buying your friends. <br><br>The upside is you'll have pretty much guaranteed connections out of school (short of being autistic). This is pretty much how you'll get any job these days, through people you know. <br><br>Business majors are big in Greek life. Probably good idea to rush/pledge.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>can i ask which university you're at?</br>  <br>Double major, Physics + Mathematics. Astronomy is fun as hell btw bro, just a lot of tedious memorization sometimes.</br>  <br>but rush costs money that i dont have. Thats my only worry. I dont want to spend money on it, and then not enjoy it</br>  <br>My college sexperience<br> had a slut for a gf freshman year  <br> got fit that summer <br> banged three girls and blown by two others first two months of sophomore year <br> met qt girl with a great ass in November that year <br> made her my gf <br> took her virginity that January <br> shared tons of experimental sexperiences with her  <br> we got married after college and have three kids now <br> she's still has a great ass </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I have no good stories.  Any prestigious anons here?  <br>As another elderfag, everything this man has said is the truth</br>  <br>Pi Sigma Epsilon</br>  <br>Ball State University</br>  <br>What do you mean? Rush week is basically a week of frats throwing free shit at you. It's worth it to go even if you're not sure about joining one. If you're on the fence it will help you make up your mind plus you're getting free food for a week.</br>  <br> and almost forgot fingering a girl on the drunk bus and then getting off the drunk bus and waking up to find out i made a friend while blacked out </br>  <br>Pics virgin</br>   get group of friends together on a random friday <br> bunch of girls, bunch of guys, all fit looking people, good crew <br> can't find a party to save our lives, currently boycotting the only frat that is having a big party because rape-frat and cops are on standby <br> fuck it, let's go to the campus ho-down <br> everyone pre-games hard, gets all ready for it <br> dress up like moronic cowboys <br> girls get slutty in daisy dukes <br> show up, lots of other people with the same idea <br> everyone's drunk as shit, admin isn't stoked but it's college, at least we showed up <br> student dj is decent <br> having fun, meet a girl <br> buddy meets a girl <br> buddy has more game than me, gets his girl upstairs immediately <br> i take my girl with the crew to a late starting party off campus <br> show up all western as fuck, look ridiculous but we're wasted and we brought booze so everyone's okay with it <br> girl gets drunk, girl wants to fuck <br> take her back and we do the deed <br> she passes out, but i'm still wired off redbull <br> decide to go for a walk and smoke a little to calm down <br> get dressed in black so i can smoke stealthy <br> go outside, buddies are in the quad burning, join them, bullshit for a bit <br> start walking back to dorm, see bale of hay <br> okay, yes. <br> each of us picks up a bale of hay <br> stack bales in front of buddy's door with the long side against the far wall, wedge them into his door frame so he can't see out at all <br> go to bed <br> wake up in the morning, all hell breaking loose, RA is PISSED, waking all of us by banging on our doors <br> she says she couldn't see who did it on the camera, but if it isn't gone in half an hour we're all getting fined, she leaves, tells us she'll be back in 29 minutes <br> ok, buddy laughs it off, he didn't even wake up till she woke him up <br> still a little drunk, lead the charge. we're on the fifth floor, so we go out to the outdoor stairwell and toss fifteen bales of hay off to the ground where they all explode in a huge pile <br> we vacuum up immaculately and go back to sleep <br> college </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>See, mine isnt nearly as big as that one. Super unknown. APSU</br>  <br>But doesnt it cost like $400 to pledge or something like that?</br>  WE AREEE<br><br>where my niggas at</br></br>  <br>Ah I see. Yeah I had a few friends convince me to check it out and I figured I would and I've enjoyed being in it ever since.</br>  <br>Not happening</br>  <br>lol, have fun. it'll be worth it.</br>  <br><br>I want to try physics but I'm seriously worried I can't handle the work load and math involved. I suck shit at math. I love space and would love to learn more about it but Im scared to major in anything related</br></br>  <br>this terry fellow must slam so many bitches.<br>good on the dude. high five</br></br>  <br>Depends on the frat. Some cost a shit ton and some aren't too much money.</br>  George Washington here  <br>been out for a bit. definitely worth it haha</br>  <br>not sure if bong or yard glass.</br>  <br>ELfag, unfortunately have to go to LCC for 2 years before MSU</br>  <br>Yea you were saying rush though. Check out rush even if you're not sure you're going to pledge. I was able to pay my dues just by working a part-time job.</br>  <br>Welcome to the club.</br>  <br>I won't bullshit you; it's pretty hard. I pretty easily got a 5 on both the AP calc AB and BC exams in high school and the math involved is still challenging. I actually have to study &amp; shit, and do multiple practice problems on my own OUTSIDE of the homework or else I get fucked on other assignments because of inconsistencies with the stuff we're actually assigned. I'd try taking a few into physics courses before trying to major in it.</br>  <br>intro* -_-</br>  Fucked a Chinese girl at a college party once. She gave me attention because I brought Chinese beer as a goof. Got hammered and rambled about my greed and her Chinese mind probably confused it with ambition, which they like, so she offered to walk me back to my dorm.<br><br>She did everything I told her to, even degrading things, she had no limit. I was too drunk to remember the condom.
