You've probably seen it but she says "you're gonna make me laugh" or something while she's sucking his dick. It's hot because she looks like someone from a cheerios commercial.</br>  <br>Still not as bad as the dream I had last night. I dreamed that a gay man hired a straight male battle-hardend prostitute to rub shit all over his body and fuck him, but instead of prostitute fucking the dude after the shit was rubbed on his body he instead shoved a heavy copper wire brush with a power drill attached to it up the guys ass and kept reversing the direction of the rotation so that the wires would stab the inside of his rectum. He then proceeded to take like 5 other pieces of copper wire and stabbed it through the gay guy's face while he moaned in agony. It was fucking appalling to witness first hand in my dream, and I thought so while I was dreaming it. <br><br>Nobody got cucked though.</br></br></br>  <br>thanks for the rock hard erection you shill bastard</br>  <br>No, I have not seen it, sounds hot though.</br>     Jet fuel wants to melt steel beams <br> American government plants explosives to bring down towers depriving jet fuel of that steel beam pussy <br> jet fuel gets cucked because jet fuel cant melt steel beams </br></br>  <br>you're welcome</br>  <br>ayy</br>    <br><br>help b my wife is cucking me with another man. what do?</br></br>    <br>I wonder if she got black pregnant yet?</br>  <br>enjoy the sloppy seconds, there's nothin better</br>  <br>More of her!</br>  <br> Married in order to glorify gay marriage. <br> I'm the passivei he is the active. <br> In honeymoon, my mate brings a straight homophobe. <br> He bends over the straight guy while applying cock cage to me. <br> Not even remotely fabulous <br> My life is forfeit. </br></br></br></br></br></br>   gf wants to fuck bf <br> bf jacks off, depriving gf of that sweet erect penis pussy <br> gf gets cucked </br></br>  <br>No but her daughter did!</br>  <br>even better</br>  <br>wish I had more of her.

I've heard the term bull, but I don't know of a term that applies to the act of being "bulled" away from a faithful relationship. <br><br>The whole cuck shit with the man watching and the woman being the aggressor is kind of the opposite of my interest. The man isn't there. It's just the woman, saying over and over again that she'd never cheat until she just gives up and goes full slut on the dude.</br></br></br>  <br>Kek. I've been cucked</br>  Pathetic fags. Go die.  <br>Greentext got cucked there. You fucked me with regular text, depriving greentext of my pussy. Greentext had to watch</br>  <br>Thats just cheating.

His palm ground into the delectable, bouncing curves of her butt, whilst his other danced from side to side, delivering a short series of sharp smacks, causing the generous flesh to bounce under his rough treatment. His grip seizes a cheek once more, kneading into it with the same intensity that drives his hips in their undulate, sawing pumps.<br><br>His cock, bulging and lurching with each hammering shove that spread her dripping lips apart, swells at its bulbous head within her, the rubbery flesh at the tip parting widely. An urgent tightness coils within him, forcing his thrusts shallower and shallower, the pad of his pelvis meeting against her clit at a frantic tempo. His muscles constrict, the sinews tight under his skin as he pulls her close for the finale, his swinging sack beneath them drawing up close.<br><br>"Here it comes," he gasps out, an almost feral rumbling escaping his throat as he keeps her pressed tight against him. His hips jerk, his face screws up, fingers tightening against their grip in a fierce grope. Short pants pass his breath over her lips, before he dips down and presses his own against her neck, pressing insistent but lingering kisses along her ivory flesh. His length bounds against the tight, milking prison of her pussy, shooting out thick ropes of his 'creamy treat', the potent cum quickly overwhelming the little space between his width and her walls.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Continuing here:  <br>Really depends on how it's done, and who's doing it.<br>But given how poorly those are understood as factors, it still might as well be a roll of the dice.<br>Well, I'm gonna head off now, might come back in an hour or two if I'm feeling less exhausted! -w-</br></br></br>  <br>I'm just a black science guy, how would I know?</br>  <br>Alright.

I heard she dresses skimpy, yes that was correct, and goes to bars and get home drunk... you sure she doesn't cheat on Daddy?</br>  I've never Erped before but I'd like to give it a try...  <br>Gard: Well you seem cool</br>  <br>I should call it off... is good sex really worth possibly destroying a 2 year relationship?</br>  <br>Seems like a lot of us haven't erp'd before.</br>  <br>"Why? Are you thinking of something you shouldn't be?"</br>  <br><br>Nice trips- would love to violently rape Chibiusa.</br></br>  <br>Gard: I'm not quite sure. He keeps on rambling about your guy's behavior, man that guy really loves me...</br>  <br>NOT IF I DO IT FIRST</br>  <br>The Mistress went to sleep I suppose, but Armani is still here~</br>  <br>Well maybe you can teach me... I just need a firm push in the right direction</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;624294939 <br>Her face rose for a moment to meet his, ah. She knew that look as well. She smiled in spite of herself as his hand grazed her sides gently. A knowing smile of sorts. "It doesn't please me to take advantage of a bleeding heart.." her elegant fingers wrapped around his own. A huff escaped her lips as she dipped her head once again, pouting in a way. "Not sure what the light would do to my body anyway." she paused, biting her lower lip gently. "Though something tells me you were not offering your talents as a healer.." she tapped at his bulky armorment, a dry joke to say the least. <br><br>Her eyes glanced outward to their surroundings, still refusing to meet his eye after her bold look. "Perhaps you should flee before I change my mind.." her long ears drooped, eyes tracing the meadow before her. "Kindness is not often shown to me, the offer is more than enough. No need to force yourself." she raised her head, regaining the pride of her race.<br><br>((Repost for reasons. Work calls to me.. But for at least 2 more hours I will tell it to Fuck off.))</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I walk up behind you and grab you by the waist<br>"You're new here huh? With an outfit like that you'll get alot of attention"</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;624297174 <br>the interaction between paladin and deathknight hand called back the memories of his brothers-in-arms flirting with the young priestesses in the cloister. he was amused to find that throughout different cultures, and perhaps even different eras, that the dance between man and woman was universal. the cool hands of the maiden on his was exotic. within his body burned a fire of righteousness, and within hers a frozen tempest. undoubtedly their encounter was about to erupt into a symphony of frost and flame.<br><br>"im afraid my opportunity to flee has expired. not for the danger i find myself in, rather, my conviction wont allow it. once ive set my mind to a challenge i cannot be turned from it"<br> his free hand reaches to his shoulders, and unclasps the protective breastplate from his body, letting it slump off his chest and land at his feet <br>the paladin stands in front of her now, vulnerable. a dangling piece of metal hangs around his neck, an identification tag. a keen eye can make out the words<br> Knight-Captain Donovin Molsen <br> 4th Knighthood of Stormwind <br>free of his encumberment, he resumes his posture in front of the maiden, and leans in carefully to place his cheek against hers.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>"What behavior?"<br>I say confused</br></br>  <br>Yeah, haven't done it before either, it'll be a new thing for both of us.</br>  <br>Gard: He keeps on pointing out a guy who tried to grab my dress.</br>  <br><br>Why don't we just spitroast her mang? There's plenty of loli to go around.</br></br>  <br>Cheating? I don't think they play games very much, mister. She does like to wear less stuff when daddy isn't around though, like me! Sometimes she doesn't even put on her pyjamas! yeah she likes to get dressed up and go out when he's not home, though</br>  <br>Tell him to smoke weed everyday.</br>  <br>(are you a shark girl then? sorry didn't follow the previous thread. I'm a girly boy in a bunny outfit. call me Bunny I suppose)<br><br>a-are you willing to play with me a bit? I-I'll keep quiet so as not to wake Mistress...</br></br></br>  <br>"Oh well I won't grab at your dress"</br>  <br>Gard: I will once your trips will be sciencefied</br>  <br>I blush and begin to stammer as steam bulds up on the lenses of my glasses<br><br> Oh- you don't say (mumble mumble) <br><br>I look away as I continue to mumble, wrists turned at a 90 degree angle. You can feel the warmth of my blood not but a hairs length from the surface of my skin a my whole body becomes flush red<br><br> T-teach me... I'd like you to show me the way. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We comin for dat loli.</br>  <br>Gard: Thank you! You seem kind</br>  <br>sorry, I didn't explain myself good... I think your Mommy lets other men play with her body and do things to her when Daddy's not around. things that only Daddy should be allowed to do... like when she makes you lick her kitty.</br>  <br><br>It would be fun to see her get gang banged. Hard.</br></br>  <br>I run my hands down the length of your stomach, slipping my fingers slightly underneath your shorts<br>"I'd like to teach you alot of things, if you don't mind"</br></br>  <br>C-Could anyone dominate me as Revy..?</br>  <br>Gard: Well I really can't do that</br>  <br>"It's no problem, say do you have a nickname or shall I just call you Gardevoir?"</br>  <br>Oh, uhm, I don't really know about that...She does go out for a long time sometimes, and sometimes when she gets home she talks funny...</br>  <br>Gard: I prefer Gard</br>  <br>"Haha, Gard works for me"<br>I smile<br>"So where are we walking to? Anywhere in particular?</br></br></br>  <br>(Nah, I'm just really into all kinds of fur and post them along with my writing. Sometimes they fit the situation, sometimes they not or most of the time not since I dont have a pic for everything. Also I'm just a normal male)<br><br>I move closer to you and look you deep in the eyes and start to smile. <br>"You are so cute, I guess we can play a bit"<br>I start to run my fingers through your hair and give you a gentle kiss on your soft lips.</br></br></br></br></br>  Any girls wanna play?  <br>Fuck trips.</br>  <br>I moan sensually as your hands run up and down the length of my member.<br><br> Give it to me <br><br>I beg and plead<br><br> I can't wait! Let me taste your beautiful cock! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br>Woops, meant to say thats no fun</br></br>  <br>Lako PIPO</br>  <br>well then it's pretty sure. your Mommy does like to play around when Dad's not there. someone puts something in her kitty or licks it while she's at the bar, and that are things only Daddy should do. she's behaving like a slut, and that could destroy your whole family! that has to stop!</br>  <br><br>Im the new guy, is the one that asked me if im feeling lewd still around? I was really looking foward to rp'ing with you, but I got distracted and the thread died</br></br>  <br>Gard: Well I found my trainer next to a log crying. I asked him why he was crying and he looked shocked. He told me that "No one really cares for me." So I hugged him we took of from there</br>  <br>Gard: How awesome is your science?</br>  <br>Gard: S'ok</br>  <br>I turn you around and push you down onto your knees, unzipping my pants and dropping them to the floor<br>"Be my guest"</br></br>  <br>Hmmmm... not yet. She did already change her plans to come see me..</br>  <br>"Don't you care for him?"</br>  Any masters or mistresses on here willing to train a new pet?  <br>I look at you with an expression of moderate contempt.<br><br> I meant the serum. You did bring the formula, right? RIGHT?! </br></br></br>  <br>Gard: I care for him immensely.He treats me like his queen. It's always a bit flattering</br>  <br>(okay!)<br><br>Mmmmhhh~<br>*he moans at the gentle kiss, his head turned up for the difference in height, his tongue reaching out to touch his partner's lips. he wraps his hands on your neck, and lifts a pantyhosed leg placing his high-heeled left foot on the back of your leg.*</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm totally into this idea but the thought of the person RPing women is a faggot is just too creepy and blurgh.</br>    <br>Lenour's brow raised, as she turned her gaze to meet his once again. The fervor burning in his gaze set her aback. Her mouth hung slightly open as if she were about to retort, but quickly forgot what she was going to say. His words then shook her, as her face contorted to confusion. Perhaps he had no inking of the conviction it took for her to turn him away. Yet here he stood before her. She jumped slightly at the inevitable thump as his breastplate hit the soft soil below them. <br><br>Her hands trembled "I.. I need but a moment- " his medallion caught her eye, only a moment. The fringe of her tight fitting dress draped around her hips like a curtain. As their skin med, it was clear to him by her actions just how long it had been since she had another..regulate her body..</br></br></br>  <br>You must have a hard time watching movies or reading novels.</br>  <br>"Uhh ya of course I did it's right in here"<br>I wave my cock in your face</br></br>  <br>you can always RP as a male and play with another male character and be a faggot all around</br>  <br>Gard: Waow</br>  <br>No... forget it. It's wrong and i shouldn't. I'll just go for coffee and keep it innocent. Well as innocent as coffee with an ex without telling your gf can be...</br>  <br>Itz scencie</br>  <br><br>"AHHH! I'm being stuffed!" she screams as she climaxes with him, both her holes throbbing, feeling the ecstasy of release as her womb is filled with a surplus of his sweet, sticky stuffing. The uncontrollable pulsing of his cock inside her and the expanding and contracting throbs of her inner walls mixed her sweet juices with his cum thoroughly, with more and more 'stuffing' pouring from his shaft. Overflowing, his hot cum seethed out of her, which she quickly scooped up with a hand to lick eagerly. She licked her lips with her tongue.<br><br>"I said I'd lick every last drop," she winked as she slowly got up, letting his finger graze the inside of her anus as they were removed. She then got down on her knees.<br><br>"And you've even given me a generous lolipop," she kissed the tip of his cum-covered cock, covering her lips with the excess before twisting a tactful, thorough tongue around his head, licking up every last drop as she promised. She looked up at him teasingly, smiling once she swallowed his delicious treat.<br><br>"You were delicious. My favorite treat," she kissed him one more time lightly before pulling back.<br><br>"Please feed me again, sometime," she smiled, giggling. She wrote down her number and left, letting him stare at her cute, receding butt as she walked out the door.<br><br>(Thanks for the good ERP. I'm heading to bed)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>"So then what brings you here? If I may ask"</br>  <br> inb4 you fuck in the restrooms </br>  <br>Gard: S'bootyful</br>  <br><br>I hope you know that its nigh impossible to find a girl thats into erp here in 4chin. Take it or leave it, unless you want to do a better job than him.</br></br>  <br>Gard: I'm not very sure. I just like seeing everyone peacefully rp-ing</br>  <br>Trust me it's less weird when they use images of girls</br>  <br>I forgot the picture</br>  <br>"And you don't do that sort of thing?"</br>  <br>(Short epilogue.)<br>A breathy laugh shakes his chest up and down, his recovery slowed by her continued attentions even after their mutual climax. He watches her butt sway back and forth as she makes her exit, and slumps, nude and lewd, into a seated position with his legs wide, he grasps the paper and brings it up to his gaze, focusing on the number.<br><br>"What the fuck," he mutters to himself, "I'm down for seconds." He folds the paper in half against his index finger, his eyes closing as he throws his head back, letting out a long blissful sigh. Which soon devolves into a rumbling snore.<br><br>(Was much fun, sleep well.)</br></br></br></br></br></br>    Well, last threads partner apparently left. Im really new to erp, if someone wants to start, I will follow,I dont care who/what is it.  <br><br>btw, I've written a few lemon piece in the past, but I haven't done a lot of ERPing, so I hope I did ok.</br></br>  <br>I start to kiss you back more wildly than before using my tongue. We exchange saliva with eachother while we kiss. I let out a small moan and hug you tighter, bringing you even closer to me while I start to stroke your leg with my hand. <br>"Mmmh~ You really don't hold back do you?"</br></br>  <br>Gard: OH DEAR GOD!</br>  <br>I started getting into it. Not really any complaints on my end. <br><br>No problems for my side of things?</br></br></br>  <br><br>And thanks</br></br>  <br>Gard: I love to lurk</br>  <br>Gard: Preach!</br>  <br>Bangkok: A Documentary.</br>  <br><br>You were great. Loved the imagery and description; I thought you were a pro</br></br>  <br>he closed his eyes as he willed his aura to envelope her. for the two of them the outside world seemed to fade away, as if they were actors on a stage, and the house lights had been lowered, only to encircle them in the spotlight.<br> a shake of his wrist is able to free his other hand from its shield, and he does also cast off his gauntlet <br>"i pray that you are not offended by my boldness" he says as his other hand begins to wrap around her body, embracing her. for the time being not even the slightest hint of ulterior motive or manipulation hangs around the two. the gesture is of pure passion</br></br></br>  <br>Sluts can break a family? You're not making sense mister... Why would boys playing with mommy's kitty hurt us?</br>  <br><br>Oh god i want nothing more. I just want to throw her into my bed and breed her until she's soaked in cum. I want to leave so many stains Carly finds out what i did from one look. I wan't it... but i shouldn't. I need to keep it under control</br></br>  <br>Awesome to hear.</br>  <br>Preached et dood.</br>  <br><br>Did you choose this site, or did your master suggest it? Because that is one of the tamest thing you will see here.</br></br>  <br>Gard: S'gud</br>  <br>Not really, it's just the gender swap that's freaking me out, that someone on the other end are hiding their true gender to serve their own selfish needs.<br><br><br><br><br>That's why I never can get into it here, ive cybered in the past with real women and that was awesome today there's just too much bullshit and guys exploiting you that it aint worth it anymore.<br><br>Imagine having these chats and someone else IRL knows that you're here and they pose as female and then post the stuff on facebook or whatever ruining your life.<br><br>Yea.. no thanks.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gard: I... I just wanted to see the legend of 4chan</br>  <br>'Haha of course, you're too cute and innocent to do something so lewd"</br>  <br>You're probably gonna end up doing it, don't.</br>  <br>What the fuck is wrong with me...</br>  <br><br>Anyways, night<br><br>P.S. Going to make my ERP name "Sweets Girl" from now on if I ever end up back on here, so thanks for that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>*both tongues dance together in the connected mouths, and as he feels pulled in closer he starts grinding against your body, a smallish bulge in the crotch of his leotard pressing into your body.*<br>i-it's just that... i-it's been two days... Mistress was very tired yesterday, like today, and I don't want to pester her but... I-I'm so... mmmhhh~<br>*his last words are muffled by another deep kiss as he puts his hand on your shoulder and jumps up, his other leg lifted up so they're both wrapped around your waist, his body so light you can hold him with no effort.*</br></br></br>  <br>someone gave out weed during, tis byoutiful</br>  <br>Gard: Oh you think I'm cute *blushes* Your too kind</br>  <br> Going to make my ERP name "Sweets Girl" from now on if I ever end up back on here <br><br>Good deal. Maybe we'll stumble across each other once more.</br></br></br>  <br>Gard: I am hovering. Does that mean I'm high?</br>  <br>I sigh and push aside your cock as I stand up.<br><br> Oh boy, you forgot didn't you?! <br><br>I continue my belligerent scolding as I start to get undressed<br><br> You see, if you had the serum with you all of this would be perfect!

Mommy's kitty should be his and his alone. that's what happens when two adults start a family, they don't let anyone else play with their bodies... if he knows she lets other boys play with hers, he might get very mad and run away. and you don't want it, do you? we have to keep your Mommy in check!</br>  <br>"Well thank you, mind if we have a seat?"<br>I point to a nearby log</br></br>  <br>Nigger this is 4chan, everything is anonymous.

Gay marriage is the gay's undoing.<br><br>Gays only exist because human culture basically has required people to get married and have children to survive. The gay genes that emerged from some mutation were allowed to continue to spread because even gays were basically forced to reproduce by social and physical pressure.<br><br>Now that gays are allowed to be in relationships and not reproduce, the gay genes will no longer be getting passed along. The gay problem naturally goes away and our collective nightmare will be at an end.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think you can only kill your self. I'm planning to an hero my self.

So do not associate anal sex and homosexuality because lots of heteros do it too--are doing it this very minute.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I honestly can't believe you retards are so worked up over the gay marriage shit. That's not the real reason for this decision,how small you all have become. <br>Not one of you are smart enough to see this was a direct attack on the first amendment, and our constitution. Gay marriage doesn't matter, the fact that the church cannot discriminate who and who they can't marry anymore, and the fact the government now has the ability to regulate the church, through discrimination law.<br>That's why they were s adamant about rushing gay marriage through. It was the same reason the pushed for the Discrimination Act of 1963.</br></br></br>  <br><br>What is your point? Besides stating the obvious.</br></br>  <br>lesbians love anal sex.</br>  Here ya go buddy, map of countries with anti homosexuality laws. :3 hope it helps.  <br>Yeah except any sort of gay gene would have been one of the very first things evolution would've taken care of millions of years ago. Being gay is symptom of:<br>a)A coping mechanism for a trauma at some point in early life, even if you don't remember it.<br>b)Hormone disrupting chemicals in food/water<br>c)Mental illness<br><br>It's one thing to like the sensation of something up your ass, but to solely be attracted to your own sex just simply isn't natural.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Derr  <br>Not that you care, but sexual orientation is not passed down directly by genes; gay people are born in families with no history of it at all. Plus, even though there probably is some family component, it need not be directly parent-to-child; probably passes through siblings to nieces and nephews, so even if every homosexual person DID stop reproducing biologically, they aren't going away, sorry to tell you.</br>  First they take over the White House, SCOTUS, our landmarks, and next they'll take our freedom.  <br>Heh heh it's all coming together</br>  <br><br>People have a right to be happy after being repressed from their constitutional right to marry for decades. You know, civil rights and all that.</br></br>  <br>i'm gay and appreciate your support, but you might want to fact check that. america is only the 20th nation to legalize same sex marriage.</br>  <br> the real reason this passed in congress <br><br>Didn't pass in Congress; it was a Supreme Court decision.</br></br></br>    <br>This actually has nothing to do with the church at all. Nothing says churches have to perform marriages, straight or gay, to be recognized by the state.</br>  <br><br>This makes sense since the south always has been a bunch of faggots. Nice to see them come out of the closet finally.</br></br>  Jack: America, where all you have to do is complain and people start kissing your ass, and "white" people are afraid to go out on the streets because of the "backs" rioting because of "hate crimes" but the U.S is better than most other countries  <br>Why didn't we listen to Ben when we had the chance? Now it's too late.</br>  Literally the only thing that changes now <br>Step one:<br>OMG OMG WE ARE SO GAY HOLY SHIT WE ARE GAY<br><br>Step two: CHEESUS CHRIST WE ARE SO GAY LETS GET MARRIED, HEY EVERYONE WE ARE GETTING GAY MARRIED LOOK AT US<br><br>*gets married*<br><br>Step three: *cricket noises* <br>Because no one will give a shit that you join the flawed monotonous union that's called marriage where you experience the same shit everyone else does, most of it is unfortunate, except you also get a dick in your ass.<br><br>Go to bed, this shits already old.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>So he's like every other politician ever. Got it.</br></br>  <br>Homosexuality in women can be linked to (ironically) increased pregnancy rates in teen surveys. Homosexuality in men may be a genetic spandrel to hypersexuality in women. The research is pretty clear, avowed lesbians sleep with men much more often than you think.</br>  <br>Summer fun!!</br>  <br> obama lies <br> implying any president was 100% truthful at all times <br>How's being a naive 13 year old, champ?</br></br></br>  <br> Now that you're all gay and allowed to get married, can you stop waving it in all of our faces? <br><br>As soon as heteros stop waving their marriages, weddings, Bridezilla shows, wedding rings, etc in ours, deal?<br><br>PS, I got married (same-sex) years ago in a state where it was legal, and far from "waving it at anybody", I don't even mention that I'm legally married unless I know someone very well. You are the victim of confirmation bias, meaning you only notice the "flamboyant" gays because you have decided that's the only kind there are.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Canada, they certainly don't have gay marriage.</br>  <br>NEVER FORGET!<br><br>how much we deserved it.</br></br></br>  Anybody gonna mention how this completely undermines the states ability to make their own decisions, in essence more power pulls from the federal govt? Most don't care because most are in favor of this, but what happens when another "super supreme court" decision undermines the states again for shit the majority doesn't want? Oh wait, I'm assuming checks and balances still exist. HA!  <br>To the point though; who cares? Not me.<br><br>Butthurt much? Lol</br></br></br>  <br>This person perhaps sees that there is a right way we could have done this, and a wrong way that the court decided to do. We didn't give them the power to legalize "same sex marriage", we have them the power to change definitions. Gay people don't have the same relationship as a straight couple. Marriage laws refer to males and females in a marriage, but there is no male in "gay marriages".</br>  <br>Even in Sparta the gay soldiers were expected to have wives just to have children. The point is that gayness emerged were it was basically had no choice but to be passed on to the children</br>  This was a horrible decision that marks, in many ways, the crumbling of the last of the checks and balances that made our nation a democratic republic. It's damaging enough that this administration is treating Executive Orders as if they were laws (they aren't), but the idea that a small panel of unelected, non-representational legal figures can dictate to the states how they are to behave represents the start of the total destruction of the legislative process. We now have a government that defies description, being a weird hodgepodge of autocracy, parliamentary democracy, and oligarchy.<br><br>What makes this so bitter is that the entire debate is based on a false premise, that is, that the government, whether federal or state, has any authority to dictate who can marry whom or in what way in the first place. They don't. Nowhere in the Constitution does it state that any branch of government has any authority to say anything about marriage at all. The majority opinions of the SCOTUS are flat wrong from a Constitutional standpoint; they quite literally made it all up.<br><br>Does anyone even know any more why marriage licenses were created in the first place? The fee for the license represented the salary compensating the Justice of the Peace for officiating the ceremony. It was an option implemented for anyone who was unable (or unwilling) to be married in a standard religious ceremony. A marriage license legally had nothing to do with making the marriage "legal". You could be married in a church by a minister for free and it was still viewed to be just as valid as it had always been.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're going to sit in your mom's basement like normal, you're going to cry and mope over everything and nothing is going to change. Grow up...</br>  <br>At 7-11</br>  <br> teen detected <br>Man you got some serious angst going on.</br></br>  <br>(cont)<br>At some point, however, the states realized this was yet another potential revenue stream, and so they decided that they would only recognize marriages that involved the purchase of a license from the state as "legal". This makes a marriage license, in essence, a tax (specifically it's yet another form of taxation without representation). You know how you can tell it's a tax? Because they penalize you for not buying one -- with taxation.<br><br>The entire concept of a marriage license being required to make a marriage legal is ridiculous. Marriage is and always has been a private contract. The only thing that a contract requires to be legally binding is that the signatory parties sign the contract before a witness. There is currently no form of private contract in the United States that requires a license to create and be recognized as legal other than a marriage.<br><br>The state (and the State) has absolutely no authority to dictate under what conditions or with whom you may form a private contract. You can form a private contract with anyone, for any reason. The only input the state should have on a marriage contract would be if there was a breach of that contract, and the dispute was then brought to court in a civil suit for the state to arbitrate, the same as any other contract. The entire argument around who gets marriage licenses under what circumstances is a complete fabrication. It assumes the state actually has the authority to restrict the formation of a marriage in the first place.<br><br>On the basis of this utterly fallacious argument, the Supreme Court has just gutted the ability of the people of the United States to demand any form of representational government.<br><br>Please note. I've said absolutely nothing up to this point about homosexual or heterosexual anything. That's utterly irrelevant to all the negative legal ramifications of this decision.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Uruguay. <br>Don't question it, just do it.</br></br>  <br>STOP BULLYING ME!!!<br>I WILL SEND SCOTUS FOR YOU AND YOUR GODS!!!<br>*runs away crying*</br></br></br>  <br>&lt;Insert any Middle eastern country here&gt;<br>Keep in mind that your probably going to end up beheaded or some shit. Price of Freedom</br></br>  <br>who<br>the fuck<br>gives a shit?<br><br>if you're straight, this doesnt change shit to you</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> America is officially destroyed once and for all <br><br>Why?<br>It's not like it has any effect on you.<br>They didn't ban straight marriage, did they?<br><br>And you're OP so you're a fag anyway.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  the fact that the church cannot discriminate who and who they can't marry anymore, and the fact the government now has the ability to regulate the church, through discrimination law. <br><br>Try again. The ruling was about CIVIL marriage. NO church or temple is or will be forced to perform a religious marriage to any couple that doesn't meet their religious standard. If you disagree, please find a single example where that has happened in any of the 37 states where same-sex marriage was already legal before today.<br><br>Some religions already have "odd" (apply only to them) rules on who can get married, and they are not forced to violate them. Many Catholic priests won't marry someone who has been divorced, without and "annulment"--still, that cannot stop that couple from getting a CIVIL marriage at City Hall, but the church is perfectly free to refuse to marry them in church.<br>Many conservative Jewish groups refuse to marry a Jew to a non-Jew. That's their right, but they can't stop the couple from going to the couthouse and getting a CIVIL marriage that would affect Social Security, taxes, etc. <br>Thus it will be with same-sex marraiges: no church will be mandated to perform a marriage, but at the same time, the church cannot interfere with that couple's right to have a LEGAL marriage for legal benefits and responsibilities (not having to testify against spouse in court, inheritance rights, hospital decisions, etc).<br><br>Please don't believe everything you hear Pat Robertson or Fox News say.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, OP should be very happy in any of these red countries.

The "trauma" reasoning doesn't even make sense. <br>Most believe it is a combination of genetics (though not as simple as passing a gene down from parnet to child) and hormones while in the womb. Statistically, boys are more likely to grow up gay if they have older brothers, this being linked to hormones the mother produces after having had one son and her body detects another one (very very simplified). <br><br>LRN2 Science</br></br></br></br>    <br><br> Try again <br>Read the anti-discrimination law</br></br></br>  <br>your keen observations of everyone's age is so biting and edgy!

So is plenty of other things I don't care to look up right now. Gay marriage isn't the first thing that was a federal law for all states</br>  <br>Woo! I'm up next for being socially acceptable</br>  <br><br>Who is this "they" you speak of? And by the way, today's SCOTUS ruling INCREASED freedom, by giving a population the freedom to marry that they did not previously have.

You Foxtards would have utterly horrified Paine or Jefferson. And Washington probably would have shot you.<br><br>If the USA is to be saved, we're going to have to clean house, starting with people like you, OP. A nation of ignorant, poorly-read, intolerant, Bible-thumping half-wits cannot be free. You're too stupid to be allowed to run free. And since I wish to live in a free nation, you have to go. I doubt you'll leave willingly, so we're going to have to kill you. Sorry, OP. It's probably not your fault that you're immersed in idiocy and probably have equally stupid parents who filled you up with a life full of ignorant brainwashing, but the reality is we can no longer afford to have you people running loose.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I want to go to Australia.
