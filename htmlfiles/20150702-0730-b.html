[ So /b/, I'm taking a career break from work for a year and I will have my job waiting for me when I come back. I also have approx $23,000. <br><br>What do?</br></br>  kill a few niggers, mudslimes or gypsies.  <br>vidya and animu<br>you can gain, like, so much xp with all that freetime</br></br>  <br><br>I'm looking at going to South East/Far East Asia at the minute. Thankfully none of any of these things there</br></br>  Do you have to pay bills with the 23k during ur year off or is that just money to blow :D  <br>DRINK SMOKE AND FUCK SOME HOARS</br>  <br><br>No debts/bills so can do what I want with the cash. Also stepping straight back into my job so no need to have any left over for job hunting</br></br>    23k usd is nothing, so after you spend a week or two fucking hoars, drinking, and smoking, get another job.  <br>Nothing here. In many countries I could live off $1900 a month very comfortably</br>  Use the free time that you have to look for another job, it allows you the freedom to be selective. Seriously, it's cool when you have choice.  <br><br>This is what I'm planning on doing. I currently work in software development and I'm questioning if it's really what I want to do. I don't like the thought of the next 40 years of my life being mostly spent in an office</br></br>  <br>havnt been working for 7 months have already spent 20k and thats not paying rent</br>  <br><br>See<br><br><br><br>Also to add on to this if I overspend I can come back to my job early. I also don't have particularly expensive tastes</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm a dev myself and have been doing it since I was a kid, once you get along in it enough and you don't have to deal with indians or foreigners it's fun, but that's rare, not too many people get that far. But look at the other side, if you're good at it and don't do it, what are you gonna do? Be a racecar driver? Not too many of us can do that.</br>  <br><br>I see where you're coming from. It's a good career, plenty of job opportunities and the consultancy I work for is pretty good. I just feel like I'm going with the safe option by not doing something I'd enjoy more with my life. But yes anything else would almost certainly lower my financial potential</br></br>  <br>Just make sure not to work for indians and know your billing rate so you can judge what you get. Indians are the cheapest faggits on the planet and if you give them an inch they'll try to take a mile, so for instance if your billing rate is 200/hr USD they'll try to get away with paying you 30/hr USD.</br>  I'm a citizen so I don't have to be cheap and easy like an h1b type.  <br><br> taking a break for a year <br> job waiting for me when I come back </br></br></br>  <br>Maybe he's pregnant.</br>  <br><br>Does this not happen in shit-tier jobs?</br></br>  <br>If only. But unfortunately, no, I wont be getting paid for doing no work all year.</br>  <br>Given the state of the USA and whether you work directly for a company or are c2c you might be able to claim pregnancy and get away with it. That would be pretty funny, niggers could probably get away with that.</br>  Claim to be a homosexual nigger who needs to find his or gender and sexuality and you can get paid for that year because some idiot company will be too afraid of not being PC and you can fill a quota.  <br><br>True, just need to pass pregnancy off as a 'social construct' like just about everything else which is very much binary</br></br>  Go to Nicaragua. It's beautiful, and cheap as fuck. You can spend a year there, living the good life, and spend hardly anything.<br><br>The last time I was in Nicaragua I stayed at this hotel, $10 USD a day got you a private room/bathroom (shared rooms are real there, don't go for it, you're a rich as motherfucker to them), breakfast every morning, and as much Nicaraguan coffee as you could drink.<br><br>You could put your 23,000 dollars in an investment account, and live off the interest alone.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not binary, it's financial and filling quotas and the check boxes on some faggit in HRs notebook so they can report that to the feds.</br>  <br>That's still about 2400/yr and that doesn't count other expenses. And no investment account is paying 10% anymore, that went out in the 1990s.</br>  <br><br>This sort of thing happens a lot in the education field.<br><br>Unpopular teachers get<br> persuaded <br>to take their 6-12 month long service leave.<br><br>Come back, because firing teachers is maximum hassle, might not be in same job/school, zero support among colleagues, slowly it dawns on them...<br><br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/625186726#p625192205">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We're just gigolos and we know it, none of us that are professionals expected the jobs to be permanant in the first place but then no jobs are these days.

These internet dick waving competitions between people who 9 times out of 10 haven't even served themselves are tiresome.</br>  <br>What happened in the 60's wasnt the problem, I mean I wasnt alive then but from my understandng that was integrated migration to fill gaps in the jobs market from the old colonies, english speakers, and more of an appreciation of english values. There are plenty of elderly peoples of Ethnic minority backgrounds in these lands who know little else, and are proud to be British.<br><br>Imo it is not comparable to New Baghdad, 2015</br></br></br>  <br><br>that's some dank cp my man</br></br>  <br>Come on anon, I understand what you're getting at but calling Argentina a "proper strong country" is a joke - we absolutely wiped the floor with them</br>  <br> acts as if has been in the army <br> is on /b/ </br></br>  <br>EAT SHIT YOU LIMEY BAD TOOTHED INBREEDS.

I like it.</br>  <br>kill bill says samurai swords are not inferior steel</br>  <br>so you are just as fast with 30kilo on your back as without ?</br>    <br>This thread needs to stop being posted.<br><br>A knight, at least the one as shown in the image, is completely covered in armor. Armor that, mind you, would easily stand against the craftsmanship of a katana. Katanas are deliberately made thin and brittle so that they may easily cut through unprotected flesh, considering most of their enemies were wearing leather at best. Besides, the knight likely has superior body structure as well. It takes a lot of strong to carry and entire suit of armor, along with the sword and shield. A European knight would simply destroy a samurai, and if you truly think otherwise, you're just a weeb in denial.</br></br></br>  <br> on your back <br>did you even fucking read what i quoted?<br>and the samurai wears armor too, and its not lighter.</br></br></br>  <br>Actually swords were mostly sidearms teh knight would likely have either a morning star, a polearm, or a lance if mounted and the samurai would probably be using a bow before he used his sword<br>in close range the knight could deal heavy blunt impact damage before even drawing his sword and then cuck the samurai</br></br>  <br> weight is spread out evenly throughout body <br> 30 kilos on your back  <br>Kill yourself</br></br></br>  <br>Knight would, better armor, more effective fighting styles and just knights and the countries their from have a lot more experience in real fighting and warfare.</br>  <br>no one. they would make sweet gay love...</br>  <br>Not inferior steel, but also not designed to cut through plate steel. It's not just the steel that matters in that situation.</br>  This is how it would go:<br> samurai takes a swing at knight <br> Katana breaks in half upon contact with knights armor or sword <br>Or<br> Knight evades <br> counters with quick rapier/spear strike </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dark Souls confirmed<br><br>eat shit weebs, samurai a shit</br></br></br>  Samurai would raise his weeb-saber too high and get it stuck in his funky headdress.<br><br>0/10 no fighting prowess</br></br>  <br>it wouldnt break, it would deform.</br>  <br>very dependent on the individual fighters, but in general:<br> katana is a curved one sided sword mainly for cutting <br> knights steel plate armor and mail is imprevious to cuts  <br> in a fight knight against knight; sword against sword one would usually try to push the straight point into the weak points in the armor in a trusting motion; halfhanding was also an option <br> knight in this picture has even a shield whis is perfect for defense can also used in offense <br> samurai has impressively durable armour from paper and wood. Still it isn't nearly as strong as steel armor and has many armour free parts. Can be cut trough by a good sword <br><br>Knight wins 5 times out of 6</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>same thing: it would be rendered ineffective and leave the samurai at the knights mercy</br>  <br>i am sorry if you didnt understand what i meant, i obviously will correct myself. <br>"so you are just as fast with 30kilo on your body as without ?"<br>but for you, sir: lack of reason is no reason for lack of politness. <br>now explain how wood is as heavy as plated steel. <br>keep in mind that the knight in the picture is a temple knight who existed like this (a lot heavier armor) at about 1200 after birth of christ, so not talking about the well designed (still ~20kg) late middle ages armors.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> weight is evenly distributed <br> "so you are just as fast with 30kilo on your back as without ?" <br><br>Nigger are you serious.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>yep</br></br>  <br>yeah well, but the knight has a sturdy shield. samurai were not trained, and drilled warriors, like european knights. even though the samurai could and would wreck shit up, he would lose against a knight, because believe what you will, katana cultists, but no sword can cut steel! <br>when european knights battled, they killed each other not by bashing swords agains each other's armour in hope it will cause some damage, but rather by inserting their steel, sharp schlongs into the nooks and crannies of other knights, therefore piercing their god damn flesh. a katana cannot do that, because to be wielded effectively, it needs two hands.<br>evasion speed would do jack shit in a situation like this. it would keep you alive, but it wouldn't kill the knight. <br><br>sorry for the long post, here's ass.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Katana breaking? You fucking idiot</br>  Knight every time.<br><br>1) Just as many knights were dedicated professional warriors as samurai were. There is no skill differential.<br><br>2) A knights armor weighs the same as a samurais. It is however steel and obviously superior in every way to what a samurai had.<br><br>3) The katana is a terrible weapon. It's four inches shorter than a longsword, heavier, and can't deal with armor at all. The knight has a longer, lighter, faster weapon that is a credible threat against even steel plate. Furthermore it has vastly superior hand protection and can be used well with one hand, allowing for a shield in the other. Both knights and samurai did not use a sword as their primary weapon in war, preferring a lance if mounted or a pole arm if on foot, but outside of war the weaponry hugely favors the knight.<br><br>4) European knights are generally a few inches taller and a good bit heavier. This gives important advantages for reach and for grappling, which is common when two armored foes fight.<br><br>5) The samurai's battle experience was mostly slaying unarmored peasant soldiers. During many parts of the middle ages a knight would have expected to fight large groups of mainly other professional soldiers equipped to a much better standard than a Japanese army, which sometimes did not even have steel heads for their spears.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>shit was brittle and prone to break on superior steel constructions like european steelswords and armor. get fucked, nerd</br>  <br> implying a samurai wouldn't easily see the weak spot in a knight's armor (his crotch), slice his genitals, and stab through the eyes in his visor or cut his neck open. </br>  The knight would win. The samurai would kill himself.

It's egregiously slow but worth while if you have a penchant for self-conscious art films.</br>    <br>that is a very rare pepe my friend</br>  <br>1. Swiched all the lights on. Switches it on again after showering.<br>2. "Definitely knew" indicating having eaten human meat before.<br>3. Saw a face between the books on a shelf against the wall.<br>4. Killed his friend for "autopsy revision".<br>5. Don't know.<br><br>6. Boyfriend commited suicide. Someone else sent the video.<br>7. Alice is an inanimate object of some form that guy has given life to in his head.<br>8. Guy was showering to clean the blood off. He killed his family, burglar ran so he didn't get killed too.<br>9. Killed at least his third wife. Possibly the other two as well, somehow.<br>10. Electric was out. TV was still on.<br><br>11. He was counting the floors to kill her next.<br>12. Either the kid or the mother is going to die, he was pointing at a reflection. Unsure who's.<br>13. In England, we have a "ground floor", what American's call the "first floor". He was on the second floor with the killer.<br>14. He is the train driver.<br>15. She was holding the knife when she thought it was her husband... Intent on killing him.<br><br>If anyone knows the answer to number 5, that'd be great.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>        <br>Would have been better if had ended with walk the dinosaur</br>    <br>would rape</br>        <br>Why does he wear the mask?</br>  <br><br>Wrapping around your FOOT and dragging you DOWN!!</br></br>  <br>If my son ever did this to me, hed be out on his arse.
