One night with a fitness model with my body is something that very and I mean VERY few girls have the willpower to resist. Just as a man would struggle to resist a super model begging for them, females are the same. Pane on top of that no matter how hard you try or how many hours you put in you will never have a body like mine. Just on a Wednesday night being a topless waiter I have more girls grabbing my cock than you will ever in your life. How sad your life must be.

This was good for literally half a season, the 2nd half was beyond terrible when they went off playing house in the forest.  <br>What a shitty way to start a god tier anime thread</br>    <br>Steins Gate</br>    <br><br>Jinx :D</br></br>  <br> God-Tier <br> SAO <br>GTFO faggot, hows middle school?<br><br>FMA:B is the best anime ive ever seen so far</br></br></br></br></br>  Fullmetal Alchemist but fuck brotherhood  <br>The fuck bro?<br>Brotherhood is so much better than that anticlimactic shit-tier version</br></br>    <br>jojo's bizarre adventure, not god tier but its pretty good</br>    I liked deathnote and code geass but thats just because thats what im into, hard to find any like them though.  <br><br>Name???</br></br>  <br>I came to say this.</br>    <br>The only true answer.<br>Inferior to the manga however.</br></br>  I always head great things about stiens gate, but every time I try to watch it, I can only get into 1-3 episodes before I get bored as fuck. I have been re-watching the first couple every couple weeks. Am I missing something? when does it start to pick up? Is it really worth it?  <br>Berserk. My man.</br>  Brotherhood tries and makes things to lite hearted, and it takes away the whole plotline with the homunculus <br>Brotherhood is shit tier</br>  <br>Mah negro.<br>Also this, Dragon Ball, DBZ, DBGT.</br></br>    <br><br>Really?</br></br>  Sword Art online was good, faggots.

A god among shit-tiers  Seven Deadly Sins  <br> God tier  <br> Sword art </br></br>  <br>Brotherhood was fucking incredible.<br>this is obviously bait. <br>Because who the fuck can forgive that stupid ghost arc shit. <br>FMA original was so unfocused, just trying to soak up cash, had to end, and created the shittiest ending ever. It wrapped up nothing. It answered no questions. And gave the shittiest ending. "Oh ed is in our world now! Guess he never see's all again, ever.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This is 'Berserk'</br>  Neon Genesis Evangellion  <br>You dont start off a god-tier anime with fucking sao, that shitty shit</br>  <br>corey in the house</br>    <br>SAO is not bad, but definitely not god. It's good if you like feel trips or sappy romance.</br>  Can't be compared to the manga, but it's still god-tier.

But for me, the ending isn't even the most important thing about a series.<br><br>I think the original was much more mature, full of extremely loaded political messages (probably part of why it's less popular), and didn't overrely on fight scenes and silly humor as much as Brotherhood.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You dont comment in these kind of threads without fucking contributing faggot</br>  <br>rly?</br>  This shit is still amazing till this day, in my eyes its god-tier, watch it if you haven't  BLACK CAT! <br><br>OH AND TRIGUN <br><br><br>BITCH</br></br></br></br></br>  Tell me /b/, why does anime suck now?  <br> TOP 10 OF ALL TIME <br><br>srsly?</br></br></br>  Brotherhood has a better ending but the rest of it is shit <br>The protagonist is generic and almost omnipotent <br>It adds that whole ching bs that didn't needed to be added <br>It jumps from plotline to plotline with zero focus</br></br></br>  Psycho pass  <br>You're probably younger than the target demographic. FMA 2003 is a far more more mature show than the manga while brotherhood was full of clichés.</br>  <br>that list is fine without mirai nikki and sao</br>  OP you should definitely post something like this on /a/, they would talk about SAO with you and tell you how they love it so much. Go ahead, ask them.    <br>this is troll right?</br>  Kaiji  <br>SAO is shit, go lurk on /a/<br><br>Pic is Haibane Renmei</br></br></br>  <br> jojo <br> SAO <br> AoT <br> KlK <br><br>madoka is great but you probably don't understand it's a satire</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann  <br>half of this list is moeshit.</br>  <br>bursurker</br>  <br> Fuck brotherhood <br><br>Hell yeah.</br></br></br>  <br>If this isn't bait then you're a huge faggot.</br>  <br> DBZ=overrated.  <br><br>The only reason you should watch it is that you wont look like a retard on the Internet.</br></br></br>  <br>Darker than Black might be what you're looking for.<br><br>&lt;--The main character is literally this guy.</br></br></br>  <br>OP do it.</br>  gintama is pretty good as a non serious anime  <br>I dont get why this is so high rated it is boring as hell and mortifying to watch</br>  <br>macross zero</br>  <br> I watched only this 10 animes, now they are the top 10 of all time.  <br><br>Go watch other better animes.</br></br></br>  Anyone know good horror animes?

I don't want to spoil any more.<br><br> Is it really worth it? <br>Yes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>mahnigga.jpg<br><br>Honestly out of all i'v seen. Spike is still the most badass character out there. Although Guts does pull close.<br><br>Also, OP.... The fuck... Did you think SAO was God-Tier just because it's a newer anime with half-decent animation? The concept was cool in the first half of the first season... but when he kills final bossaru halfway through and they introduce a new game with new people and literally NO character or plot development for the last half of season, it was shit... I only finished it to finish it and get it off my mind.<br><br>Cowboy Bepop<br>Berserk<br>Darker Than Black<br>FMA (+ Brotherhood) [They both were good, fuck you all]<br>Gurren Laggen<br>Death Note<br>Code Geoss<br>Hellsing Ultimate<br>Dragon Ball Z Kai (Dragon Ball Z if you can handle an episode or 10 of powering up)<br>Black Lagoon<br>Attack on Titan<br><br>The list continues but these come straight to mind, No particular order.

Kiseijū/Parasyte no doubts    <br><br>for autists</br></br>  <br>well, i agree that the anime is lackluster but the manga is a god damn benchmark when it comes to the artform<br><br>and if you consider the anime to be a stepladder leading towards the manga i would say it's fair enough</br></br></br>    <br>Ghost hunt.

Problem is, Gundam already deconstructed its own genre, unintentionally, about 10 years before NGE. <br><br>Anyone who thinks NGE is deep after watching it when they're an adult really needs to delve into philosophy and psychology with more determination. Or is stupid.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shit yah. <br><br>Today you're pretty cool, anon.</br></br></br>  <br>Fucking torrent is 17 gigs<br>Worth it<br><br>Also, God tier anniemay</br></br></br></br>  <br>the only reason we remember berserk is because of how it goes batshit crazy at the end... but it's not good<br><br> now that i think about it, the tone shift is so extreme it's kinda terribad </br></br></br>  <br>the manga is better for like 400 pages and then it's turbo-awful for the next like 600.</br>  <br>I'm 2 episodes away from the end of the reboot</br>  <br>On Netflix it's listed as 1 season. Is season 2 combined with 1 on Netflix?</br>  <br><br>Doesn't know how many chicks are into Anime and would love nothing more than to sit down and watch the fucked up themes given by Animes with a guy that thinks with more than his cock.<br><br>Oh dem skinny tiny cunts are fucking wicked. Love to be choked, love to be thrown around. You can be a dominant motherfucker and love these shows you foolish cunt.</br></br></br></br>  People hating on eva will be like: OMG dis show is not kawaii it actually has a storyboard directed by someone that doesn't use moe and stereotypical figures and isn't afraid of showing what sexuality really is instead of putting enormous boobs everywhere DESU DESU worst show ever itz 4 kids  <br>Kurapika dies.</br>  <br>Woah woah settle down with those quads</br>  <br>Queen?</br>   Based Chobits is Based   <br><br><br>Is Clannad still on Netflix?
