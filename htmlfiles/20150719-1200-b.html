Played the fuck out of that game.</br>  <br>Okay, found some more.</br>  <br>Ayumi Hamasaki, my man.<br>Lovely game. Strange mix of an rpg and a dating sim kinda. Lacked screen transitions. A real oddball, but a great game.</br></br>  <br>Oh my fucking God, I haven't though of this disc since I last saw it, lol. It came with the toys didn't it? Is that right? Nostalgia'd hard</br>  Better than Mariokart      <br>ghost in shell</br>  <br>Ghost in the Shell ps1 game. Wanted it just cause it had robots in it, but it was kinda crap if I recall</br>  to this day i still don't know anyone who has heard of this game  <br>Yeah man. I remember being a kid, trying to figure out how the fuck to install this on my parents' computer and playing it. Probably the first game I played.</br>    <br>I swear on all things holy I was just thinking about this game!<br><br>A sleeper hit for sure and sorely overlooked by the mainstream.<br><br>Excellent graphics and game mechanics for its time.</br></br></br></br></br>        <br>played it anon, loved it</br>  <br>I played this, interesting game and story, pretty obscure.<br><br><br>Boogerman was an interesting game to say the least, I still have a Sega copy.<br><br><br>I used to own this fighting game, I don't know what ever happened to it, though.

Galaxy of Games 1, 2, 3, and Nothing But Action. (Freeware and shareware comp. discs)<br>Bodyworks, BrainWave, Chronicles of The Sword. Every single fucking port of Pitfall, the Mayan Adventure.<br>Encarta's "Mind Maze"<br><br><br>Any of these, anyone else?</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>My parents got me this instead of another game for Christmas one year. One of the most fortuitous life events I can think of.<br><br><br><br>Owned the sequel.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>fuck yeah mah nigga awesome game, remember when you throw pizza out of the helicopter?</br>  <br><br>and don't forget about the soundtrack!</br></br>      <br><br>I had this on PC niqqa</br></br>  <br>played it.</br>  <br>Still got that shit on my shelf. All the low quality voice samples were so cool as a kid. and that green ranger. goddamn.</br>  was anybody else a kid that got an early start on gambling?  <br>Holy fuck I remember this, what was the game called?</br>    <br>TOY SOLDIERS. FUCK YES.</br>    <br>aw fuck yeah small soldiers, movie was great too.</br>    <br>Dude, the games are rare as fuck and probably don't work anymore. This is the best I could find on le Google</br>    i know its small but anyones that played will recognize cover art  <br>Kula World<br><br><br>Small soldiers nigger</br></br></br></br>    <br>i wanna say i've played this game on some weird sort of system, but it could've been sega</br>  <br>Comix zone, I loved that game.</br>  <br><br>These.<br><br>Also, posting a couple myself, 1/?</br></br></br></br>  <br>That was the PS1 game, the first Gex I think<br><br>Hard mode right here, who the fuck had this?</br></br></br>  2/?  The Bouncer for PS2    I never even see this in nostalgia threads...<br>Surely I can't be the only one that played this masterpiece</br>    <br>No childhood memories with it, but I just picked one up mint, in box for like 10$ at a redneck garage sale last year and sold it on ebay for 200. So I suppose I do have good memories with this game, yes.</br>    <br>Played bruh. Badass game.</br>  <br>lol.. this fuckin game</br>  <br>Fight giant robot seafood</br>  <br><br>fuck me I still have a dinosaur I made out of an empty butter carton and toilet roll cardboard that I made when I was like 10, I didn't know they made a game.</br></br>    <br>My nigga</br>  This was a good game too.    <br>that was a good fuckin game</br>  Vintage 1994  <br>fav all time game</br>  <br>Fucking YES.<br><br>And seriously--what other game can you think of that had a strong female lead for the time? This game was sorely underrated and unfairly looked-over.<br><br>Ignore the cringe intro<br>https://<span>youtu.be/xT38jG6ahWI?t=6m33<wbr>s</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br>    loved this little fucker    <br>What in the mother of fuck?

Input spray commands can't be beat. <br>Also. dreamcast master race, faggot.</br></br></br>  Can't even find a decent picture online for this one  Anyone?  Posted in lots of these threads, still never found anyone else who played it. Its was an awesome game.    <br>I can't believe i remember this. god tier</br>    <br>When officer asked you 'Did you see this girl?' you said yes right?</br>  <br>always wanted to play these, they looked like they had the same vibe as silent hill 1</br>  <br>Motherfucking this</br>  <br>Shake shake.</br>  <br>I haven't beat it because I never got around to finishing it.</br>  4/?    <br>hated that game</br>  <br>i don't think my bro and i ever finished that one</br>    <br>Yup, very original game.<br><br>I need to look this out sometime.</br></br></br>  And here's another fucking gem of a game  <br>Fuckin' killer PS1 title. Got it on my PSP again recently.<br>Was expecting Solatorobo on ds to be more like it.</br></br>  <br>Didn't this come with the original Xbox? I thought it was this and some Sega GT game.</br>  Best game ever  <br><br>I played this on my PS1</br></br>  <br>Know this game too well, and Mystical Ninja starring Goemon, and the rest of the series including Japanese only releases haha.</br>  Please tell me i'm not the only one. This game was god-tier.  <br>Fuck that black dude but yeah it was funnier that way</br>  <br>Holy shit this was the fighting game right? I loved this game.</br>  <br>just got done with legend of the mystical ninja currently playing mystical ninja starring goemon. I swear so much brotherhood bonding went to that games coop mode</br>    <br>They did. Vol 1 was the best, the quality slowly decreased.<br>5/?</br></br>  <br>they actually made a game out of those fucking movies?!</br>  <br>It did. I still have it but I haven't played my original Xbox in ages.</br>    EVERYONE PLAYED ALL OF THESE GAMES YOU FAGGOTS, YOU JUST DIDN'T HAVE FRIENDS.<br><br><br>You stupid fucking niggers.<br><br> Gex.

Glad someone else has played it.</br>  <br>fuck yes</br>    <br>like literally all of them. or at least rented them from blockbuster.<br><br>Soul Reaver's great. sequel sucks dick. Legacy of Kain Defiance won me back over though.<br><br>Digimon world becomes obselete with every new entry (Except 4. what the fuck were they doing.) <br>Maximum Carnage and Separation Anxiety were great, arcade quality beat 'em ups though.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>i bet nobody played this as a kid</br></br>  <br>Also i remember when another bitch girl stucked under wardrobe you got option to oil her.</br>  <br>Weird game. My wife had heard of it and I fou d it for her.</br>  <br><br>Pilotwings?<br>I think I have this on my Nintendo 64 emulator...</br></br></br>  <br>Damn that game brings back memories. That and pinball were the only games my dad has on his computer.</br>    <br>same!</br>  Played this at SNK playmore office when I visited Japan. <br><br>I know not one soul outside of myself that has played this game.</br></br>  Older than most games I'm seeing here, but one of NES's highest production value games due to very late release.  <br>are you even trying?</br>  <br>Favourite fucking game,ahead of its time,I own music sampler cd</br>  <br>i know i am kek</br>    <br>I think u won 1st place for non-played games</br>  <br>Mark of Kri/Rise of the Kasai<br>Both god-tier games</br></br>  A little recent but it was still awesome  Anyone else play this one?  <br>I love you. Mark of Kri was fucking incredible</br>  muh childhood  <br>Underrated game</br>  <br>played it, a really good one.</br>  <br><br>Ah, didn't know that!<br>Only played this game recently on my PS3</br></br></br>  <br><br> Through fire, justice is served. </br></br>  <br>mein negger, i played this shit when i was kid.</br>  <br>yep. loved it. the rhino was cool .think it was a rhino</br>  I know many have played this game. But in all honesty it was better than the movie.  <br>top fucking kek</br>  awesome soundtracks for a nes game.  <br><br>Tomba 2 and Crash Bash.<br><br>But seriously, loads of people played Crash Bash.</br></br></br></br>  <br>fuck yeah loved it</br>  <br>Reporting in.</br>  <br>Game was good as fuck.<br><br><br>Underrated game. Seriously needs to be played by more.<br><br><br>People behind Dynasty Warriors made this. Great fighter.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>      <br>Amen to that. That and the original Simgirls game</br>  <br>Same, that was awesome</br>  <br>Just bought this for $5 at local pawn.</br>  <br>such an amazing game</br>    Abe's oddysee, best fucking ps1 game ever.  <br>Dude! I used to love this game</br>  <br>Getting fucked in the ear by a black guy is better than the movie. But yes, that was one of the best games on the N64</br>  1/2<br><br>On PS1</br></br>  If you know this one you are my nigga  <br>Game isn't even rare breh.</br>  <br>Excalibur, PS1. It was a weird puzzle RPG Tomb Raideresque thing. Didn't like it.</br>  <br>Is it still possible to get this for pc or something nowadays?</br>  <br>kek they still have this shit on the shelf at the Family Video in my town</br>  <br><br>And 2/2<br><br>On PC</br></br></br></br>  <br>best puzzle platformer ever in general</br>    <br>you fucking overpayed if you did that recently. pawn shop owners are human scum</br>  you're all faggots and probably oldfags. please fuck off and let the new breed of /b/tards properly run 4chan.  <br>Ship battles were ahead of their time. Also semi-open world was too.</br>      <br>Oh god. I forgot about this, great game<br><br><br>Yeah it was a bit odd. Oh man, remember the old PS1 demos? Some amazing games there that never got full releases.</br></br></br></br>  Here's another fun, but hard to find classic.  <br>Grandia II and Skies of Arcadia are the top DC RPGs bar none.</br>  <br>I don't know. It's possible, but it was an Only On Xbox game I think</br>  <br>i swear i cudnt even get halfway thru that game i was so retarded</br>        watch here http://huieka.tumblr.com/  <br>The link above is a scam, don't click it.
