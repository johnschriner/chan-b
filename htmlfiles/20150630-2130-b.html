What's so good about this album ? I played the first songs and that's not that good..</br>  Steez 4 President  no doubt about it.. these guys were italians but their death metal was really something!  <br>Because chance is relatable</br>  your jimmies get rustled, you lose. you lose, you contribute<br><br>- green texting is retarded and the narration style it employs is even worse<br><br>- feminism is pretty great, it gave us all these young tight pussy to bone with minimal effort and commitment, if you missed out on easy pussy in middle/high school and college, its your own fucking fault<br><br>- there is nothing wrong with gay marriage. gays aren't destroying the sanctity of marriage, liberal divorce laws are.<br><br>- single mothers by choice, and i mean BY CHOICE are not brave heroines that society wants us to think they are, they're grossly irresponsible for willfully subjecting their child to a statistically proven shittier life in every conceivable category.<br><br>- liberal arts and humanities programs should be eliminated from all but the best 100 colleges in the US.<br><br>- cigarettes are not that bad when used in moderation<br><br>- EDM has the shittiest most militant fans out of any genre of music because they're insecure about the fact that some people consider it to be not music<br><br>- religion isn't holding us back as much as the media is<br><br>- pedophilia will never be legal, but polygamy and incest are up next for legalization<br><br>- vaping is not "better for you" than smoking, it looks ridiculous too<br><br>- the amount of time we waste blaming poor people for public welfare is ridiculous, especially when corporate welfare is a much much bigger problem</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  sex makes babbies  there was no conspiracy behind 911<br>there was no conspiracy behind jfk<br><br>moon landing was complete bullshit though</br></br></br>  <br>exactly. there is no moon</br>  4chan is a huge psychological experiment by the CIA  not having to live in africa is a pretty good reparation  <br>Rack up another failure to the CIA.</br>  This is a scientific fact rather than opinion, but bootin' anyway.   Talks shit about green text <br> Uses green text writing style <br><br>- religion isn't holding us back as much as the media is<br> Amen brother <br><br>The media pushes division in this country because that's what the elitists want. Yes it is a conspiracy but not like those tin foil hat wearing Alex Jones crazies say it is. It's class warfare plain and simple, always has been &amp; always will be. <br><br>Also America is an empire, soldiers fight and die not for our freedom but to maintain the American Empire. <br><br>All that being said America is still great, way better than China, the current up and comer.<br><br>Lastly all psychopaths &amp; drug addicts should be weeded out and put into forced labor camps.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> china <br><br>will collapse before 2020, i guarantee it.</br></br></br>  -if you wear glasses, you already appear more stuck up and shittier by default<br>-people into certain subcultures (furry, MLP, and some others) deserve ostracisim because they tend to ruin everything under the guise of protecting such hobbies<br>-PC gamers are worse than xbox and playstation gamers due to their need to feign superiority at all times. The truth is PC gaming is bad if you do not make a ton of money or shit golden spoons because many games do not run or run with very butchered graphics on casual, typical PCs.<br>-MOBA games are essentially copy paste cookie cutter bullshit games. So are fighting games.<br>-EA is not a bad company; it targets the appropriate fanbase and maximizes profits. It is doing what a business does, and while the way they gain money is more controversial and upsetting compared to other companies, they do it for a reason: It works.<br>-Valve is overrated and Gabe Newell is too. Their original IP's end up becoming worthless, so they have resorted to pumping source sequels for the time being.<br>-Valve and Nintendo have business practices that are just as bad as EA, sometimes worse, but because Nintendo made Mario and Valve made HL, CS, TF2 and others, they are somehow better than EA.<br>-Stepping on the american flag is fine, but it depends on what statement the person is trying to achieve. Someone should not be told and harrassed to leave their home because they are expressing symbolic speech in relation to why they do not like the way things are going<br>-The US military will never be bested, not because we are the most refined or because we have the best tech, but because we have the best talk; it is all bravado.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Trips speak truth. <br><br>Also, so long as I'm bootin:<br><br>Homosexuality has been legalized as the next in a series of degenerations America and all empires must take before their collapse. The nation will be stricken down by God likely in the next 100 years or so. <br><br>Democracy is inherently shit. Your opinion doesn't matter if you don't know what you're talking about. <br><br>And chocolate tastes like shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I Really like this thread, I have barely even disagreed with anything  <br> cigarettes are not that bad when used in moderation <br><br><br> Smoke only additive free cigarettes. <br> Have no addiction/urges. <br> Haven't smoked in 3 days. <br> No negative effects. <br><br>y do people smoke with additives again? They give everything else such a bad reputation...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  race relations in this country was much better before civil rights and during segregation  black people play the blues, niggers rap  <br><br>You can go into Prison with the age of 14 (in the most Countrys) but you arent allowed to fuck who you want with the same age.</br></br>  <br>if the girl does it, she doesn't have to go to prison, no she's just "misguided" or is having "an identity crisis" and given help instead</br>  If you're a caucasian male and you have an Asian immigrant wife then i consider you a pervert  This current generation is taking things of little importance way to seriously (i.e. video games, movies, sexuality, cartoons, entertainment media in general). <br><br>Bravado has nothing to do with US military success. Money, experience, compartmentalization, and long term strategy does (we are willing to play the long game). <br><br>Every one says they hate hipsters, even hipsters because it's cool to hate hipsters. <br>Hipsters = posers<br><br>If your a poser I will call you out in public, fuck you, you dick riding wannabes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's hard to believe you could be so right about one thing and so wrong about two other things.</br>  cream was the best band of the 60s. <br><br>the beatles fucking suck</br></br>  <br> all bravado <br><br>Having worked in joint multi nation commands and operations, I can assure you it's not all bravado.</br></br></br>  the increased amounts of deviant lifestyles is a result of the population explosion, some people arent meant to reproduce  <br> This current generation is taking things of little importance way to seriously <br><br>What exactly IS important, faggot?</br></br></br>  <br>Nigger please. Stones.</br>  <br><br> current generation <br><br>erosion of major institutions and the rise of the internet, is causing a lot of people to lose direction in life. it's not their fault.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>they have a handful of good songs, everything else is just a derivative of those songs. fuck the stones faggot</br></br>  <br>eric clapton is a talentless overrated faggot</br>   sex in a platonic relationship is healthy <br><br> there is literally nothing wrong with being LGBT <br><br> while i am happy with the output of the same-sex marriage thing in the USA, i am disappointed with the method used <br><br> marijuana (as a recreational drug) and cigarettes should be legal only when you're at home or in a private place. no one wants to inhale your fucking smoke in public places </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And Cream has exactly one memorable song. Back off bitch.</br>  <br><br>Where to begin...<br><br>-- I don't hate Marijuana or think it's bad, I just think people are stupid as fuck and act like jocks or some shit when it comes to it, so I don't want it legalized. "oi man i jus smoked a whole bowl man-" Nobody fucking cares. <br><br>-- White people suffer from racism more these days than anybody else in America.<br><br>-- Cops are bad people, but you know who else are bad people: Everybody.<br><br>-- Republicans are just angry old-asses who can't get with the times. They're shit.<br><br>-- Democrats are softy normies who can't get anything done. They're shit.<br><br>-- America is still the best country.<br><br>-- Memes are still funny, after a certain amount of time of not seeing them.<br><br>-- Cigarettes aren't addictive unless you have a mental illness that makes it so.<br><br>-- ZeRo is a mild Smash 4 Player at beast.<br><br>-- Sequels, Remakes, and Reboots of movies are usually better than the original/the previous one, like The Karate Kid (2010) and Clash of the Titans, as well as Star Wars Episodes II and III and Tron: Legacy.<br><br>-- Being Pro Life is fucking stupid. You aren't alive til you are born. That's part of the definition of being 'born' you fuccunts.<br><br>-- There will never be a Nuclear War. There will also never be nuclear disarmament.<br><br>-- I'm afraid of dying before we get the technology to live forever/upload our consciousness into robots or computers n shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  All narcotics should be legalized and readily available. It will be self sorting and in a year the only ones left will e those who can handle their party or don't use.  I'm a Christian unironically. I work in a scientific field.  <br>Politics, history, mathematics, psychology, philosophy, physics, personal health, world events... Things that have real life applications, get you a better job, &amp; make you a better informed voter. <br><br>A hobby is a hobby but when it's your entire life, it's an addiction.</br></br></br>  <br> There will never be a Nuclear War. There will also never be nuclear disarmament. <br><br>I feel like these statements directly contradict each other, unless human life ends before either thing can happen. Because, as long as nuclear weapons exist, someone will eventually use one in a populated area, and, unlike when the US nuked Japan, so many goddamn countries have nukes now that one used on a city is almost certain to cause a chain reaction of every nuclear armed country nuking everyone.<br><br>It may not happen any time in the conceivable future, it could be 10,000 fucking years from now, if people are around that long. But time, as far as we know, is infinite, and according to scientific estimates, it's about 5 billion years till the sun dies.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Look at Mexico.</br>  <br><br>Well, whose to say that we won't leave Earth behind, along with our Nukes, never using them? It's not impossible.</br></br>  <br>Kekked</br>  <br>Why is that important? Cause you said so? I have a degree in philosophy. You know what I do for a living? I drive a truck. Video games are more important to me than philosophy, or driving a truck.<br><br>Nothing that ever happened in any of those fields you mentioned during my lifetime ever affected my life in any major way. So I disagree.</br></br></br>  <br>Couldn't agree more, but I hate the mentality of everyone being shit. While mildly true, it's often better to try and find silver linings or look to the better side of people.<br>Also, I really dislike trans people. Never met one who wasn't either an asshole or insane. They also freeload the fuck out of lgbt groups considering there problem stems not from sexuality, but their own mind</br></br>  <br><br> -Feminism is pretty great <br>Nope.<br><br> -there is nothing wrong with gay marraige <br>That's not an opinion, more-so common sense, but whatever.<br><br> -religion isn't holding us back as much as the media is <br>In Murica, both are holding you back as much as each other.<br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/624914352#p624922631">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  the gay marriage legalization became another excuse for straight white people to show each other how "progressive" they are. it's disgusting.

I had a hand in setting up most of the puzzles in 2014.<br><br><br>I was recruited a few years ago by a mutual friend who saw potential in some of my intellectual pursuits and the positions my career led me, as most were before the puzzles began.<br><br><br>I am not representing Cicada at this time, sorry. :(<br><br><br>That is really one question. Our intentions are what we have said all along: privacy and liberty. That being said, the further along you are in the organization the more privy you are to some of the more "esoteric" concepts we utilize. The unsettling part, and the part that has recently caused a split in the organization actually is our significant power. Our sphere of influence is global, but it doesn't just stop at the political level. I guarantee that everyone on this board has at least once been familiar with a project Cicada has had a hand in kickstarting.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  POST A PUZZLE HOMO  <br>what where your intellectual pursuits?</br>  I THINK THIS GUY IS LEGIT   High RAnking <br> Cicada <br> on 4chan <br> MFW <br>Nice try Based anon</br></br></br></br>  <br>they recruit on 4chan you fucking sperglord</br>  <br>why do you care if your identity is compromised?</br>  <br>Whats your view on the Patriot act, Jade 15, and TPP? Also, what do you think about the general privacy of the average American? How much can the government get from the average citizen?</br>  <br>yeah you fucking sperglord</br>  <br>Do you get paid by this cicada 3301 group?</br>  <br>wow youre an idiot</br>  why recruit on 4chan, full of pony-loving-nigger-ginger-jew-spic-<wbr>hatin white supremecist, that are more fucked up in the head then the average mental patient.<br/></wbr>  Op, are you currently recruiting? Maybe not in this thread but in general?  But ike isnt Cicada a branch of some french division of ISis?<br/>  <br>What do you look for in recruits? Why do you choose to recruit some people from 4chan?</br>  Did Op died?  OP, I want to believe  <br>Do you clean laundry im confused</br>  Do you get paid?<br>How do people normally get recruited?<br>Requirements?</br></br>  bump for OP  <br>any of your members musicians or actors?<br>Are there global facilties?</br></br>  bump  <br>I was fascinated by concepts and people like sacred geometry, the flower of life, Nietzsche and Crowley etc etc. As most members know, these are some of the organization's core pursuits and values.<br><br><br>It's a good job.<br><br><br>The general privacy of the average American has been compromised. If someone with the means to do so wanted, they could find out everything about you. Everything.<br><br><br>Yes.<br><br><br>The organization isn't recruiting at the moment. The 2012 recruitment wasn't incredibly successful, though the other two showed promise. There has recently been a split in the org however that has demanded much of our attention.<br><br><br>As much emphasis as we place on technical skills, what we really care about at the end of the day is where your core values lie and if they are similar to ours. We recruit from 4chan because we've seen many things born on this website spread like wildfire, but still kept "under the radar" if that makes sense.<br><br><br>Yes, many of our members are involved in the arts. Not so much actors, but many prominent filmmakers and musicians.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No you aren't.</br>  <br>how much monies do you get for yo shit</br>  When is the next recruitment and how old must you be?    <br>what technical skills must you have? do you make a difference in the way that we live? is there a way to show support for something like this even if per say i couldnt be a part of it</br>  <br>Ya give me all da monies to keep u safe pl0x</br>    <br>by checking your dubs</br>    <br>All the monies.<br><br><br>There are no immediate plans for recruitment at the moment. There really is no age limit.<br><br><br>Really the same skills that were required to solve our puzzles. But there are so many different factions of the org with varying skill sets that it's really dependent on what you're hoping to contribute to the organization. As far as showing support, I would suggest studying up on some of the concepts I've mentioned and applying them to your own life, as well as rising up through the ranks of society. If you do that and are in the right place at the right time, Cicada will find you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you are bugs?</br>  <br>youve mentioned sacred geometry and the flower of life which ive done a little reading and understanding of, mainly the flower, appreciate you anon, ill do my research</br>  <br> Nice meme </br>  <br>When is the last time you went outside?</br>  <br> When is the last time you have sex? </br>  <br> rising up through the ranks of society <br><br>all u need is the monies</br></br></br>  <br>how many gigabytes have you hacked?</br>  where am i posting from?  why should we believe you?  <br>What is your response to the "Leaked" documents of past Cicada members claiming in ominous tone that there are impure intentions within the group?</br>  <br>Yeah if you're a bug, why should we believe? how can you even type?</br>  Also, Sacred Geometry, Nietsche, Crowley. Are you a Masonic organization? I learned back in 2011 about your organization and alot of the leads of the puzzles lead me to question my Mason friends about my findings. They were a little off put and seemed not to know, but of course this was when I was in High school, they were not even ranking Masons yet.  <br>One of the main things that put me there was the Masonic art I found along the way and The Most Holy Trinosophia.</br>  My life feels so empty and meaningless, do you have any advice to make me feel more alive?  <br>how do i read to learn about being a hack?</br>  <br>vsauce</br>  What are your thoughts on Tekknolagi?  <br> Tekknolagi <br>this guy?<br>https://twitter.com/tekknolagi</br></br></br>  <br>I never told you to believe me.<br><br><br>I could understand how someone could find our methods intimidating. We have an incredibly wide reaching influence and the recent worry among the org has been whether or not we've taken enough preventative measures to remain incorruptible. I for one wholeheartedly believe in our cause.<br><br><br>We are not exclusively a Masonic organization. We do incorporate a lot of elements from Thelema however.<br><br><br>Learn, live and embrace the idea that one day you will be no more. Make this life productive. You are what you do.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  how do I get smart enough to become a member.

You need a mind for the perception of a flow to occur; the flow of time is a meaningless concept physically, and causality itself is really meaningless (that's why the ABL rule in quantum mechanics works).<br> I envy the dead. <br>If you really did, there's an easy fix within your means.<br> I've thought about this. <br>Apparently, not enough ;)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>what, is this the first time someone has gotten a post directly after another pertaining to subjects relating to each other?</br>  <br><br><br><br>Ayy niggas don't leave me hanging is it really a cicada video?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I aint clikin shit until I get info on what the fuck it is</br>  <br>right in that same boat anon.<br>any brave souls wanna check for us pussyniggas?</br></br>  <br>I'll bite.<br>We live in a universe where dark energy is the cosmological constant, which means accelerating expansion (without Big Rip) taking us asymptotically towards a de Sitter space configuration.

I don't know much of anything about the topics they reference and I don't consider myself to be of above-average intelligence. <br><br>I just think it would be really rad to be part of some super secretive underground group, if it really exists.</br></br></br>  <br> we have gone to deep <br>Clearly, a few have gone to the turbulent end of the grammar pool.</br></br>  <br>Oh I know what's gonna happen in greece.

And the weapon market moves the world (and all its wars)<br><br>Weapons &gt; oil</br></br></br></br>  <br> I just think it would be really rad to be part of some super secretive underground group, if it really exists. <br>But that's the raison d'être of the organization, even if they rationalize it to themselves in other ways in order to narcissistically maintain their self image as do-gooders and saviors.</br></br>  Sorry for the break!<br><br><br>The puzzles are unfortunately part of the recruitment process. If you'd like, you can look back over our previous puzzles.<br><br><br>Absolutely. We have a very practical approaches to our problems, but underlying them are our more "esoteric" belief systems. As far as the varying ideologies, you would have to ask each individual member<br><br>.<br>We do not believe in breaking the law. Though perhaps some higher ups in the organization that I am not aware of have intentions of their own in that regard. And yes, we have plenty of heavy hitters.<br><br><br>Secrecy is the key to attaining power. As for your second question, that is exactly why there has recently been a split.

I can assure you none is going to kill a man in order to stay in Europe.</br></br></br></br>  <br>what is this<br><br>about?</br></br></br>  <br> our greatest fail safe is compartmentalization <br>This answer is strange, as my question (as you well know) was regarding the safety of the rest of humanity from your organization, whereas compartmentalization improves the safety factor of the clandestine organization itself (cf. terror group cells).</br></br>  <br> You are what you do. <br>Start the reactor.</br></br>  <br>oh no, it won't be to stay. It'll be after leaving.<br>The euro will have little value in greece afterwards, but those Euros can still go to Euro gun salesmen</br></br>  So OP, what is your view on that "leak" you guys had of a guy who said that you guys ain't good news and told everyone to stay away? Was that true? Are your military connections true?  <br>am i on the list</br>  <br>how many people are involved in cicada 3301?</br>  How can you claim to be 'recruiting' people while at the same time saying that you are posting this thread unbeknownst to the rest of your organisation?<br><br>Wouldn't they ask where you found the recruits? If they ask how would you explain it?</br></br>  <br>Schindlers maybe</br>  <br>We're having a refendum that will pretty much decide whether we leave or stay this weekend.

Monetary union without fiscal and economic union leads to inevitable mercantilism by the strongest members (in this case, Germany). The union then will self destruct through self-cannibalism: first the weakest member (Greece), then the next weakest (Italy or Spain), and so on. And this is not an endorsment of Germany, for the trade surplus allowing it to do this is maintained not just through productivity but also wage suppression at home (who do you think really benefits in Germany, the average Germans? lol).<br>The euro's troubles were predicted by modern monetary theorists at its inception.</br></br></br>  <br>I have to admit that was pretty funny, even though it makes no sense.</br>  <br>I'll wait and see.</br>  <br>The majority of people in this thread live in those cities, you tool.</br>  <br> I have to admit that was pretty funny, even though it makes no sense. <br>doesnt know what schindlers list is<br><br>14 year old detected</br></br></br></br>  Shuffle your music, post the first five songs.
