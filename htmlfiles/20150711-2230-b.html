[ How does one over come depression? Is being sad and being happy decided by ourselves? Can we choose if we're happy or sad? Why does depression hurt so fucking bad. Please help /b/  Drugs helped me my man  <br>For awhile they were helping me too. But then I felt like the drugs just made me feel more sad than happy. At one point drugs weren't an escape, but a door to extreme fuckin feels</br>  <br>Yeah that is very true, i think what helped me most is i just stopped caring about anyting but myself</br>  I used to be pretty bad <br>Some bad stuff happened and I lost practically a year<br>I personally got out of it by thinking that everything in the future is up to me<br><br>No point sobbing over bad stuff and wasting precious time</br></br></br></br>  Couldn't spot a cringe bread, starting one now<br>Make me cringe so bad that the back of my head touches my shoulderblades</br>  <br>Dear lord, how are bronies getting laid while I'm sitting here masturbating?</br>  <br>This is why we have our children grow up with a healthy dose of hatred and disgust for shit like this.</br>  samefag  <br><br>I hope to god that isnt true.</br></br>  THE ULTIMATE TRIAL<br>How many videos can you make it through?<br>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5<wbr>KO4-EsrgQtdImJNMWgMpg<br>Good luck, you'll need it!</br></wbr></br></br>    <br>ONLY A COUPLE SECONDS IN THANK YOU FOR THIS GEM I AM SUBSCRIBING NOW.</br>    Kill it      You guys are hitting hard, keep it coming  <br><br><br>Maybe if you weren't so afraid of what people think of you and actually went out you'd find people with common interests as you<br><br>Why do you hide in your room, scared of looking dumb, suppressing anything you might like for fear of how it is perceived?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>She got like 20 years for that.

Anything beyond a quadcore is really only needed if your doing multiple things that require parallel processing. Games with the exception of shit like minecraft really don't tax your cpu all that much. You would be better served investing your cash in a SSD or better graphics card. SSD especially as your games would get bottle necked as fuck if your still on hard disk. Btw have I7 as well used to do game design so needed it.</br>  <br>You have no clue what you're on about. How would a hard drive bottleneck his games? They'll load slower but still run the same. Please provide proof. A new GPU I can agree with though</br>  <br>original core i7 965<br><br>bizzarly still costs £900 after all these years</br></br></br>  <br> gaming CPU <br> gaming <br> CPU <br> I thank God 3 times a day for granting me i7 <br> capitalizing the word god <br><br>Damn, it sure smells like summer in here.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>4690K at 4.5GHz<br><br>feelsgoodman</br></br></br>  <br>i7 4790k</br>  I5 3570k<br>Msi 760<br><br> nothing else mattersss </br></br></br>  <br>i5 4460<br>cheap but good quadcore cpu.</br></br>  <br> <br> what real advantage is there in an i7 for mainstream games<br><br> none really<br><br> simply for folks who like to keep their coolers running<br><br> a decent vidya card and a decent cpu is fine, except for the professionals, who live and die on the smallest percentage edge.<br><br> so, congrats edgelord.<br><br> AMD, and NVIDIA....top of the line CPU, Middle of the road card.

But why would you want to upgrade though? Whats the need?</br>  I've been running of the 4790k and Intel hd 4600, with an msi z97 gaming 5.<br>Actually kinda surprised, it runs games okay, but Christ do I want my 970</br>  <br>apologies, almost 7 years.

From the 3 second mark.</br>  <br>How new are you?</br>  <br>I hope she's okay :,(</br>    Pause around 0:27 in the video during the snap will be the clearest shot in the entire video. <br><br>Hands look bound but can't make out much more than that.</br></br>  <br><br>Hands and feet are bound, mouth is taped.</br></br>  <br>That's the rule we created originally so the government and officials could fuck off.</br>  <br>maybe instead of saying it actually fucking do it</br>  wtf?  rekt  <br><br>Oh forgot to add that she's wearing the same bracelet as in the photos. <br>Seems legit to me.<br><br><br> implying that Toaster Steve didn't really try streaming his suicide for all of /b/ <br> implying that anon didn't really post pictures of strangled girl before getting arrested for murder <br> implying that you're a faggot. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is this illegal?</br>  <br>Alright stopped where you said and managed to get a clear shot.</br>  <br>You must be new here.</br>  <br>He's shocking her.</br>  <br>Summerfag</br>  this shitty video again? the original OP should be beat for the poor quality of this shit.  <br>No shit, faggot</br>  <br>god no, i'm not a fucking monster, I just don't care</br>  <br>Shocking, isn't it?</br>  <br>Yes, quite.</br>    I'll try grabbing photos of each time he shocks her (when the room lights up).  <br>she is wearing the same bracelet</br>  <br>That's in bad tase-t</br>  <br>Such a boring "rape"</br>  more normal pics ?  <br>Yeah, same black/white on her right hand.<br><br>Check it.</br></br></br>  So I was looking at pictures of her she has cut marks or shock marks on her legs, that's probably her fetish, she likes cutting herself or being shocked. It's not fake just the way they have fun  <br>The first one reveals she's topless.</br>  <br>People cut their legs so no one can see they did it. Thats a sign of a cuter, not a fetish</br>  <br> can't tell the difference between cut marks and shock marks <br>Are you really that sheltered or is it just summer in here?</br></br>  <br><br>Yes it does you fucking idiot. If there is no victim, and everyone partaking in it is consenting, how can it be "Fucked up."? Why do you give a shit what they're doing.</br></br>  <br><br>Actually 6 years on my back. Just don't wanna get V&amp;.</br></br>  <br>God you're an idiot. You do know people that say summer kids are usually summer kids themselves, or people who just got here, so I suggest you shut your candy ass up, take that knife in your kitchen, and shove it up your candy ass!</br>  <br><br>nobody ever fucking said it wasnt the same girl in the vid<br>the reason people call fake is because this is obviously gf + bf roleplay</br></br></br>  Went frame by frame in premiere and got a few shots. Rolling shutter makes it hard to get a good frame.  <br>Stay buttmad, faggot. Atleast I can differentiate between a fucking cut mark and a shock/burn.</br>  <br>Delivering as best as I could</br>    <br>How do you know he has a candy ass? Did you lick it anon? Did it taste like strawberries or rock candy? Hahaha summer faggot</br>  <br>that's probably the best one we have</br>  <br>I altered the contrast settings so it looks more visible (although not by much), but don't think I'm gonna upload the whole thing. I'll share it if I do, though...</br>  <br>That floor, enhance on the reflection</br>    can't wait for not-summer so that everyone stops calling fucking everyone a summer fag.    <br><br>Summerfag</br></br>  <br><br>Who are you replying to, samefag?</br></br>  Girl is having to much pain from the dude tasing her. (you can hear it clearly)<br>this issent roleplaying...far from.</br>  <br>That's two different people.</br>  <br>Sure it is, now where are you going with this, anon?</br>  <br>Well...do you??</br>  <br>Damn. Honestly this doesn't seem like roleplay to me. Got a shit ton of BDSM under my belt. <br>Especially with the recording.</br></br>  <br>No</br>  <br>Enhanced and highlighted to some degree. Polished floors but no real reflections except for the light</br>  This is some fucked up shit  <br>Seconding this.</br>  <br>Keep enhancing, I think I see a table with an envelope in the reflection, we might get his address.</br>  And no one has any info on the girl? Probably give a clue to where she is. Crop top part of face from the tit pic and run image searches if possible  Somebody upload this to mless or something, don't really want to download it.  <br>Marks are visible here. Looks like scars on closer inspection</br>  <br>/b/ has become CSI Miami and we can enhance a blurry photo until we get crystal clear info.</br>  zoom in and enhance  <br>Could post in /gif/</br>  That's some "Dark" shit.  <br>Sauce plsss</br>  We CSI nao  /b/ is the internet. <br>One doesn't simply "post" something without /b/ going ape shit on it.</br>  <br>I need sauce</br>    <br><br><br>Pussy fucking newfangled niggers.</br></br></br>  <br>First day?</br>  <br>7 years.

Not sure what to use for webms also.</br>  Hi MEGAfags  <br>Source</br>  <br> and a whale. </br>  <br>jesus christ shut the fuck up holy shit<br>calling sauce on that makes you a newfag theres no digging youself out of that</br></br>  Apparently she's still wearing her beanie too.

If you know why don't you just let it be known. Other people are interested as well.</br>  <br>Nice catch anon. I don't think the video is going to bring anything to the table though.<br>Best chances are the pictures in daylight. Odds are she has photos of herself on the internet. Just need to reverse image search and hope for best.</br></br>  <br>moralfags and moralfag supporters<br> thread </br></br>  damn it boner why  <br> Everyone on /b/ has a mental issue <br> getoverit.jpg </br></br>  Story behind this?    <br>yeah, but some of us are good enough to hide them from psychiatrists/psychologist and appear perfectly normal to the rest of society.</br>  bump!  <br>A subtle feeling in my stomach tells me you're an edgy euphoric neck beard. Not that I disagree. Most people here are fucked up except for the 12 year old autists from 9gag and reddit who think they're cool browsing 4chan not even knowing what the fuck is being said.</br>  <br>im not your friend, tard. the fact that its unsaucable is what makes you so new</br>  What's the interest of this video?<br><br>I don't get it.</br></br>  <br>lol. So soms anon "picked up a hitchhiker, took her home and tased and raped her"? Bullshit. Any news article?</br>  <br>Not to sound edgy or anything but most "normal" people don't go to a site where every other thread is "lolli (aka i'm too scared to own CP)" "s/fur" "r34" "pics you're not supposed to have" and "gore/rekt"</br>  <br>Well then, anon, you seem pretty new yourself! Everyone is friends here in the wonderful land of /b/! Pardon my autism, I'm not an avid porn critic!</br>  <br>True, as I said, I agree. I've been here since I was like ten and can almost surely say it's what caused my sociopathy and hallucinations. I grew up Seeing this shit it's like my home. Just got a slight euphoric feeling.</br>  <br>l0l</br>    <br><br> edgy euphoric neck beard. <br>exact opposite, which adds to the unsettling concern that there are many fucked up people in society that appear perfectly normal and you wouldn't have a clue who they are.</br></br></br>  <br>and /thread</br>  loli      <br>MODS MODS MODS</br>  <br> loli <br>posts toddler<br>fuck this shit.

It is a color. Have you ever heard of a pigment?</br>  <br>Youre not really "looking" at it though</br>  <br><br><br>Tetrachromaticism. Apparently, some women have it too. It's incredibly rare,tho, and it manifests by them being able to tell apart shades of existing colors that look identical to normal people, NOT by seeing a new color.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>you can all fuck off because this shit is real</br></br></br>  this conversation has 2nd grade written all over it. if you guys ever get the internet sometime you should really check out a website called wikipedia.  I just did. It's like red but not really  There are in fact other colours, just none that exist in our light spectrum.  <br>octarine</br>  <br><br>Blue and red are at opposite ends of the color spectrum, they don't mix irl, only in your brain.</br></br>  OP is from 918  <br><br>Then they aren't colors, idiot.

Look it up. Crazy shit.  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>WTF</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I only see a mix of purple and pink, what should be so special about magenta? I don't understand.</br></br>  <br>http://www.popsci.com/article/scien<wbr>ce/woman-sees-100-times-more-colors<wbr>-average-person</wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Yeah but birds can see into the UV spectrum cause this extra receptor absorbs higher wavelengthsthan human eyes can see. <br>Ive also read that dogs, with only 2 receptors cannot see red but instead see shades of orange. Likewise i would expect birds to see new colors beyond violet that we cannot even imagine.</br></br>  <br>thats what a girl would say</br>  Did you know that there is no screen that can create the color yellow. It's just red and green pixels. When you mix the two in pigment form you get brown, but in light form it creates yellow.  <br><br>I work in design and most women don't know a thing about colors or which colours to combine etc.</br></br>  <br><br>Not because of the extra receptor, bees can also see ultraviolet. The eyesight of a bird would be incredibly dense for us, but it would look more like an explosion at a paint factory than some "color out of space" shit.</br></br>  <br><br>it's grellow</br></br>  THIS THREAD IS GOLD    <br><br>Did you read the article? She doesn't see "new" colors, she can just tell shades of the same colors apart that appear identical to everyone else. She's like a reverse colorblind.</br></br>  <br>is gold a color?</br>  <br><br>It's called "yellow".</br></br>  <br>No, it's an illusion. Everything we see is just a dream. You shouldn't believe everything you see with your eyes, because it isn't always what it seems to be.</br>  <br>A screen could create yellow if you make a screen that displays 100% yellow pixels.<br><br>It's not like it's not technological possible but that's how most screens work, they mix colours to create another colour, and this is not only about yellow.</br></br></br>  <br><br>YES AND THE BEST METAL, PROVE ME WRONG</br></br>  <br>best meDal</br>  <br>why, my peenus weanus of course :)<br><br>hahah! :D<br><br>it's my weeeeeeeeenus peanus! :) haha<br><br>Try to imagine a color that doesn't exist - my answer is, of course, my peanus weenus :D<br><br>hahaha!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>IF, YOU EAT A STEAK IN YOUR DREAMS AND WAKE UP FULL, DID YOU REALLY EAT? IS YOUR BRAIN LYING TO YOU, OR IS IT ALL A DREAM?</br>  <br><br>Is it as good as Uranium, a metal that not only is heavier than gold but that literally kills people just by sitting next to them?</br></br>  <br>No, gold is more a property than a colour.<br><br>It's some brown, yellow, orange and the right reflection properties. If you were to make gold in an 3d rendering application it's more about the physical properties of the material like reflection, fresnel etc. than the actual colour.</br></br></br>  <br> yellow pixels <br>From wikipedia<br>Quattron is the brand name of an LCD color display technology produced by Sharp Electronics. In addition to the standard RGB (Red, Green, and Blue) color subpixels, the technology utilizes a yellow fourth color subpixel (RGBY) / He argues that, due to industry-standard color spaces used by content providers, there is no existing source material that contains the fourth color channel. He further states that any "extra" colors displayed must simply be created in the television itself through video processing, resulting in exaggerated, less accurate color</br></br></br>  <br>YES but to touch it is death, though cool its not the best, im talking about practicality. gold is why your CPU can run as fast as it douse, try putting cancer metal in you machine</br>  <br>You dreaming of eating a steak is only a dream in which we have inside this fake reality. So in reality, everything that you experience is not actually what it is. It's a dream.</br>  <br><br>Nigga, gold would get reked by uranium in a second. It'd be all YO SITTIN IN MAH CPU CHILLAXIN, LOOK HOW SHINY I AM YO and uranium would be all TSSK FOOL QUIT YO SITTIN, IMMA NOCK U DA FUCK OUT, SHINY-ASS NIGGA</br></br>  <br>Uranium doesn't kill you fag. there's literally just 0.7% of natural uranium that's radioactive. the rest is harmless.</br>  MILF thread!
