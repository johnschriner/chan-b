[ Trips chooses what I watch on Netflix.  Roseanne<br><br>too bad there's only 1 season of it</br></br>  The Nick series of teenage mundane ninja arseholes.  Spartacus, muhnigga.  <br>The first episode of Rosanne 50 times</br>  <br>A 50 episode season.</br>  The league... If you haven't already!  The entirety of Trailer Park boys  Human Centipede 1 and 2  Sex: how it works<br><br>It's actually a very interesting documentary, you should watch it regardless if this is trips or not.</br></br>  The last episode of Lost.  <br>Bunraku</br>  Louie  <br>my mistake, it's like 3 seasons</br>  &lt;normal looking women<br>&lt;make them all look obese<br> <br>http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/trendin<wbr>g-now/women-video-game-characters-g<wbr>iven-a-%E2%80%9Crealistic%E2%80%9D-<wbr>makeover-171116488.html</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br> More realistic... <br>Sure... If by realistic you mean fat.</br></br>  <br><br>We never said feminists and fat women were logical. Women are the niggers of gender. They are lazy, shiftless and liars. When someone has more then them they don't work for it. They beg for it or pass laws to get it and hide behind the word privilege knowing it can be lied about or changed in new arguments much like religion. Allowing them to use the word indefinitely.<br><br>Women will aspire to nothing as a collective. They biologically seek the best mate, seek to raise kids etc. They "objectify" themselves to get the highest value male. The ones that are ugly or fall short somewhere fall by the wayside and call for feminism and fat privilege in a desperate plea to get attention from these males by thinking society will fix biological tendencies, not knowing biology is the creator of society. They are ignorant, ugly and low value mates and will die alone from a pulmonary embolism in an Arby's parking lot.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>*more than them.<br><br>Not then..<br><br>Typo</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the woman in video games shouldn't look like the average women. they aren't average, they are highly skilled killers/spacetrekkers/warriors/etc.<wbr> obviously they are going to be trim</wbr></br>  <br><br>I've seen women at the gym who look like girls out of the video games.<br><br>I'll be damned if I maintain having abs and some definition etc as a guy and have women say a fit woman is unrealistic.<br><br>Fucking cunts.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  How about get of their asses and get to a gym?

What are we gonna do about this now? <br><br>Holy fuck you are a faggot. You know what we would have done years ago? Fucking nothing. you know what we will do now? Fucking nothing.<br><br>Oh right you thought 4chan actually used to have l33t haxorz that would spring into action and somehow bring down hollywood for mentioning a website. <br><br>Just kill yourself you pathetic newfaggot.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  The same thing we do every night Pinky.  <br>Nothing, because 4chan isn't what it use to be. Everyone on here is a newfag and newfag only. No old fags exist anymore, they left when it started getting filled with cancer.<br><br>Source: Friends with some extreme oldfags (One was here since the day 4chan was made)<br><br>4chan has become a pussy ass website where nothing happens. Deal with it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Its over man /b/ aint what it used to be. <br><br>years ago shit was real, but the website as a whole is infiltrated with total fags. its over dude. it started when things were no longer for the lulz but for justice and shit. then the le legion came and watered it all down. its over man</br></br></br>  <br><br> Implying anyone was capable/wanted to do anything about this even before the cancer. </br></br>  <br>That is the original short film that served as the inspiration for the new movie.</br>  <br>idk man i remember like the cuts for bieber and shit like that not long ago, there were a few real raids, but idk, my buddy is an older fag, ill have to ask him if shit actually went down in the past</br>  This fucking movie has ruined my Space Invaders tattoo that I've had for over 25 years.  <br>More interesting shit happened, yes. Because /b/ wasn't just 100% porn and ylyl/cringe. <br><br>But you're fucking delusional if you think we were ever capable of doing shit because Hollywood mentioned 4chan. Cuts for beiber and raids do not equal some how taking on the movie industry. Stop being a faggot.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm sorry for your loss, anon</br>  <br> We wouldn't have allowed this years ago <br>Yes we would shut your fat fuckmouth</br></br>  <br>Man thats the attitude that is why nothing happens, i mean trust me dude, I saw a thread where a guy wanted help on a poll for his office and over a thousand people voted, if you have that many people you can acomplish something easily, with a bit of creativity. its never over</br>  <br> Source: Friends with some extreme oldfags (One was here since the day 4chan was made) <br>Well shit aren't you the coolest fucking kid in the special class</br></br>  <br>You don't seem to grasp the fact that a bunch of shut in NEETs/socially retarded 12 year olds raiding random websites or voting on some faggots poll does not mean we are capable or were ever capable of doing anything about adam sandler mentioning a fucking website.<br><br>I don't even want to know how we would accomplish it, I just want your idea of what we would actually do to him? Come on faggot, give me your best.</br></br></br>  <br> Enjoy an Adam Sandler comedy </br>  <br>write thousands of terrible reviews and spam shit about the movie, say 1 million people read those and half decide to watch something else, at 1$ a person the studio lost half a mil<br><br>500 NEETs with nothing better to do would only have to put in about 10 minutes each<br><br>its the simple things man, its not even about the movie, its just that 4chan is lost, and no longer united, and flooded with newfags<br><br>change is coming and who knoews whats gonna happen, moot is gone, and the rule of the oldfags is over.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This</br>  <br>kek your delusional. Just how fucking new are you? Go back to reddit.</br>  <br> 4chan <br><br> deciphering Alien Transmission <br><br>Hmm, i wonder how that went...<br><br> Hey faggots, trying to decipher this alien transmission, help me out? Pic related. <br><br> I found it out: Ayy lmao <br><br> Fuck off newfag, aliens aren't real <br><br> OP is a huge fucking faggot retard <br><br> OP sucks with his fake bullshit, this is now a spiderman thread </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 4chan is lost, and no longer united <br>Shut up and stamp on your own cock you're mourning something that never was</br></br>  <br>legion was real back in the day man, people really got together to acomplish ignorant meaningless things<br><br>like pools closed and shit like that, hundreds of people teamed up all the time for shit, and it just dont happen anymore</br></br></br>  <br>top.kek</br>  <br>sauce?</br>  <br>Honestly, I think the best thing that can happen is doing nothing and letting 4chan die. Some people may think it's already dead but I'd probably say it's more like a walking corpse right now. Thing is, once 4chan dies completely, head removed and all, we'll find another place to hang out and that'll be that. The cycle will repeat a few years down the line but that's okay because we'd have to do is wait for our haven to die again and then move.<br> What if they follow us? <br>They won't. Once 4chan dies, the fad dies and people have to go back to their miserable lives, unsatisfied by the lack of edginess in their diet.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah because it's all been done and it's not interesting any more. When the internet was just blossoming and you could scare people en masse just by saying you're a hacker without even proving anything those sorts of things were fun, but now everyone is savvy and if you do a "raid" everyone just thinks it's dumb... because it is. Things change, let it go.</br>  <br><br>yeah man yall are right</br></br>  <br>to see if he got any worse. theres a point when an actor becomes so bad they actually become worth watching</br>  <br>do people are spend time typing all these words on the internet? what the fuck do you want us to believe</br>  there's really nothing to be done here<br>movie is one of the worse reviewed of all time<br>studio expected it to bomb, but not at hiroshima levels<br><br>I suppose we could take credit for this unfortunate turn of events anyway</br></br></br></br>  <br>dont lie you mustard fart hound. this is how you find 4chan.</br>  <br>I'm gonna be real honest with you now. I was on top of my gf, Beverly, making intense painful love when it happened.<br> Powerful thrusts, on a sultry hot evening. All the windows closed. The heat turned up to about 82, so it gets sweaty and hot. <br> Heavy breaths. My hips slamming down on Beverly, her trying to get away cause she does not like it. <br> I hear a sound, a tap at the door, my youngest son, Kenny, little boy. <br> Beverly screamed, "Kenny, no! Leave!" <br> I said, "Honey, shut your mouth. Let the boy watch. He's old enough. He needs to learn, the way I learned from my father, the way he learned from his father. Let him be witness to what is being consecrated here." </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>  implying any of are capable of leaving /b/ <br><br>face it we're all deprived cucks</br></br></br></br>  <br>And it will have more 12 yo now, as they'll come here after discovering 4chan in the movie</br>  4chan is mainstream now  <br>Bump for this, are we doing this?</br>  <br>like pic related</br>  <br>why not? if we get popular our army will be strogner and than we can hack a lot more than we will be truly feared and than we can take over 9 gag and redit</br>  <br>Oh shit</br>  <br>fuck you</br>  <br>Kek</br>  <br>How old are you</br>  <br><br>this</br></br>  <br>No one actually saw that movie</br>   more normies will find this site <br> they will find the loli <br> they will do everything hey can to ban it outright or just ruin every thread worse than spiderman does <br> 4chan will eventually become facebook 2: electric boogaloo </br></br></br>  <br>sounds about right</br>  <br>good thing you said literally, I would have thought you meant figuratively cashing in a n those things you said<br><br>faggot</br></br></br>  <br><br>This.<br><br>And the damage is not in someone mentioning 4chan.<br><br>The damage is that....4chan, at some point in its history, became worth mentioning.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Source: Friends with some extreme oldfags (One was here since the day 4chan was made) </br>  <br>Don't be such a faggot about a shit movie.<br>Let them keep /v/, hell, throw in /mlp/ too.</br></br>  <br>underrated post</br>  I can imagine thousands of lil niggers searching 4chan.com  just saw it, ama.  <br>How shit is Pixels compared to other Sandler shitfests?</br>  <br><br>its a road movie more than anything. its based around the retard and his special abilities. the other characters are along for the ride.</br></br>  <br> 4chan.com <br>kek</br></br>  <br><br>/b/ is different kind of weird/funny now.<br><br>You can NEVER bring back the pre-2005 internet.

You guys just have to find joy in whatever was funny when YOU were 20-something. <br>Yes.

original.</br></br>  <br>Is that what that pacman shit was?</br>  stop crying for the olf /b/, I am here since 2007 and I only fap  <br>thats right, many fantasies<br><br><br> The damage is

Don't let this happen to you.<br><br>No that's not my penis, but I'm scared dickless that I MIGHT be HPV positive. Fucked a chub last year and found out a couple days ago that she has warts. Bitch has no idea when she contacted it. <br><br> 2015 <br> Trusting women.  <br><br>FML.<br><br><br>So yeah, I had no idea I could have just been vaccinated. Instead of blaming prudish society, I'll post this PSA. Also general STD thread.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I posted something else but seeing as it's and STD thread I might as well.<br><br> be 25 <br> just out of long relationship. <br> drunk <br> drunker <br> found sweet ass bitch to lay. <br> would do again but <br> herpes <br><br>I'm freaking out.<br>3 days later and no signs but I was wondering if anyone could describe the actual feeling of symptoms. Not a description like every MD site.<br><br>As for the vaccination I've never heard of it. But that sounds like an awesome idea seeing as dick warts would be the epitome of bitch repellant.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>UNCUT MASTER RACE LOL</br>  GG STUPID PEOPLE DONT GET TESTED  <br><br>I'm now paranoid that every little penis wrinkle is a sign of HPV. I worried that this paranoia will induce a manifestation of the disease. Don't laugh, I could start a whole thread on manifestation and a list of coincidences from my personal life. Also, my grandmother has a strong belief in it. I normally would think she's just being nutty, but it has happened too many times. Either way, I want to clear my head, and not have the worst case of self fulfilling prophecy. Can't wait to get tested and pass.</br></br>  <br>I'm 31, too old...</br>  <br>SHE TOLD ME MONTHS LATER THAT SHE WAS BURNING THROUGH THE DICK, NO FUCKS GIVEN. WAS GOING TO FUCK TIL SHE DIED. <br><br><br>I had no idea that I was literally sticking my dick in crazy. I can only hope that her death wish came AFTER our sex.</br></br></br></br>  I thought HPV caused cervical cancer but had no effect on men.  <br>Is it impossible to get vaccinated? Absolutely impossible? <br><br>Loom at that dick, anon. Look at it. Don't you think your penis deserves a greased $20 or whatever it takes to guard against that wrath?</br></br></br>  <br>It's not about the cash. It's about vaccination requirements. With certain things, after you pass the age, you're outta luck.</br>  <br>THIS IS WHY I MADE THIS THREAD. <br><br>Feminazis lit up Mike Douglas, but you can die from eating rotten vadge. Literally dying from a throat full of warts and cunt cancer.</br></br></br>  <br> take a paper towel <br> pour vinegar on it <br> wrap it around your dick <br> tape it shut <br> leave it there 20 minutes <br>if theres any areas that are infected they will be whitish when you remove it</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dude have you heard about condoms? Symptoms may not appear in 10 years but you may be a carrier, go to a doctor and get your seminal conducts cut off so you may not procreate stupid bastards like you.<br><br>Enjoy your dick while you can.</br></br></br>  <br>Shit b8 m8.<br>If you're a man you can't die of cervical cancer. Because you don't have a cervix. Is the only symptom of HPV cervical cancer? I thought it was, in which case it has no effect on you. I may be wrong, correct me if I am.<br><br>Genital warts are a completely different STD.<br>P.S. YOU DON'T HAVE TO TYPE IN ALL CAPS TO GET YOUR POINT ACROSS!!!!!1!1!!!!!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh, P.P.S. checkem.</br>  <br>What bullshit. We should get a pass for not being born before it was created. My son is getting his vaccine long before he even knows what his dick is really for. <br><br>Why did I have to be such a man whore. Hopefully I'm safe and the bitch got infected after me. I found out because my friend fucked her recently and is freaking out. Had I known he was trying to fuck her I could have warned him. <br><br>Is there anything he can do legally? She fucked him knowing that she was contagious.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>LOL it is because HPV goes off the body after your thirties.</br>  <br>Lies, nigga. The HPV will rape your throat like a cervix. Look up that shit. There are image search results with a mouth full of warts. There's also a dude with enormous anal warts bigger than your nut sack. HPV is the most common STD and can wreck your life. No cure, but there is a vaccine. Save your benis, Bros.</br>  <br>I'm not sure. HPV isn't a death sentence, like HIV. I don't think intentionally infectiong someone with it carries the same ramifications. I'm not a legal expert, though.</br>  HPV-vaccination is only useful BEFORE any kind of sexual activity, because 50-80 percent of the population carry the virus.<br>Also, i never heard about a vaccination for boys, only for girls, because of cervix cancer, although, it is linked to various types of other cancers too.</br>  <br>A friendly graph.</br>  <br>IT doesn't just disappear. The Powers that be have determined that it isn't safe for anyone older 26 to get the vaccine.</br>  <br> dont put any vinegar on your actual pee slit or it will burn, you dumb nigger. </br>  could be worse  <br><br>...b...b-but I DID wear a condom...</br></br>  <br>Boys can be vaccinated. Check the guideline, age seems to be the biggest restriction. There are 2 vaccines.</br>  <br>So nice choice, still you have a slight probability if the infected girl's tissue touched some of your unprotected skin, the first symptoms will be kind of like the ones that you feel when you get a cold and of course a rash in the affected area that will generate a white and wet burst. DO NOT MOTHERFUCKING TOUCH IT and go see a doctor immediately.<br><br>Unfortunately for you, if you are infected you will have it for the rest of your life and may appear when your defenses run low by stress or another disease or may not appear anymore, it is about luck and how your system interacts with the virus.</br></br></br>  <br>Was this her by any chance?</br>  Creepshot thread.
