When I tried to turn it on it said it needed charging. So I charged it for a while but no matter how much I charge it it just says it needs to be charged more or it gets stuck on this logo screen thing. Plugging it in to my computer doesn't do anything. There's no card in the side slot either. I've never owned an iShit so I don't know if this is common, had to run to a gas station and pick up a charger. so that's $7 wasted.<br>Well I don't know what the fuck to do with it, so 69 decides what I do.</br>  <br>Wow you are one pathetic piece of shit</br>  <br>thats probably why someone left it.. just to troll some dumbass with a phone that doesnt work.</br>  <br>sell it to a phone store dumbass</br>  <br>Put it up your ass</br>  Hold sleep, home, and volume up button all together unbricks iphones  Hold phone between your ass cheeks and run time trials  Smash it  Stab it til it blows up.

Good thread OP  bump  <br>I think it was a knife, thats why the customer grabbed him. He probably thought it was a gun at first, when he turns around he looks at the Suspect in the eyes, see's the facemask then steps back. After seeing whats in his hand at 0:6 he takes the guy down, suspect ends up possibly stabbing himself in the heart?

They have one hold. Are you looking at some other map? In case you somehow are, this () is the OP's map.

I wiped out all of the brotherhood from new vegas with nothing but a robot dog and a sniper with PTSD by my side.</br>  <br>Well, space marines can go into space... so......</br>  <br>Space marines no contest. Their normal guns fire exploding bullets the size of baby fists</br>  sometimes I wonder if I should even reply to these shitposts but nevertheless.<br> spacemuhreens </br>  One Space Marine could leather about 5 brotherhood of steel members, keep in mind how big space marines are too!  <br>It's actually fire .75 caliber.</br>  <br>humans vs super humans with 100s of year of experience compared to 20-40 years</br>  <br>Is this a motherfucking joke?<br><br>The Space Marines are genetically enhanced super soldiers that stand at 8-9ft tall. They're raised on combat like babies on milk and have what the BoS would call "bug guns" by default.<br><br>The Brotherhood of Steel are just regular hicks with training and antiquated technology. Good against wastelanders but not compared to a force like the Emperor's Finest.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not all of them have hundreds of years of experience. They have new recruits just like anyone else.</br>  <br>That is an absurdly large round. Baby fist might be an exaggeration, but the explody part isn't.</br>  <br>That's true. But the rounds are proportionally shorter; more like a large pistol round than a rifle round.</br>  <br>Also forgot to mention that Space Marines are genetically modified to have 2 hearts and 4 lungs. They almost never get tired.</br>  <br>Space marines vs halo Spartans</br>  Round 2<br><br>Zerg vs Tyranids.</br></br>  <br>but still they are in war with deamons, orks, tyranids and eldar the worst thing wastlanders deal with are deathclaws and merlocks with the occasional raider group</br>  <br>Zerg. The Ultralisk is indomitable, and the Zerg would just consume and refine the genetic code of the Tyrranids after each kill, then produce their own stronger ones.</br>  <br>Batman</br>  <br>I'm playing with Boone and Rex right now on my current play through!<br><br> Boone and Rex best squad </br></br></br>  <br>But their "new" recruits are raised in simulations for years, and genetically enhanced.</br>  Holy shit this is an unbelievably massive stomp. One fucking space marine would destroy the entire BOS (providing he had enough ammo).  <br>SPESS MUHREENS hands down. <br><br>The BoS would do pretty well against an Imperial Guard detatchment until they brought out the artillery, but the BoS is in essence only a heavy infantry unit with no artillery or air support, thus they are an inferior force to any properly outfitted combat regiment.</br></br></br>  <br>That doesn't matter. What matters is that they would turn the BOS into puddles in about 3 seconds.</br>  Praise the emprah  Ayy dont mind me  <br>And the have METAL BAWKES</br>  <br>All tyranids do the same thing. I think it'd be an even fight.</br>  Ok. As it can be seen. The space marines win, <br><br>Thank you, /b/ros. <br><br>I'll make a new thread later.</br></br></br></br>  the tyranids would also do the same with the zerg so it would be a never ending evoloutionfest  <br>bitch, the 'nids do the same thing.<br>However, the 'nids would start with a huge advantage cause of all the SM and ork shit they've absorbed already. Would take the zerg a while to catch up</br></br>  <br><br>and STEEL REIHNN</br></br>  <br>pretty much. <br><br>The BoS are good against light infantry in skirmish scenarios, you know, like what the entire wasteland is made up of. <br><br>Against a real army with any type of support they get outmaneuver fast.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>this<br><br>A more plausible question could be 1 young and inexperienced space marine vs the entire brotherhood of steel, every chapter. The space marine would probably win without much trouble though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Also, aren't tyranids less like an insect and more like a plague? My grasp of the fluff might be a bit off, but isn't it almost impossible to eliminate all of them once they get started?</br>  <br><br>Fair point. I don't actually know much about the 40K universe.<br><br>The zerg have incorporated Protoss in their genetics and have hybrids now (although not part of the main Swarm), so there's that for them.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> implying they arent the same thing and it isnt taking place in the same universe. The terrans in starcraft are the remnants of a badly failed colonisation attempt during the age of expansion or the dark age of technology or something. They're seperated from Earth and doing their own shit. The great crusade is gonna roll through in starcraft 4 or 5 and clean out the protoss. </br></br>  <br> Protoss are basically less kick-ass eldar, so tyranids still have advantage there.<br>Just about any major race/army in 40k can kick the shit out of (almost) anything else from any other sci-fi universe cause they all are in an unending war against each other.</br></br>  <br>uhhh spartans maybe? im including armor abilities like cloaking and such. and i feel like theyd be quicker</br>  <br>To be honest, the more I think about it, the more I think the tyranids would steamroll the zerg. The zerg are like the tyranids 50k years in the past. The tyranids have fought and dominated each of the species in the 40 universe, except for the Necrons. You have to understand that 40k war is on a galactic scale, not a planetary scale. Most races in 40k don't give a fuck about single planets.</br>    <br> implying warcraft and starcraft aren't just cheap knockoffs of warhammer fantasy &amp; 40k. </br>  <br>but but liberty prime</br>  <br>You'd think so, but you couldn't be more wrong.</br>  <br><br>nids have the same thing but with the eldar, another psionic race like the protoss only significantly more powerful.</br></br>  <br> Mechwarrior universe(all factions pretty similar apart from clans) vs imperium of man <br>I know jack shit about warhammer but i love the mechwarrior lore and story</br></br>  Space marine. No contest OP.  <br>Dubs checked<br><br>but Liberty prime is the equivalent of a single Imperial knight</br></br></br>  <br><br>space marine armour was developed and built between 10 and ~38 thousand years later. The space marines themselves are several orders of magnitude more advanced than the spartans and their gear is similarly superior. I remember reading somewhere that a space marine in full battle dress can sprint at around 130mph.</br></br>  <br>Titans<br>Imagine mech warriors, only a mile tall with weapons able to wipe entire cities off the map in seconds.</br></br>  <br> drop a couple titans <br> outmech them in their own universe </br></br>  <br><br> 'nid hive mind </br></br>  <br>Really?<br>WH40k lore is so over the top, comparing it to other stuff is pretty dumb. I mean i love WH but its stupidly OP that is why its awesome.<br>BoS guys are regular people with a strong anti-wasteland armor.<br>Space marine is genetically modified sociopath with one or two additional hearts, augmented brain capacity, integrated with the space resisting armor, they carry canons that rapid fire and melt enemies. And that is just the default kind.<br>Specialised marines can drink blood to heal themselves, others communicate with wild animals while others withstand highest or lowest temperatures possible.<br>And fucking Ultramarines the supermen of WH40k...<br>BoS would just /life</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A titan could step on liberty prime. Much as I love liberty prime, the BOS is just outgunned in every possible way.<br><br>Dude, space marines would destroy all of halo, no contest. Every race in that game could ally vs one chapter, and they would get their collective shit pushed in. Tanks in halo are light enough that one dude can flip them over. 40k has walkers that make godzilla look small.</br></br></br>  <br><br>well the imperium is several thousand years more advanced and is the largest and most powerful empire in the galaxy, literally spanning from one end of the galaxy to the other and around each spiral. So I doubt they'd struggle much.</br></br>  <br>the houses and clans do the same and have been traveling space for about a thousand years. excluding the titans i feel like theyd have a chance. granted im not sure how big their armies are.</br>  <br>That's the problem with comparing stuff to 40k.<br>Basically everything else is relatively cheery 'if we do X then humanity is saved'. In 40k humanity already reached their height, so they have endless 'Humanity, Fuck yeah' levels of OP to throw at the enemy, even if they're boned.</br></br>  <br><br>Hell, all of mechwarrior vs. mars would be more interesting.<br>Still a slaughter as the mechs die in their thousands, but interesting</br></br></br>  <br>are we including the forerunners? because one dude wiped out an entire city in one ship</br>  <br><br>all space marines can eat any material, btw. They can sustain themselves by eating rocks in a pinch. Drinking blood is more of an affectation some of them got from one of their glands that they use to consume knowledge (yes, they canliterally eat their enemies to learn what their enemies know)</br></br>  <br> one city <br> billions of worlds <br>You're still thinking way too small scale to even consider sending anything against the adaptus astartes</br></br></br>  <br>it was just an example. not stating all of their accomplishments</br>  <br><br>well something in the order of a hundred billion imperial guardsmen die in battle every day, the population of the imperium is measured in the quintillions and they have the industrial output of almost the entire galaxy put into producing essentially nothing but war machines and war gear. So the armies are uh, big.</br></br>  <br>the forerunners controlled three million life bearing worlds and once they took all there was they began building their own planets</br>  <br>40k is actually more than 10 thousand years AFTER humanity has reached their height and started the decline. It's mankind's final struggle against the dark. It might take several tens of thousands of years more for the end to finally come, but this is it, there is no saving it.</br>  <br>C&amp;C i Know</br>    <br>The same can be said about Zerg vs Tyranids<br>Here is how it would go down:<br>Kerrigan comes with 2 worms carrying basic infantry into the fight. They start corrupting the planet and terraform the ground. Day 10, the pretty much have 80 of one small country covered in terrain. They spot a small group of tyrannids... They slaughter them.<br>They thing they won the war... They take over the whole planet in the next month.<br>Queue the sound of devouring wind as Kerrigan loses the sight of the sky underneath endless dark tide of beast-storm devouring anything (INCLUDING THE FUCKING LAYER OF DUSTY LAND WHERE U WALK ON) <br>It's the hivemind fleet of Tyrranids, reducing the planet to a rock. As the Karrigan and many legions of Zergs fight in the center of storm, the tide of Tyrranids is endless, their weaponry unlimited ... and its only one of the endless hive colonies. Even if they fail at devouring every single one of Zerg they would die to being tired.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The eldar built their craft worlds, the deamons of chaos build and change worlds all the time in the eye.<br>3 million worlds is about the size of a single military campaign in a single sector for WH.</br></br>  <br>Join us brother, we are your only salvation.</br>    <br>One city? May I direct your attention to the phrase Exterminatus. One ship, one planet, no more planet. They use something called cyclonic torpedoes that bore into the mantle and returns the whole planet to it's infancy, just rocks and lava without an atmosphere.</br>  <br>At the same time, just because fuck your shit, the entire surface of the planet is scoured clean by bio-engineered viruses. God-Emperor bless the Inquisition</br>  <br>All your women will become fucktoys to the swarm!</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=h67<wbr>JpMyrOVE</wbr>  [ ]</br>      <br>the covenant can do that silly. They turn the surface to glass.</br>      <br>Yeah, but that takes a fleet, and they have to cover the whole surface. This is a few ships burning a crater and one firing a round so powerful it restarts the planetary life cycle. Glassed worlds can be terraformed after some time, and can even be habitable after cooling.</br>  <br>A challenger appears!</br>  <br>Gotta go with Brotherhood of steel since wearing a space marine suit would pretty much break you the first time you took a step or rotated.</br>    <br>so glassing is better? becuase the planet is salvagable. It only takes a few hours and (rarely) at most 2 days to glass a planet</br>    <br> being retarded </br>    <br>Actually there is a babyfist sized bolt round, but thats for the Heavy Bolter, not the Boltgun/Bolter of the Marines. Human-sized bolt ammo is even smaller ( Kommisars cant wield Marine-size bolt pistols)</br>  <br> doesn't know how to read </br>  <br> Stalingrad <br> Also known as cadian boot camp </br></br>  <br>Glassing leaves the atmosphere intact in some cases, and the planet still has a surface. Exterminatus doesn't just kill everything, it takes the planet back to the state in which it first formed. The crust is fragmented and scorched, the mantle flows up and out between the cracks, and the atmosphere boils away into nothing. So glassing is less effective.</br>  a naked space marine holding a boltgun would still demolish a brotherhood paladin  <br>We put a lot of design effort into praying over those suits for SPHESS MEHREENS you sub-servitor pleb!</br>    <br><br><br><br>glassing is ok for the enemies its used against. but once the touch of chaos corrupts something, it can no longer be salvaged, hence exterminatus</br></br></br></br>  who the fuck needs space marines anyway<br>this asshole could kill almost anyone in fallout</br>  <br>The taint of the warp must not be allowed to spread, as well as the insatiable hunger of the Tyranid menace.</br>  <br>But could he kill Macharius?</br>  <br>holy shit<br>i'm pretty new to 40k<br>the more i read, the more metal it gets</br></br></br>  <br>Ha! Even if you can stop chaos, the great devourer is still coming. Kill as many scouting parties as you want, but soon the main fleet will soon be upon you.</br>  even one SOB would destroy the brotherhood. Astartes are just insane even naked. imagine a 500-800lb man on genetic steroids and backup organs ramming those tiny tin men  <br>that's the point. take inspiration/directly from everything in the 80's, make it metal/grimdark, and call it a game</br>  <br> Brotherhood of Steel. </br>    <br>It used to be a whole lot more metal</br>  <br>Doomrider says hi.</br>  <br><br>it is the metalest possible universe. It's literally a fictional universe where gods, supermen, aliens and monsters have been in a state of perpetual mutual war for almost 40 thousand years. On a hundred billion worlds a hundred trillion men battle an unending horde of horrors and have done for so many generations that no one can remember a time before there was war, because the only one who was alive before the war started is the god emperor of man trapped in a golden throne that keeps his corpse rotting perpetually without dying. So. Fucking. Metal.</br></br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>Hey Abaddon, how's your 13th fuckup going?</br>    Seriously, how the fuck is this a question? You insult the Ordo Malleus, the entire Adeptus Astartes, and the Emperah himself!  <br>still spazz marines.<br><br> again, no contest <br> instant coagulation of blood <br> dat armour <br> did i mention all the biological implants thta basically make them any 11 year old's wet dream? <br> because hey, im twenty and you don't fuck around with those who will find heresey and slap its shit </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> comparing units of obviously different classification </br>  <br>Don't worry, he too will be consumed.</br>  <br>except the war thing has been maybe ten thousand years, starting with the great crusade. bjorn remembers the time before that too, because he's been in a dreadnought for the whole time since then. the throne is life support</br>  <br>Except that what you thought is Creed is actually a carefully arranged group of Imperator-class Titans with Baneblade escorts.</br>  <br>the throne was supposed to be so much more than just life support, but magnus went and fucked that up.</br>  warlord titan vs entire fallout universe (including aliens)?  <br><br>well the eldar and the necrons and a few others were knocking about, fucking each other up, before the great crusade ever happened. There was already a galaxy at war when humanity joined it, the emperor just stepped in and won said war for a bit.</br></br>  <br><br>bitch blizzard basically ripped off every idea they've had from games workshop<br><br>this is like asking if a sweatshop chinese copy of a louis vuitton suit can match up to the original</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fine lets compare it to a dreadnought then, if thats too far compare it to terminator armor.</br>  <br> ...... <br> because its not like millions of space marines haven't been fighting for thousands of years and never managed to work their goddamn armor. </br></br>  <br>if all the weapons used in the war that created the fallout universe were used against a single titan, yeah there'd be a chance of bringing it down. but the way fallout stands post-war? not in even the most convoluted dreams of the followers of the eight.</br>  <br>liberty prime has nukes</br>  <br>They do have new recruits but on average they are 400 years old so its considerable more experience</br>   an open mind is like a fortress with its gates unbarred and unguarded <br><br>Fucking love the Librarian in the RTS games</br></br>  <br> implying the Mechanicus is useless <br> implying battlegear rites don't happen <br> implying </br></br></br>  <br> citation <br>new recruits are normal human ages, as they're recruited from normal human populations</br></br>  <br>*mini nukes</br>  <br><br>CREEEEEEEEEED</br></br>  <br>And he gets fucked up in Broken Steel.</br>  <br>nukes nonetheless</br>  <br>liberty prime can suck my death korps cock<br>the equivalent to a flashlight in the 40k universe would decimate liberty prime's asshole</br></br>  <br><br>well he said marines, not scouts. By the time you're an actual astartes you've had all your genetic modifications, had all your implants and organs put in and shit. A recruit proves himself as a recruit and starts on the path to becoming astartes, by the time he puts the power armour on he's a marine, not a recruit.</br></br>  <br>jokes on you, he has no asshole</br>  <br><br> walk softly and carry a big gun </br></br>  <br>Yes, but those are scouts or neophytes, which aren't real space marines.</br>  <br>not yet</br>  <br>new recruits are typically the best young warriors a planet has to offer though. And before they ever see a battlefield (even as a scout) they undergo years of indoctrination and some of the most intense combat training the universe has to offer. Most recruits don't even survive long enough to become scouts</br>  <br>i'm implying that the previous dude i replied to didn't know dick about how this shit works, the armor or the enhancement of supermen</br>  <br>I don't actually. Please explain how they fit in those suits. Are they stretched out by means of magic or something? Do they not have normal human proportions?</br>  <br><br> all this talk about space marines <br> no one mentions based Custodes </br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, kinda irritating that Warcraft and Starcraft are such blatant ripoffs of WH Fantasy and 40k, yet got way more popular.</br>  <br>Actually not true. Scouts have had all the gene-seed organs implanted, and that is usually completed by the time they reach adulthood.</br>  <br>i would like to hear this explained, I dont understand 40k shit at all, but i understand that if you compare it to anything it is just like super powerful, even starwars or whatever, 40k is just jacked up because the creators put everything on Buffout</br>  <br>You really don't understand the scale of destruction that each weapon of the Space Marines can bring.</br>  <br>Go on YouTube and look up 'Vaults of Terra' select any video regarding the space marines and prepare to wet yourself. This fucker explains everything canonically and manages to make it sound casual its almost believable that this could happen</br>    <br>GW ripped off Blizzard big time. Look at it all, such easily ripped off. Space Elves are just the Protoss. Tyranids are the shitty excuse for zerg. And the Imperium is a pathetic version of the Terran. Hell Dreadnoughts are just goliaths.</br>  <br>ion cannon in one hand</br>  <br>That's how I've always heard it explained but the suits have never made sense. The human body is around 7 head heights, hence my lines.<br><br>Unless space marines have insanely stretched out skeletons something doesn't mesh.</br></br></br>  What is it that this guy always says?
