[ rate my girlfriend  Tits and I will  <br>Tits and pussy</br>  7/10<br>i like they eyes, geve more, OP</br>  <br>trap/10</br>    ITT we talk about things you think about that keep you up all night.<br><br> Death, not existing </br></br>  Her.  I feel that, OP.  the guilt I carry about drinking and driving in the past.  CRIPPLING DEBT FROM STUDENT LOANS.  <br>Same. <br>And she's my closest friend.</br></br>  the fact no matter what i could ever do, humanity will plunge itself into chaos within our lifetime  <br>Everyone dies, and as far as anyone outside your personal life is concerned you may as well not exist. No one in China or even the next state over knows, cares about, or is impacted by the fact that you exist at all. Deal with it.</br>  Dealing with my rage I bottled up throughout the day.  <br>I think about how fantastic fucking her was and what I could have done or should have done rather than what I actually did, then I fap to her remembered tits and cry myself to sleep.</br>  <br>Are you me dude?</br>  <br>Wait, what?! Explain please.</br>  <br>Yes, hello me</br>  <br>Is there a greentext for this if its not too personal?</br>  <br>Stop trying to prevent it and prepare.</br>  <br>meet the real me</br>  <br>Right in the feels, and it's been a month already.</br>  <br>No, it won't you moron. This is literally the best time in the history of humanity and it's only going to keep getting better.</br>  <br>Unless you hurt anybody don't worry about bro, just don't do it again.We all mistakes.</br>  <br>i wanna believe that, but i keep seeing it in too many dreams</br>  <br>Why the hell would you trust your dreams over logic?</br>  <br> guilty <br> shame <br> ugliness </br></br></br>  <br>I really enjoy your optimism <br> inb4 not joking <br> inb4 im a pessimistic asshole </br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>sorry I was playing Star Wars. <br><br>When I was 16-18 I would drink until I was blackout drunk and then drive home. I remember driving in the wrong lane once. <br><br>Well anyways, I flipped my parents car off the side of the road one night. It rolled 3 times. I was uninjured. My dad came to save me before the cops got there. Even convinced insurance to cover it. But I have such deep regret for things that could have happened to OTHER people. I don't care about myself, but the thought of what a monster I was, kills me. And I'm not sure how to atone for it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   insignificance. <br> deciding between military and university <br> accepting loneliness. </br></br>  <br>just kill yourself dude, that's one way to atone for your sins.</br>  <br><br>Gees. Good thing is no one was hurt and you definitely learned your lesson so you've got that going for you.</br></br>    <br>No sympathy, you were a fucking idiot to do that. 16-18 isn't a kid either, so your actions aren't excusable with ignorance either.<br><br>That being said, what's done is done. Take it as a lesson, and never do it again. You have no reason to feel guilt, because you got lucky and didn't hurt anybody. Don't beat yourself up over it, you made a mistake and recognize it as one.</br></br></br>  <br>Swearing on the life of my unborn child, constant reminder that I'm an asshole and deserves every bad thing that has happened to me</br>  Making sure my son and daughter are taken care of in the future.  did I do the right things in my life?<br>where my choices good ones?</br>  Realizing that nothing matters at all.<br><br>Passing school, getting a job, being in a relationship, experiencing things. None of this matters because eventually you will die, and in 100 years no one will remember your name unless you've done something to affect the course of history substantially. Even people remembering you doesn't matter, because they will also eventually die.<br><br>Humans will never be able to explore the rest of the galaxy, if a spacecraft were to travel at the speed of light it would take 4.5 years to get to the nearest star. Everything is impossible. Imaginations will never be reality.</br></br></br></br>  <br>no.</br>  <br> I think human consciousness is a tragic misstep in evolution. We became too self-aware. Nature created an aspect of nature separate from itself - we are creatures that should not exist by natural law... We are things that labor under the illusion of having a self, that accretion of sensory experience and feelings, programmed with total assurance that we are each somebody, when in fact everbody's nobody... I think the honorable thing for our species to do is to deny our programming. Stop reproducing, walk hand in hand into extinction - one last midnight, brothers and sisters opting out of a raw deal.</br>    <br>As delusional as it might sound, there's a chance you might live forever. It's a far shot, but since technology processes exponentially, there's a chance of immortality. Read up on the singularity and futurology, I find it really comforting, even though it might be a bit unrealistic (not completely though).</br>  You niggers think too much. <br><br>Smoke a few blunts, eat a pizza and go to sleep. Life isn't as bad as you think.</br></br>  <br>figured as much</br>  My mom passing away.  <br>Money, job, food, insurance, gas, housing, phone bill, I just became homeless, I have nothing, my best choice is to sell my tv buy a gun and end it. All this time, effort, y? And for what? I hate God for bringing me into a poor family and ending me like this.</br>  Anxiety.<br><br>I'm fucking tired of this shit</br></br>  <br>That sucks man, I hope things get better.</br>  social anxiety, recurring suicidal thoughts, paranoia ( I think there's a ghost in my room seriously shit gets knocked over and I hear loud noises in the middle of the night and one time I saw some shit standing in my room) <br>I'm not schizophrenic</br>  <br>Sorry to hear that, hope you're doing alright.</br>  <br>talk to the ghost, it will help you with your social anxiety</br>  <br>fucking kek</br>  accepting that being alone is probably the best thing for me  <br>Put yourself in Cryo sleep</br>  <br><br><br>It's been a year now. I was just a shitty son. I did shitty things when I was younger and I wish i could've apologized to her and admit to all the lies and the drug use and everything. But I was a coward. At least I got to sit by her side up until the end. So I'm grateful for that. I just wanted to be someone she could be proud of. <br><br>Anyways sorry for rambling and what not just needed to get that off my chest. Hope everyone in this thread is doing alright. I wish you luck in your battles friends.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'll try man, I'll try</br>  Rekt Thread Anyone?  <br>buuuuamp</br>  Bump  <br>bumping because i don't save rekt shit on my pc but i want to see some fucked up shit..</br>  <br>also, inb4 edgy</br>  haven't had my daily dose of rekt<br>where they at?</br>  <br>just look in the mirror edgelord</br>  <br>ahaha called it. i knew some newfuck was going to say i was edgy. <br><br>also, nice trips</br></br></br>  <br>Nice dubs</br>  <br>thanks op. i don't think anyone is going to supply us with rekt shit though.</br>  <br>This is full of trips and dubs</br>  <br>I'm more pissed about him not letting the guy record</br>  <br>i have a sub to documenting reality. i need to learn how to make webms.</br>  so anyone got any?  Hb this fags  <br>please continue</br>  Rekt  Moar?  <br>very classy start.</br>  <br>That happened on the 4th of July this year in Florida.</br>  <br>why</br>    <br>Kid was holding a "fire cracker." I think it was a mortar though.Wasnt there but heard the story and saw other pics.</br>  <br>do tell story plz</br>  <br>That was quite an explosive night huh.</br>  <br>I don't know what I'm supposed to be seeing.</br>  <br>This picture is fucking with me. like how come we don't see more of this. Our guys got fucked up right here. Drenched in blood. So many words for this picture. Please give me a story.</br>  <br>kek</br>  <br>Allahu Akbar?</br>  <br>this shit happens all the time... the story is they don't like us because either they hate westerners or in the case of Syria we don't support them while they get shit on by their government and radicals</br>  <br>because the guys "protecting your freedoms" made it illegal for news sources (specifically newspapers) to post pictures of dead soldiers post 9/11. Believe it was Bushes call no?<br><br>They dont want you to see this shit because people might start questioning being their fucking pawns</br></br></br>  <br>Anyone have the vid of that dumb fuck who set that mortar off on top of his head?</br>  <br>I like how mudslimes say that after they manage to actually kill an enemy commbatant like they're actually proud of their accomplishment. Even though they've lost over a million Muslims and kill eachother as much as we kill them. But when they actually do get in a kill after several months of being dominated its ALAH AKBARD</br>  <br>plz</br>  <br>maintaining a positive attitude. good for them i guess.</br>  <br>goes back to ww2 but during Vietnam people started to publish pictures of dead soldiers and it started making people really protest the war i think from then after they "censored" media coverage of wars</br>    <br><br>JPP?</br></br>    <br>That's true. He also removed pictures of the cAskets draped in the American flag because it showed that men were dying. Sounds fucky to me.</br>    <br>yet people keep thinking ISIS or whatever new communist witch muslim boogeyman trending is the threat</br>      <br>infidel on far left looks like a dummy on explosion, clearly isis is CIA operatives</br>  <br>Well it's not so bad seeing a picture of a dead gook slumped over barbed wire, but turn that gook into an American and its gut wrenching. That guy was my neighbor who was forced into a foreign shithole by a draft to accomplish something that Today no one understands why we were even there.</br>  <br>that looks like the fakest shit ive ever seen</br>  <br>kek, also checked</br>  <br>and to top it all off, american soldiers after death are nothing but heroes. you see that picture posted on facebook of a crying wife or mother and the caption will almost always include the words, "died for your freedom," or "hero."</br>  <br>I have no doubt the CIA does that kind of shit on the regular, but lets not pretend like they need dummies. There is no shortage of people to kill when it comes to them obviously.</br>  <br><br><br>ISIS is a joke propogated by the media to fearmonger the people. The more we spread shit like this the more fuel they get and the more the media gurgles down the jizz of who owns them to just highlight whatever they can for views. Isis is for fags.<br><br>But, i'd still rather join ISIS than be a redditfag<br> Upboat for funnies </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Really was just some high school drop out with nothing better to do with their life so they took a free ride in the military and got to close to an ied.</br>  <br>Allahu Upvote?</br>    <br>Nice shot Hakim, you need glasses.</br>  <br>pretty much most of the marines/soldiers. <br><br>Either way, the economy and endless expansion of military is turning this country into a police state. Soldiers see everyone else as the problem coming for their freedoms, but the reality of it is the soldier lifestyle forces you to give up those freedoms, and fucking love it. Than you come back pretty much hating anything that isnt a bootlicker<br><br>Off course there are always those vets that come home super fucked up and than just star becoming really anti-establishment..... but thats much more rare</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>most idiots dont realize they are more likely to die from a cop (even if you arent a nigger) than any boogeyman terrorist</br>  something like webm monters (pls, no dross , no youtube  <br>Its because it's not real, this is training.</br>    <br><br>Hey OP, there are a series of those picture leading up to that final picture. Some sandnigger was on a moped drove up to those army guys and blew himself up. I had the pictures saved for a long time and finally deleted them because it was just to sad to have on my computer.</br></br>  <br>where do these videos get filmed?</br>  <br>no but cops come to you school and tell you they are there to help and you never have to be afraid of them, on the other hand the news says terrorist 47 times while blasting pictures of dead people and explosions at you.</br>  <br>Probably the same place Bruce Wayne was dumped in the Dark Knight Rises.</br>  <br>in a hollywood basement</br>  <br>Op here, <br>Damn sandniggers. You would've think one of us would've learned in asscrackistan (afghan) to not mess with the other. I've been looking for an explanation to this picture, thank you.</br></br>  <br>no its real its just very high quality and well shot for theatrics. not fake u must broaden your spectrum of possibility</br>  <br>the file name is isisdrowing so.. probably syria</br>  <br> soldiers <br> learn <br><br>kind of defeats the purpose of canonfodder</br></br></br></br>  <br>This really pleases me. Fucking saved. BTW, I'm American.</br>  <br> Soldiers see everyone else as the problem coming for their freedoms, but the reality of it is the soldier lifestyle forces you to give up those freedoms, and fucking love it. <br><br>nigga are you retarded?<br>there is literally no one more disgruntled with the shit that soldiers go through than the soldiers that go through it</br></br></br></br>  <br>Definitely looks like a vbied, or svied</br>  <br><br>yeah you know me.</br></br>  <br>but its same , just only in little proportion its real, i talk about monsters film on day, not aliens</br>  <br> trying to take my girlfriend on a nice vacation <br> she loves hot weather and sand <br> look up hotels in iraq <br> call the hampton inn <br> "sorry, isis has reserved the hotel for the entire weekend." </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's because Vietnam showed that to defeat the most powerful military in the world, you just have to make its population doubt the cause or the cost.<br><br>And defeat is defeat however the means achieved.</br></br></br></br>  <br>not really retarded, but its not very often (well not as often) you see soldiers come back questioning authority. They usually come back with renewed outrage out whatever minority the government is telling them to be afraid of.</br>  <br> That guy was my neighbor who was forced into a foreign shithole by a draft to accomplish something that Today no one understands why we were even there. <br><br>War on Terror in a nutshell. Stupid hillbillies think fighting an emotion is winnable. The fact that you are starting a WAR ON TERROR means you are already fucking terrified. That means you lost</br></br></br>  <br>Edgelord watch out... it pleased him. You're such a hardass</br>  <br>It feels like you're assuming that everyone in the military is just some sort of drone that believes and does anything the government tells them to when that really isn't true</br>  <br><br>Can someone run me to the hospital? I think I need stitches after that hard edge.</br></br>  <br><br>OP, here is the article<br><br>http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news<wbr>/world/afghanistan/story/2012-04-04<wbr>/Afghanistan-suicide-bombing/539866<wbr>52/1</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>yep, i think like you everthing is because iluminati and reptilians and the powerfful dross wiht his shit hystories</br>  The amount of autism in this thread is killing me.  <br>no.... but they fucking do it. So does that make them better or worse?<br><br>The reality of it is thats what the military does. Its meant to erase ones individuality and free thinking. They cut the hair to symbolize that. They teach you to operate on a "need to know basis" becuase they are taught their lives arent with that information. They are taught to do unethical things or get courtmartialed.<br><br>I mean obviously there are some really smart/great people in the military. However, the overall mindset that gets instilled is very dangerous and is prone to fascim. at least it seems that way</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There were a lot of things happening in the US during Vietnam. That both had to do with the war and didn't have to do with the war. I think all a country really needs is a reason to go to war and after that, it takes a great deal of people feeling very angry about the war to change anything.</br>  <br>I served 4 years in the chairforce and I fucking hate the US government.</br>  <br>poor attempt at humor</br>  <br>Ooh tough guy, stick it to the man!</br>  <br>You're just as retarded, shut the fuck up</br>  <br> daddy was in the army </br>  <br>the real life is how matrix?, somebody want to protetec the "system"</br>  <br>Good lord, you're fucking retarded. Please, shut the fuck up. Spent a few years in the army. Tradition of cutting hair is 1. Keep it short so the enemy cannot grab it if hand to hand combat, 2. It's more sanitary, less issues with short hair when you're out in the field for months at a time.<br><br>Fucking idiot. You come up with all this bullshit, and never even been in, so seriously, kill yourself</br></br></br>  <br>I was in the army</br>  <br>He died didn't he? I think he pulled his chute too late to survive the fall.</br>  <br>Go back to Tumblr faggot. The only ones who boast about saying they were in the military are the only ones that joined for the recognition.</br>  <br> Keep it short so the enemy cannot grab it if hand to hand combat <br><br>lol ya thats such a problem in this day and age. Holy fuck you are stupid</br></br></br>  <br>hey man , relax, all in this page is a joke</br>  <br>who said anything about boasting? nigga where you learn to read</br>  <br>more soldiers dead</br>  <br>I think you'd be surprised</br>  <br>Protect the sistem it's throw money from the poor and give it to the rich.. So use a 50.000 missile to kill some ISIS faggots works perfectly..</br>  <br>I don't get it</br>  <br>ya remember how many people used to die of getting their hair pulled back in the day. Oh man, almost lost WWII cuz of it</br>  <br>As a veteran of one of the less "indoctrinated" branches (navy) I will say that there is a remarkable insidious element at work regarding a low level service member's outlook on what they do. While nothing that could outright be considered brainwashing occurs in US military training, a high level of indoctrination occurs that makes the questioning of authority/orders seem to universally be the worse option. You are never broken down to be built back up as a drone/tool of the government, but you exist in an environment that robs you of your desire to pursue alternative options to shit situations. You end up either feeling helpless to enact meaningful change or that what change you can make is not worth the effort.<br><br>End result, you do what you are told. Not because you like it, but because that's just how it is.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh I know, just when I read stupid shit and theories like that, I wish they would just subtract themselves from this earth</br>  <br> not knowing a symbolic function can also serve a practical function </br>  <br>Ya everyone in the world does what their bosses tell them to do<br><br>Things like the hair cutting are done for a lot of reasons. It looks professional, you're representing the military so you have to look the part. It's easier to clean and doesn't get in the way of your eyes when you're using a weapon.<br><br>You will never be taught to do anything unethical when you join the military. You WILL be taught how to kill an enemy and defend yourself but no one is going to teach you their favourite waterboarding techniques. In fact they drill into you that if you find a wounded enemy no matter what they've done it's up to you to provide medical attention to them. If you go around putting bullets into people willy nilly you will be removed.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kek'd. Don't know why, but fucking kek'd</br>  <br>Military</br>  <br><br>fuck south africa</br></br>  <br>makes em stupid. But not better or worse</br>  <br>lol look how many butthurt army people you brought out of the woodworks</br>  <br>Less indoctrinated.. that's classic. Meaning you didn't do shit</br>  I came to see gore, not a bunch of faggots arguing.<br><br>Get back on track here.</br></br>  more rekt faggots    <br>  not knowing shit </br>  <br> spew retarded shit <br> people correct you <br><br>that's usually how it works</br></br></br></br>  Army, Navy, or Hairforce? Kek  <br>Top kek</br>    <br>....duckman (cartoon) say something same in the episode "dasbus" (when he are the teacher) and the asking of one studen was "our system be bad, but is the unique what we have"</br>  oh sh-  <br>kek'd</br>    <br>anyone that takes corrections on this website seriously.... well i dont know where i was going with that</br>  where are the clowns <br><br>send in the clowns</br></br>    <br> shit not knowing </br>    <br>broke leg but survived</br>  <br>checked</br>    <br>im going to call my friend, mr. jhonny bravo for to fix this fucking problem+</br>  <br>Boom.

To me, looks like some junkie bitch comes up and asks for change, this dude says no and she decides to throw her cigarette near the gas he's pumping into his car to be a cunt...

Efficiency is not the most critical thing to many project. For instance, an ATM machine software has among other things the requirement for error-free transactions, and secondly hardware portability. If the ATM is slow doesn't matter to them as much as those other things, so they won't use C (They usually choose Java for that). But thats just one example.</br></br>  People have a... favorite programming language?<br>I mean, I've used Lua, Java, and Python but I never really thought of liking any one more than the other.</br>  <br>Brace on the line with if is an oldfag style to fight the if statement getting separated from the braces. It is an aggravating bug to go find when that happens.<br><br>Other oldfag tricks: <br> if( true == variable) { cout &lt;&lt; "TRUE MY NIGGA!"; } <br><br>By placing your constants on the left of any equality test, you stop all the typo bug assignments when you mean equality testing.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>not mention java in bad way or good way? <br>my university is teaching the courses in java. should i be goin for somethin else?</br></br>  <br>Uhh do you even encapsulate br0?</br>  This is why I can't talk to anyone about coding. Fuck everyone else.<br><br>btw, braces-on-newline-masterrace.</br></br>  <br>It means Python is a great language, but indenting is supercritical in Python. One little bit of code too far left will totally fuck the program.<br><br>C# and Java only use indention as a way of prettying the source code. The compiler doesn't actually care as it knows how nestled code due to braces.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Dafuq is wring with you and your indentation?</br></br>  <br>Honestly, for banking programs I'd use C. It puts you closer to the machine and you know exactly what's going on.<br><br>With Java you're relying heavily on someone else, and we've all seen how insecure it is.</br></br></br>  This thread smells of freshman CS students.  <br> Using java <br> Using compators on boolean checks </br></br>  <br><br>While I agree with you for the most part (every language fulfills some purpose better than others), I chose Ada as my "favorite language" because, unlike many languages that it overlaps in capability, it is the one of the greatest accomplishments of humanity. Its a showcase of what humans can accomplish when a mega-fucking-super power like the department of defense puts their weight on trying to make a programming language to run on their half a trillion dollar shit. And its just so perfect I honestly sometimes need to walk around outside and get some fresh air just to keep myself from crying from joy that I was actually able to live this moment in history when a language like that not only exists but where I can actually drive this motherfucker.<br><br>So yeah, all languages have their place, but this one is.. well.. just talking about it makes me choke up. Its on its own level. And don't even get me started with SPARK.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>#include &lt;faggotio.h&gt;<br>#define FAGG()<br>printf("we have a faggot %s at %s", __FILE__, __LINE__);<br><br>int fag(int argc, char** argv)<br>{<br>while(1)<br>{<br>if(argv[1] != null)<br>{<br>printf("fag fag fag %-20s\n", argv[1]);<br>}<br>}<br>return 0;<br>}</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Java is a good language for beginners since it handles a few of the more complicated parts of other older languages for you. The problem is that it's not really efficient fwiw.<br><br>We started with C in my compsci course and I hated dealing with pointers and the like but it made the transition to other languages easy.</br></br></br>  Right is right. <br><br>Brackets go on the same line. Unless of course you're a pleb.<br><br>Source: I'm a coder.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Now, I know that a lot of different languages are used for specific reasons or reaching certain goals that other languages just cant accomplish quite as efficiently. Assuming you've had some experience, what do you think I should be focusing my energies on?</br>  <br>It saves time opening the file across millions of lines. It's convention. My first university taught my to leave the left bracket on the same line as my control structures. My second taught my to leave them on a new line. There's no benefit to the former other than giving those with a strong opinion against it something to whine about.</br>  Ya llego el Mexithread perras !!<br>Directo a las puertas de sus casas.</br>  <br>no lo tiene</br>  <br>Mas de ella?</br>  <br>mi ex</br>  bubble thread?
