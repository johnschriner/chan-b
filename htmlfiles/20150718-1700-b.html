Serious questions for smart responses. Why is the general merican population full of such retards? Such simple minded idiots that they constantly fall for manipulative evil fucks like Trump, Bush, the Republicunt party. Seriously, considering that the Republicunt party has ruined/hurt Merica's greatness more than any sand nigger...somebody explain why anybody in their right mind would vote Republicunt in modern times? Everything they do, think, feel, and every plan they impose pretty much fucks up the country in some way. And even when not in power, they do everything they can to fuck up any great solution and turn it to shit. Why does anybody even vote Republicunt anymore? Are many americans just plain retardo?  <br>The intelligentsia in America are apathetic and don't vote, they live in their progressive costal cities and think the rest of America is doing just as well or they just simply don't care</br>  <br>This.</br>  Califag here, the entire midwest brings the cumulative IQ of the US down by a lot.  <br>the midwest being populated mostly by conservative republicans</br>  <br>kek at the truth.</br>  <br><br>Midwestfag here. You're both right. I can't wait to leave this country.</br></br>  <br>Dont leave the country, just go to the East or West coast.</br>  <br>has so many laws they can't produce their own water during worst drought in over 100 years.<br><br><br>believes that everything should be free and not realizing you can't get something from nothing.<br><br><br>eager to jump off the bridge with his friends.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I live in missouri. Middle of nowhere missouri. The closest town has a population of 300, the next closest is about 6000.<br>Between those 2 towns alone there are 34 churches. The neighboring towns arent much better.<br>the majority populace is senior citizens and conservatives 55+ years old, comprising at least 60% of the populace. Now these fuckers are old and stubborn, and fervently deny change, even for the better.</br></br></br>  <br>They're just plain americans, they're born stupid.</br>  <br>/thread</br>   OP implying the Democratic Party doesn't do the same shit. <br>Nice b8 fgt</br>  <br><br>what is your nationality?</br></br>  <br>...you're the only one that took the b8.</br>  <br>And the Midwest.</br>  <br>Fuck. Than the baby Jesus for the internet and porn at least. Bc that sounds like a circle of hell.</br>  I wish trump got into office and deported all the beaners, but then again I don't like trump.  <br><br>Murricunt. I just honestly think most of us have a destiny of ignorance and low intelligence. Not our fault, we're born in a country that wants to keep their people in the dark.</br></br>  <br>fresh imported beaners have no money. trump LOVES money. its simple math.</br>  <br>A desalination plant would fix the water problem permanently, but I digress. Red tape slows all progress.<br><br>The Democratic party can be idealistic at times, but its better than the Republican party. Republicans are the reason why Congress is stagnating. They are against any type of improvement in society.<br><br>  Implying that trickle down economics works in the long term <br>  pro tip: it doesn't </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who do you think supported Bruce Jenner faggot ass to prance around on tv? You think republican wanted that? You got it all wrong fuccboi</br>  <br>Ok, then leave libtard.</br>  <br>It's not just Americans that are stupid. It's everybody. The truth is, it's just the most vocal and obnoxious people in any group that end up causing them to look bad to everybody else. Besides, when it comes to politics, its the same thing there. Both sides have simple minded idiots that are constantly manipulated by whichever political party. Hell, the two parties simply take on any issue they can so that they can guarantee the other party won't first. Just so they can get more people to join their party, that is in reality, a conglomeration of whatever voters they could win over in any way they could.</br>  <br> Why is the general merican population full of such retards?  <br>We have a crippled education system that often relies on idiot states like Texas to essentially regulate textbooks.<br><br> somebody explain why anybody in their right mind would vote Republicunt in modern times?  <br>Tradition, lack of education, lack of experience, misinformation, and straight up lying.<br> <br> Why does anybody even vote Republicunt anymore? <br>Above should answer.<br><br> Are many americans just plain retardo? <br>As I understand it, people base their vote on their accepted information and that may not always include facts, truths, or reality.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>power. the ability to move people in the direction you want, how you want, and when you want. either vote for it or be the subject of the vote.</br></br>  <br> Democratic party <br> Improvement <br> Same sentence <br><br>Hardly laughable.<br>You can't get anywhere with a reactive mentality.<br><br> inb4 we don't react <br><br>Reacted to Sandy Hook, Reacted to the confederate flag bullshit, reacted to everything except Benghazi.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Republicans are snakes and fakes. And many fall for their fake bullshit now.</br>  <br>I bet OP loves niggers and BBC...look witness my dubs faggots</br>  <br>It's foolish to assume that either party is good. Both in reality are only after putting themselves in power and pushing their agendas. Agendas that they only pursue in order to get more power by getting more voters. The democrats don't care about people anymore than the republicans do in reality. This is why so much of the United States population has such a high level of political apathy.</br>  <br>Better question: Why do you care what other people do? Brainwashed libtards like you don't understand government. You pretend to, but you just assume all republicans are bad and your system of government is better.<br><br> but... bbc said republicans are bad. <br> shouldn't you accept faggots? <br> hurdur, you're just some butthurt backwoods retard <br><br>Fuck off. It's 2015. Shouldn't you just grow up and stop being such snob cunts?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You a smart mofo. With this metric system shit.</br>  <br>Lawyers are fucking lying dirtbags who suck people dry to defend something they know is wrong.</br>  Dumping my pro-republican folder.  <br>Democrats are no better. All politicians are fakes. You shouldn't think that because you support one party that they automatically are exempt from corruption that is widespread throughout the political system. It affects both sides. Not just the side you are opposed to.</br>  <br>Please, take a dose of your own medicine and realize that the only good party is libertarian. It's the only one truly for the people.</br>    <br>The Republicans have several demographics locked up.<br>1) The Christian Right<br>2) The wealthy and the rich.<br>3) The "fuck you, I have mine" crowd.<br>4) Employees of corporations that are intimidated into voting Republican fearing for their jobs.<br>5) Single issue voters like pro-lifers and gun nuts.<br>6) People who don't want to see a single cent go to the poor, even if helping the poor would actually reduce the cost of things like emergency room visits and crime due to alcoholism, etc.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  No one is seriously considering voting for the lying cunt, are they?  Why is the world so obsessed with America?<br><br>Focus on your own problems for a change</br></br>  <br>Everything shouldn't be free, but it certainly shouldn't cost more than its actual market value under a truly "free market."</br>  <br>Yeah because liberals do a great job when they're in power. Just look at Detroit and Baltimore.</br>  <br>The Democratic party has created Obamacare, major immigration reforms, and legalized gay marriage. None of those things were reactionary and all of them were opposed by the Republican party.<br><br>  Reacted to Sandy Hook, Reacted to the confederate flag bullshit, reacted to everything except Benghazi. <br><br>You seriously think that the republicans would do anything different? How could any action dealing with those situations not be reactionary?<br>  inb4 republicans loosen gun control and allow the confederate flag to fly on federal buildings <br>cause those would be amazing decisions</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    Liberal logic    <br>Yeah, but they could never win in the shitty 2 party system with the Republicans as the 2nd party. And nothing has hurt the U.S.A more than then Republicans in the last 25 years. Even Reagan was not such a crazy Republican. He seems almost like a liberal compared to the modern conservative party. Any modern conservative would call his economic views communism.</br>  Liberals lack logic. They make decisions based on emotion. Basically a bunch of bitches.  We can't defeat the system people. It's too engrained into the very minds of the people. Both parties are too entrenched for any new ones to ever take hold. Both just assimilate any possible demographic in any way they can. It's been going on for so long that the only people who even vote anymore are those who buy into the rhetoric of the politicians, considering the majority of voters vote for no reason other than party affiliation. The rest are apathetic due to seeing how little power we really have in the government and the sheer amount of lies, political spins of stories and inability to truly make a difference in the government.  <br>Your truth makes me so sad. God bless America. A once great country.</br>  <br>this<br><br>democrat is the downfall</br></br></br>  <br>Im not trying to say that Democrats are good and all Republicans are the bad guys, but the democrats tend to advocate progress where the republicans seem to advocate stagnation.</br>  <br>To be honest I don't know very much about libertarians, so I can't really fully understand what you mean but I am left leaning on most issues. I'm sure this will damn me but if I had to vote in the Republican primaries then I would go with Rand. In Democratic however I would go with Bernie.</br>  Fuck liberals. Scum of the earth.    <br>The Democratic Party is mostly for single payer health coverage just like every other developed nation has, but healthcare is too lucrative for the insurance lobby and the Republicans to let that happen, so they created the monster known as "Obamacare" and actually managed to blame Obama for it. Healthcare is grossly overpriced.<br><br>I find it ironic that the Republicans want to deny healthcare to those who can't pay, yet they want to keep tight control over every chemical that can be used as a drug. If you could just go to a pharmacy and pay what people in most other countries pay for the medications you need, most people wouldn't pay more than 25% of what they're paying now for healthcare.<br><br>Fuck the DEA.<br>Fuck the doctors' guild.<br>Fuck big pharma that charges ten times the price for the same drug here than they do elsewhere.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>fuck the poor<br><br>kill them all</br></br></br>    <br>Fallacy in your logic.<br>Most the country votes Democrat.<br>Most the country is retarded.<br>Therefore most the countries people are retarded Democrats.</br></br></br></br>  Yeah, because open minded liberals are better than religious republicans.  <br>In every country half the people are dumber than average. Have you seen the various ass hats running European countries.</br>  <br>Why not. She is smart. And Republicans respect/fear her balls for than Obama. She would be great. Also, she has Bill Clinton as her private advisor. Clinton who was the best modern president the U.S.A has had and a landwhale fucking stud. Yeah...oohh, the emails "scandal". Yeah, like lying about a war like Bush jr did is not the real fucking sad travesty and another Vietnam. But oh...she...she used some private emails like others before her...OMG. Republicans point fingers so their true crimes are forgotten by the dumb.</br>  Republicans are the only good system.  <br>Simple. Rich white people vote for them no matter what because Republicans look out for their interests (cause they are rich white people too)<br><br>But hold the phone, they can't win the election with that small 1% right? So they think "How can we fool non rich people into voting for us?"<br><br> lenient gun laws <br> tough immigration policies  <br><br>Then they have a army of Rednecks that will vote for them even though Republicans will cause them to become poorer as they become richer.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Everything that you have said is laughable dumb bait</br>  <br>no republicans are the lesser of the two evils</br>  <br> most the country votes democrat <br>That's why republicans own both houses of congress right?</br></br>  <br>Look how shitty the government gets when democrats rule the US. Don't look at the little things, look at everything together. Notice how things are worse.<br><br>Now look at all the times we've been ran by republicans. Much better. Democrats are just retarded fags thinking everything needs to go their way.</br></br></br>  <br>Okay, question. Do you love the United States of America?</br>  <br> Countries shit <br> Blaming Republicans <br>Can I just assume you're in highschool?</br></br></br>  In a country where 350lbs+ disgusting hunks of lard can live off welfare and food stamps just fine and wounded veterans dont get payed shit at least 50% of the time and laws dont apply to the police whatsoever does a change of one person with barely any power over the entire system truly fix the problem? That is why voting for people is worthless plus all of the options suck and its probably rigged anyway  <br>That's why a nigger is in the white house right?<br>Republicans being in congress means very little with a Democrat President.</br></br>  <br> Voting for people is worthless <br><br>I'm going to assume that nobody you've ever voted for has won and therefore draw that conclusion that it must be rigged</br></br></br>  <br>no youre the problem you sorry assed bitch</br>  <br>Do we have to pull out the graph that shows how much republican presidents have eternally fucked our country, plunging it into debt?<br><br>I think we do</br></br></br>  <br>Keep on posting more of the same shit. Maybe someone will eventually think you're making an actual point rather than just posting a bunch of horseshit.</br>  <br>I don't. I hate it here. I'm shunned for being a straight white christian. I'm called a backwoods hill billy for saying I'm republican. But the freedom to be able to express myself is nice. And the availability and freedom of jobs is okay. Not great, but livable. Food and gas is cheap here.<br><br>Who do you ask?</br></br></br>  <br>I just dont vote honestly, as i said to me its worthless</br>  <br>That isn't an option, although giving out birth control and relaxing restrictions on abortion would help reduce their numbers. So would educational reform on a national level that takes the power away from local school boards.<br><br>The Republicans aren't so cool with those ideas, though, are they?</br></br></br>  <br>Like how we had a surplus under Clinton and faced an economic meltdown under Bush? You're an idiot.</br>    <br>chekt and rekt</br>  <br>Go suck bush off you nignog</br>  <br> Not understand that it takes years to see economic change. <br>Any negative reflection on the economy was just the aftermath of a Democratic parties influence.<br>learn2history.</br></br></br>  <br>USA! USA! USA!</br>  The United States citizens dont have a choice, and the media makes us all look stupid and fat. Also brainwashing, and propaganda.  <br>Are you actually retarded or are you just pretending to be retarded?</br>  <br>Shitty? You mean like when Clinton ran the country and had the Economy in great condition, so much so that he left a surplus to Bush jr. Who manage to completely fuck up the economy permanently and start a fake war/crusade based on lies that America is going to be paying for the next 50 years around the world in many ways? And now Obama who managed to fix the shithole just a bit, even with Republicans destroying every single plan they can to make the U.S.A better? Hilary is the best thing that could happen to the dumb dying U.S.A. She has more balls than Obama, she is smart. And she is respected around the world. She wont take it in the ass like Obama did from Republicans. They fear her so much that all they got is this email BS. Which is hilarious to see how they manipulate. But they started another Vietman for the country, but thats cool..bc its the emails that ruined the U.S.A.</br>  <br>yeah always wondered why every country is so obsessed with us instead of worrying about the 3rd world shit holes they live in.. you know fix your own crap before trying to fix the world kind of thing</br>  <br>/thread</br>  This country is rotting from the inside out. None of you realize just how bad it's becoming. Our rights are slowly but surely being removed. Censorship is increasing and being promoted as "progressive". A country that has freedom as one of it's national ideals now censors people and objects that may offend some people. I'm ashamed to be a part of a nation of people that are willingly letting themselves be ruined so blatantly. Politicians spin whatever story on the news into something related towards whatever agenda they are trying to push, minimizing the people hurt and the actual perpetrators or cause of the crime. This country today is a result of people who grew up with political correctness. They were told that anything they didn't like or agree with is wrong and should be silenced so that they feel better about themselves. This generation was raised to feel special about themselves and that the world owes them something. Now that they have grown up, anything that upsets them causes a public outcry that is nothing short of ridiculous. They can't handle reality and so they force others to conform to their standards, their views and their mindset or they are wrong. A man who landed an a probe on a moving object in space had to make a public apology for his shirt. All because it offended some groups of people. Too bad for his friend who made the shirt, the woman he was trying to support. A man gets shot after attacking a police officer and a whole city gets looted. Then the public outcry blames the officer and completely ignores the very people who wrecked a city. It's one thing to be upset about something. However, the public shouldn't justify their actions. The cop's actions don't justify theirs. There was even a mayor who called the looters thugs and found themselves sued over that.  Implying that the Dem's and Rep's aren't the same thing with different talking points. If you think the other party of the two party system is going to fix something you are part of the problem.  <br>The TRUTH is, that anybody that votes Republican anymore is basically admitting they are either dumb, blind, stupid, or selfish. And dont really understand the world, or our own country anymore. I often wonder at the people that voted Bush jr...2x. And that now want to vote Trump or some other Republican.</br>    from msnbc <br>  imb4 false democratic propaganda <br><br>shut the fuck up</br></br></br>  <br>Your votes literally are worthless because in the end the representatives of the district decides who to vote for not you.</br>  <br><br>Need to replace that with FOX.</br></br>  America is the center of the worlds attention, these threads only prove that fact.  <br> The problem is the Democratic party <br>They "solve" all the problems that no one gives a shit about and ignore the things that matter</br></br>  <br> I'm shunned for being a straight white christian. <br><br>Tip top bait. Amazing.</br></br></br>  <br>feels good to be king</br>  <br><br>You must watch a lot of Fox "news". Or you are a masterbaiter. Either way, you get some Topkeks. For stupidity, or hilarity.</br></br>  <br>Burger King</br>  <br>It's not about the emails, it's the fact that the bitch lied to our faces. How can we trust a president to lead us if she lies to us before she's even in office?</br>  <br>those look good as shit, where can I buy</br>  <br>I agree with pretty much everything you said, but if you're so ashamed to part of the nation how it is, why don't you do something to change it?<br>  inb4 I can't do anything that will make a difference <br>No, you're wrong. You could become a politician and try to do as much as you can to change things. Sure it might not be much, but every little bit counts. You could join the police force, you could join the FBI, the CIA. There are tons of ways you can make a difference instead of simply complaining about the problem.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, but they all do that.<br><br>I'm not voting for anything with a vagina, though.</br></br></br>  <br>get some new material, shits old.</br>  <br>  implying any administration tells the absolute truth to their citizens <br>this is an unpopular opinion, but people can't handle some of the things that happen in politics<br><br>sometimes lying is the best option</br></br></br></br>  <br>Turkey</br>  <br>Bc often the great stupid actions of the U.S.A. Like vietnam, like Iraq and the mess in the middle east, like America's economy, and a lot of the pressure the U.S.A bullies countries with kind of effects the world. Just look at global warming for example. For too many reasons to list. China, the U.S.A, the middle east and all that shit effects all the world. I can't believe one has to explain this shit. And I am American.</br>  <br>Shouldn't you get on the right side of history?</br>  <br>This</br>  <br>Obvious non-american spotted.</br>  <br>Because their education is shit and they're easily swayed by appeals to emotion instead of logic.</br>  <br>Remove the kebab from thine own mouth before telling another to remove the burger from his.</br>  <br>there are people who are still dumb enough to vote democrat? i didn't know you people still existed lol</br>  <br> lol <br><br>GTFO of here grandpa. Take your pills and go to bed.</br></br></br>  <br> Obvious person who either doesn't live in the US or never leaves their basement spotted </br>  <br>I am on the right side.</br>  <br>so in other words the rest of the world is made up of tiny minded paranoid faggots who think america controls everything and that we spend all day plotting your downfall..at least tin foil hat wearers are a minority here</br>  <br>wealthy and rich. so republicans are better than democrats ?</br>  <br>No you're a turkey</br>  <br>Cherry pick much?</br>  <br>You do know that she did nothing wrong right? Broke no law. And actually did what some of her same predecessors have done...but the emails,the emails..omg. But Bush Jr lies the U.S.A into disastrous war, steals, destroys America, and Republicans probably want to carve his face into Mount Rushmore. Its call brainwashing my son. Get out of it...or may God have mercy on your soul!!!</br>  <br> obvious weeaboo scum spotted </br>  <br> implying I don't live in murica. <br>When you think about it, how would I be able to spend my money on electric and food bills if I didn't leave my basement?</br></br>  <br>and go where? sweden?</br>  <br>You're picture is wrong...<br><br>The Republican party may have freed the slaves, but its ideologies were similar to those of the current Democratic party. After the revolutionary war, the parties essentially switched to what they are today.<br>  learn basic US history faggot </br></br></br></br>  <br>You live with your Mom</br>  <br>I'm just amused by the fact that you've managed to convince yourself that you're oppressed as a Christian straight white male. That is some hilarious mental gymnastics that makes me think you spend too much time online.<br><br>I say this is a straight white male with some Christian background. We are literally the least oppressed people on the face of this planet.</br></br></br>  <br>the beaners in california bring the iq of the united down by many points</br>  <br> your money <br><br>It's your moms money</br></br></br>  <br>Why do you think that?</br>  so many amurica haters believing troll  <br>I really don't see how that follows. Are you assuming that the accumulation of wealth is the sole indicator of a person's intrinsic worth? You wouldn't be alone in that opinion, but I don't believe it to be true. <br><br>When I said "wealthy and rich," I was making a distinction between households that make over about a quarter million dollars and those that make over about ten million. Anyway, both are a minority.</br></br></br>  The savior of the White race.  <br>More orange than white, isn't he?</br>  Creepshot thread  bump      2  ERP thread I hope Index comes back soon edition.  <br>Alas, Index is one reason I keep coming back.</br>  Miri~  (JEREMY)<br>TRIXIE, IF YOU WANT ME BANISHED YOU MUST BANISH ME YOURSELF!!!!!<br>(This might be the last night I'm using Jeremy as a character)</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;628698997 <br>"Okay.

I actually kind of hate that part of my life besides meeting him. And I don't want anything to do with it, it's complicated...... very complicated. But of course that's the first place I asked, I asked anonymously though, no one knew it was me. I still ask sometimes but still nothing, a lot of people don't even know who I'm talking about so. In fact almost know one does.</br>  <br>I let out deep breaths, closing my eyes. I grip the bedsheets tightly once again and take it for what feels like hours. Eventually, I feel you slowing down. "Are you about to cum?" I ask with relief.</br>  <br>if it counts as both it should be its own category, I don't even know, but the dominant chromosomes on both of them are reveresed, xie has dominant male chromosomes, the mistress has dominant female chromosomes, so that should be heterosexual</br>  <br>Ya got 5 more seconds come on Mac!

I then move my head to your ass and lick your asshole clean. I swallow everything.<br><br>"I hope you clean up mine too." I say, pointing to my cock.<br><br><br>"Don't worry about it!"
