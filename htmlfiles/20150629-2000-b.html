She didn't recognise me as relative as we've only seen each other a few times. Nothing much else to it, but the fact that I knew she was sort of family made it absolutely incredible. She was 18 back then (two years ago) but she still looks about 15.<br><br>Second (i'll call her M) was when we were staying together at our holiday home during a uni break. She had always had a thing for me (she's five years older) and was your typical 'predatory' relative back when we were young. She came out of the shower wrapped in a towel, I was sitting on the couch, she looked at me and asked if I found her attractive. I said something like 'sure, of course', then she came over and started rubbing my cock through my pants. It escalated until she was riding me, to be honest I didn't really like it. she's a little crazy and has hurt people before so I didn't want to do anything that would set her off. It was over pretty quickly and I felt bad afterwards.</br></br></br>    <br>checked</br>    <br>Story?</br>  <br><br>Two trips in a row. This is now a fucking Spiderman thread</br></br>                    <br>Cant stop won't stop</br>    Fuck you spiderman, I was having fun.    <br>yes.<br>with my sweet little sister.<br>on regular basis actually still going on and hopefully it will last long.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck you lucky bastard. I'd nut in that ass a million times.</br>  With my cousin. Since we were children.  <br>MOAR KEEP GOING</br>      <br>If you fuck her, get a pic of her asshole.</br>  <br>k i will.<br>off to make brekfst now.</br></br>  fucked my 17 year old sister a year ago, i was 21 at the time. she has a perfect ass, shoulder length blonde hair, and unbelievably blue eyes - basically anything i could want in a girl. we've had sexually charged interaction ever since she was 15, and we finally acted on one another out of impulse. we still mess around from time to time.  <br>Fuck, too bad you won't be back in time to show me. Fuck you a million times.</br>        My sister and I had a thing once. I'd tease her ass with one of those electric back massagers. She'd let me watch her shower. That was about five years ago. We don't really talk to each other now.    <br><br><br><br>Keep on bumping, thanks spidey &lt;3</br></br></br></br>    New thread<br>We poorly describe vidya games and have anons guess what game<br><br> get attacked <br> get revenge <br> want money and more revenge so you try and get stronger <br> get attacked by assholes all the time </br></br></br></br></br></br>   parents dead <br> make decisions <br> kill people <br> not as good as the last one </br></br></br>   Jiggly tits <br> Lots of references <br> The final boss is extremely annoying </br></br>  <br><br><br>pineapple express</br></br></br>    <br>pineapple express</br>  <br>any fable game</br>   look like beef jerky <br> light fires <br> die </br></br>  <br>Dank Souls</br>  <br>no</br>  <br>pineapple explress</br>  <br>Yep, I didnt think it would take long lol</br>   try to enjoy game <br> get raged at by little kids <br> quit </br></br>  <br>Any COD game?</br>  <br>pineapple express</br>  <br>pineapple express</br>   Fight <br> Most protags die <br> Evil antagonists prevail </br></br>  <br>It might be pineapple express</br>  roll   is kill <br> actually isn't  <br> robot stalker <br> a suit like a board game </br></br></br>   drive like maniac <br> kill people <br> mostly kill hookers </br></br>    <br> poorly described </br>  <br>Bayonetta</br>  <br>Cod, halo</br>  <br>Nope.</br>   brother is a cunt <br> lets rock baby <br> brother died <br> sad </br></br></br>  <br> We poorly describe vidya games and have anons guess what game <br>fag</br></br>  <br><br> hat shrinks guy <br> while tiny guy finds other tiny guys <br> go between normal and big size entire game <br> worst game of the franchise hands down </br></br></br></br></br>   be green <br> have bumble ball <br> destroy the universe <br> actually kinda fun </br></br></br>  <br>Minish Cap.</br>   hats   <br>he literally just outlined the entire game<br>fag</br></br>  <br>Devil may cry 3</br>  <br><br>Correct</br></br>  <br>Fuck you, that was one of my childhood games.</br>  <br>sheeeeit</br>   be Edgelord <br> have gf <br> meet crazy bitch <br> cheat on gf <br> have dreams of sheep </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Stay assblasted.<br><br>Protip: I was in college when that epic shite came out.<br><br>Underage b&amp;.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   only use four buttons <br> Click alot <br> Fan boy faggot fanbase </br></br>  <br>Mario Party 2700</br>  <br> Underage b&amp; </br>   All you friends die <br> The only new features revolve around boats </br>  <br>no</br>   be nig nog <br> basically the whole game is "niggers gonna nig simulator" </br>  you guys gamer dudes? who here is ready for the zombie apocalypse? one shot with the pulse gun take em all out haha, i'll me a shotgun in the zombie apocalypse  <br>Assassins creed 4: black flag</br>  <br>You got it.</br>  <br>This could also be Dance Dance Revolution</br>   crash space ship <br> zipperhead bro is kill, almost <br> what the dick </br></br>  <br>nop its a pc game</br>   play as female or male <br> crazy monsters  <br> chase this greasy fuck all game <br> heavy metal music </br></br></br>  <br>Five Nights at Freddy's</br>   Huff gas <br> smoke meth  <br> be generally retarded </br></br>  <br>Mass effect</br>  <br>GTA</br>  <br>still no, since you guys are bad a geussing heres another hint<br> kill things for money </br></br>  <br>nope</br>   be jigaboo <br> meet science man <br> science man makes you a monster <br> kill shit <br> fly <br> fight science man </br></br></br></br></br>   <br>Fallout boy the game new mexico version obviously</br>  <br>Binding of Isaac</br>   cry   <br>Katamari Damacy</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>You must be very depressed</br></br></br></br></br></br>   only click shit <br> make lots of money </br>  <br>Adventure Capitalist?</br>  <br>Cake Presser</br>   YOU DID NOT REACH THE NUCLEAR THRONE    be in space <br> somehow acquire teleporting light drive <br> fly around in random death stars shooting shit with a tiny little ship <br> oh shit the teleporting drive broke <br> teleport to random unknown place in space <br> that's how it ends </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Correct</br>  <br>pineapple express</br>   Vietnam <br> leather jackets <br> shitty controls <br> shitty gameplay <br> shitty graphics <br> everything is shit </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>nuclear throne maybe</br>  <br>Yus!

Everytime you stick your dick through you get to choose who's behind it, and you're guaranteed that they give you amazing head until you cum.<br>Everytime you use the hole, someone who've talked to in your lifetime (not two words, a conversation, even a simple one) dies.<br>No consequences of the deaths fall on you legally, and no one knows about your hole or pact. Whats the game plan?</br></br>  Probably use it untill one of my close friends or family dies.  Fuckin leave that shit - I got mates worth more than blowjobs.  <br>use it so many times everyone i have ever spoken to dies then use my ability to talk to someone and kill them later any way i want</br>  Use it until everyone i've ever talked to is dead.  <br>This guy is going places</br>  <br>Get a job as a customer service rep to increase the chance of someone you don't give a shit about dying instead of people you're close with.</br>  <br>MAJOR GLORY!</br>  OP here. To clarify, if you kill everyone you've every talked to, you're horrible, but this magical hole will keep on working regardless.  This immediately stands out to me as a way to murder whoever I want. I stick my dick through the hole until everyone I've talked to has died. Then, I go about having conversations with anyone else I want to get rid of. It's like death note but you get a blowjob!  Choose my mom to be the one behind the hole, so I can make sure she never dies :)  <br>Use it. Use it until nobody I know still lives. Then use it more. An hero when I'm 40. Pass on the magical glory hole to a random stranger. Do not warn them of the dangers. Kek while I rot in the dirt.</br>  If there's an equal probability between the entire set of people I've had conversations with then I'd go talk to a bunch of assholes and people the world might be better off without. I'd visit a bunch of old folks homes and only speak to the problem patients. I'd go talk to complete niggers in the ghetto. Just a quick and simple "Sup mang? What chu do?" And I can likely kill then later. It's Russian roulette sure, but I can pad the odds. Also, free blowjobs.  What if you've had a conversation with yourself  <br>Fucking clever</br>  <br>Smart<br>I'm also considering that you can mass murder by getting on the radio/TV and simply making an announcement. Does that count?</br></br>  <br>max kek</br>  <br>That's not a conversation you dipshit</br>  <br>Conversations have to go both ways. They would have to respond. Not OP though, so fuck if I know.</br>  <br>Nope, not a conversation</br>  <br>Can u bring ppl back to life when u suck dick in a glory hole ?</br>  Use it untill everyone is dead<br> inb4 egdy <br>Talk to magical gloryhole<br> gloryhole is kill <br> FUCK UR STUPID RULEZ OP, I FUCK THEM </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>so nice plothole, but what if when you cum she dies in front of your little hole, or while giving you head</br></br>  What if the person you chose to suck your dick has had a conversation with you?  <br><br>Wouldn't use it.<br><br>Blowjobs ain't all that, especially if you can't even see the girl's face. Don't see what the point of being able to pick who it is when you can't even see them. Might as well be some random 800 pound male landwhale that just happens to have amazing blowjob technique.<br><br>I'll pass.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Iangine if Barack Obama uses this  <br>But only after he cums. OP said he gets to cum</br>  well I hate everyone I know so this is a pretty easy decision  <br>Then you just choose someone else to be in the gloryhole. Or fuck the dead mouth</br>  <br><br>could we fuck her and anal also if not, iits worthless</br></br>  <br>I would probably do it just so people would die</br>  <br>OP here. I guess they get immunity for that round? Sounds fair enough. A load for a life</br>  so would you people have a chance to die if i used it?  <br>What would you name this practice?<br>Death Splooge?</br></br>  <br>Only if we reply to you. <br><br><br> fuck </br></br></br></br>  <br>Conversations have to be ORAL<br>*ba-dum, tssssk*</br></br>  <br>talk to as many people as possible<br>use the hole as much as possible<br> i am edgier than bismuth <br> id actually do it though fuck everyone lol </br></br></br></br>  <br> the human who talks to anon will face his salty wrath </br>  <br>would just join teamspeak rooms at random and say shit until someone replies</br>  <br>Just ask if your mic works. Someone will do a mic check for you.</br>  <br>there we go that's the whole plan assuming probability rules the more people i talk to the least chance someone i actually know dies gg 4chin solving the real problems</br>  The average person only lives 24,000 days. So I will just keep talking to people, can't possibly put a dent in the population.  <br>kek, good one</br>  Just use it on all of your close friends and loved ones.  Make it so that I'm the one sucking dick so I can bring people back from the dead  <br>Same here.</br>  YLYL<br>god-tier addition</br>    <br>Oh I didn't notice that. That's actually very sweet. Wouldn't you like it if you found a girl that wanted to be with you for the rest of your life, actually make it until the end but after your passing would still carry "you" with her?</br>    Ask a compulsive liar anything.  You are not a compulsive liar, you are lying.  What's your craziest lie??  <br>are you lying about being a compulsive liar?</br>  <br>what do you think your motive for lying is?</br>  <br>That depends on what you mean by craziest. I've told people some real stupid bullshit and sometimes they really believe it, too. I don't really keep track, though. I stole someone's lighter earlier by telling them I needed it to light a cigarette earlier. I don't smoke, and the guy has known me for years, so you wouldn't think he'd fall for it. But he did.</br>  <br>Who cares what his answer is...hes fucking lying.</br>  <br>I think it has to do with the people I grew up around. They would just lie for no reason, and it's something I just picked up.<br><br>I lie to practice a lot of the time. That's how I rationalize it to myself anyway. I also do it for fun. It's interesting to see just what people will believe. <br><br><br>It's hard to say.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A lie is just a distorted interpretation of reality. Nothing is ever totally void of value.</br>  Are you good?  <br>I like to think so. I've been told that I'm a bad liar a handful of times when I was telling the truth because when I'm lying I think about it and choose everything I do and say very carefully, but when I tell the truth I assume that it will speak for itself so I don't go out of my way to convince anyone of anything. So people think I'm lying when I'm telling the truth...</br>  <br>are you insecure ?<br>why do you need so much attention ?</br></br>  the lie is gonna catch up to you. good day sir.  <br>I'm not sure. I usually try to divert attention away from myself and I usually think of that as being evidence of my being insecure. I really don't think I'm insecure, though. I'm honest about things that are important, unless I just don't like you. I think that being a liar and being honest are not necessarily mutually exclusive, and I think that if I were dishonest then your point would be more valid. As it is, though, I'd say I like the person that I am and I don't fiend for validation.</br>  <br>so somehow you are scared of people you don't know or don't like ?<br>you feel that lies protects you ?</br></br>  <br>No, that's not it. What I was saying is basically that you'd better not leave anything valuable out around me if you won't be around to guard it if I don't like you.<br><br>I do lie to protect myself sometimes, but I don't mean that in an emotional way. I'll lie to protect myself and my belongings. Who wouldn't? <br><br>Mostly I just bullshit to see if I can get away with it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What if people are better than what you imagine ? By better I mean that you can trust them more and they are not all bastards.</br>  <br>Because I can learn. If I wanted to keep getting fucked over I'd let people walk all over me. I already do. But I'm careful as hell now, because there are a lot of people out there who are pretty damn smart who will actively work against you. I know this because I've had to deal with them. <br><br>Trusting people who you don't have very close ties with just about the best way to set yourself up to get screwed.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes there are manipulators everywhere but you could learn their techniques through tutorials and online-courses so they wouldn't be able to manipulate you any more.<br>I did this and I don't need to lie at all any more, I can be myself and not be scared of these people. I don't give any personal informations, I just learned to talk without saying anything important or personal.</br></br>  <br>I've been at it that for years. Some people figure out a way to fuck you up anyway. <br><br>You're still lying to people if you're withholding your whole personal life. It's impossible to have a real social life unless you just hang out with drug addicts all day and don't have any personal attachment relationship with them.</br></br></br>  Everytime I don't want to go to work, i call in and tell them one of me relatives is really ill or dead. <br><br>too bad now everyone in my family is dead. Need to look for a new job.</br></br>  <br>Shut the fuck up and stop doing psychedelics.</br>  <br>I bet you miss out on a lot of hours like that. I take what I can get even if I hate going to the damn place. <br><br><br>No.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Adopt some kids or buy some new pets.</br>  <br>I don't know why it wouldn't work for you but, knowing manipulation technique should protect you from it<br><br>No you are not lying, you are taking control over the conversation to talk either about casual things or about the others<br><br>It's ok if you don't have hundred of friends. I used to have so many "friends" and a "great social life" but it is totally useless, these people won't help you when you need them. So keep few quality friends and fuck the rest.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you have AIDS</br>  <br>Some people are just useful to have around, even if I don't particularly enjoy their company. There are other people whose company I enjoy but who aren't particularly useful. There are other people who I both use and enjoy, and those people are close friends / family. Of course most of socializing is useless, but it can be fun and it can be interesting.<br><br>Some people just lie to try and get you and they're damn good at it. Unless you're just really super careful all the time, the only reasonable way to deal with them is to not, and to just walk away.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think so but I've never been tested so I'm not sure.</br>  <br>I don't get what you mean by "using you" "getting you", could you be more explicit ?</br>  <br>That a Drawing is so shitty lol<br><br> muh expression </br></br></br>  <br>how do you want to be executed?</br>  <br>Using you to meet their own ends. Sex, money, or drugs are always involved. <br><br><br>I thought it was kind of cool and that's why I saved it, but that's just like my opinion I guess.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd rather not be executed.</br>  <br>I don't care what you want, I want you executed and you will be, how do you want to go? last requests/meal?</br>  <br>I've been using once but not twice. Any mistake is great because you learn from it.<br><br>It you are repeatedly getting used by the same patterns you have to question yourself. Why are you not learning from these mistakes ? Pretty strange to me.</br></br></br>  <br>*I mean "I've been used by someone once but not twice"</br>  <br>Persistence is the one that always gets me. When someone is smart enough and they just keep at it, eventually you're going to screw up unless you just walk away. I guess my mistake is not disengaging to begin with, but what fun would it be to not play the game?<br><br><br>Liver failure at the age of 90. A banana and a glass of water sounds like an Okay meal and it wouldn't be too unreasonable to count on being able to get that at a hospital, which is where I plan on dying.</br></br></br></br>  I personally would cut off your tongue feed it to you, and let you bleed out.  <br>Which execution method would you prefer?</br>  <br>I wouldn't have any grounds to complain, I suppose. People have died in much worse ways. It probably beats bleeding out from a car accident, too. <br><br>Anyway. I'm not too worried about it. If some motherfucker cuts out my tongue then it was just my time to die.</br></br></br>  <br>The one where they don't execute you.</br>  <br>why? you're not going to give me a straight answer anyways.</br>  <br>you're getting executed m8, now choose the method, lethal injection, hanging, decapitation, gassing, drowning, death by firing squad etc..</br>  <br>Do you think anyone ever gives you a straight answer? At least I'm telling you outright to be skeptical of what I have to say.<br><br><br>No I'm not.</br></br></br></br>  <br>yes you are, now choose or default will be lethal injection, you don't have anything special?</br>  ITT: we poorly describe a movie then people guess.<br>I'll start:<br><br> Someone tries to shoot a dog and then people dont trust each other </br></br></br>  John Wick?
