Would you guys have weekly gay sex with an old dude for $200 a week?<br><br>Some 60 year old man wants to make love to my 20 year old Asian body and is willing to pay for it, but idk if I'll do it. He wants me to pretty much be his lover overnight and would probably make out and do all sorts of shit with me. What would you guys do if you were in my situation?</br></br>  <br><br>Barter.</br></br>  Yes  $200 sounds really low.  say no because im not a whore or a faggot  You must be pretty damn desperate for cash, man. 200 for a whole week?  <br>I do it for 40€/2hr so yes</br>  <br> What would you guys do if you were in my situation? <br>Bite the pillow</br></br>  <br>Nah dude just for a weekend Saturday night to Sunday morning.<br><br>Idk if I should do it though</br></br></br>  post pics OP  $100 an hour  <br> Some 60 year old man <br> for $200 a week <br>HAHA no my pride is way bigger than my greed.</br></br></br>  i'd do it if i was homosexual  kek, getting a shitty job pays even more.<br>choose OP, making hamburgers or sucking cock from an old guy</br>  <br>I'd probably do it for like $500.</br>  <br>Id do it but no kissing, thats what makes you gay</br>  <br><br>at least cooking hamburgers your breath won't smell like dick all day.</br></br>  <br>I forgot to clarify.<br><br>I do work in a shitty retail and get like 500 a week. <br><br>This guy wants to have weekly encounters during the weekend when I'm not working and have gay sex, 200 each time I visit him.<br><br>Should I whore myself out? I think it's pretty good for just a night but he sounds like those clingy desperate types that'd probably want to marry me</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>200 is a really low amount for this. The fact that you're even seriously considering doing it speaks quite a lot about you.</br>  <br>I'd say if you are attracted to him, maybe. just get him off as soon as you can so he loses his urge to continue for more</br>  <br>requesting n00dz</br>  <br>No nudes, I'm not a faggot that will degrade myself on /b/</br>  <br>make it 300 and deal. you could live off of him comfortably.</br>  I'd probably do it for double that. It is a lot of cash for little work. Try discussing the price with him?  <br> degrade myself on /b/ <br><br>If you're contemplating this guys offer you're a faggot son :^)</br></br></br>  <br>are you gay? <br>I am, and I would do it. <br>Life sucks regardless, might as well get paid to do one of the few things that doesn't</br></br></br>  ask him 300$ you sissy boiiiiii<br>or catfish him, take your secret cam, film him and ask 2000$ otherwise you will show the vid to his wife.</br>  <br>Sauce?</br>  <br>Are you a hoe?</br>  <br><br>charge more than 200 OP</br></br>  I'd say why not. You'll eventually love the feel of cock in your ass if you don't already. Just charge 500 instead of 200 per encounter. That's way too low.  get as much money as possible but do it anyway feels good man  <br>You just have to ask yourself one question OP<br>Am I a bitch?</br></br>  <br>pretty much. one guy offered 150 for my 18 year old boypussy a few years ago, but i got him up to 300 by the time we actually fucked. after a few weeks i told him i wasn't feeling it any more and he put it up to 400 on the spot.<br><br>thing is, it really fucked with me. i'm not gay - and while i don't have any problem with the idea of gay sex the whole thing made me feel really terrible after a couple of weeks. like, sitting on the edge of my bed with my head in my hands shaking kind of terrible. something about the experience went against the core of my being.<br><br>good money while it lasted though :P</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>sounds like aids</br>  would u fuck a hooker in the ass if you had to pay 200, would u kiss her  <br><br>I've never even had a gay experience before (I've never even started my own 4chan thread) but I don't see the big deal about gay sex. I mean, I'd fuck an ugly, old chick for $200 - I don't see how that would be any less unpleasant than having sex with a man.</br></br>  <br>geez, he'll probably want to make out, so you'd have his rough face and bad breath all in your face, his putrid cock...no thanks<br><br>at least ask for an even grand per month</br></br></br>  <br>no cause im not a faggot, please kill yourself and make the world a better place</br>  <br>Haha!</br>  <br> 2000$ payment a month <br>There are people who would kill to earn this much you faggot<br>Gi and get your ass fucked by old man because you just pretty much want affirmation from us.<br>Yeah go and get fucked you fag whore.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Hookers don't kiss. Didn't you ever watch that movie 'Pretty Woman'? It had that insufferable slut in it. Richard Gere, I think.</br></br>  <br>YES YES YES YES <br><br>Where do I find one of these arrangements?</br></br></br>  <br>I couldn't do it for 10 thousands, let alone shitty 200 $<br>make out with an old dude, are you not disgusted by thinking about this? If not, sure go on</br></br>  <br>ones fuck you and you basically become his bitch, The other you fuck and can live on with your life. Its very different.</br>  <br><br> Nah dude just for a weekend Saturday night to Sunday morning. <br><br>You can get much more money than that. Cute boy can sell their ass at higher rates than that. <br><br>100€/h is standard.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>for $1000 yes</br>  <br> calls ass boy pussy <br> not gay <br>kek</br></br></br>  do it op i would do it if i wasnt ugly as fuck. nobody even looks my direction.<br><br>infact i would do it for free</br></br>  <br>I guess if you like dick and need money,then why not?</br>  <br> 100€/h is standard. <br><br>And prostitution is way cheaper in Europe than in the US.</br></br></br>  <br>Dude....nah.<br><br>If you spent each of those saturday nights planning, working, and helping realize your goals you'll get a hell of a lot farther than this guy's money and ass fucking will take you.</br></br></br>  <br>How'd you find the guy?</br>  I had an old guy make me a similar offer. Not worth. You can buy lots of things with money, but you'll never be able to buy back your dignity.  <br>Dude tell him to make it double and then you'll do it.</br>  <br><br>TRUTH</br></br>  Hi /bros/<br><br>anyone ever got a buz off Tramadol?<br><br>How?<br><br>I have 10 boxes.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  yes, take 100, see how you feel, take another 100 if you feel like it  <br>that might be a little too much</br>  bumpy  Not OP, how good are these in comparison to something like lortabs or percocet?  <br>how the fuck would I know dipshit?</br>  you guys are morons hyperventilating works better.  <br>I got those once after I got hit by a car and I swear to god they made the pain worse. Like I was hyper aware of exactly where it was. <br><br>That being said I got a decent buzz from snorting them. Hurt though so try and crush it up as small as possible.</br></br></br>  <br>not even kidding the lack of oxygen releases brain chemicals</br>  <br>dirty and speedy opiate high, worse than codeine</br>  <br><br>Well friend, if you don't kno why bother responding?</br></br>  <br>lol have you done tramadol? its not too much</br>  <br>Try your moms panties on your head.</br>  <br>Them quads though,</br>  350-400mg will fuck you up, you will be itchy. I love em. Need to get hold of 10 boxes myself.  <br>do you chew the slow release?</br>  <br>Nah I'm good with watching people suffocate trying to get buzzed while I never do drugs.</br>  <br>you boring fuckhead</br>  <br>It's the ultimate comedown/hangover drug. If you have been partying on MDMA or some other substance with a lot of alcohol all night and you know the next day is going to be horror hang over just pop a 50 mg tramadol every 3 hours or so. You'll feel a lot better</br>  <br>You could say that or you could say "Not a stupid fucking tool like everyone else".</br>  <br>like so<br><br>you're a faggot<br><br>Personally i don't like tramadol. I absolutely prefer tilidine.<br>Tramadol has an annoying 'speedy' addition to the buzz</br></br></br></br></br></br>  i use them regulary. Mostly just before work. Keeps me hyped all day long.<br>I mostly take betwoon 100mg and 150mg</br>  <br>just how delusional can one be I wonder?</br>  I'm on 100 mg of it right now<br>It's a wierd buzz nothing special but nice<br>I take it to relieve pain tho</br></br>  <br>Very delusional, have you ever looked in a mirror?</br>  <br>Tranmdol will turn u into a massive gaping vagina</br>  <br>"look in the mirror"<br>are you 12?....bed time little fella</br></br>  <br>I just did, boy I look fab<br>still replying to the lamest baits is kinda fun</br></br>  <br>Very clever it's not like it took you 2 minutes to come up with that.</br>  <br>wat?</br>  <br>wat?</br>  I find they go down really well with energy drinks  Well my work here is done. Violence.  <br><br>I have had 100Mg today, I feel hotter and sweatier than normal but its a nice background buzz, nothing too intense... don't listen to idiots telling you to snort it, makes no difference... if anything they work better when you just eat them :D</br></br>  <br>Thanks man...first real post</br>  <br>Makes you feel good, like an opiate high. Never take more then 200mg. After 200, the high will not increase and you have a greater chance of death. 150mg is perfect.</br>  <br>did you die?</br>  <br>yes I'm dead.</br>  I got some for my cat that come in a gel/liquid. Would it get me high if I inserted it anally? I just know it is going to taste like absolute shit, especially since it's a few years old  Take 2/3 with a few beers. Nice little buzz if you're looking to just chill for a couple of hours.  just suck on the patches and get that fentanyl  <br>Yeah, i dont like it tho, its different, plus i have trouble sleeping on it, never had trouble sleeping on other opiates/benzos <br><br>Thats just personal experience tho</br></br></br>  <br><br>this guy is right, take 50 see how you feel and then take 100 if that isn't enough but 50 should be fine. 200 is way too much even though tramadol is a non opiate. <br><br> &gt;regular opiate user here </br></br></br></br>  <br>He's talking MG'S not pills</br>  <br>oh.....lol</br>  <br><br><br>are you fucking faggots trying to kill him? 50mg of tramadol will give a 300 pound man a strong buzz. 200 will fucking kill him OP do not take 200mg of tramadol.</br></br></br>  <br><br>You have to be careful if you're drinking with it, you can stop breathing, especially if you have sleep apnea or similar like me... don't get pissed! couple of beers to intensify the buzz is fine... <br><br><br><br>More than welcome! :D I love Tramadol me</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah tried a bunch in Thailand. Took about 2-3 initially then gradually got up to 5-8. I drank a fuck ton of water the first time and my body never processed it, ended up puking it all out. Heard noises when I was trying to sleep as well. Like someone was calling my name.<br>Alright high, had some good conversations and smoked a lot of cigs on them. <br>Don't drink alcohol with them.</br></br></br>  can you chew the slow release ones?  <br>Ayy you're fucking retarded my cat was prescribed 50mg 3 times a day retard</br>  <br><br>They make me nauseous too, taking 5-8 is Madness... don't do that!</br></br>  <br>Regular prescribed user of Tramadol here.<br>You're a dumbass.<br><br>OP, don't take more than 300 mg a day on your first try. That's the maximum prescription dose. There can be HIGHLY unpleasant side effects, including the possibility of a grand mal seziure, which happened to me when I tried to abuse it by taking about fifty pills or so. Now I just use it like I'm supposed to, because it's not really something that gives me much of a buzz. Some people love it. Some don't get a buzz at all.</br></br></br></br>  Did anyone say Tramadol?<br><br>I'm on 600mg a day with 900mg Lyrica and 10mg valium.</br></br>  <br>I'd recommend 200-300mg. But don't if you're epileptic, that shit significantly lowers seizure threshold</br>  its popular in the middle east. friend of mine who tried everything and i mean everything said that this shit is the worst. doesnt get you high and has the worst withdrawl  <br>oh lord</br>  <br>do you people even have livers?</br>  48÷2(9+3) = ?<br><br>Your answer is wrong, I guarantee</br></br>  48÷(18+6)=<br>48÷24=<br>2÷1=<br>2</br></br></br>  happy OP?  288?  48÷2(9+3)<br>24 x 12<br>288</br></br>  Its 2 lern 2 PEMDAS  48 ÷ 2 x 12<br>24 x 12<br>288<br>yeah?</br></br></br>  G-sus you guys are retarded...

What you want to do is study Order Of Operations. Also look into the “Distributive Property”, as well as Implicit Multiplication, and Juxtaposition. Research what the obelus is and means (÷). Define the “Terms” of the equation. Read up on Algebra and what Parentheses are used for. Research “Factorising”. Now that I have stated all the actual Mathematical principles, let’s prove what the answer is.<br>====================<br>For starters: What does 1/2x mean? It clearly means 1/(2x), but we just write 1/2x. It does NOT mean (1/2)x or “one half x” since the notation would clearly be x/2 for that.<br>So 1/2x = 1/(2x), just as 6/2x is 6/(2x). When x = 2+1, the answer is 1.<br>====================<br>Method 2: Let’s take the number 6. Do you agree that 6 = 4+2?<br>Now what is a common factor of 4 &amp; 2? 2 works. So factorise the 2 from 4+2 and you get 2(2+1).<br>6 = 4+2 = 2(2+1). When we do math, we all know you have to use the WHOLE term, and not a portion of it, with an operator. Therefore, 2(2+1) is an entire term with a value of 6, and you cannot use a portion of it with another operator, such as doing the 6/2 =3, and them multiplying by (2+1). That is incorrect.<br>Therefore, 6÷2(2+1) = 6÷6 = 1.<br>====================<br>Method 3: Distribution. Similar to the above but a different principle;<br>a(b+c) = (ab+bc). 2(2+1) = (4+2). Notice how all these math principles are proving the SAME thing?? 6 ÷ (4+2) = 1.<br>====================<br>Method 4: Using parentheses as grouping. Think about this equation as a real world problem. I have 6 apples. i want to divide among 2 groups of children, each group with 2 boys and 1 girl. How many apples does each child get? Now look at the question again, while thinking of that situation: 6÷2(2+1). They each get 1 apple.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>?</br>  Can we wrap this up please? I wanna go smoke a cigarette, but the butthurt is too good to miss a second of  <br>Method 5: Juxtapostion. The 2 that is “in front” of the brackets is there by this principle and some say this holds a higher precedence than explicit multiplication (and division). Answer = 1.<br>=====================<br>Method 6: The “obelus” ÷<br>While researching the exact meaning of this, I found these results. The ‘dot’ on the top of the symbol represents the dividend and the bottom dot represents what comes after the ÷. The 6 precedes it, and the 2(2+1) comes after it. Again ,yielding 1.</br></br></br></br>  <br>12 is still in the parenthesis, so it's 48/2(12) parenthesis must be solved first, or is someone implying the parenthesis dissapear?</br>  <br>Yes, we've already found that "?" is the answer, it says so up there. You're not special, kill yourself</br>  <br>HURRRRR DURRRRR I THINK I AMS SMARTS.</br>  <br>72</br>  <br>No, parenthesis is solved already.<br>Now it has a factor of 48/2 before it.</br></br>  <br>2. These threads are made perpetuated by trolls who just want to confuse people who can't maths.</br>  <br><br>The equations inside the parentheses are done first, the resulting 12 is treated like any other part of the equation.</br></br>  <br> 48 48<br>it is ______ ergo _____ ergo= 2<br> 2(9+3) 24</br></br></br>  48÷2(9+3) = x<br>x/2 = 24 +(9+3)<br>x/2 = 24 + 3(3+1)<br>x/6 = 8 + (3+1)<br>x*x/36 = 64 + 16(3+1) + (9 + 6 + 1)<br>log(8)x*x - log(8)36 = 2 + 1 +1/3 + log(8)(3+1) +log(8)(9 + 3 + 1)<br><br>I think I made a mistake somewhere.

Why do Americans love killing each other?  Because they are racist and classist as fuck and yet utterly positive they are not.  <br>CAUSE US MURICANS LOVE GUNS AND YOU CAN'T LOVE GUNS BACK WITHOUT SHOOTIN SOMEONE EVERY 30 SECONDS.<br><br>USA USA USA USA USA USA USA</br></br></br>  <br>we're way larger than those countries and have way more problems with drug trafficking, ethnic minorities and general poverty. Also most of our cops are ex-military who's anti-social asses could not get a job with civvies because they're so special.</br>  Because 99% of the people killed are niggers.<br>/thread</br>  <br>are you sure its not cause of a little thing called GUNS? plus no healthcare, some of those people could have been saved but you have no healthcare. why would you vote against obamacare so fucking stupid. stupid americans turning down free healthcare, typical</br>  <br> we're way larger than those countries <br><br>6 times the population, yet a thousand times the institutional murder?<br><br>Doesn't add up.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>they're not, niggers only 13.2% spics are like 17% of the total population. While niggers constitute more than 13% of the deaths attributed to police officers the number is less than 20% of the total number of police shootings. Statistically speaking you're more likely to get shot for being poor.</br>  <br>this</br>  <br><br>No guns are actually one of the only way we have to defend ourselves against states that would essentially be like a giant Glasgow. You can't refuse emergent care in the US.<br>We're just not the same. Our problems are not the same. We don't have free health care it's the opposite actually. Calling it obamacare is ironic because it's benefits conservative the most. It basically mandates everyone to buy health insurance or apply for government health care plans if they are applicable. So it essentially forced a lot of people to put money into private insurance.</br></br></br>  <br> free <br><br>Nothing is free. We'd rather pay for our healthcare ourselves with out own money and get top quality service than lose another chunk of our paycheck to the government automatically and end up with shit tier healthcare and end up on a 6 month waiting list for basic surgery if we ever needed it like you would in Europe</br></br></br>  <br>fuck you Glasgow rules<br><br>probably some Edinburgh cunt</br></br></br>  <br>Probably because the US has been in at peace for 21 years in its entire history.</br>  <br>canada has it pretty down pad though. Biggest problem they have is natives. Cheap meds, good weed, low cost of living, low level of political corruption.</br>  We breed the strong to survive. It's why we run the world while other supposedly "superior" countries bicker and make mewling noises whenever Russia rolls through another neighboring territory.  <br>Because Greece won't pay their debts and it's pissing us the fuck off.</br>  <br> doesn't understand the concept of free healthcare <br>clues in the title m8, free</br></br>  <br>RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT !<br>They don't kill each other, they kill niggas.<br>I would do that same.</br></br></br>  <br> doesn't understand economics <br><br>I know you're only 16, but next year you might have to take a class called "economics."

Why not?</br>  <br>You're a bullshit Canada, french fag!</br>  <br>I'll settle</br>    <br>If the government insurance is so awesome why would people choose to pay for private insurance plans?</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>lol gun peeple r so angry n smal penised</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>because theyre rich</br>  <br>IM GAY DONT YOU GET IT?</br>  <br>because get too invested in their emotions and hurt ego, leading to an escalated situation that could have been resolved with non-lethal force. not a lot of us cops are guilty of this though, but many abuse their power on a day to day basis, not necesarily killing people; but failing to uphold the constitution they swore an oath to and violating people's rights. again, that type of shit happens every day in US, it just goes under the radar and nobody hears about it.</br>  <br>well not entirely under the radar</br>  <br>Okay they're rich. Why are they buying healthcare if the government healthcare is so awesome?</br>    <br>Because the Police in those other places are a bunch of pussies</br>    <br>look back across the replies, i dont see that anyone ever called it 'awesome'.<br><br>to be frank the healthcare that everyone gets is probably not awesome. Thats what you get by spending more, if youre rich. the common healthcare is good and adequate. <br>the point is, that good and adequate is a lot more than many americans can say, myself included.</br></br></br></br>    <br>I think I'll stick with the system where I pay for what I use. That way I actually get good healthcare.</br>    <br>There's more bad people there that the police have to deal with, the new world is a different world.<br>Canada's alright though.</br></br>  <br>i'll honesly probably just emmigrate from america because i dont want to argue with people like you</br>  <br>its obscenely overpriced though. all the pharmaceutical company's would rather see you die than not pay anything for treatment</br>  <br>Those countries are full of pussies</br>  <br>not entirely, but the vast majority of unjust interactions with cops go under the radar. the conflicts that happen to be filmed, white cop vs black guy situations, and the extremely violent or corrupt actions are the ones that get picked up by the media.</br>  <br>the US is one country made up of lots of states retard</br>  <br>ive never understood that whole gay thing, its an american way of life</br>  <br>this is me<br><br>yeah thats how i feel, which is why im trying to escape america</br></br></br>  <br>Actually, no one really knows, that's why we finally put it out.</br>  <br>This</br>  <br>You are so dense, it is embarrassing.<br> i am not even American </br></br>  <br>because niggers get out of line.</br>  <br>Lulz.

Pro tip: you cant</br>  <br>isnt that the gun from halo?<br>oh shit i thought it was from halo sorry</br></br>  <br>name 1 war you've won<br>pro tip: you can't</br></br>  <br>says the autist</br>  <br>ok you're a faggot then</br>  <br> not a single country on earth can go toe to toe with the US <br> dont name all those countries that beat us/we cant beat, those dont count </br></br>  <br>remarks the retard</br>  <br>srs?</br>  <br>are you fucking stupid?</br>  <br>dont be so hard on yourself</br>  <br>do it fagit<br>ya'll are a bunch of pretty boy posers who cant actually fight for shit</br></br>  <br>such an angry europoor.</br>  <br>no but I am waiting for you to name someone you've beaten in a war</br>  <br> He's right you know. </br>  <br>Faggot please, when you break your leg and get billed $1400 tell us your system is so much better then. Also if the condition is severe enough there is no waiting list for surgery. It doesn't work like a line, it goes in order of severity.</br>  <br> Dont give me that bullshit either with nam and the muslims <br>already backtracking, typical amerifag</br></br>  <br>can you name a country that did "beat us"? cause so far there were only 3 wars that were fought on US soil that we won. i cant remember losing any of those wars. But i DO remember every country getting its shit kicked in by the Germans before we showed up.<br><br>Listen the US is the big dick swinger so far in killing people. idk what nation you come from but it certainty would last a campaign.</br></br></br>  <br>im from greenland actually</br>  <br>the soviets were the savior not you</br>  <br>Fucking hell, tip your fedora in another direction. That is easily the faggiest statement I've ever read.<br><br>0/10 edgy 16 year old</br></br></br>  <br>those arent fucking actual wars between two nations. are you dense? unconventional warfare is a whoooole different type of warfare that is fought differently.</br>  <br>wtf are you talking about?</br>  <br> *the soviets were the savior not you <br><br>*The soviets were the Germans target practice long enough for the allies to regroup and mount a proper offensive.<br><br>Fixed that for you.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> cause so far there were only 3 wars that were fought on US soil that we won <br> arabs kicked your ass on 9/11 </br></br>  <br>how is it there?</br>  <br> got your asses kicked in vietnam <br> came home crying </br></br>  <br>A win is a win. Even if it's a team sport</br>  <br>you owe the soviets</br>  <br>made me laugh thank you</br>  <br>you mean warfare that you cant win?<br>because you arent as strong as you say you are?</br></br>  <br> Blacks </br>  <br>2000 people and some change doesnt win ya a war buddy. Also after 9/11 im pretty sure the shit storm invasion that proceded after that killed alot more people then those 2 towers falling. Again though thats not a country either name a COUNTRY that could actually beat the US in a war.</br>  <br>ok so thats one</br>  <br>it was the other way round actually. you dropped a couple big bombs on japan (wow great) after a german told you how to do it. america is fucking useless at war</br>  <br>vietnam</br>  <br>again not a country buddy and i don't think your nation could do better. The strategy behind Vietnam was flawed and that was the first time US actually encountered guerrilla warfare. Were alot better at it now trust me.</br>  <br>saved</br>  <br>ok so you can win wars if other countrys help, i get your point, america sucks at war</br>  <br>As someone who's not an American, I don't owe the Soviets shit.<br><br>I owe the Americans for deciding to fight in the Pacific first, I know saving my country wasn't their first priority, but they did just that in the process.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>i would really like to know what country you people come since none of have said so far.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>not a nation and circumstances are alot different</br>  <br>U.S. Beat these fuckers so hard they took up baseball and gave up on war forever</br>  <br>kek</br>  <br> Mfw Nazi Nuclear Weapons program was scrapped right after they split the atom and Nazi scientists actually contributed very little to the manhattan project. </br>  <br>chill</br>  <br>Which of the allies countries wasn't a smoking pit of rubble after that war again?</br>  <br><br>You understand that the conservatives intentionally hamstrung the ACA with these provisions don't you? That they intentionally hurt and robbed the american people to make the democrats look bad?</br></br>  <br> The strategy behind Vietnam was flawed and that was the first time US actually encountered guerrilla warfare. Were alot better at it now trust me. <br>you just admitted that your army sucked fuck you</br></br>  <br>uses a propaganda written by the US to show how good the US is, good!!!</br>  <br><br>Lmao eurotards<br><br>Breaking a leg in the US costs 10x that, even if you are insured</br></br></br></br>  <br>USA USA USA USA</br>  <br>Well they gave up on war forever, until recently.<br>but now they've learnt the lesson to not fuck with the US and decided to fight on the good guys side in case anything arises.</br></br>  <br>sounds pretty neat!</br>  <br>fucking 2 party system!</br>  <br>he's referring to Einstein but he was a Jew.</br>  <br> US and decided to fight on the good guys side in case anything arises. <br>yes...the good guys..good goy</br></br>  <br>im talking about einstein you retard, go back to school</br>  <br>Would you prefer the original document? Maybe a webm of Hirohito sucking MacArthur's dick?</br>  <br>GREAT BRITANIA</br>  <br><br>Only one party systematically acts in bad faith against the american people.</br></br>  <br>I can believe it. <br><br>So heard a visit to the GP (or equivalent), even if it turns out you're fine, can easily run you over $100</br></br></br>  <br>it doesnt really matter what you think. Whatever fuck boy country you live would never stand a chance against the US. The only way to threaten the US is with nukes and im pretty sure by now we got a plan for that too. The US literally has a war plan for every single country on earth.</br>  <br><br>Not only that, but pre-ACA health insurance policies can decide AFTER paying that you weren't actually insured, and sue you successfully for everything they gave you. <br><br>You can then have your wages garnished for the rest of your life potentially, to pay them back. You can't even file bankruptcy to get out of medical debt anymore.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because even muricuns hate muricuns</br>  <br><br>As a fellow American, you're 100% delusional.</br></br>   police do their jobs <br> people get upset </br>  <br>explain</br>  <br>oh yeah I know, the legislation the bill was based on was from failed legislation from Massachusetts during Romney's term. You don't even have to read into it to see who this shit was for. Conservatives keep shouting their mantras and scaring people and eventually people believe it.</br>  <br>Was that just urban renewal that was happening in post-blitz London?</br>  <br>  you can't even file bankruptcy to get out of medical debt anymore <br><br>FUCKIN WOT</br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't generally explain myself to flag waving, ra-ra, cheerleading retarded teenagers and/or keystone light chugging WWE fans, who are the only two types of people that hold the absurd opinion that the United States is an unconquerable military power, we aren't, we never were, and (this is the important part now) we don't want to be.</br></br>  <br>A single cop fires more bullets inside a day, on average, than the entire Finnish police forces fire within a year.<br><br>I'm not saying this is a good or a bad thing. It's just a thing.</br></br></br>  <br><br>It is POSSIBLE to eliminate it with chapter 7 or 13 bankruptcy, but I personally know people who have gone that route and still ended up a few hundred thousand in the hole.</br></br>  <br>I seriously would have thought that America, the richest country in the world, would have sorted somethig out. <br><br>Fucking crazy</br></br></br>  <br> pay a few hundred thousand dollars <br> pay ten thousand to relocate your family and get new identities.  <br>fucking aye it's not even a choice.</br></br></br>  <br>2/3 of Americans earn less than $41,000/yr. rich country full of poor people</br>  <br>Tell that to people calling us yuropoors</br>  <br>you should see dresden</br>  <br> implying i insinuated any of that shit <br><br>See unlike you i actually can look at the facts and say that the US is the strongest military, never said it was a good thing. Now if the whole world ganged up on us sure we'd lose. But im not gonna sit there and say we are weak. we have enough guns and ammo to supply nearly ever citizen in the US to fight. We have nuclear weapons to destroy the world 8x over and we have enough military bases to be anywhere in the world within 24 hours. i will say it again, the US is a war like nation more so then any other country on earth</br></br></br>  <br>  being across an ocean <br>  brags about not being bombed <br><br>Wot</br></br></br></br>  <br> Maybe a webm of Hirohito sucking MacArthur's dick? <br>doesnt exist retard</br></br>  <br>the jewish party.</br>  <br>hey man we losed a few boats.</br>  <br> Whatever fuck boy country you live would never stand a chance against the US. <br> i live in US <br> US wouldnt stand a chance against US <br> american logic </br></br></br></br>  <br>kek</br>  <br>I brag about my enormous cock, but I didn't do anything to earn that either</br>  <br> &gt;implying i insinuated any of that shit <br>wtf were you posting about for the last hour you stupid faggot?</br></br>  <br>government is swimming in debt it will never be able to pay off. Private sector is paying less and less taxes. Private sector coerces government into lifting tariffs in the name of business. Private sector moves everything overseas as fast as they can. CEO's still live in america after moving business out. Don't pay income tax. <br>There's a lot of things wrong with your picture of america.</br></br>  <br>im leaving</br>  <br>  strongest <br><br>Throwing money around isn't strength, boy. Money might be power in America, that's not the case everywhere.</br></br></br>  <br> civil war <br> Americans fight against Americans <br> guess who wins? <br> America <br>dayum</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>"America is the wealthiest nation on Earth, but its people are mainly poor, and poor Americans are urged to hate themselves. To quote the American humorist Kin Hubbard, “It ain’t no disgrace to be poor, but it might as well be.” It is in fact a crime for an American to be poor, even though America is a nation of poor. Every other nation has folk traditions of men who were poor but extremely wise and virtuous, and therefore more estimable than anyone with power and gold. No such tales are told by the American poor. They mock themselves and glorify their betters. The meanest eating or drinking establishment, owned by a man who is himself poor, is very likely to have a sign on its wall asking this cruel question: “if you’re so smart, why ain’t you rich?” There will also be an American flag no larger than a child’s hand – glued to a lollipop stick and flying from the cash register.<br>Americans, like human beings everywhere, believe many things that are obviously untrue. Their most destructive untruth is that it is very easy for any American to make money. They will not acknowledge how in fact hard money is to come by, and, therefore, those who have no money blame and blame and blame themselves. This inward blame has been a treasure for the rich and powerful, who have had to do less for their poor, publicly and privately, than any other ruling class since, say Napoleonic times. Many novelties have come from America. The most startling of these, a thing without precedent, is a mass of undignified poor. They do not love one another because they do not love themselves."</br></br></br></br>  <br> Now if the whole world ganged up on us sure we'd lose <br><br>US would still last a hell of a lot longer than 99% of other countries in in that scenario. I'm glad the US is being world police, without them, Russia, or god forbid China would try and start some shit.</br></br></br>  <br>read the post and you'll understand dingleberry.
