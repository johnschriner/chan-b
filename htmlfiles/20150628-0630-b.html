[ Why can't atheists define atheism?  Why do you not have a life and try so fucking hard?  Herp de derp derp herp?  Why can't you prove god exists?    <br>I have a question for believers. How can you believe with 100% certainty that there are some godg when there is no proof that they does exist? That doesn't seem like a very logical, open minded and scientific way to view the world. It seems more like your beliefs are being dictated by your emotions and not on facts.</br>  LETS MAKE IT OFFICIAL.<br>LETS ALL STOP POSTING ON THIS GUYS TROLL THREADS. <br><br>THEN HE'LL STOP.

You might not even notice a certain reference being used, but others who have watched older anime will get it while you'll be left with a sense of missing something others have understood and also it's amazing when newfags with less than 50 titles under their belts praise some new mecha anime as some exceptional masterpiece without having watched older works which are much better.</br>  <br>I've seen them try harder</br>   mirrai nikki   <br> Legend of Galactic Heroes <br>my nigga</br></br>  <br>No stop please</br>  <br>Cowboy bebop</br>  <br> kill yourself </br>  <br> jojo </br>  <br>God tier</br>  <br>Wow aren't you original</br>   kite <br>is an anime movie and ovas, it was hardcore</br>  Durarara is a good anime too <br>Robotics;notes <br>Kill la kill <br>Kore wa zombie desuka</br></br></br>  boku no pico  <br> /u/CuteChihuahua <br>also nice copypasta bby</br></br>  Everyone else here is suggesting you the wrong things. All of those series are great I'm sure, and a few are even masterpices, but the real thing you need to watch here is Puella Magi Madoka Magika. Every single story ever told supposedly has at least one flaw that everyone can objectively agree upon. As much as I'm sure everyone loves all of their favorite series, they have SOME objective flaw in their storytelling somewhere. Madoka is the only piece of literature I have ever seen or read that, after almost a year of devoting an unhealthy amount of time to trying to think of a flaw, i could not. Anything that I thought might be a badly written or boring character, every scene I thought might be unneeded filler, and every plot point I thought was too convoluted or unexplained turned out to just be completely intended and perfectly written with some further thought. There are no conveniences taken for the plot (the biggest thing), every single character is always in character and develops tremendously throughout the series, and the REAL main character is actually just the best written character I've ever seen. If anyone wants to argue that their is something objectively wrong about some aspect of Madoka, I will gladly hear them out and discuss the subject with them.<br>Subjectively, of course, there are some things a viewer might not absolutely love about Madoka. After all, different people are into different things. but anyone who says that any part of the parts of writing that can be measured (Characterization, themes, all that sort of stuff you are taught in Lit class) behind Madoka was anything but perfect is just wrong. I believe with unreasonable levels of resolve that Madoka is just the best story ever written, even though I know my opinion as a stranger doesn't matter much, and I will happily get into a lengthy keyboard war with anyone who wants to convince me otherwise.<br>TL;DR Please watch Madoka. It's perfect.</br></br>  <br>also <br> perfect blue </br></br>  <br>Madoka was pretty good.</br>  <br>can't handle best show and best girl?</br>  <br>i don't care for references, i watch everything as it goes, i watched your 'god' tier trigun cowboy bebop and few more i dont remember cause they were just plain good. I am not saying they were bad, they were good for sure even tho i hated few of them, but fucking glorifying every shit you stumbled across cause it has a &lt;2000 year lable slapped on it, it's retarded</br>   2015  <br> nobody suggested Gurren Lagann to this cunt. <br> Just who the hell do you think I am? </br></br>  Aren't we forgetting the best anime?<br> pic related </br>  <br> Jojo's Bizarre Adventure <br> calling others plebs <br>You might as well have typed Naruto</br></br></br>  <br>It hurts to think about........&gt;&lt; have mercy..</br>  <br>Death Note</br>  <br>the spiral energy is 2stronk4them<br>Late /b/uddy</br></br>   higurashi no naku koro ni   <br>Atleast you know shinobu. It's a copypasta though newfag</br>  <br>but why its easily one of the best anime of the year? at least its much better than season 2 of actual Haruhi</br>  <br>I never said anything about &lt;2000, just &lt;2010, also I never mentioned glorifying older works just that they were much earlier and much better or at least equal to the current works, if we're talking a particular genre such as mecha.</br>  <br>It hurts it hurts please stop</br>  <br>This is now a other girls doing rikka hand spin thing thread</br>   battle angel alita   <br>A spin off by definition cannot be the best anime of the year.</br>  Legend of the Galactic Heroes  <br>A anime based off a glorified fanfiction and done by a subpar art studio with subpar everything can not be best show of the year</br>  <br>who can resist this face?</br>  <br>I liked yuki before she had autism</br>  <br>Yuki was never good.</br>  I haven't seen anyone post Heroic Age.

No they need to default because fuck the backwards fucked up banking systems and fuck the EU.<br>maybe then change will finally start happen, if we keep bailin gnome out economies all it does is create more and more power for the banks, less for the countries themselves</br>  NEver pays taxes, and every deal is handled under the table.. Surprized when government runs out of money.. Fuck 'em.  who  Maybe we could implement slavery again to get something back from these scum? Fucking worthless people  <br>where did you get the info that they don't pay taxes?</br>  Greece. The only country where they had a council to look over a lake that dried up decades ago. They were all paid well for the job of course.  <br><br>Having been there on vacation 4 times this is pretty much my general impression of it too, kek.</br></br>  <br>When the crisis hit them a few years back, plenty of government corruption came to light. A lot of money had been stolen by government officials. Most of these government officials are leftist. Now they are the ones that want the country to fall apart a ultimately brake the EU.</br>  <br>my first thought, OP.<br><br>Blaming the Greecs is victim shaming, blame the EU for not giving them more money to waste.</br></br></br>  <br>so that means corrupt politicians didn't pay taxes.<br>where is the info you have about hard working greek citizens that didn't pay taxes?</br></br>  <br>that's common knowledge you helenic faggot</br>  <br>so is that germany will write off that debt you intergalactic faggot.</br>  <br>it is the nature of private banks that print and loan money for profits<br><br>debt = slavery<br><br>the USA is in debt for 18 trillion to the Federal Reserve which is a private bank run by the Rothschild bank, and the debt is ignored as long as the US Govt and military-industrial complex does the dirty work for the bankers, as soon as the government and military quits being the muscle for the bankers the central bank will demand the debt be paid and the government will go broke</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dude, just look around the web. <br>Here, I'll help you a little...<br>https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gre<wbr>ek_government-debt_crisis<br>Good luck!</br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br><br> private banks <br> print money <br><br>Lol</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> A lot of money had been stolen by government officials <br><br>This is now being realized as an overestimate.<br><br>However, <br> where is the info you have about hard working greek citizens that didn't pay taxes? <br><br>NO one pays taxes in greece, this is why they got in such deep shit. Just google "greece tax evasion"<br> In the last quarter of 2005, participation in tax evasion reached an estimated 49% of the population <br><br>It has been going on for a very long time, it is part of their culture. It's not entirely the people's fault, the government just doesn't come after you and no one really willingly wants to pay taxes. Unfortunately, this leads to your government taking out loans they now realize they can't pay back.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>let me fix that for you<br><br>private (central) banks</br></br></br>  Fuck Greece. What is that pathetic stunt of setting up an emergency referendum just to win a couple days? Fuck them. It was a mistake to get them into the eurozone, and they will never be willing or able to do what's really needed to fix their country, no matter how much money is wasted on them. So fuck'em deep in the ass. Let them die and rot mouth open.  <br>Not the fag you reply to, but do yourself a service and google money creation private banks. Banks create money by fiat. When a bank gives you a mortgage loan all it does is add your credit line to the liabilities column. Central banks have given up a long time ago the idea they're the only ones creating money. What they try to do instead is control the money supply and velocity in the economy. The idea is that an economy is too difficult to control if the central bank is the only one creating money and this process should be farmed out to the private sector.</br>  <br>07/30/15 the day when shit finally hits the fan</br>  <br>learn to use google<br><br>http://www.theguardian.com/world/20<wbr>15/feb/24/greece-collecting-revenue<wbr>-tax-evasion</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Lending money creates money.

Greece's funding is going to stop this day.</br>  <br>Greece is Africa grade corrupt third world paradise</br>  ITT faggots who fail to see what the IMF ECB and EU did to Greece, this "Crisis" was a fucking scheme to rescue French and German banks, not Greek btw  <br>Their former leaders LIED their way in, and the EZ knew it and went along.<br><br>The greeks will only recover when they have their own currency.

Even if they suddenly caved, isn't it too late to logistically pay the debt?

It has been all arranged with Germany, ISIS will do the dirtiest jobs. We will see some serious bloodshed soon.</br>  This is the place where i am not going to give a fuck about what the rest of the world thinks about us, drinking ouzo, eating the one, the only, the original Cretan Souvlaki with extra tzatziki on the top, and fucking some richfag grade tourist pussy for desert, having euro's or drachma's is something i really don't care about  <br>when there are more new porsches sold than higher rate tax payers in the country it becomes pretty apparent that a lot of rich people haven't been declaring their incomes</br>  <br>"Ant".. is that Greek for "Germany"?</br>  <br>You're a huge fucking stupid idiot spouting nonsense. No French bank was ever in any danger of going bankrupt. When shit went down in 2008 there were some banks for which there was a little doubt and liquidities got a bit dry. The FRENCH GOVERNMENT lent them money to ease things up. That money was REFUNDED to the French state a few months after. No French bank was even re-capitalized with French money. There was no bailout. Any danger to French banks was all over in 2008 already. You can go FUCK YOURSELF with your own dick you fucking third-world faggot.</br>  <br> hard working <br> greek citizens <br><br>Pick one and only one, you lazy fuck.</br></br></br></br>  <br>ΔΝΤ, Greek for IMF</br>  <br>you mad b/ro?, that's the way i like it</br>  <br>Yes. They had months. They had all the time they wanted to do a referendum in time. It's a joke, they're still playing games with the EU.</br>  Greek master race reporting in.<br>We lied to get into the EU and got your money.<br>We kept getting your money for decades and still do.<br>Now that we don't get as much money we have a "refendum" in order to leave and will now start getting new money from the Chinks and the Rus.<br><br>How does it feel to work while I'm getting money by producing nothing?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well at least it looks like the EU isn't in the mood to play anymore.</br>  <br> Federal Reserve which is a private bank run by the Rothschild bank <br><br>no, the Fed is run by the people appointed to run the fed - it is notionally owned by the various member banks... these are the likes of citi, J.P Morgan etc..<br><br>The Rothschilds are not that big as far as banking is concerned, they're a very wealthy family and they have some banking and asset management interests but you're looking at a tier two bank in London and a small asset management firm... the idea they control the fed is laughable - the last time they had the sort of influence conspiracy theorists believe they have today was back when the British were fighting the French at Waterloo</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>  where is the info you have about hard working greek citizens <br><br>Indeed, where is it? Retiring at 50 isn't my idea of a hard working person.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Greek master race <br>Hahahaha.</br></br>  <br> retiring at 50 <br><br>You don't know shit.</br></br></br>  <br> i can't refute a single word he said <br> u-u-u mad? </br></br>  <br>Go fap your tiny nordic dick, when you come to vacation I'll have Takis fuck yo wife while you watch like the cuck you are.</br>  <br>check your dictionary and then try to laugh</br>  <br>the fact is that you live in a country that could run perfectly and pay his debt like every other but instead is going bankrupt due to the years of poorly runned administration and tax collection</br>  <br>I bet that 1. given the current unpopularity of the eurozone institutions, no country will want to join in unless they have a solid case that it will benefit them and 2. the eurozone will use the benefit of hindsight and won't accept any sketchy application like Greece was, hoping for the best</br>  <br> this mentality <br>Wow, greeks are truly the worthless niggers of Europe.</br></br>  <br><br>Well, I guess the IMF can't really do anything after they default, but once they leave the euro, they still will have other debts that will now be impossible to pay from countries that can lead to sanctions.<br><br>Your debt doesn't just go away when you default.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Wow, greeks are truly the worthless niggers of Europe <br>Amen to this^</br></br>  <br>The problem with Greece is 0 prodcution, and austerity measures don't really aid the rise of the private sector. Tax evasion could also be dealt with, but once again the focus is spent on installing even more taxes instead of busting tax evaders. It's a broken system that needs fixing but blaming all the Greek working class guys who will now retire at 70 after decades of unhealthy labor is just sick.</br>  <br><br>You don't provide counterarguments.</br></br>  <br> implying people will still visit your country  <br> when it becomes a crime riddled third world shit-hole </br></br>  Ρε παίδες, τι ασχολειστε εδω μεσα, μονο 12χρονα ειναι και περιμενετε σωστη συζητηση με καποιον απο αυτους? γαμηστε τους ολους και αντε γεια  <br><br>Then you lend them your own money, how about that?</br></br>  <br>Better a nigger than a cuck.<br><br><br>Δικαιο εχεις. Τι θα ψηφισεις την Κυριακη;</br></br></br></br>  <br> Then they can devalue it to boost their export and tourism economy and go from their. <br><br>It will take decades for them to recover from that, while turning their country into a worst shithole than Bangladesh.</br></br></br>  <br>i only know that my mother worked for 40 years and paid her taxes to retire at age 65 and now the eurofucks want to make her pension 300 euros, fuck this WE ARE OUT<br><br><br>Δραχμη εδω και τωρα και οι γερμανοτσολιαδες γλυφοκωλι στη μερκελ και στη λαγκαρντ θα ψηφισω</br></br></br></br>  <br>Which is why talks have began with Russia and even the Chinks, it's not gonna be easy but we've been at the same program since 2009 and NOTHING has changed, if anything it's worse now.</br>  <br><br>Won't happen. What will happen is that about 70% of the population will leave the country leaving the rest that is actually productive to produce. Basically making the same stuff Bangladesh produces but saving on transportation.<br><br>And some tourism too.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Better a nigger <br>Glad you finally admit that you're a subhuman.</br></br>  Dear b faggots. Please keep in mind that all debts, short and mid term of greece have been bought by France and the UK. This implies that wathever sum of money the EU (germany) provides to greece...it is directly transfered to the UK and France. The outcome for greece is turning a short-term lone in a long-term, postponing the shitstorm. For the UK and France this means $$$$ profit. Pleas understand basic economics!  <br> new money from the Chinks and the Rus <br><br>You think after they realize you are a poor investment (arrogant government, won't pay debts...) they would care? You're only value politically is you are an EU country. Once that goes, Russia doesn't really stand anything to gain from investing in you.<br><br>Russia, WANTED you to stay, so they could pick up the tab later.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i disagree but your dubs say otherwise? (that is your argument right?)</br>  <br><br>Your politicians stole your mom's savings. Or misspent them, whatever. As for your mom, well, I'm in favor of euthanasia. People shouldn't need to be forced the indignity of living when they can't afford to.</br></br>  <br>Pay your debts Greece</br>  <br>i know in italian it's called "signoraggio", could you tell me the english name? here it's considered conspiracy theory but i'm pretty sure most of i've read is true</br>  <br>China is already investing hard in Greece. Check COSCO.<br><br><br>le funny debtz meymey<br><br><br>Amen.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I recognize that the austerity plan were stupid and even more weakened greece, the problem is that the new government refuse to comunicate with eu and demand a pure erasement of the debt, which is unconcivable for a country like germany who paid a tremendous debt to every european country</br>  <br>can you hear this? its the sound of the worlds smallest bouzouki while i spent the last of your money just to print my money next week while saying i don't give a fuck of what you think</br>  <br> oooh I should write in Greek so these fucking 12 year olds won't know what I'm saying! <br><br> I can't into google translate! <br><br>φάει τον κώλο μου</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, the idea of having a referendum wether or not to take more EU money in exchange for their demands a week after the money is required is surely a great plan. South europeans, fucking lazy dipshits.</br>  <br> China is already investing hard in Greece. Check COSCO. <br>Ah yes of course, they invest so hard that Greece doesn't need EU money after all. If you seriously thing that China will invest money to save your country, you are retarded.</br></br>  <br>i don't need Gtranslate, i speak 4 languages, you speak 1/2</br>  <br> i don't give a fuck of what you think <br> while i spend my time replying over and over telling you just how much i don't care about what you think </br></br>  <br>Omfg, are you serious?<br>The "eurofucks" isnt gonna take anything from you, your stupid goverment has overspent their funds and has borrowed money they couldnt pay back.<br><br>Hope your country goes bankrupt.</br></br></br></br>  <br>We should invade greece and enslave their people in Jesus's name.</br>  <br> winning! <br>topkek</br></br>  <br>Yeah China is doing it out the goodness of their heart mm indeed how naive you must be.</br>  <br>greeks are filth now</br>  <br>greeks are filth now</br>  <br>well, we know reality is different</br>  <br>No problem, the banks are safe now. That would have been a problem a couple of years ago. Those private bank debts have been socialized, other countries have them and are liable for them now. Thats the difference why we can now let them go down, now it is just everybodies tax money. Capitalism is a great system, isnt it?</br>    <br>Greece actually erased the German debt back in the 50s I think and we never got back our war reperation money OR the loan that Hitler took from Greek banks during the occupation.<br><br>Also, the new goverment (even though I don't like them much) aren't demanding a pure erasement but a cut so that it becomes viaable since now it's just too big to let the economy revive. No talks of "erasement" have been had.<br><br><br>And you can't even use google translate right. You sure are an imbecile.<br><br><br>Nobody ever said that, and EU isn't doing it for the "European idea" either. There are interests, and as long as they benifit both of us we accept them. So far the European interests don't seem to be helping Greece much.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But that is exactly what they are doing.<br>Germany loaned Greece money tthe first time because they knew their politicians were corrupt as fuck and the people didn't have the capitol to pay it back.<br>Now they've shuffled Greece to the breaking point and they are going to command debnts be paid and completely collapse their economy.<br>But because they are part of the EU they are about to sink their economy as well.<br>We owe China fucktons but they will never recall it because their entire economy relies on us not falling apart and going into bankruptcy.<br>It's a country sized self destruct button</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>needs more back and ass hairs to be accurate.<br><br>Greek men look disgusting. Like greasy sweaty apes.</br></br></br>  <br>Thats not missmanagement, they were waiting for the lake to return and observe that the moment it happens.</br>  <br> LOL, actually believes this </br>  <br>Why has it taken until now when you are on the eve on bankruptcy and the country in ruins for China to suddenly offer this deal. They realize you are in deep shit you have no choice but to take a shit deal and believe me to default on the European Union will lead to nothing but sabre rattling. Default on China they will wreck your country in more malign ways then the EU ever could.</br>  <br>China ha been here since 2010 at least. I'm not saying they will become are sugar-daddy partners in crime, but they most certainly have interests in the region.</br>  <br>You are right, the hard working greek citizens are paying their taxes. Problem is, there are hardly any of those.</br>  <br>Germany actually paid them jundreds of millions in the 80's/90's for war stuff.</br>  <br> Germany actually paid them jundreds of millions in the 80's/90's for war stuff. <br>you must live on mars, no other obvious explanation</br></br>  <br>Nope, Germany even has the nerve to claim that the debt was erased in 1990 when it was unified cause "it's a different thing now".</br>  since we are a nation of fags lets eat cum  <br>bahahahahahah</br>  roll  Rall  Ending of the most boring Games I've ever hosted.<br><br>But nevertheless, congratulations Sableye!</br></br>  <br>Stats for nerds</br>  <br>Congrats.</br>  <br>Winscreen!</br>  <br>Congratulations to the gem-eater.</br>  <br>You're not a bright one, hehe</br>  <br>[Kana.exe has stopped working,would you like to restart?]</br>  <br>Awesome.<br><br><br>Kana pls</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm sorry Musaki, I'm not very good at thing like that when I first wake up...</br>  <br><br><br><br>Congrats</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because you're you.<br><br>f perv</br></br></br>  <br>I dont know who you are talking about.</br>  <br>No,leave it be.<br> Jasper </br></br>  <br>God dam- *sigh* Darn it.</br>  <br>Shutdown.</br>  <br>Thank... you.</br>  <br><br>Next game.

Do you think anyone in the black panthers or other racist pro-nigger group will be on the list and expost? Hell no. The nigger president has made this country more divided now than it was in 1860. Don't even get me started on his rainbow flag white house, trying to annoy christians. The nigger president is trying his best to bring this country down.

It just turned our school into a shithole where the monkeys took over. They were unstoppable. They brought in a racist black principal from downtown ATL who took over and he'd let the blacks get away with anything.
