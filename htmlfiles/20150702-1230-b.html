We broke up about 2 months ago, and have remained as good friends. She was a really nice person. A couple days ago, she invited me over to hang out and watch some movies. Now we all know that "chillin and watching netflix" generally means to get under the sheets, but I figured I could hold back and we could actually have a decent time.<br><br>When I got there, we started watching some Daredevil. A couple episodes in, she leaned over and told me she still had sexual feelings for me. I was kinda surprised, but at the same time, kinda aroused. One thing led to another and we ended up having some casual sex. <br><br>Now here's the kicker. After we got done. She ended up telling me she had a bf. She didn't say it out of regret though, and even told me that she's glad we had sex again, and said we should do it more often. I went along with it and said sure, and we continued watching the show.<br><br>Nothing has really happened since us between then and now. I'm generally a really nice person. I don't want to be treated disrespectfully by getting cheated on, and I certainly don't want someone else to feel the same way. So I'm debating as to whether or not I should tell him or let him be. And even if I do tell him, I don't know how to get a hold of him. What do /b?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>excellent<br>you're doing the right thing OP<br>#brosbeforehoes</br></br></br>  Read the message and didn't even reply.
