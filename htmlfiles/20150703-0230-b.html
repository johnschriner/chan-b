You aren't even the 10th best country, at anything. Fucking loud n' proud losers. inb4 MUHARMIES.<br><br>One way is to look at how America now compares with other countries in key areas. The group of twenty advanced democracies—the major countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), including the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Japan, the Nordic countries, Canada, and others—can be thought of as our peer nations. Here’s what we see when we look at these countries. To our great shame, America now has<br><br>• the highest poverty rate, both generally and for children;<br>• the greatest inequality of incomes;<br>• the lowest social mobility;<br>• the lowest score on the UN’s index of “material well-being of children”;<br>• the worst score on the UN’s Gender Inequality Index;<br>• the highest expenditure on health care as a percentage of GDP, yet all this money accompanied by the highest infant mortality rate, the highest prevalence of mental health problems, the highest obesity rate, the highest percentage of people going without health care due to cost, the highest consumption of antidepressants per capita, and the shortest life expectancy at birth;<br>• the next-to-lowest score for student performance in math and middling performance in science and reading;<br>• the highest homicide rate;<br>• the largest prison population in absolute terms and per capita;<br>• the highest carbon dioxide emissions and the highest water consumption per capita;<br>• the lowest score on Yale’s Environmental Performance Index (except for Belgium) and the largest ecological footprint per capita (except for Denmark);<br>• the lowest spending on international development and humanitarian assistance as a percentage of national income (except for Japan and Italy);<br>• the highest military spending both in total and as a percentage of GDP; and<br>• the largest international arms sales.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>In regards to ops picture, I love these people on Facebook who do these "20 day weight loss challenges".... OK so you're doing it for 20 days, THEN WHAT? Are you just going to go back to being a lazy fatass. Why not make it a "lifetime weight loss challenge"?</br>  <br>Juice for two weeks, destroy their insides, go back to hamburgers. Baffled why they yo-yo weight.</br>      <br>Yet here you are, crying about my country. I'm sorry that we just don't care about whatever third world shithole you call home. <br><br>Stay jealous my friend</br></br></br>  that's how capitalist countries turn out eventually. Not a surprise.  <br>It would be a pleasant change for once, that when you nice people trash our country, you at least tell us where you are from because it's obviously better in your opinion. But you won't, because you know you're wrong.</br>    got awful quiet in here<br>op blew his load in the first post</br>  <br> muh freedom <br>'MERICA <br>Cheeseburger <br>liberty</br></br></br></br>  <br>germany</br>  <br>American here.<br><br>You have no idea how often I've wished I was born somewhere else. I lost the birth lottery, but at least I'm not in some South American or Mid-Eastern shit-hole.</br></br></br>  <br> the major countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), including the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Japan, the Nordic countries, Canada, and others—can be thought of as our peer nations. </br>  <br> germany <br><br>we all know where this is going now</br></br></br>  <br>the only possible route</br>  <br>Yes, I saw that the first time. I didn't realize you could from more than 6 countries at the same time. Thanks for pointing that out.</br>  Lost me at "highest infant mortality rate". US is 5.2/1000 births. Afghanistan is highest at 187.5/1000. US is 34th best out of 188 countries. Not the best, but ceratinly not the worst.<br><br>Yes...we are too fat. Because we've spent many years becoming the greatest economy on earth so that we can afford to both thrive as a society and to support fat, lazy slobs. You have them there too, wherever you are (assuming you are in a country where you have access to food and clean water like all of us fat stupid Americans). You just don't admit it.<br><br>Get your facts straight, you jealous fuck. Enjoy the shithole you live in while I work my high-paying job in safety, then go home to clean my gun, work out, watch a movie on my high-def big screen television, eat safe and healthy food for dinner, and then fuck my beautiful girlfriend. Have a nice life, shit-for-brains.<br><br>And of course we keep a huge army...so when a pack of fucking morons like you get out of line, we can send in a few JSOC teams and heavy bombers to kick the living shit out of your entire army.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>still assblasted that the allies dismantled their "1000 year" reich</br>  <br>jolly right my friend. we gave jerry a right arse kicking, we did!</br>  Oh...you are from Germany. No wonder you are jealous. We soundly kicked your ass (twice), you have Nazi shame and/or rage, and you are getting ready for your country's economy to completely stall out since you geniuses decided to buy into the whole "Eurozone" thing and support all of the bums in Greece, Italy, Spain, etc whi still refuse to reform and pull their own weight. Makes the UK look pretty fucking brilliant for keeping their own currency, huh?<br><br>Have fun working to support the European welfare society, and hoping you don't get destroyed by some North African immigrant terrorist in the near future.<br><br>No wonder you hate America, you silly German fuck.</br></br></br></br>  niceme.me    <br> the allies <br>You mean the britains and russians</br></br>  <br> We soundly kicked your ass (twice) <br> americans actually believed they decided the world wars <br>topkek</br></br></br>  <br>nice try friend</br>  <br>Well, they certainly didn't hoist the american flag in Berlin</br>  <br>And you say America has the shitty educational system. Try reading instead of just looking at the pictures.</br>  <br><br>For real? you should read a history book to find a clue. Entry of America into both world wars ensured that all of Europe is not speaking German today.<br><br>And no one here even wanted to be in WWII until Pearl Harbor. Saved European and Asian asses, we did. Who else was going to pull it off...the French? The Brits fighting valiantly but hopelessly over-matched? The Chinese? What a joke...<br><br>Fact.<br><br>Who decided the World Wars, genius? Hmmm...must have been those brave partizans.<br><br>Gimme a break.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>funny thing is<br>our economy is still better than yours and we never had any problems with terrorism from the outside<br>and i dont hate america<br>canada is pretty fine<br>i dont even hate us-americans for being this<br>what i hate is the us-american government, some us-american people but i truly hope that you guys can get over your puritanian heritage soon<br><br>and no, im not jealus, why would i?<br>i can go to school for free, after that i got a degree that is more worth than your collage degree, then i got into university, also for free<br>after i did my msc i got a great job in 3 weeks and you know what?<br>i did not lend me any money, no, actually after i finished my studies i actually had a positive account balance<br>you can only dream from this</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Norway. So yeah...<br><br> /thread? </br></br></br>  <br>russia</br>  <br> someone believes that America wasnt the deciding factor in both world wars <br>gr9 b9 m9</br></br>  <br>you could say the same about every other country that was part of the wars and that wherent part of them</br>  <br><br>Actually, they did. Berlin was partitioned very quickly with the Americans holding their part and the Russians holding theirs. One building does not a city make.<br><br>And the Russians would have still been bogged down and getting their asses handed to them on the Eastern front if the US had never shown up and actually forced the Germans to fight in Western Europe instead of just pillaging art, drinking wine and fucking French girls.<br><br>Truth.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuckn bait nigga</br>  <br><br><br><br>Guys, what are you doing?</br></br></br></br>  <br>i think i still have some 3rd reich history book from my grrandparents somewhere around in the basement for the keks so yes<br>what do you believe what they write into historybooks?</br></br>  ITT: butthurt Europeans  <br>Why do you wish you were born somewhere else?</br>  So America doesn't rate #1 at absolutely everything? Does anyone? No? Thought so.<br><br>The fact is if you are pretty well off, like the top 50% of the economic ladder in America! life is actually pretty fucking great. Yeah in the ghettos it sucks. But that inequality thing swings both ways, for every shit clinic in downtown rusted shithole you have incredible hospitals like John Hopkins. America is really a tale of two nations, and taking the average isn't a fair comparison when a crap clinic is just 30 minutes from a private world class one. If you live middle or up, America really is a great place to live. People from all over come to America to get educated in science, math, engineering, and tech fields, and many opt to stay. So maybe... Just maybe... America may not be the end all be all at everything. Ok. But we are STILL seen as the land of opportunity by many. We are STILL the nation everyone turns to when something happens. Americans don't do state charity much, in terms of foreign aid. But remember that even a small percent of our economy can flood most nations in cash. And it doesn't factor private charity given by Americans, the number of private charity groups led by Americans (warren Buffett and Bill gates have given billions in charity, and pledge more through the Bill and Melinda gates foundation, etc.). <br><br>Note I'm not mentioning ww2. I don't think its relevant to the convo really. But America is still the guarantor of European security. During the Cold War does anyone truly believe that West Germany or France could withhold the soviet hordes? No, they probably couldn't, we saw what happened when the soviets and Germans squared off last. To this day most euro nations are in a weaker state than they were in the Cold War, and with a resurgent Russia NATO's existence has been reinforced. So bitch and complain about America all you want, but we still are a world leader with no one rising up as a suitable replacement to fill the void.</br></br></br></br>  dubs names my cyrex  4chan made me this  Im a nigger  Silly Nig  <br>Kek</br>  <br>Transexuallity isn't real,They're just faggots.</br>  <br> True, bro.</br>  <br>OP Delivars</br>  Why are girls around 12 so fucking perfect, /b/?<br><br>They should lower the age of consent for girl's to 11-12 because they're a lot more developed than males.</br></br>  <br>lower it to 4</br>  I know what you mean, she 13...  <br>more please aha</br>  any pad  <br>yn77p3v2f5w2<br><br>Captcha: pizza.

NO WAY.</br>  <br>His kids probably drove him nuts playing the movie and soundtrack over and over and over and over and over and over -GYAAAAAAAAAAAAH!</br>  <br>You know he had that pimp hand on the charger for like two weeks before unleashing it on that big bitch</br>  <br> Not running with all his might prior to the jump <br><br>Stupid fucking kyke.</br></br></br>  <br>ur mums a cgi fake</br>  <br>So, today, we learn THATS possible.</br>  <br> jet fuel cant make spiders scream </br>  <br>ayy lmao</br>  <br>Cute.</br>  <br>i love how it just sits there and pounds it while swaying. dude i wish i was as alpha as that seal.</br>  <br>I think this word has just given a birth to the new generation</br>  <br> Plus you're supposed to brake on the turns, that's what the signs say <br>It's the ride designer's fault for allowing something like that to be at the control of the rider in the first place. Either change the configuration of the track so brakes aren't needed, or use a system that automatically applies braking when needed, or at least space the riders out far enough that contact isn't going to happen.</br></br>  <br><br>Sugar crash.<br><br>I LUBS YOU, ORANGE</br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you have functioning ears?<br>He said he was going to ram her and let out the raptor screech</br></br>  <br>Too little oxygen at birth.</br>      <br>It wouldn't have mattered.
