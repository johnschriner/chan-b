it but I have put too much work into it to not finish so I'm gonna post here again.<br><br>I don't wanna post it all for nothing though so I want some replys before I give too much away<br><br> Pic related <br>It's the girls ass I'll be telling the story about so you guys have something from the start, maybe I'll post more when I done with the story, so here's part 1<br><br> be 2013 <br> meet a girl that gives me a feeling I haven't felt for a long time <br> I feel at home with her <br> I feel like a child with two loving parents when I'm with her <br> like everything I've ever worried about doesn't fucking matter anymore <br> she makes it all go away <br> it's October when we really start getting close <br> I leave in November for college <br> already figuring we will get close and lose contact once I leave <br> I try to make the best of what time I got with her <br> she actually lets me get my dick wet even though we've only been talking for a few weeks too which was fucking amazing <br> I say it like that but this was the most passionate sex I've ever had in my life <br> she says the same thing, "I've never felt that before" type of stuff <br> we near Nov. <br> it's time for me to leave <br> I say goodbye <br> we agree we won't lose contact <br> I almost knew we would, but little did I know we wouldnt </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Part 2 bump<br><br> fast forward a little <br> I've been at college for about 2 weeks <br> we actually still talk everyday with the same passion we had when we were together <br> we talk about how much we miss each other <br> some more details: I'm living with a roommate I've never met before college but he's really chill and we both smoke weed so that's cool <br> anyways I come up with the idea to tell her she can come live with me if she wants <br> just one more option she has in her life <br> I slowly bring it up <br> it went a little like "I know this is a big step and something that we will have to talk a lot more about, but if you would like to come here and live with me I would like that" <br> I remember her just saying "really?" <br> I took it bad and said yeah but its okay if not, I just wanted to give you the option <br> she almost immediately said yes <br> my fucking jaw dropped <br> this girl I have completely fallen for, that's only been close to me for about 2 months now, has agreed to move in with me <br> I'm on top of the world </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Part 3 bump<br><br> fast forward <br> my mother had agreed to help her move <br> which also says a lot about my mother, as she helped this girl she only met a handful of times move in with her son that now lives 6 hours away from our hometown <br> I still remember the day she got there <br> it was like a movie <br> we're see each other from far away and start running towards each other and we hug and kiss <br> we're happy, truly happy <br> we live there for about 4 months with no problems other than normal life shit <br> problems did start arising <br> only 1 car <br> I'm only going to school, not working <br> she's working but doesn't make much <br> i start being lazy and bum around all day until my afternoon classes <br> no money so I don't take her out much <br> I feel guilty about all this and I tell her I wish we could have a better situation <br> school was only a 9 month program so finding a job for only 5 months would be almost pointless <br> I felt we were doing okay <br> then one day I realize it <br> she's not happy anymore <br> she distant <br> she won't let me hold her like I used to <br> she doesn't look at me like she used to <br> she doesn't love me like she used to </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>already bad news<br>you went to college. never bring baggage to college. your failure is imminent.</br></br>  <br>lurking</br>  <br>Part 4, the real downfall<br><br> I ask her whats wrong, what I can do to fix this <br> she dodges all my efforts to help our relationship <br> she's already made her decision <br> I can't change her mind now <br> night was always the worst <br> we had to sleep in the same bed, but I know she doesn't want to be next to me <br> if I even subtly touch her or brush her while going to bed she jerks her body away from me <br> I was destroys by that <br> I couldn't cuddle with her anymore <br> she hated me <br> the day comes around when she tells me <br> "anon, your mom is picking me up in exactly 2 weeks" <br> "I'm moving back home" <br> I was broken <br> I failed <br> I failed to keep this girl happy <br> I failed to keep the girl that made me love life again <br> I failed to keep the love of my life <br> she's moved back now <br> she tells me she's doing alright and that maybe someday we can try again <br> I knew it was just pity <br> next thing I know, she has a new guy <br> this guy is a jailbird <br> in and out of jail his whole life <br> little did I know, he had introduced her to heroin </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Bump</br>  <br>so you dated a secret loser for like 6 months and then she decided to leave to go live as an actual loser? good job dodging a bullet. don't feel bad, anon - you will find better.</br>  <br>Oh shit</br>  <br>Part 5, hell<br><br> I'm so angry but I keep it all in and repress it like you shouldnt ever do <br> these next 5 months alone at the apartment we lived in together were complete and utter HELL <br> all I ever think about is her <br> I forget she gone half the time <br> I come home from school expecting to see her on the bed waiting for me <br> but she not there <br> I look around the room and realize how blank and empty the room is without her and her stuff there <br> its about 3am one night and I'm sitting, moping, reminiscing <br> my phone starts ringing is her <br> I heart skips so many times I thought I might have died <br> I answer <br> "hello" <br> *crying* "anon, I know you don't want to hear about this but you're all I have. There's no one else I can call. No one answered except you" <br> "talk to me, I'm here" <br> "my bf, he went to go do a deal to get more H. But the guy pulled a gun on him. He pulled his and then the cops came and now he's in jail" <br> oh fucking great <br> this is where she's gotten herself? <br> this is what she left me for? <br> THIS? <br> "it's okay, just breath okay?" <br> I eventually calm her down and she says thanks and that she will call me tomorrow </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This</br>  I don't know where this is going but I like it  <br>I like your trips</br>  <br>Almost got 6s damn</br>  <br>Part 6, hope<br><br> we start talking again and getting close <br> it's getting close to my school program ending <br> I'll be coming back home to her <br> I can tell she's trying to make me forgive her for leaving and getting into such deep shit <br> she says she's made bad decisions and she's sorry <br> I have no choice but to forgive her <br> I tell her I'm coming back soon <br> she's excited <br> she wants me again <br> she likes me again <br> maybe she even still has love for me again <br> fast forward <br> I'm back <br> we meet up about 2 days after I get back <br> she hugs me tight <br> I melt <br> she says she needs me <br> she says never let her go again <br> she says no matter what she says, no matter how she feels <br> "DONT let me go anon" <br> I promise her I will NEVER leave her <br> no matter what <br> I meant that <br> I just helped her though on of the most fucked up situations <br> I love her <br> I never could have let her go though that alone <br> a few weeks go by and were happy again <br> we start dating again in my eyes <br> she tells me she had become so distant during my schooling because she never had a boyfriend as understanding as I am <br> she said she expected me to just call her a bitch and never talk to her again <br> I explain myself <br> that's not who I am <br> she understands that now and has a whole different outlook on me <br> this is good <br> we're together again </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You don't *keep* a woman happy. She either is happy, or isn't.<br><br>However, you should have been a man and worked rather than sitting on your ass.

Stop being such a fucking beta for fucks sake.</br></br>  <br>damn OP you cant be this dumb , people doesnt change , specially people like her</br>  <br> A little mad </br>  Shes fucking playing you so hard. She wants to quit heroin, she goes to you. She needs help, she goes to you. You need to cut her out of your life before it gets too bad  <br>what the hell are you doing op?<br>you just gave her a reason to stay in that bad situation. <br>if you really want her to get better then you have to try and force her to do it. <br>she is too fucking weak to do it herself and you're too fucking weak to truly do anything about it.<br>don't go to her, make her come to you<br>make her realize that she can go into a better situation and not staying in a bad situation with a little bit of good.<br>stop being a fucking pussy and take charge because she won't<br>be a fucking man</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>hahahahhahahahahha you fucking faggot<br>this has got to be fake, right? is anyone really this much of a bitch?</br></br>  <br>Apparently so</br>  <br> I fucked up so bad with you and I still can't believe you even speak to me. <br>Truth nigga. She knows what's up, she might be a heroin junkie but she's more aware of reality than OP is.</br></br>  Op, not trying to be condescending, but I seriously can't stay in this thread cause of how dumb you are. Seriously man...  This thread gave me diabetus..this is now a spiderman thread  <br>Nope, nah-ah, nope, no, no, no, nope.<br><br>She knows you will put up with whatever she does so she will FOREVER give you shit. <br><br>Shoe on the other foot where you fuck up half as bad, you think she is there, anon?<br><br>NOPE.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Looks like I rustled some jimmies tonight<br><br>Here's some more pics to calm you guys down</br></br></br>  <br>Op can you even<br>this is almost cringe</br></br>  For you guys just telling him to cut her I don't think you understand his situation completely. I had this girl whom I fell in love with on first sight. 3 years later she's made it obvious that she doesn't like me that way and never will and she plays me for money and shit and is a total bitch to me but I still stick with her because me and anon both got that feel going.  <br>Is it the last one?</br>  <br>That's a manipulation tactic too. Junkies use it to reinforce the enablers behavior.</br>  <br>You know the OP pic looks fine<br><br>That looks fat. I thought heroin made you lose weight?</br></br></br>  <br>I understand. He's a bitch and you're a bitch too.</br>  <br>k? so were you trolling all along or hwat?</br>  <br>Off by one</br>  <br>I'm in the same position but bitch left me for a nigger and nows she's tainted filth.<br>Assume every girl that leaves you fucked a nigger and you won't ever want talk to her again.</br></br>  <br><br>As if you haven't even already heard this speech before. She's a tumor. <br>Quitting drugs is fucking difficult, I know it by experience.<br> But she has been choosing them (and by extension her boyfriend) over you and her own health. Your value to her has diminished. <br>To her you are just a 24/7 available crying shoulder. You are a willing tool for her to use inbetween her heroin highs.<br><br>Get yourself a fucking scalpel and cut her out of your life.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Lol op digs fat chicks who do h =op is faggot  <br>Have the feel, but do not allow that to affect your actions, FFS!</br>  <br>That "I want to be a doormat and have no self respect and/or balls" feel? Beta bitches, everywhere. I swear man....</br>  <br>This</br>  <br>Yeah I guess so, I've been through that kind of shit before so to get around manipulation I take most people at their word and/or literally.<br><br>Makes life more fun really. Let's you call out bitches when they get all "I'm so sorry, I'm such a bitch".</br></br></br>  <br>You guys call me a bitch, look I get it. But there's no changing what I would do for this girl. Call me bitch, pussy, cuck, but I care about her.</br>  So she has heroin, and you have her?<br>Everyone has their own poison, huh?</br>  <br>SO MUCH THIS! I'm triggered, opie.</br>  <br>quit being a cuck<br>You love her but she is poison<br>You will never have a future with her, so unless you can get your head out your ass by some miracle you might as well start doing heroin with her.<br>It's all you. It's all your fault you stuck with her and couldn't keep her away. And it's your fault you still love her. And that's fine. But face reality. You two will never stop being on again off again unless you either change yourself for the better, or drag yourself down to her level. Frankly, I don't think you can do the former unless she ODs or you leave for a long time.<br>Good luck, anon - not with her, but with yourself.</br></br></br></br></br>    good god this is a lot of text for no nudes.  Dude, she honestly sounds like she loves you but she doesn't love you more than she wants to quit. <br><br>The worst thing about recovering from heroin is that life just doesn't seem that great without it. <br><br>You are stuck in her cycle man, her heroin abuse is killing you and causing you some terrible pain, there is only one piece of advice for you and that is to CUT HER OFF.<br><br>I had my heart broken bad too man, didnt eat for weeks, cried couldn't leave the house. Thought I'd never get over the bitch, got drunk and some dude I was talking to laughed at straightened me out. <br><br>He told me to cut her out of my life, don't talk to her don't look at photos don't do anything, she'll invade your thoughts for months but eventually you WILL GET THE FUCK OVER HER. <br><br>She's addicted to heroin you're addicted to her, stop being a depression junkie and let her go.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>she is hot op, post more</br>  <br>lol, there is no way this bitch is actually addicted to heroin<br>way too much body fat, way too clean of skin<br>not saying that in a bad way, she's actually really attractive<br>but she is playing you SO FUCKING HARD<br>please kill yourself you fucking pathetic cuck beta</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>no one is saying that you fucking faggot. we're telling you because you are going about this the wrong way. she's not going to change and you're not going to change so best thing to do is drop her because you're too much of a pussy to take charge</br>  <br>I get where you're coming from but she's your drug. You need to quit and live. The best way to get over something is to find something new.</br>  <br>Damn bro, you're still a beta fag but I can see why at least. That bitch be really fucking hot.</br>  <br>Meanwhile, there is a worthwhile bitch out there who would be there for you and thus bring you true happiness.</br>  <br>checked</br>  <br><br>Change yourself dude <br><br>Your gonna let her tear you into a miserable pile of a person<br><br>Move on dude <br><br>I've been through exactly what you are going through now and she won't quit heroin cold turkey she can't it's heroin<br><br>So you quit her cold turkey <br><br>And find a better bitch</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You almost have to think like that because if your brain takes it as positive reinforcement you won't ever stop being the enabler and you end up as a cuck like OP :-/ (sorry OP, love you but you're fucking up.)</br>  <br>you don't even love her. you just want to fuck her. seriously. stop fucking lying to yourself. jesus fucking christ.<br><br>ultimately, i think your mom is at fault. she knows the whole story, and hasn't forced some fucking sense into you? jesus shit christ. you should all be removed from the gene pool.</br></br></br>  <br>Have you seen this chick shoot up? or any scars? or even any physical H</br>  <br>Face pic now</br>  im pulling for you op, i like to believe in fairy tale endings, heres hoping you get yours  <br><br>You aren't the first person to be in love with someone asshole, but guess what, being IN LOVE does not last forever, right now you want so badly what you can't have. You obsess over it. If you were to spend the next 3 years together with her you'd fall out of love with her, you might still love her as a brother or parent but being in love does not last forever. <br><br>Time is the healer of all wounds visible and none visible. You'll get over her, you might never meet someone again and have the same emotions but she's poison for you dickhead. <br><br>You aren't the first kid to have your heart broken.. You won't be the last.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying his mom hasn't set him skrait. </br>  <br>So, if I wanted to fuck her would I have to give her H, or just money for H? 'Cause you know that she's the town bicycle for her dealers and she only uses you for safe landing in between. Better double-wrap it, friend. Or move on to something real and let her sort her own life.</br>  <br>I'm not cutting her off. Maybe I'm already fucked in the head from all this idk. Here's the best pic I got</br>  <br/>  <br><br>So is this just your way of venting?</br></br>  <br>So you like feeling all those shitty horrible feelings you feel every time you guys talk. Mkay, OP. You like going to bed every night worried that she's probably shooting up in a filthy public bathroom somewhere? Mkay, OP. You like popping a random boner throughout the day but having it immediately go down because you think about her fucking some other filthy heroin addicted faggot right before shooting up and then picture them lulling in a corner like some diseased vegetable? Mkay, OP. You care about her, though, right? You believe in her though, right? Yeah, OP, you guys'll be fine.</br>  Did this happen yesterday? Is story dead?  Atleast forest gump was retarded but you op you are a plain idiot this women poison  <br>Guess so. I knew you guys would find something in my story to like or hate. Figured fuck it I'll post.</br>  <br>no way that bitch does heroin<br>she is fucking with you on SO many levels</br></br>  <br>Yeah, there hasn't been much progression on the topic of us since. Just normal hey hows it going? You still a junkie? Type of convos</br>  <br>Anon, she does not look like shes on heroin...<br>Are the pics from before that?</br></br>  so shes gonna try to get off the stuff this upcoming week?  <br>vulgar or not we're just trying to help. we all understand going through a rough situation and the steps we took to get out of it. we're just telling you what you should do without being emotionally invested</br>  <br>You and anyone else saying she doesn't do heroin becuase of her body, she smokes heroin she doesn't shoot. And she's also done it in front of me</br>  <br>Man, it is sad how much you do not get this. Here, let me spell it out for you, as a guy who has had female relatives addicted to heroin.<br><br>You are not worth more than the drug to her. EVER. She needs it and will do, and has done, whatever is asked of her for it already, I can promise you this. If she looks healthy, that means she is using regularly and to do that costs money. If she has no means of income, you do not need me to tell you how she is paying for it. Ever see Star Wars? She is Anakin, Episode 3. Cut her fucking legs out from underneath her and move on man. There is no redemption for her, at least not by you. You are not strong enough to help her. Want to know how I know? Because you are bitching about it here instead of doing what you should have done from the beginning. Slap some fucking sense into her, beat her pimps ass and MAKE her give that shit up. Man the fuck up man.</br></br></br>  <br>OP, you seem to be hell bent on depriving yourself of any hope at happiness. Have at it.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>one of these post is not like the others</br></br>  <br>Let me just put this into perspective<br><br>She is getting rammed pretty hard by other guys while you sit around waiting for some fake soppy text from her, which you take completely at face value because you're a desperate faggot.<br><br>She literally has zero respect for you. Girls DO NOT respect guys they can puppeteer like this. She is crazy and you are delusional. Grappling onto the hope youll have that booty on any sort of tap again for your motivation is near insanity and will rot your soul. Begin to cut ties and learn to not fall for her bullshit. The memories you 'shared together' literally mean fuck all to her by this point</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Thanks spiderman for saving us from cringe fucking thread.</br>  <br> And she's also done it in front of me <br>With what she's done to you, that is almost as bad as fucking a guy in your bed while you watch.<br><br>Have you tried the H, OP? If not, you are a cuckold to that shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She has a job. She makes a decent amount of money. She also wants to quit to save money. There's a lot that I haven't told you guys tonight becuase it would take so long. This is a 2+ year story that is still being written. She has heath issues which the heroin has not helped but masked. And she sincerely wants to be clean but the drugs make her pain go away. I use drugs too. Almost everything but heroin and I guarantee if I tried it I'd be just like her. I'm trying to make the best of this situation we have both been in for some while now.</br>  <br>stop being some junkies fall back. she don't love you. actions are love. not biological feelings.</br>  OP here. I just asked her hand in marriage. She immediately asked if i had got a ring and how much its worth. Not sure why  <br><br/></br>  <br>Well this is /b/. People will post what they wanna post, but it just seems fucking stupid.<br><br>U: "Hey guys, I have this problem"<br>/b/: "You should take this action."<br>U: "Yeah, I know, but I don't want to."<br><br>You came here, knowing what kind of advice you'd get (cut her off, as I said earlier).<br>It's a problem with only one real solution, you have the answer. <br>From what you've said, there are two outcomes to this whole debacle.<br><br>1: Move on, cut contact and obtain happiness in your life again. In a few months you will learn of her death by OD from someone else.<br><br>2: Stay with her and support her. Witness her OD'ing yourself and watch as you spiral into depression.<br><br>Choose.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    Treat her as shitty as her heroin boyfriends do, but without the drugs. She'll be stuck on you like glue.  <br>Pathetic. I hope neither of you reproduce. You should both start IV using so you can get AIDS and rid us of your stupidity.</br>  <br>Yeah but how WAS the food?</br>  <br>Hahaha real OP here keks</br>  <br>Honestly OP, i dropped a girl of 2.5 years because she was a junkie. I loved the shit out of her, still do, but i haven't talk to her ass in about 3 years. They're not worth it. They're leaches.</br>  <br>i lol'd.</br>  <br>shut the fuck up faggot</br>  <br>I never came here for advice. I came here to tell a story.</br>  <br>lolol she SMOKES heroin only and you're still going through this shit? she's not even a fucking addict to be pitied, man, she's just a bitch using you. jesus.</br>  <br>Oh shit, I know this girl. I started seeing her but this pussy ass ex of her's won't leave us alone. Said he has a small dick and fell asleep on him a few times while he was trying to get it up.</br>  Telling it like it is<br>its gonna be hard OP but you're strong. we're here for you no matter how much of a pussy you are</br>  <br>You should tell Cheyanne to fuck off until she gets herself clean and can actually prove it to you. YOU BOTH HAVE A FUCKING PROBLEM WITH ADDICTION! You cant letting her string you along like this because its fucking with you just as much.</br>  <br>Oh yeah What's your name?</br>  <br>Dopey McFuckinYoGirl</br>  <br>Damn I knew those censors were shit</br>  I'll do anything for you he says. Proceeds to post shots or her ass and tits. Kek 10/10. Just glad no dinosaurs were walked.    <br>Try writing over it in the same color as the text next time. Man, you can't do shit right. Can't keep a girl, can't post shit. Should an hero.</br>  <br><br>Truth is op, I wouldn't be surprised if this nigga did bone her. She's a junkie, like i said about y girl of 2.5 years, i dropped her. It was one of the reasons i dropped her, so many men have ran her tacks.</br></br>  <br>Oh yeah if she found out I'd be done for</br>  <br>GOT HIM<br>https://<span>youtu.be/tv5x-HWXiKg?t=9s  [ ]</br></br>  <br>I know. I honestly just hate seeing people let themselves get screwed over.</br>  <br>implying you were not done for 2 years ago?</br>  <br>where do you live OP? i'll drop her a $20 for a baggie in exchange for a quick fuck<br><br>also, &gt;420</br></br></br>  <br>Bruh just toss her 5bucks</br>  <br>lololol<br> dubs witnessed <br> shiny and chrome </br></br></br>  Any pics of the feet OP?  <br>Yeah, but honestly I'm doing pretty well for myself. I'm getting a new house in October as I've found a new job that will pay well. I'm happy if I had to say.<br><br><br>Ha true</br></br></br></br>  <br> a story <br><br>Exactly. Why do people even respond to threads like this?</br></br></br>  <br>Here's what's going on.<br><br>You associate her with happiness, being the girl of your dreams, etc. You think you can't have that shit without her. That's why you still feel like you have to care about her.<br><br>She associates you with her old, happy, non-junkie life. She thinks she can't have that life without you. That's why she uses you as a crutch to get clean, why you're her "clean life."<br><br>You're both wrong. You both should give up on each other. Sort your shit out, don't look back.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I mean, hell, if you cannot sort her out, give me her name and address and I will. It is not hard if you actually know how to deal with a junkie.</br>  <br>Priceless! You show her tits and it's over. She fucks guys for drugs and ol' puppy dog stands by her for more. You're a joke, opie. A sick ass joke.</br>  <br>yeah op</br>  <br><br>Nah I was never a foot guy</br></br>  <br>Wanna buy some?</br>  <br>Heroin is awesome.<br> try it <br> build addiction <br> understand life <br> do it with gf <br> OD <br> End of story <br>She'll love you forever since you chose to do the drug that keeps her from you. That OR she's a lying cunt<br>IN B4 I finish another line</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Your princess is a drug addicted whore. Dafuq is wrong with you? Seriously. Something about you is WAY off to take this shit.</br>  somebody saved this story right?  <br>Yeah I'm not okay</br>  Op, you are a pussy. A true fucking vagina of a man. Im a really fucking empathetic person, i was so happy you guy went back together after college. But then she fucked you ober like a dozen times, and your basicly her little bitch that she has. Your a slave, not even a pussy, a fucking non human robot that does her bidding. After that thing with the boyfriend of she texted me about that thing with benzos id laugh in her face and tell her i. Hope she ODs on those benzos. Anhero or end it roght there. And dont tell us how you are in love, ive been too, and ive been fucked ober too, and guess what? After the second chance, you let them go, unless you are a masochist who enjoys humiliation. Fuck im so mad you cannot even comprehend  <br>wots wrong op</br>  <br>Need to! It's a Swiss Army knife:<br>works for cringe, rekt and YLYL.</br></br>  <br>To be honest she left you before when something better came along, or more exciting. You give in each time too easily. She won't learn that you are not her go to when that better situation goes away, or her drugs run out. Maybe she truly loves you maybe she doesnt, but you sitting around waiting on her texts and always saying yes will always ruin this shit for you. She knows who you are and what you do for her and give her, but YOU LET her take you for granted by your actions. You honestly should try to cut most ties with her, if only to try to stop her taking you for granted. She knows she can depend on you. But you are acting like a father figure to her and that will almost never equate to some loving relationship. Have a backbone and help her out but tell her straight up that she takes you for granted. Cutting her off completely will probably just lead her back to easy drugs but honestly, being her father figure and, I say again, making her take you for granted, is no better. This is coming from someone who isn't the average angry btard. You're letting her take you for granted. You are to blame more than her for the relationship problems, not the drugs though.</br>  You're being played, OP. Sucks that you're sucked into this whore's trap. You seem like a genuinely great guy. Hopefully you'll find your real dream girl one day. This girl... is far from a dream. She's a nightmare.  <br>Unload b/ro. I would love to help you puzzle this out.</br>  <br>Do you agree u SHOULD cut her loose?</br>  <br>Yeah. I contemplate cutting her off all the time. I always come to the decision that I'm doing okay how I am and if I'm helping her, good, if I'm not, well then lets just keep trying. I'm doing good either way.</br>  <br>this. exactly this</br>  <br><br>but who IS cheyanne?<br><br>why even care if she's got a name as faggy as that?</br></br></br></br>  <br>literally OP I've dealt with the same thing. you give attention and she takes until she's done. When you stop giving the attention she will crave it either until you start being a bitch and talking to her or you ignore her long enough for her to kill herself</br>  <br>Do you think you can help her yet suppress romantic feels?</br>  dammit Tracy what about the pineapple!?  She obviously isnt smart anyone who does heroin is a dumbass just let her go. Give her an ultimatium  <br>I think I can make her come to reality. I remind her of before she was addicted. Fuck romantics, I want her to be clean, healthy and happy. Idgaf about romantics by now.</br>  <br>This</br>  <br>Yeah this is good, I thought about this conclusion as well.</br>  <br>It's ok to help her. You just need/deserve a healthy relationship, though. Have you decided she will never be marriage material?</br>  <br>Is this one girl, this one pussy, worth losing your life and becoming (probably) as hopelessly addicted as she is? Is that really what you see in the cards for yourself? She's really that worth it? How old are you by the way OP</br>  Ew. Those junkies have wrecked her snatch. How do you not throw up just thinking about those disease infested cocks banging her out? Probably even multiple at once since her vagine is what pays for her habits.<br><br>OP is a fucking cuck faggot.</br></br>  Alright /b/.
