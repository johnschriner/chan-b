[ Me and my girlfriend are going to start a business selling her dirty panties, and possible other "fetish items" (spit, period blood, finger nail, pubes, etc). Any tips on how to go about this? We want to make our own website rather than using the existing marked places.<br><br>Any thoughts or ideas?<br><br>Any good names/nicknames to call my girlfriend? She does not want to use her real name.<br><br>Are there any cheap and secure web hosts that allow anonymity? I don't want to pay more than around $8/month.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Someones been watching too much orange is the new black :^)  who the hell is going to buy blood over the internet? wtf? you might as well go on leddit and just sell her underwear to the plebs  <br>Hue, we had actually been playing with the idea for quite some time before that episode launched.<br><br><br>People will buy the strangest things...</br></br></br></br>  <br>i guess you can go on some dank web forums and find some pedos and lie about your gf's age. but you might get raped or something</br>  <br>I've seen someone selling her period blood on her site, no need to lie on sketchy forums. Our first priority is her underwear, but we might expand to other stuff later.</br>  <br>Just use various communities already setup. Otherwise how are people going to find your website?</br>  Foot fags will pay 30$ for a use par of socks  <br>We'll advertise on said communities, plus 4chan and whatever else we can come up with.<br><br><br>Socks are high on our list of expansions.</br></br></br></br>  <br>i want to buy the nails covered in her blood and your sweat all served in a pig hat made out of her pubic hair <br>express delivery pls</br></br>  <br>Sorry man, we're not open for business just yet :/</br>  Any thoughts on names/nicknames?  <br>i demand my nails</br>    How does someone buy used panties/socks without being highly suspicious that they were worn by some dude for the lulz  <br>you buy them 4 the lulz too</br>  <br>Well, females tend to leak their fluids onto them... And they have a very distinct sent.</br>  <br>is this your collection or do you just post girls with panties?</br>  <br>Well panties, anyway. I don't know about socks.</br>  <br>I'm just posting panty related pictures from google. Sorry if I disappoint you. Actually my girlfriend is out right now shopping for panties, heh.</br>  Nobody has any name suggestions...?  <br>Dude this is a million dollar idea<br>you can cure the cancer from 4chan and make money with it <br>sell brony underwear with a deadly disease</br></br></br>    <br>You want to start a new business in an extremely saturated market place? Really?</br>  <br>bunch of stupid bitches already doing it on reddit</br>  <br>kek<br> Tumblr pantys  <br>with the sent you love</br></br></br>    <br>I would say hair and finger nails yes, period blood maybe not so much. <br>call her something like 'Adjective' then 'generic slutty name'.<br>something like Dirty Britney or some shit.<br>good luck</br></br></br></br>  <br>in what country are you? maybe I can link you a market that works pretty well (to get ideas about what to sell, how the profile should look like, nickname, etc)<br><br>also post some dirty panties/girl's pics</br></br></br>  <br>also maybe socks, who knows</br>  <br>If those are her panties that bitch must be huge.</br>  <br>well you sould build up a customer base on the regular market places or reddit or something before you start your own website, so you have more traffic when you open the site and mate the money faster</br>  <br>Any specific ideas? <br><br><br>The US. We have already been looking at lots of places for ideas, but thanks.<br><br><br>I'm aware of this, buy we want to look more "proffessional" and "exclusive" by having our own website.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dirty panties for you, sir.</br>  Name idea: the fethrift shop. Or maybe upap<br>Used panties and pubes</br>  <br>okay,that sounds smart, then you shoult advertise on those places for some traffic</br>    <br>specific ideas for name?<br>probs have something that she can relate to and that she likes, doesnt have to necessarily relate to her name. but for slutty names i would go for. Rose, Tiffany (Tiff), Misti, Misty, Crystal, Candy, lacey</br></br>  <br>Well first things first, your girlfriend cant have a boyfriend if youre going to sell this shit</br>  <br> US <br>Bad, saturated market. You should move somewhere where it's "new" either you won't make real money.<br><br>Also you should try starting a market, more money in this, take a cut on each deal.<br><br>If you want to sell "period-related", you have to market that shit properly to increase sales.<br><br>Protip: just market these "products" as "strawberry-something" <br><br>Other stuff that people might buy: clothes, saliva, bathroom trash, ...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>try misty or Crystal to attract pokemon/furfags</br>  <br>Upap... There's something catchy about that...<br><br><br>Yup, we're planning on it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>there's already a subreddit set up for this exact thing. Not like I would know for any particular reason.</br>  <br>Boring, shitty to browse, too much competition, only good if you're not in NA(for sellers).</br>  <br>"desperate whore with no self respect"</br>  <br>true but I'm also not the retard who is trying to do this now. when everyone and their fattie aunt is trying to after that stupid show</br>  /b/<br>Me and a few friends are in a debate<br>do animals have language?</br></br>  yes  <br>yeah body language,fool.</br>  <br>no they don't. Do some philosophy, should help you with that debate</br>  No. A language has a structure and ways of communicating concepts and ideas between individuals.<br><br>Animals have communication based on sounds and movements.</br></br>  <br>How + [Citation Needed] <br>not that easy Anon</br></br>  <br>I can speak whale. But only to OP'S mom.</br>  <br>That is a dumb question.<br><br>"Do animals communicate?" is a smart one.</br></br></br>  <br>http://thekidshouldseethis.com/post<wbr>/52874440499<br>Look at this</br></wbr></br>  <br>how is the a smart question ? seems like an obvious yes to anyone with eyes and ears</br>  <br>not talky talky language but different grunts and cries and movements mean different shit</br>  <br>I think whales supposedly have an actual language, other than those I'm not too sure if any other animal has an actual language (ie isn't limited to warning sounds, mating sounds, and the like)</br>  <br>some animals have means of communicating which could be interpreted as language, but in truth the do not. there are not specific words or phrases that they pass down from generations.<br><br>Elephants have several different means of communication even one as strange as ground vibrations that we don't understand very much of. Dolphins and Whales communicate with different calls for different messages they want to send but its not really considered language.</br></br></br>  If you read Carl Sagan's book "The Dragons of Eden" he talks about the abstraction of the communication systems animals.  Animals can communicate but they don't have language.<br><br>I'm a linguist.</br></br>  <br>yes, they speak arabic. Just watch the news.</br>  <br>This cuck gets it<br><br>But friend says, you can't communicate with out language</br></br></br>  <br>Forget the word language.<br>They have their ways of communicating by body expression and noises.<br>I don't think they communicate like us human do.<br><br>It also depends on the animals, cetaceans can communicate like us humans do though.<br><br>If by language you meant different dialects in the animal kingdom within the same species then I believe maybe. But only on a select few like cetaceans wolves, etc. anything that has a social structure.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Looking at basic search-engine results, the definitions of language lean towards something achievable at human capacity.<br>Non-humans interact with other non-humans out of instinct to survive in given ecosystems, whereas civilizations have developed verbal, visual, and physical languages to ensure survival in rapidly changing conditions.</br>  <br><br>gr8 b8 m8<br><br>They do, actually. Body and visual languages.<br><br><br><br>Most animals express their territory.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Which animals?</br></br>  <br>Yeah. I'm the rhino in the pic OP. Now fuck off, I'm busy</br>  <br><br>Also, what is your definition of "language"?</br></br>  <br>Damn, you iz about to take a big dick niggah.</br>  <br>Tripz can't lie nigguh.<br/></br>  <br><br> HOO DI MY LAND GRR <br> HOO DIS MY LAND GRR <br><br>Thats literally it. Its my land. Not my land 'because'. Just its my land, because my instincts are telling me that I need territory. They don't know they need territory, but they act on the instict. Thats the difference.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes of course. <br>I've been studying animals for years and believe they do have the powers to communicate with each other. <br>Just look at the Ferguson riots and a program called twitter. Animals obviously communicate with each other especially right before a major event. I remember one fascinating subject in particular kind of a more advanced koko the monkey we named Martin Luther King Jr who could communicate with the rest of the herd and seemingly inspire them.</br></br></br>  <br>Animals don't communicate with each other. All sex between animals is RAPE if you don't realize that you are part of the problem.</br>    <br><br>I just kek'd at so much stupidity.<br><br>Countries express their territory for resources (food, water, energy or whatever) that are essential to their survival. Are they as stupid as you're describing animals ?<br><br>Did you know apes we're actually able to organize their space with cultural elements ? They're able to mark trees, to dig up holes in the ground to preserve their food ?<br><br>No you didn't. Nice try though : 0/10.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Hi /b/ros. Anyone know how I can get in touch with ISIS to join? My decision is made. Having difficulty finding stuff online. Allahu Akbar.   Implying they would take an overweight faggot like you   <br>Why would you want to join ISIS? What's your goal?</br>    <br>Yeah.
