[ I have to hire someone for my IT department. My boss capped the salary I'm allowed to offer at $55,000. <br><br>Every single resume I've received for the posting either lists a diploma from an online university as their education, or they don't mention a degree at all. Not a single person applying for the job has a degree from a real school.<br><br>What do?</br></br></br></br>  What is the IT role?  Hire one of them for less than the maximum salary, offering "room for advancement". Just because someone doesn't have a degree from a university doesn't mean they don't have the skills. For example, my dad is an IT director for a Mercedes dealership and he never even finished college.  <br> What do? <br><br>What do you mean what do? make a selection of the best resumes, and inverview the candidates, picking the one you think is the best</br></br></br>  <br>don't hire if they have no degree or offer them 30k a year</br>  How good of IT are we talking on a scale of install windows to set up a complex lan? <br><br>Mostly because for 55,000 a year you could just hire to peeps in college looking to work part time if it's just the install office crap.</br></br>  Quit being part of the corporate hand to bring us down man   Having a degree <br> Better than someone without degree <br><br>I have a degree in animation but haven't drawn anything in about 7 years. Just because I have the degree doesn't mean I could do it anymore.<br><br>Read their CVs, invite them to an interview if you like the look of it, hire the best suited one.<br><br>Asshole.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why no rekt thread?

I'd say that both "chwała" and "sława" are correct, but they highlight different aspects: "chwała" is more of a "glory and praise" whereas "sława" is more like "fame and glory" in its vibe.<br><br><br>Anthro is a Greek word, tho, I'd have to check if it is possible to use it as a base for such a phrase...<br><br><br>Till we see each other again! Enoy your meal!<br><br><br><br>Yeah, that's valid too.<br><br><br>Apart from the answer provided by iisu, mine is above.<br><br><br>I get you covered!<br><br><br>Greetings Dash, been a while! I'm more or less fine, thank you, yourself?<br> That's a good choice of a classical music to listen to! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>A bit bored, but I remembered the book you were telling me about a week ago or so, so I'm reading it now. On that note, I was lurking last thread, and your story was awesome. I'd love to read more of it or any other stories you've written.</br>  <br>Glad you like it.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=b2b<wbr>6zwKBfcY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>I did mean it in the more religious sense (naturally).<br><br>Thank you for elaborating!<br><br>If it's not any trouble, I'd like a small tutorial on common greetings and such, the next time we Skype. Translating via Google and the like will not explain proper usage.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Anthro is a Greek word <br>Still better than literal translation from English slang word.</br></br>  <br>All of my favorite people are here today!<br><br>I'm just on vacation, but my thirst for glorious sfur got the better of me. I'm also shopping for a GTX980Ti (my birthday is tomorrow).<br><br>I hope you're well! Thumbs up on the classical and I too am starting to tire of metal (after thirty years of it).</br></br></br></br></br>    <br> All of my favorite people are here today! <br>If I could say the same…<br> Filenames is sleep <br> Haven't seen Konpurekkusu for a looong time <br> doesn't matter, talked to Twincal </br></br></br></br></br>  Seems the mods only fuck with us when we're being polite and cordial with each other.  <br>Happy early birthday, Radzyn! A 980Ti, lucky you! I wish I enough money upgrade. Where are you vacationing, if you don't mind me asking?</br>  <br>Looked like a 404. Disregard.</br>  <br>Well, we're furfags.</br>  <br>you will see (404) on the tab when the thread dies.</br>  <br> Reading it now <br>Yusss, yusss, that pleases me greatly! I'm lookin' forward to hear your opinion after you finish it!<br><br>And if ya want some more of my scribblings, I can provide:<br><br>Chapter (…) Selection of summaries of Alexandreoni myths.<br><br>This chapter contains the selection of summaries of Alexandreoni myths, based upon the versions compiled by Emperor Erxandros II the Confessor, one of the first rulers of the Second Empire of Alexandreon, who was also one of the greatest poets and historians to reign over the Alexandreoni empire. The events, characters and interpretations derived from other sources are properly marked.<br><br>Title 1. The Cosmogony<br>The issue of the origin of the world and gods is surprisingly neglected in the Alexandreoni mythology. The myth of the Beginning could be only reconstructed from the brief passages and elusive references included in the lore.<br>The Alexandreoni mythology asserts that the Universe, as the palpable reality, the temporal world as it is known had its origin in the radiant glory of the Absolute, the unspeakable perfection and amalgamate of Everything that exists. The Absolute, incomprehensible neither by the rational nor mystical manners emanated the entire Universe, along with multiple parallel worlds, as they are inherently anchored in the Absolute. <br>(-to be continued-)<br><br><br>Then, for Polish usage I'd stick with "chwała", since it is a word that is more native to the Polish language, and to Western Slavic languages in general. "Sława" in Polish generally means "fame, popularity", at least such was its original meaning.<br><br>It's not a problem at all! I'll try to provide some handouts and comments!<br><br><br>A fair point.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> one namesync in tred <br> how2namesync <br>Do you see mine?<br><br>Wat happened to others' NameSynces tbh?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>New Jersey (Jersey Shore, specifically).<br><br>Just visiting with friends. I love the weather! 23C in the heat of mid-day, as opposed to the 35C of my region, 2500 km south of this location. Wow, that was a long drive.</br></br></br>  <br>i can see you, Twincal and Dash</br>  <br>I'm going to be away for tomorrow, so happy birthday in advance!<br>(Best pic in my opinion)</br></br>  hello thread  <br>I only see you and me and a bunch of Anonymous. :/</br>  i'm looking for a guy called "dong magician"...?<br>anyone know him?</br>  <br>All great people.</br>  <br>he's probably asleep right now</br>  <br> lewd pic of Katia <br>NO! GO AWAY! CZY TY MASZ ROZUM I GODNOŚĆ CZŁOWIEKA? ;__;</br></br>  <br>Yeah, we know that aggravating motherfucker and Alex-clone.</br>  <br>How does one ns</br>  <br>Thank you twice, my friend!</br>  <br>oh<br><br>b-but i thought everyone loved the best khajiit girl</br></br></br>  <br>[-Continued-]<br>Title 2. The Theogony<br>The radiance of the Absolute gave birth not only to the Universe, understood as the time-space continuum, but also to the pneuma, the first principle of the existence, thus the Beginning of everything.<br>The pervasive pneuma, by the process of gradual concentration, gave birth to the Chaos, the primordial amalgamate of everything existing, apart from the Absolute. After long aeons, the Chaos, through a process of gradual ordering, emanated the matter, from which the world emerged.<br>In the meanwhile, the same pneuma gave birth to the Gods, as the Gods are pneuma and the pneuma is Gods. Infinite numbers of deities emerged, some of them sentient, some mindless, most alien and indifferent towards the emerging world. Aeons lapsed, the Gods existed aimlessly, as the Universe was too young for life to appear. Some of the more benevolent deities devoted themselves to the goal of aiding the birth of the life, manipulating the pneuma to create hospitable environment (author’s note: the creative impotence of the Gods is quite bewildering, particularly when the Alexandreoni mythology is compared to other systems. The Gods were unable to create life on their own, they could only aid its natural emergence. That myth, however unbelievable it may sound, seems to be among the earliest known examples of the anthropic principle).<br>Contrary to many Indo-European mythological systems, the Alexandreoni mythology does not provide an elaborate genealogical tree of the deities, as most of them fell into oblivion before the emergence of the mature Alexandreoni religion. The question whether the Star-Eyed Lady belongs to the first generation of the Gods, who emerged from the pneuma itself, or to the many hypothetical generations of the divine offspring is not addressed directly, and asking such questions is generally considered irrelevant, as deities of all generations deserve the same reverence.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You have to download all the CP you can find and bring them to the nearest police station, telling them you've recorded all of it.
