Jewish descendants and homo cucks.</br>   Whites aren't savages who have killed more than any other race. <br><br>Of course they aren't, of course they aren't.</br></br>  <br>Me since Earth is infested with non-white scum</br>  <br>No, we are, and we'll fucking wipe you out if you slip up, mongrel.<br><br>This is why you have to resort to race mixing to get anywhere because you'll be crushed in physical warfare.</br></br></br>  <br> implying it's something bad <br>It proofs that whites are alphas</br></br>  <br>Top. Fucking. Kek. China and India would fuck your shit up in a conventional war.<br><br><br>Sure they are.</br></br></br></br>  <br>was Rome white?</br>  <br>Nice try fag. If the U.S is committed no single nation could take it on in conventional warfare.</br>  <br>KEK<br><br>India, the ones that can't even muster up enough weapons for their soldiers, their non existent NCO corps, the complete lack of organization, and the poverty levels through the roof?<br><br>Or China, the paper tiger with a brown water navy comprising of old diesel subs and a rusty Soviet carrier, aircraft that smoke more than my Grandfather, and 5'5'' underfed monkey troops with outdates weaponry?<br><br>KEK.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>lol @ u</br>  <br> This much delusion. <br><br>Wow it seems what they say about American education is true. China alone could fuck you up, 4 times the population means they would outproduce the USA so hard it isn't even funny.</br></br></br>  <br>see<br><br><br>Did you get your fifty cents? Oh wait, your stock market crashed. Lmao.</br></br></br></br>  <br> 3 billion people in total war mode. <br> THEY WON'T DO ANYTHING!!!! <br><br>Wow you're stupid as fuck.</br></br></br></br>  <br>China lacks the air and naval power of the United States. We could wipe out their infrastructure overnight. They also lack the ability to effectively damage the United States mainland, nukes aside (No one presses the big red button as that would fuck us all to hell) the United States also has a well trained and experienced military. The Chinese, while well trained, do not.</br>  <br>When was the last time China or India win a war? As i recall they always sucked in a conventional war or modern.<br> dat pic <br>West still dominates the world. Your butthurt powered efforts are futile.</br></br></br>  race is a misbegotten term from a riddled tongue. this culture is a joke, or is it?? their knowledge of medicine has let us have patterns like in google search. what, are you going to resort to pot and follow the newton's profecy???? i think this is a culture of lost knowledge imo. we were falling asleep because we don't believe in higher power or refuse to talk about it falsely, but maybe thats a history of oppression. i don't know. whites rule  <br> USA loses in Korea, Vietnam and Afghanistan. <br> Thinks they could beat China. <br><br>Literally couldn't make it up.</br></br></br></br>  <br> civilians are the ones who go to war <br><br>read a book nigger, I don't think you realize that maybe 10% of them would be fit for military service, and at that, those two dirt nations don't have enough resources to train, arm, or feed those new draftees at any time shorter than a decade.</br></br></br>  <br>We did better than anyone else would have in those wars.</br>  <br> West still dominates the world. <br> USA= P...please don't expand into the South Sea China. <br> P....please don't join that Chinese bank guys. <br><br>lel</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>3 billions of women and elders against nuclear weaponry.</br>    A little bird told me that Whites are responsible for the social problem here, and that the Chinese will have to bail them out with medicine, and Russians with technology. The melting pot has it's merit, but the culture is crazy. OR MAYBE THAT'S JUST ME. For instance, I need medication so that later the pictures don't meld into one another or become impossible to discern, but the medication's culture causes that, where culture is a lost point of term and where point of term is not a defined term  Lol like I give a fuck, I'll be dead in a century  <br> China thinking they're tough <br><br>lel manlet chinks</br></br></br>  <br> What is conscription? <br>China and India are some of the most naturally rich countries in the world with massive agricultural production.<br><br><br> India and China don't have nukes. <br>Can you please go back to your sandbox now, adults are talking.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I tend to think this time is isolate but subject to panic law where panic is a pun and confusive knowledge, eg hopefully our knowledge doesn't end in M-Theory when NYC gets flooded, but maybe if that did happen, it would only be subjective anyway, eg diasporic phenomena  <br>...</br>  <br>China's market almost collapsed a couple days ago. You know why?</br>  <br><br>lol. fucking white ppl.<br><br>i'm not from America, but I'm pretty sure 'America" doesn't fucking equate to "White" you stupid piece of shit.</br></br></br></br>  China is only good for their drugs, but they will fail or succeed a military attempt in seven years, but maybe I won't be around to see it  <br>conscription is when you muster up everyone who doesn't want to fight, and then wonder why they are horribly ineffective and get addicted to drugs.<br><br>See: Russia</br></br></br>  <br>2nd smartest tho</br>  China needs to make a serious drug for drug users that domintes the market imo. fuck this legal weed shit. we'll all get flashbacks, we need something new  <br> An economy went bad for a while. <br>Never happened to the USA amirite?<br><br>Fucking moron.<br><br><br> Russia. <br>Objectively the most powerful country in history.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  smartmouths in this thread, godbless america, social scum  Battlestation thread.    <br>The picture of Iwata there makes me unsure how to feel</br>  bump  <br>hows north korea?</br>  not my battle station but this is probably how most of you live <br><br>https://<span>youtube.com/watch?v=B7bIy0K<wbr>0Ods</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>looks like it's going well for him</br>    <br>1/2</br>    <br>one of very many questions, who is rake and what did he do?</br>    that picture of Iwata in the background ;_;  <br>Hey that's kinda nice.</br>  <br><br>nice cat</br></br>  <br>is this real or...</br>  <br>2/2</br>  <br>Sage<br>Fuck</br></br>  <br>That's gotta be the saddest thing I've ever seen.</br>  <br><br>it says rape you dingus</br></br>  <br><br><br>Try reverse searching it kek</br></br></br>  <br>Not even playing melee. what else is a gamecube good for?</br>  <br>10/10<br><br>10/10<br><br>7/10+1 for keyboard<br><br>6/10 really nice but not my kinda thing<br><br><br>what are those speakers they look fuckin ugly<br><br>terrible keyboard</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>      <br>you have really shit taste and you have no idea how to rate things</br>  <br>Do I hear somebody indirectly talking shit about Super Mario Sunshine?</br>  <br>living the dream</br>  <br> Pikmin 2 <br>My nigga</br></br>  <br>thank's anon now suck my dick</br>  <br>Mario janitor? the worst 3d mario game, sure.</br>  <br><br><br>What's worse is it's real.

One pedal is on/off, one is space, one is backspace.</br>  <br>Fantasy MAN Fantasy man fantasy man FANTASY MAN</br>  <br>I just dropped about $850 recently to get all this shit looking nicer. Desktop was like around 350, keyboard 200, speakers 100, mouse 60, pad 40, cords and Wraps around 40, and wall mounts for Consoles about 60.<br><br>Got the laptop down there I'm the corner last summer for around 2.2k because I needed a hybrid to game and for commuting to college. It's a lightweight powerhouse, and I'm thinking of cutting up the drawer to create vents to let air out, but for now it sits on an angle in the side compartment.</br></br></br>  <br>Dude.... are you fucking eating butter?</br>  <br>is your music even good? let me hear it.</br>  <br>What's on the desk with the iPad?</br>  <br>Fuck yeah it does. It's a gimbal within a gimbal and yes it's custom. The hinges contain the sensors from a joystick that I took apart. The joystick part itself is actually what you use to tip and tilt it which makes the hinges pick up the movement. The joystick is also wired up properly so the buttons work. Then there's the throttle and keyboard/mouse combo. It also has speakers attached with the subwoofer mounted under the seat for obvious reasons. It's only missing the projector and rudder pedals.</br>  <br>Cant beat starfox adventure. 10/10 best starfox game since the creation of the world. best zelda game. would fuck.</br>  It could be better...  <br>How long did it take you to be able to do that whilst doing other thing at the same time?</br>  <br>cut out a nice chunk and put a pc fan in there to move air.<br>it will work well</br></br>  <br>I thought it was a sex machine</br>  <br><br><br>rate</br></br></br>  <br>Not bad to start off, though I'd try to at least organize it a little.</br>  <br>I'm actually impressed anon, looks like an awesome thing to play drunk</br>  <br>bet ya cant find this one on google</br>  Dorm room.  <br><br>You should add me on steam or skype cause damn those legs doe<br>http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mossly<wbr>/</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>No, he's just gay.</br>  <br>0/10 pepsi is better.</br>  <br>You have no fuckin' idea.</br>  <br><br>It's pretty shit. I'm just learning to use the Ableton software for college.</br></br>  <br>so you just don't use that closet?</br>  <br>Yes and with salt,why?</br>  <br> faggot with a fish <br>'dude I bet you get fucking no girls</br></br>  <br>Just join the Air Force already faggot.</br>  <br>The real reason not to do shit like this -- you will not want to add new shit that doesn't fit the theme, even if it would be more convenient (i.e. new fan, keyboard, etc..). Often the best of things (i.e. mouse, computer tower, gfx card, ...) are not made by the same people, and do not aesthetically match. If you can add custom paint and light to everything beyond that, you need a life.</br>  <br>There's a bit of a learning curve, but once you get the hang of it, it's pretty easy. Now I can type papers and play guitar at the same time.</br>  <br>  +1 for using that god awful and probably very uncomfortable chair. But nice setup. </br>  <br>Paula Deen approves</br>  <br>And I can't believe you didn't question my sausages hanging from my desk.</br>  <br>c'mon</br>  <br>God I hated my dorm room. So cluttered. Had the same minifridge. Better be crunchy peanut butter of there.</br>    <br><br>for plebs with shit taste, maybe</br></br>  <br>Are you saying you don't eat a tub of butter for a late-night snack? Fucking normie, you don't belong here.</br>  Hue lights can make anything look good. This was when I first got the chroma keyboard.    r8 ?    <br>You disgust me. Put that cap back on now or I swear, I'll hope you spill it on your desk, but obviously not on anything important because I'm not an animal.<br><br><br>You, however, are. Straight up, get butt fucked. But don't like it.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>requesting the background on the right monitor if youd be so kind</br></br>  Just took this one real quick.  <br>aight faggot sure<br><br>i have somewhat of a life. but i enjoy doing that shit. is that a problem for you?</br></br></br>  <br>Not the person who posted the pic, but that's smooth peanut butter. See the green part of the label? Crunchy is blue.<br><br>-A Peanut Butter Connoisseur</br></br></br>  <br>That doesn't look good, though. An actual camera could probably make it look good</br>  <br>Poutine?</br>  <br>that chair bro</br>  <br>Yeah I was thinking about it, but the damn drawer is so small height wise that it's going to be a pain finding something good to work well enough and still fit in there. The laptop has a 17 inch screen, it doesn't even fit in that side compartment flat, has to be angled. <br><br>Made it work for now since I'm not in school atm, but it would be nice to be able to have easier access to it in the drawer once college time comes around again. Removing it from the side compartment Is a hassle.</br></br></br>    <br>awh dude dat targaryen flag</br>  <br>What sort of shrubbery is this?</br>  <br> Looks good to me </br>  <br>WHo?</br>  <br>Looking for a r8 m8's<br>II'll post the 2nd one if anyone wants to know.</br></br>  <br>Crunchy is the fucking best. I hate smooth. It's just so boring. Crunchy adds so much. Makes it fucking worth it to eat a damn fucking ass peanut butter and cock sucking jelly sandwich. Fuck. Now I'm pumped at 3 in the morning about crunchy peanut butter.</br>    <br>where's the p nigga?</br>  <br>how often do you get to make that joke?</br>  <br>No, the plate with all that red shit on it?</br>  this is my new pippin settup  <br>I actually just got that banner about a week ago.</br>  <br>underrated post</br>  <br>not you again, assmaster</br>  I'm so jelous.  <br>first time. been saving it all summer</br>  <br><br>i'm so close to the edge that spilling coke on my expensive shit might be what i need to off myself.</br></br>  <br>from where?</br>  <br>Fuckin mobile never sets the orientation right.</br>  <br>12/adult</br>  <br>I wonder if this was a guy hiding his computer from his wife.</br>  <br>Kinda tempted to try that. might be comfortable for the snes.</br>  recommendations?  <br>Yeah, just don't eat it after having teeth pulled.

I haven't done DMT yet but I plan on doing it before too long. Personal decision.</br></br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=fAj<wbr>-X6qhjf4</wbr>  [ ]  <br>Molly is fun. Make sure it's good shit, and don't get too wild on it or you'll find yourself on the floor with your heart exploding out of your chest unable to breath if you took enough. I would recommend setting up an environment kind of like a trip (good music is paramount), and do it with a couple friends or someone you want to really connect with (fucking will happen if you are into each other, which will happen if your sexualities align.)<br><br>That's just my personal style though. If you're into partying then by all means hit up a rave and lose yourself if that's what you want to do. Still don't get TOO crazy though.</br></br></br>  <br>Psychedelics are the only good drugs, man. Can't get any better. Fuck heroin, meth, morphine, and crack. All hard drugs deserve their legal status. But I don't get why psychedelics are still illegal.</br>  yo lets get some trip reports, im actually really curious about certain drugs<br><br>duncan trussel has a really cool lsd trip report but i want to hear from more people<br><br>ill start with an intense weed experience<br><br>i try a strain called dream maker at a friends house and take the first bong rip iv ever taken and take a few joint hits<br><br>i lay down and decide i need to stay there, i hear the word theodore and its echos<br>i close my eyes for a while and my head feels really fragile, like my brain could shatter like a glass bulb and the insides are hollow. then i can feel a brain literally reflesh within my head. The music my friends play hits me hard, i can literally feel the bass and it pushes me back with force. I really get the jam and even though i prefer brighter sound signatures, i really enjoyed the funky tubey bass(sry audiophile here). i fell asleep and was still high in the morning<br>that whole day i was uber euphoric and felt really fresh</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I've only done weed and LSD. Plan on exploring the psychedelic experience further, though.  <br>in my honest opinion, you'd be better off going to school on a tab of LSD than LSA. for firsts, you get really low feeling, and its tough to not laugh. also, its a lot more mental. and Ive noticed that lights affect me WAY more than LSD (too bright).<br><br>thats a fucked up idea to do anon, but Im not you. do what you must.</br></br></br>  what are some good references fo getting some dregs?  <br>Complete agreement. It's a travesty that so much wealth of knowledge is kept under a guise of legal taboo. Fortunately the growing popularity of psychedelics in recent years may bring about their use in more popular culture</br>  <br>ya not into partying, im too old for that rave shit, probably just get some and kick it with this chick from work</br>  I've told this story in a few threads, but I'll repost it anyway.<br>  be me <br>  be 15 <br>  was talking to some friends about taking acid, an experience which I expressed interest in. <br>  Had never previously done any psychedelics, never smoked weed, so I was at that point drug free. <br>  Everyone thought I was crazy because I wanted to try acid before weed. <br>  Some kid said he had acid <br>  paid 20 bucks, it was on a watermelon sour patch kids candy, double dripped, double dose. <br>  being skeptical, I inspected it thoroughly before doing anything. <br>  It was pure, from what I could tell (not that I actually knew what I was looking at, but I know now that it was pure.) <br>  I invited a friend to stay the night, and he was a good friend who I could trust, but fell asleep really early in the night later on. <br>  dropped half of it, then said "fuck it" and took it all, both hits. <br>  Decided to go to wal mart because I liked those sour patch kids candies.  <br>  Got snacks and what not. <br>  On the way back, the LSD started to kick in, and the sunset started to look amazing, vibrant with color, and bright as fuck. <br>  somanycolors.jpg <br>  Got back, walked into man cave basement, and basically acted like a complete dumbass. <br>  balance was slightly off, but not by much. <br>  I was so hyperactive, and distracted by everything, and its beauty. <br>  It was like ADHD times 10 <br>  So, yeah, I kinda spaced out with psychedelic rock, and had to pee a lot. <br>  when I went to the bathroom, everything was moving, but chill at the same time, saw patterns in blank spaces. <br>  Noticed that I could barely see my irises in the mirror, and my face looked like it had a geometric pattern on the cheeks especially. <br>  Everything seemed so tranquil, and beautiful, and at peace.  <br>  my friend was totally asleep, so I just listened to psychedelic rock, spacing out while looking at the wall. <br>  Decided to put a bunch of blankets over everything for some reason <br>  Never was quite satisfied, my OCD was kicking in, probably a side effect of LSD. <br><br>cont.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yo finally<br>iv been waiting for someone to agree with me on that<br>i dont get the point of being fucked up on crack or heroine for a while. I need to experience something.<br><br>also psychedelics are illegal because western medicine is more about giving something to shutup symptoms and doesnt believe in people experiencing something spiritual to settle their issues, instead they give mentally debilitating prescriptions to shut kids up. Also the big lsd scare in the 60s ended up banning all psychotropic drugs and basically ruined it for everyone... the states and feds refuse to look back on it, and its gonna be a while with weed still on its way.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  Soon as I was done, I layed down in my blanket orderly chaos, and stared at the ceiling. <br>  Listened to Orion, by Metallica on repeat for like 4 hours, spacing out, thinking about life. <br>  I really wish I'd known about Pink Floyd at that point, but alas, no. <br>  Coming down from the trip, shit was still moving, but not as intensely, and the geometric pattern was still there, but faint. <br>  I ended up going to sleep at around 7:00 in the morning, and woke up 2 hours later, refreshed, and energetic, I was so happy. <br>  Haven't taken LSD since then, but I did have a flashback when I got high for the first time, so that was fun. <br><br>To be continued...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Here is the first time being high on cannabis, about 5 months later ish.<br> be me <br> be 16 <br> had previously smoked weed twice before, but hadn't gotten high yet. <br> decide to ditch my 3rd hour to go with my friends, they have a steamroller with a bigass bowl loaded. <br> I took the 2nd hit, felt nothing. <br> when it came around again, I decided to try taking a massive hit <br> took massive hit, ended up coughing for ages. <br>  I started to feel weird, but kept taking hits. <br>  I could not comprehend what happened after that. I had previously taken acid before I ever smoked weed, and it felt like I was having a flashback. <br>  flashback combined with being high as fuck <br>  feelsgoodman.jpg <br>  My friends were talking, but my brain told me it didn't matter what they were saying.  <br>  Began to feel like everyone was messing with me. <br>  decide to try a kickflip, which I could do pretty good at the time. <br>  could barely get on skateboard. <br>  OK, well I'm fucking baked. <br>  hear someone shout "shit, security's coming our way. <br>  We decide to go that direction, because the school is that way.  <br>  tokerface.jpg <br>  "hi guys" says security person <br>  "hello" I say, trying to be cool. <br>  they just pass right by us. <br>  decide to go in through front entrance <br>  everyoneslookingatme.jpg <br>  Go in cafeteria <br>  listen to psychedelic classic rock for hours, with my eyes closed, having amazing closed eye visuals <br>  Fuck to the yes. <br>  Ended up ditching the next 3 classes, because I was too fucked up. <br> walked into 7th hour, still a little high. <br>  no one suspected a thing. <br>  I look back on this, "god damn, I was such a dumbass." <br>  My mom asked why I ditched those classes <br>  made up some excuse about being stressed <br>  she buys it <br>  lets me sleep in the next day, cause I had 1st off <br>  Never suspected a thing. <br>  As it turns out, I still had some weed the people gave me, to be honest, I forgot they gave it to me, I was so baked.  <br>  smoked every day for the next week. <br>  shit was so fucking great. <br>  never ditched class again </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  weed,<br>coke<br>meth<br>dexamphetamine<br>ritalin<br>concerta<br>mushrooms<br>lsd<br>lsa<br>dmt<br>25i-nbome<br>25c-nbome<br>ketamine<br>3-meo-pcp<br>2c-b<br>valium<br>codeine<br>lexapro<br>mdma<br>bk-mdma(methylone)<br>mdea<br>cigarettes<br>vaped caffeine<br>alcohol ofc<br>salvia divinorum<br>khat<br>ephedra<br>oxiracetam<br><br><br>i've probably forgotten about a lot but I think that just about sums it up for 'significant' ones</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>o ye also modafinil<br><br>stimulants &gt; stimulants, you'll realize this when you all stop being 16 yo hippy faggots</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah. I'm planning on trying ayahuasca, because I lack motivation. I don't know what I'll find on the trip, and I'm pretty sure it won't magically give me motivation, I just want to know why I keep working, without an end.</br>  <br>stimulants &gt; psychedelics*</br>  <br>Don't go to school on psychedelics. It completely fucks up the experience of what psychedelics should be and bastardizes its meaning.<br><br>LSA is way more of a body high than LSD. I've eaten 20 Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds while walking back from a tour of the world HQ of a fortune 100 company (it's next to my school) and it was pretty cool only because I hardly tripped from it. On a full LSA trip (which I only experienced after this situation) it would have been absolutely horrible.<br><br>LSD would be better for school, but still don't do it. You would most surely be obviously on drugs unless you're truly a master of your own mind and keeping your cool and you would be investigated by your school officer most likely. There were a group of kids in my high school that would regularly drop acid during the school day and every single one of them was eventually found and expelled. I knew a couple of them.<br><br>That being said, if you're going to do it anyway, don't let yourself think about these comments and develop a paranoia while you're sitting in class... that would only exacerbate things. I still heavily recommend against doing it though. It's not as fun as it seems.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> do acid <br> finally understand american ded <br> see german fish in fishbowl <br> feel wet <br> see roger the alien <br> oh dear god I will never fit in with society <br> see francine <br> sweet jesus im just like my mother, im such a nagging bitch <br> who am i <br> oh dear god <br> see Stan <br> ohyea.jpg <br> euphoria </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>codeine stories plz</br>  <br>still same op<br><br>did mushrooms on an airplane, lsd at church, mdma spending time with family etc, high at school a lot<br><br>good times were had, only thing I really regret is meth</br></br></br></br></br>  obviously not mine but this is one of my fav trip reports<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Ant<wbr>iAAltTFQ</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>kek</br>  <br>content with shit, relaxed, but itchy as fuck<br><br>that's about all there was too it, not really my cup of tea, pretty much put me off the idea of opiates in general</br></br></br>  I was an waltir whate to pay my way through gradschool.<br><br>Pic related: NMR of mescaline sulfate dihydrate</br></br>  <br>What about MD?</br>  <br>That's the way to do it, man. Unforgettable feelings of joy pulsing through your whole being.<br><br>DO remember though, molly is pretty hard on the brain if you do it too often, so don't make it a regular thing. Generally it is recommended against doing it more than once a month because it floods your brain with so much dopamine and serotonin (don't remember if it's one or both) that it will actually desensitize you to those feelings if you get too frequent with it.</br></br></br>  what was the diet supplement in one of the previous drug threads where the guy said goes well with weed and makes u really relaxed?  <br>same op again<br><br>just realized I forgot mescaline from the triplist, but that was a pretty meh trip, san pedro cactus juice, would try again if I ever have the opportunity but in a better environment not surrounded by hard drug addicts</br></br></br>  I haven't done any form of meth. Other than that, basically everything. I don't remember tbh. Drugs rotted my fuckin' brain.  Just downed 600mg of DXM<br>Wish me luck</br>  <br>this is what happens when u stray from the really safe psychedelics</br>  <br><br>md was nothing but lovely every time i've had it, just pure bliss and love-felt feelings towards everything, had my first proper conversation with family members in my teen years while on MDMA, still like the occasional roll but I prefer to do it solo as I don't have a trip-mate anymore</br></br>  <br>LSD is the truth</br>  <br>sorry for just general questions, same guy everytime, i've only ever smoked weed and this stuff is interesting. what was coke actually like?</br>  <br>no, that's what happens when you abusing any psyche altering drugs as a form of seeking happiness in your life. Psychedelics can just as easily throw someone off the deep end as hard drugs, seen it happen to mates, been through it, but responsible use of psychedelics is probably by far the safest in terms of physical health</br>  <br>pls post updates on here<br>would be appreciated<br>i took dxm recently and went to the hospital and actually almost died<br>i fell asleep before i got to enjoy it with music and when i woke up it was a literal nightmare and i was a mindless robot that followed all orders.... if u enjoy it i might reconsider<br>keep us posted</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Extracted mescaline sucks because 98% of people can't perform the extraction properly. Honestly to really do it well you'd need a soxhlet extraction and vacuum distillation rig.<br><br>Mescaline is an incredible psychdelic, probably the best by far. It's a shame so few get the chance to try synthesized mescaline because it is absolutely the tits.</br></br></br></br>  i shot the maijuanas in my arms and ate my neighbors turtle  <br>powdered confidence, extremely clean and normal feeling, just a sudden spike into 'damn, I feel great, I could take on the world right now' only had small amounts to myself but could easily see myself abusing the shit if I had a regular supply</br>  <br>yeah that's probably the case, I did have a trip from it but it wasn't like other psychedelics, more like a trippy drunk with endless shit talking and laughter, but it was pretty meh and a terrible environment for the experience</br>  Tried salvia. Shit made me autistic for five whole minutes  <br>Friend had a cactus and chopped it up fine crushed it in grinders and put in water. He tripped sac, he had about 3/4 and I had about 1/4 was literally the most comfy I've ever been.</br>  <br>Ya I don't make anything a regular thing, hell I only smoke weed like once a month, but I'm down to try something new</br>  <br>lol it looks like a lot but this is shit. i mean really could you get anymore shitty RC's on there? and if youre somewhere where youre getting both "LSD" and 25i then you better believe you didnt actually get acid. newfag</br>  LSD<br>DMT<br>MDMA<br>Shrooms<br>Weed<br>Xanax<br>Various Opiates<br>DXM<br>Salvia<br>and some less popular OTC stuff that was meh</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>did you make sure dxm was the only active ingredient?<br>Unless you took like over a gram that shouldnt have happened. Unless you just have a bad trip. I thought i was gonna die the first time I did a 600mg dose</br></br>  <br>and ketamine</br>  <br>yea it was delsym</br>  <br>Weed<br>Ketamine<br>Acid<br>Adderall<br>Xanax</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I have the same feelings, the lack of motivation, working with no end etc. While my problems are completely different than yours surely, I recently had an LSD trip that gave me some vision that may be worth sharing with you.<br><br><br>Basically the outlook I had on life was shit and simply incorrect. Nobody wants to believe that and go "yeah I'm a fucking waste" but that's what you have to do sometimes to break the cycle. I just sailed along life with so much drive to amount to something in the FUTURE, but never found myself wanting to actually work for things NOW to substantiate my future. I was caught in this cycle of dreaming up my great expectations of how I'm going to be so successful and I will amount to something great... but the whole time that's exactly what I was doing. Dreaming. "Some day I will be this" "someday I will be that" the shitty reality of the situation is you'll only be "this" or "that" if you actually put in effort to reach those goals. "But they're so far away... soon I'll do stuff to get there but I don't need to do anything right now." that's still wrong, though. You're still dreaming. You're just not dreaming as far into the future as you were. You could call it a start. Now obviously this is all easier said than done. Depression is a feisty bitch. You're always exhausted and you always lack motivation to do anything. That's just how it is. But the easiest way to get out of it is to start small. You don't have to start drafting the idea that will be your crowning achievement to your career when you're about to retire now. It could be as simple as finding a good book to read. Or going to the park and lacking motivation somewhere where more is going on around you. Baby steps. That's all it takes. The game of life is a long one, and you can think in the future or the past all you want, but those two are irrelevant because we're in NOW and well... now is now.</br></br></br></br>  <br>vapored caffeine? Do anything for ya?</br>  <br>Tried salvia, hit it HARD with friends, completely blacked out into another dimensional space, had conversations with extra dimensional beings, saw metaphysical train tracks leading to god knows where, snap back to reality, drool all over my face, friends laughing.<br><br>Was also really drunk at the time may have enhanced the effects.

Looking for someone that is interested in psych's as much as I am.  <br>i just did adderall for the first time today, i felt a little different but nothing to great, did good in csgo tho</br>  Weed<br>MDMA<br>DMT<br>Shrooms<br>Cocaine<br>Meth<br>AL-LAD and Probably numerous research chemicals sold to me as "acid"</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>went out of my way to get them and try them for the sake of trying them, drugs can be a novelty of a hobby and it's interesting to give the rc's a go but for the most part I wouldn't recommend any of them to anyone, especially the nbomes. 2c-b was nice, LSD in general is fantastic but sometimes you just don't want to trip for 12 hours straight so you look for other options, pretty much why I tried nbomes, and came to the conclusion nbomes kinda just suck</br>  Well here I go with the reason Its 9am and I am at home instead of Work.<br>Friday night about 1am, drunk as fuck, commin to a friend who is living in the near, commin in, chillin, drink some more vodka, he says he has emma (mdma molly) and wants to share, never had it, but fck it lets try out, ye was fun but cuz of the alc. I can remember much. Now here the main part, since then I was feeling completely tired the whole time, I have no power to do anythibg, I havent eaten for 3 days and my head burns. Dunno if it was the emma or the alc (the others said the emma was nice) but, this shit isnt for me, did psychadelica before, liked it much more</br>  'sup, /b/rothers? Stoner Bear is in the thread for another trippy night.<br><br>First time I did LSD, I distinctly remember saying, "Words won't stay where I put them."</br></br>  <br>felt a bit like when I first tried speed, but extremely jittery by comparison, wouldn't recommend tbh</br>  <br>maybe youre allergic or just had a bad trip</br>  i did jenkem for like 2 years when i was living under a bridge in reno nevada<br><br>shitty steve, they called me</br></br>  <br>try 1p-lsd</br>  anyone ever done acid/shrooms and watched joy of painting with bob ross?

I like it.</br>  <br>Not a fan really. I like my adderall and Molly but meth didn't feel right. It was really euphoric, like a really euphoric adderall but it just felt dirty.</br>  <br>it's also fun to watch king of the hill youtube poops also, bah can't buy shit in korea, but it's only gonna be another month</br>  <br>OTC/prespcription/illegal??</br>  <br>thought Id get that ASMR like I usually do, but just ended up thinking too much. I have a hard time just watching shows on Acid</br>  <br>I tripped acid a long time ago, gained motivation, then started smoking weed, then lost it again. Maybe it's the weed, or some outside force. Maybe I just need to move on from my childish desires. But then I'd be doing nothing for myself. I'd be living a life for others. Then again, isn't that what everyone does? People work for their own benefit, but they don't realize that in a sense, everything they do has a butterfly effect on someone else anywhere in the world. Every thing you do in your life affect some outside force, which may or may not cross paths with you once again. This is why I lack motivation. I once again fail to see the big picture. I see everything in my own world, and not in the world that other people see. I've been selfish all my life. Damn. Why do I feel depressed now? I have motivation all of the sudden, and I guess I just needed time to sort out my thoughts. I feel kinda weird. I didn't take anything, so I should be fine. But I feel like I'm just senses, floating without gravity, or any outside forces. And my thoughts are multiplying. Do you ever get this, while being sober?</br>  any legal highs out there like teas or finding random herbs or something<br><br>tried online stuff and it wasn't a good experience at all, compared to weed</br></br>  <br>Weed. Back in 2014.<br>Had to do a drug test yesterday tho, nervous as fuck for no real reason</br></br>  <br>Nigger you just gave me something to look forward to doing when I trip next.<br><br>Thank you for helping my trippy experiences become a whole lot funner. &lt;3</br></br></br>  <br>How is Salvia? I was at a headshop and asked the guy there about it, he asked if I had ever tried it and, after telling him no, he suggested synthetic cannabis which is a no-no for me.</br>  <br>Ketamine and it's cheap</br>  <br>salvia is awesome if you can handle drugs</br>  <br>nothing would blow your mind like youtube poops:<br>(warning: be under the influence of something when you watch this)<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=jiN<wbr>sXCIcWHg</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  I was with my girlfriend of a year that the time and her best friend. My girlfriends sister has been selling lsd and decided to sell us some for cheap so the three of us (me my girlfriend and her best friend) got feeling good and long story short I had a threesome while on lsd at 16 years old my girl was tight her friend was was skinny af but blown af  <br>it's the weed, stop smoking weed regularly and you'll find you have a lot more motivation as well as seeing opportunities you failed to see while high.<br><br>Weed's motivating in one way when you become a stoner, but it motivates you to smoke more weed, and neglect other stuff. <br><br>YMMV, but typically speaking, if you're already lacking motivation, weed's not gonna make it any better</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Salvia is like a acid trip in 15mins, to put it simply.</br>  Occam's Razor conclusively shows that there is a creator. So why do you still cling to the ridiculously improbable THEORY of evolution?  R.I.P. Satoru Iwata, CEO of Nintendo.  Things that make you uncomfortable thread. Go!<br><br>Pic very related.</br></br>  <br>Anon....</br>  <br>I need to know what this is, like, right now</br>  <span>youtube.com/watch?v=wyBoIY2Y9Hg  [ ]  what happened, /B/ros?  The place became irrelevant, people moved out to better sites (reddit), the internet became mainstream, and most of all the autistic neckbeards on /pol/ filled the void after everyone left. They were unable to understand the ironic shtiposting that built 4chan and take this place seriously.  <br><br>I agree, Reddit is where it's at now. 4chan died in 2006 when they introduced the "dubs" numbers.</br></br>  Think about how long it's been since 2006. The people who came here then, are growing the fuck up. Getting married, having careers, having kids. Most of the "legion types" figured out this shit sucks and moved on years ago. What you're left with, if you're even from around that time, are the real social rejects and 12 year old's.</blockquote>]
