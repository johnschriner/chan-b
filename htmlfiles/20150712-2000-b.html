Rap fucking sucks man.<br><br>Grow up.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=xLc<wbr>5dVypsgc</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Here's a depressing song that doesn't suck.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Hip-hop and rap are nothing more than aggressive lyrics set to simplistic beats and melodies. They take very-little skill or hard work to create and are subsequently enjoyed by those with no appreciation of skill or hard work.<br><br>Also, hip-hop and rap tend to be something of a catalyst for violent acts committed by these unintelligent, uninspired, unskilled and lazy people (mostly men). Ironically, were one to resort to violence in an attempt to remove said-problem (I can think of a few who'd be first to go), this would negate the argument, entirely. So, the rest of us just put up with hip-hop, rap and their followers.<br><br>Pic related. It's a REAL musician.<br><br>There are so many wondrous things we've learned we can do with our voices, in unison, with other hard-working people who've been practicing until their fingers bleed, and there are STILL those who listen to people talking over a generic melody and beat?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>OP here. Mainstream rap's bullshit. I agree on that, but there are some rappers out there who make good music. You can't just say that the whole genre sucks.</br>  <br>The entire genre sucks. See </br>  <br>Rap's about the message. (If it has one, that is.)</br>  <br>J. Cole stuff is good if you like Kendrick Lamar. Try a Tale of two Citiez. It's pretty good. Also, there's Maad city, ignorance is bliss, and other stuff by Kendrick.</br>  how the fuck is money trees a slow depressing song?<br><br>the art of peer pressure is exactly what you're looking for btw<br><br>and the blacker the berry has an incredible story/message</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, the entire genera sucks. And the shit that isn't "mainstream" is literally only liked by white kids like you. <br><br>Trust me, I was there. I used to religiously listen to Immortal Technique when I was younger.</br></br></br>  <br>OK. What about Aesop Rock then? He's a rapper, but he's nothing like what you said. If you truly believe what you said, then why appreciate poets? They do the same thing as rappers without the music.</br>  <br>oh and i forgot sing about me im dying of thirst</br>  Atmosphere - Yesterday.<br><br>Reply back if you listen to it, let me know what you think</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>So ya'll saying that it's impossible to have a single rapper who has an actual message and artistic skills. Okay. <br><br>There isn't a single metal singer who isn't violent in real life.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The fuck?

I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through." I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because your post gave me cancer anyway.</br>  big boobed teens!

Think about where you want to be 5 years from today. Really think about this. Write down your goals. Now, what are you doing today to get what you want?</br>  no.<br><br>i have a few questions though<br><br> are you actually a psychiatrist <br> how old are you <br> greentext your career up until this point, including education <br> are you happy with your job <br> are you le master trole 2015 </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>seconded.<br><br>medical student here. looking to go into psych.<br><br>whats the career progression like?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Since I was a child I've been rageful, but always a seething internal rage with no outlet. My mother would go "on the war path", yelling at us arbitrarily, and I remember at the age of 6 giving her the middle finger under my pillow as I lay in bed at night, wondering if I could keep the finger extended though the night while I slept. Nowadays, I'm rageful toward the ineffective management at work; I harbor deep resent and lie in bed thinking of ways I could successfully burn the office building down. I want to kill the managers, but it's not enough. I want them to know that they are dead after I've killed them. I've never intentionally harmed anyone, and I've never even been in a fight. I try to cope with my angst by portraying a sense of calm, but I feel the facade is transparent. Exercise helps, but the rage is always there.</br>  <br>Nothing that bad. My problem is I can only handle being around people for so long. After a while, I click into a point where all the noise of people's voices (or sometimes even just one person's voice I've been listening to for a while) feels like it's getting louder and louder to the point where it makes me angry and feels like it's emotionally hurting me. Then i have to remove myself from the room, sit in quiet and desensitize. I can hear all the sounds like the tons of the voices, music that was playing, etc. all in my brain even though I'm in a silent room. Within maybe 30 minutes to an hour, I'm back to normal and I can handle it again.<br><br>Is there any reasoning behind this?</br></br></br>  I have really bad anxiety and everything terrifies me I can't do basic shit like make phone calls or interact with people properly. In the few friendships I've made I refuse to be truly myself around them and I'm never fully comfortable. I don't sleep and want to die all the time. I have migraines and panic attacks all the time. Help  holy shit. so much social anxiety and self hatred here.  How do you pick up the pieces after a LTR breakup? I'm a 27 year old dude, I was with my ex for 6 years. She left me because she had "commitment issues" and because I wasn't the person she fell in love with anymore.<br><br>I just need to move on from this, but it still consumes me, even though it's been 4 months. It almost feels like the breakup happened yesterday. I thought a lot about suicide initially, since I have a history of depression/anxiety. Ironically, she thought I was depressed for a long time, but I wasn't. I have dealt with depression on/off since I was a teenager, practiced self-harm as well. It is something I have almost always had to deal with, but I am aware enough about it now to know when I am not ok. Ironically, I am depressed as fuck now. I want to get on from her, but there's still a lot of me that would do absolutely anything to win her back. I don't know if she would ever want to get back, but I desperately want that too.<br><br>Sometimes I don't feel like I will get over her until I date someone else, and (possibly) fall in love. It excites me, but at the same time frightens me. I really just want my ex back. I don't want to move on, I can't move on. I wanted to believe that true love exists, and I bought into the romance of that idea. I feel my gut clench tightly just at the thought of my love for her going for naught. It haunts me to think about all the possible ways I could have done something, could have saved our relationship. If I had told her I loved her more often, or if I had made her feel more appreciated, then maybe this nightmare never would have happened.<br><br>I don't know how to move on. I am caught in this place, where my plans for the future have drastically changed recently. I feel immense pressure to do something with myself for the future; go to graduate school or move somewhere else or just do fucking something. How can I even think about that when I'm still hurting so much inside? All I wanted was to get married, ever since I was a kid</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I'm always falling in love for fictional characters. What have Doctor? How do I treat or over?  <br>tumblritis<br><br>but seriously, that's normal. Everyone has done that. It's cuz you get to know the character and all the details about them through the book or movie or whatever. Just like in real life, you learn the details about a person, and fall in love based on those details you learned.</br></br></br>  <br> girlfriend leaves me <br> oh no <br> fantasize about raping her and her mother every night and fap to it </br></br></br>  <br>BiPolar II and an inferiority complex fueled by my physical disability<br><br>Fuck your gay shit doc<br><br>also thank god for valproic acid and quetiapine</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>/b/ is a place where broken souls go when they are ready to die.</br>  <br>slippery slope m8</br>  <br>normal.

I don't mean stop sleeping and eating. I mean stop thinking of yourself as such a big deal. Just do whatever you want despite your disability. Stop caring what everyone thinks, because you can't read minds. You're just putting your "inferior" thoughts into other people's brains when they aren't even thinking that at all. Don't live your life to please people. Anyone than that. Your answer could be yourself, God, whatever, but just don't aim to please everyone in the world because there's no point in it.</br></br>  <br>do you really want to listen to little people problems bruh?</br>  <br>I was diagnosed with APD but wasn't given any resources to help manage my tendencies. What the fuck do I do?</br>  <br>Need to stop beating the dead horse and move on<br>Everyone EVERYONE has had their heart carved out of their chest by someone but you need to focus on bettering yourself. Sounds like self confidence is an issue here so try exercising. Wake up half hour early and do it in the morning when you aren't tired from work. You'll see the difference it makes in your day and subsequently the difference it makes in how you feel about yourself...which will alter how others feel about you.

It's the answer you don't want to hear but it's just the blatant truth.<br><br>No, I'm sorry. The answer you ACTUALLY need is you have severe fictionalromancticitis and it has to do with your brain being attached to other human beings. It's a rare thing, that means you can feel special. You can now finally use a word to describe yourself and give yourself a free excuse card. Also here are some drugs you can buy from me to get high and stop caring about shit. I'll take that $500 check, hope you feel better soon with your serious problem anon</br></br></br>  <br>i'll stick with my grocery money and medically necessary trust fund<br><br>good luck</br></br></br>  <br>life nigger</br>  <br>You slap it in your own face everyday. No one else does. There may be a few assholes who do, sure. But most of it is you telling yourself "This person totally thinks this about me" etc.</br>  <br>the meds, takes 3-6 months but side effects fade</br>  <br>For real?<br><br>To clarify, it's not what they're saying that bugs me, it's just the noise</br></br></br>  <br>Well you are kinda right here. . . but there are some disabilities that even you and I cannot fathom that cause little problems (which can build up). For instance, my left-handed friend pointed out to me that there is a significantly low amount of left-handed desks verse right handed desks. I had never even noticed something like that because I am right handed and I was never inconvenienced. . . that's a very different example, but the logic behind it is the same. Naw what I'm sayin?</br>  <br> most of it is you telling yourself "This person totally thinks this about me" etc <br><br>lighten up doc, wouldn't want to upset the handlers<br><br>also why does this room smell like piss?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>worry about it when you're 35. distract yourself with good shit.

Calling my name, laughing, screaming.<br><br>Lately I have trouble sleeping. Falling asleep late, waking up mid-sleep and having hard time falling asleep againg, sleeping for about 3 hours at night.</br></br></br>  <br>If you're worried about it, then probably not.</br>  <br>Think I was abducted several times by aliens between the ages of 7-14. Had sleeping problems for years. still suffer from paranoia and social anxiety. Thoughts?</br>  <br>Damn it fresh princess</br>  <br>you know a little poke here, nudge there, play to balance it out. got him using those enormous goofy ears. he's getting better than me<br><br>but his inbred life will be short and i will forever judge my sister for buying him in a store.</br></br></br>  <br>for you</br>  <br>Realse that a lot of people are like you. You're not alone. There are good people in the world but keep you expectations low. It should help you get through most things.</br>  <br><br><br>Other night I had a dream that I was going around in a wide open shopping center place that was under construction and there were pretty large completely isolated places.<br><br> would wait out until I saw someone walk by <br> See cute girl walking <br> dont really remember the rest but it skipped forward with me pressing sharpened long thin spikes into her skin and holding her down as she squirmed.  <br> Pushed 5-6 in her ass, trying to gape her more and more <br> eventually pushed a spike through the corner of her eye deep enough she stopped squirming. <br> did this to multiple people <br> one lady was a real cunt. I pressed a spike under each arm pit (it felt so good when they broke the skin) <br> pressed a spike on each side of collar bone going straight down. <br> finished with spike in solar plexus, finally killing her. <br> I had been using a certain scent of lotion to help the spikes move in and out <br><br> later on in the dream, a cop finds me and asks if i can help him carry some stuff.  <br> Smile and say sure.  <br> It was his ruse to get me to leave my scent, but i knew the whole time <br> Finally stop and give him the things back <br> Can slightly smell the lotion on the handles of the cases he was having me carry <br> Dont care and just smile at him as I walk away, feeling excited knowing that's not enough information to put me away yet still enough so that he knows i did it. <br><br>Odd thing is is that normally i have a very strong sense of empathy and (in good moods) like people pretty much just because I can see what they're going through and almost see how fragile(?) they are. They're like little kids to me. But anyway the strange thing is that in dreams like that I do things that would normally make me sick but they feel so so good. Is this like inflated ego or arrogance as a sign of psychopathy or what?<br><br>I had some odd sexual experiences as a young child.<br>Large amount of childhood trauma once i got older (family over dosing, foster homes)<br> Too paranoid to talk to therapists. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's generally the case, but whatever suits you better</br>  <br>So, is gender identity disorder a real thing</br>  Bipolar depression<br> went on a crazy manic episode <br> got back together with my ex-gf <br> pick her up in my car <br> car sex without protection <br> cum in her <br> tell her I'm going to be back <br> walk a mile outside of my car naked <br> piss on a tree and that's the last thing I remember <br> woke up in my car with a gash on my temple and my ex yelling at me </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>2spooky4me m8</br>  <br>The dream seem weird, but as long as you're conscious about this you should be fine. I think /b/ is affecting you too much</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>sounds like your autistic. Better kill yourself</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'M A MONSTER<br><br><br>"This place is a veritable prison, and I am its prisoner"</br></br></br></br>  <br>So prolong for entertainment.<br><br>Don't get caught my dude.</br></br></br>  <br> thread </br>  <br>  heroin addict (ex bf introduced me to h) <br>  used to be anorexic, then when I got deeper into my addiction I basically stopped thinking about it but when I do get clean I focus on it again <br>  haven't had 30 days clean since 2009 <br>  liar, thief, everything except sell my body <br>  had a good childhood.

Which makes it hard to relate to the world.<br><br>I have no family and the friends I do have are distant to say the least. <br><br>It is not in my nature to just simply give up and die, but someone can only struggle against the currents of reality before their muscles go out and they go under.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What's your address anon?<br><br>It be so much more entertaining to kill you.</br></br></br>  <br>Isn't it obvious?<br> fucking the animals </br></br>  <br>I wish to rape murder commit necrophilia and then eat women in that order i often fantasize about taking over the world my mom works all the time to support us as my dad is in prison or doing drugs it does not bother me now but when i was like 6-13 i did my big sister basically watched altough she is only 2 years older so i basicly rasied myself the only woman besides my family i do not think about in violent was a random chick for germany i did not know also im to beta to talk to women what is wrong with me also checkem</br>  <br>If i have my fursuit on it's ok</br>  thinking about going into psychiatry, first year at uni next year, is it hard?

Can we get a feels thread going?<br>I don't care if it's teenage drama and girl bullshit, just get one started for me.</br>  <br>Old laptop, Public wifi and I have power where I am parked.</br>  I've a story to tell since I really want to talk about it after what happened recently. Anyone interested?  <br>I've been in physical and emotional pain, more than I know how to explain, for most of my life. I've nearly died four times... the last time was on my own terms when I swallowed 30 percocet. Somehow I've survived everything and here I am, talking to you fine folks.<br><br>I truly believe I have a purpose aside from being worm food and a cautionary tale. If that's true for me, it's true for you as well.</br></br></br>  Dubs decides how to escape I'll draw each step <br>(Don't just say roll say how you would do it)</br>  <br><br>This but instead of sink water use the damn toilet water.</br></br>   Sit on toilet <br> wait </br>  <br><br>last re-roll</br></br>  Claim your waifu before anyone else gets her<br> Mari Maya claimed </br>  Claimed  Mayuri is the one true waifu that you will go endlessly through time to save and get to.  <br><br>This</br></br>  R8 my b8 m8<br> also general bait thread </br>  Do you honestly believe in the "Big Bang"?

I feel helpless and I don't know what to do.<br>I feel like I want help, but I don't want it because I'm suddenly filled with anger.<br>I tried therapy, instead I just get prescribed amitriptyline, to which I do take, but it ended up making me more miserable; no way am I going back to therapy and paying 800-1000 dollars. Even then, I did not feel like I was helped.<br>I just don't know what to do anymore, and I'm losing my mind. I believed I was at peace when I was unconscious, I don't feel any different physically, but emotionally and mentally I feel like I'm getting worse. I'm really just tempted to take the entirety of what's left in the bottle. I'm really scared, but I feel like there's no way out.<br>Again, I just want someone to talk to, so it doesn't feel like I'm dying alone. <br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/627409408#p627409408">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Do something for someone in a worse situation than yours.
