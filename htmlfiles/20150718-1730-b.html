Like killing rabbits in an mmo starting area.

Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked. Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them. But when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years passed and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar, an airbender named Aang. And although his airbending skills are great, he still has a lot to learn before he's ready to save everyone. But I believe Aang can save the world.  <br>Agnostic deists are like the bisexuals of religious debate.

It's insanity.</br></br></br>  <br>Isn't religion the essence of delusion anyway</br>  <br>why do shitposters automatically assume atheist automatically assume anything?</br>  <br>I have evidence to support my belief. My belief in the existence of God is based upon the size and complexity of the universe. I don't know for certain that god exists, which is why I also call myself agnostic, but I do believe that anyone who looks at the complexity and size of the universe and denies the potential for a supreme intelligence being the cause of the big bang is being willfully obtuse.</br>  <br>Complexity isnt proof or evidence.<br>You need a fucking dictionary</br></br>  <br>you need to learn how to fucking read.</br>  Agnosticism is only logical  <br>Agnostic what?</br>  <br>Because if we argue with Muslims they'll kill us.</br>  <br>We'll kill you anyways.</br>  <br>CPU's are pretty complex, anyone who denies the possibility that Intel has hired god is being wilfully obtuse</br>  <br>Do you believe any sum of deeds deserves infinite punishment?</br>  <br>u seem upset. arguing with a Christian is fucking easy as hell, but when a deist enters the thread you get flustered.</br>  Because Christians are dumb enough to post the SAME FUCKING THREAD EVERY FUCKING HOUR.  <br>I believe that is God decision. It's not for me to judge.</br>  <br>Then you have no position to defend and you have no place here</br>  <br>That isn't a Christian. It's a troll, and you're a fucking moron.</br>  <br>I disagree.</br>  <br>Do you believe your god is stroking off imagining ways to cause people pain in the afterlife? Or rather, does god enjoy inflicting suffering on those he decides shall be damned?</br>  <br>Yeah, I'm mad as hell.<br>I'm indifferent, your logic just sucks</br></br>  <br>Reason is because people are afraid of what they don't know. Nobody can truly say they know there is or isn't a God. People are truthfully just trying to answer a question that humans have been trying to answer forever. They all can't face the fact that they won't know until they inevitably meet there end.</br>  <br>Most popular language among native Anglophones?</br>  <br>Did paul walker even say so? Did he fulfill the prophesy given to worshippers of a canaanite fire god?</br>  <br>Paul walker existed</br>  <br>I believe that God doesn't put anyone in hell. He simply prevents assholes from entering his house.<br><br>You'd do the same thing.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm not the deist you are arguing with. lol.</br>    /b/ isn't the best place the argue about religion, is it?  <br>welcome to 4chan, newguy.</br>  <br>then where is the "lake of fire," "where there will be grinding and gnashing of teeth," and that "it is better for [them] to not have been born"?</br>  You don't know, you can't know, you will never know. Believing is pointless. We as elements of the universe can never know its true properties, because you need to be outside the box to know what the box is. We know only what we perceive. Best not to think  <br>What is defined as asshole? Throughout any holy book from a western religion god does and says things that are pretty fucked up. Punishing a group because they didn't murder everyone living in a region, for instance in the bible. If god is hanging out with like minded people, I don't know that I'd want to be at that house party, anyway.</br>    <br>less than 10% of Christians take the bible literally. I don't believe in a lake of fire. I believe hell is simply being outside of God's love and being stuck spending eternity with all of the souls who couldn't get into God's house.</br>    <br>I can sit inside a cardboard box and recognize it as cardboard.</br>    <br> he's a christian.  <br> he must take the bible literally. </br></br>  <br> why does anyone assume anything on /b/. <br>Stupid retard. It's the internet</br></br>    <br>A lot of Christians take it literally, and that's the source of a lot of the shit Christianity gets. All 3 abrahamic religions are built off of a book of poetry, not to be taken verbatim or literally.</br>        <br>They're scared</br>  <br>The real box could be stretching way beyond</br>  <br>that is literally the hottest face I've ever seen. I stared at it and couldnt look away<br><br><br>have fun as an angel version of yourself on top of white clouds for all eternity, you psychopath.</br></br></br></br>  <br>belief is simply the extension of instinct. It's your brain processing the magnitude of information it receives beyond the ability of the conscious mind being able to comprehend and consolidating that information into a smaller quantity the conscious mind can process.</br>    <br>Nigga go to bed.</br>  <br>HNNNG</br>  <br> that is literally the hottest face I've ever seen.
