I'm pissed   Your room sucks   WHAT  A MEME      Did you just say she "bounced"? Please an hero   Real OP here, yea she just left. She said her mom was in an accident and she had to rush to the ER. She said she would come back later     Yeah I pulled her thong to the side I was ready to fuck wtf   Lay on the bed with your cock out and call for room service.   I asked her if I could take pics she said no tho. She'll come back latter I'll sneak some    If you are dumb enough to believe the Civil War was fought over slavery ask yourself this. Did the South say: A: "hey we're gonna go have slaves" and the North said "hell no you won't" or: B: "fuck you we'll be our own country." and the North said "hell no you won't."  If you guessed B, you are correct. If you guessed A, you are historically ignorant and probably a bigot who is projecting their feelings onto a flag that has no intrinsic value.             it's pretty much A and then B     Inbred fucks       Ask most kids what WWII was about and they will say the holocaust....  Same misinformation...      <br/>   If it's so racist why did no one catch on to its evil nature while the dukes of hazzard was on tv?     Implying the North didn't have slaves.    This flag is more than just a flag to me... It represent my proud heritage and where i came from. It represents that i have respect towards my ancestors who fought on the confederate side during the civil war, as well as southern culture.   It represents the last time a large group of Americans stood up to the overwhelming power of the federal government. You can criticise the south all you want, but I love our bad emission trucks, i love our tight knit christian communities and small towns where everybody knows each other.   I fly a rebel flag in the back of my 9mpg chevy and the day some northern yankee thinks he's gonna take it out will be the day when the south shall rise again        how does this make you yanks feel ?   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=eh5<wbr>gMXofND4</wbr>  [ ]       It left to be it's own country (or tried to) because the United States was adding abolishment to the constitution.  "Those who believe slavery was not a central point of conflict in the Civil War may wish to peruse the South Carolina, Georgia, Mississippi and Texas declarations of secession. Those documents all explicitly cite threats to slavery as reasons for secession. Mississippi's declaration goes so far as to say that 'a blow at slavery is a blow at commerce and civilization."  http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/7639<wbr>788</wbr>        this guy gets it     You are absolutely full of shit if you're suggesting that anyone flies it today to celebrate the dukes of hazzard.    i bet half of you niggers didnt care about that fucking flag until people started bitching about it   Don't use the word bigot, you are stooping down to the liberal's level   Not only did the North have slaves, but they planned to do nothing about slavery. Lincoln only emancipated the slaves as a rhetorical gesture after reprimanding one of his generals for doing the EXACT SAME THING    What was the reason they wanted to be their own country? A tax on Sweet Tea?  Fuck you it was slaves.      Hmm... No one...    this flag is the flag of an enemy of the UNITED states of america. and as such, no enemy flag should ever be planted on US soil.  waving it presents no issue. neither does hanging it on the wall of your trailer.  you should be able to buy and sell it.  but if you plant an enemy flag, it's the duty of all citizens of the USA to remove the fucking thing.         thanks baby cakes    the day when the south shall rise again   If you were any more retarded you'd be southern... oh wait...      that isn't flying the flag you fucking redneck dimwitted moron    i find homoflags highly offensive..  they need to pulled discontinued and burned across every inch of this country.  homoflags are far more offensive than a confederate flag!@!!!        thanks baby cakes    you are a dumb shit and clearly not from the south.  Northern faggots like you know nothing of Cooter and Lynard Skynard.  Go listen to Jay-Z rap about selling crack and call yourself progressive you stupid WOP         except for brandon, you fucking dick.  how do you know who i am? is that you, Obama?     it doesn't represent racism, it represents an enemy of the UNITED states of america and should not be allowed to fly.   painted on a car is fine. i know where to apply my keys then       History is not written by the butthurt.     because being a disrespectful and hateful shitlord is the best way to make your case as an enlightened civilized person       It represents the last time a large group of Americans stood up to the overwhelming power of the federal government.   This.       That's clearly the BFotAoNV on the roof of all those cars.     I know where to apply my keys   Right up your faggot ass I assume. You are nothing more than a wannabe toughguy.      The south seceded over taxation in large part related to slaves so...     history is not written by the butthurt   clearly ignores the holocaust   Oy Vey!       Homo flags are only existant to show seperation of rights, discrimination against normal people, and are highly offensive against the colorblind.  I DEMAND they are pulled and burned from state to state!!!       No its fucking not, I'm so tired of hearing you fat, tryhard clowns say shit like this  Go ahead, come and take it, you fat fuck       It was about money. Slaves = money, so about slaves. North was less dependent on slaves but South was still a slave-based economy.    That isn't what we're discussing. We're discussing the real symbolism of the flag which belongs to the confederacy. These were the motivations AS STATED by the confederacy: http://www.ucs.louisiana.edu/~ras27<wbr>77/amgov/secession.html Their FIRST fucking reason is that they didn't like the North getting rid of slavery because it was argued unconstitutional. "The Constitution of the United States, in its fourth Article, provides as follows: "No person held to service or labor in one State, under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor, but shall be delivered up, on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due." [editor's note: this is the Fugitive Slave Clause in the original Constitution whereby the North promised to return escaped slaves to their "owners" in the South]" that is verbatim. </wbr>      yeah but it isn't a flag planted and flying you faggot. two different things.    This guy here knows what he is talking about. This is exactly the point. It is not the flag of our United States. Its the Confederate flag and shouldn't be up next to the US flag in federal or state places like it belongs or something.    Thats an inconvenient truth northerners like to forget. They were ALL ABOUT southern slaves as long as they could profit from it.      you are the kekmaster   the master of all keks       You're eitger a teenager or foreign, fucking stop with the ellipses you faggot    thank you. they'll call us samefags but i don't care. it's nice to be appreciated.     being this irrationally nationalistic  Good little cuck, when you're 65, you might get a treat.                  homoflag = offensive  therefore homoflag must be removed from this country.                  Your parents are related aren't they    If you think it wasn't about slavery read the Cornerstone Speech.   fucking hick morons can't even history       I could've sworn they won a war for the contrary.    Yeah, and you know what, my great grandfather was a soilder in WWII with Nazi Germany, does that mean I'm going to start flying the nazi flag because 'lol it's my heritage'?    When people get lynched under a homoflag, we'll remove it.    "Thanks baby cakes"    North and South had slaves. Certainly was not about slavery since Ulysses S. Grant had slaves, and Robert E. Lee did not. Emancipation Proclamation freed no one.  Must have been something else then.  Learn2History        Nope, and I have a degree from Dartmouth.  You however strike me as the type who lives in a 30 story tenement screaming with all the mammys about your late welfare check.      They dodnt, they just underpaid any colored workers    I think he mean't the losing country. The holocaust was the evil the losing country did. If Germany won, we would be reading about Polish and British crimes in our books.      there are plenty of stuff that offends me. like all these shit reality tv shows.   but it's not about being offensive, just that it's an enemy flag. Gay Land is not an enemy of the US, did not have it's own goverment and president, its own currency and it's own Gay army that went to war with the UNITED states of america.  but it would funny if it did. wouldn't it?          here's a pie chart showing all of the things that the seceding states wanted to talk about in their declarations of secession. It was mostly  A: slavery B: The states right to define humans as property C: Lincoln's campaign promises to keep slavery from spreading into western states  http://www.civilwar.org/education/h<wbr>istory/primarysources/declarationof<wbr>causes.html?referrer=https://www.go<wbr>ogle.com/</wbr></wbr></wbr>          bullshit answer. you telling me one mans actions dictate what everyone else rights are?   if this were the case than all muslims must be banned from the united states because of Isis....        this is what northerners tell their children so that they can feel good about themselves   because when you tell a lie enough it becomes true.      You clearly haven't historied at all then. Ulysses S. Grant had slaves DURING the Civil War.      The South seceeded from the Union over slavery but you can be damn sure the North didn't win the war to free the slaves. You really think ANYONE at that period in time cared about a bunch of niggers? Give me a fucking break, the North fought that war cause it was gonna fuck up the Union if, you know, half the fucking Union disappeared.     My names brandon fuck you    ha ha what context is context in? bah ha ha.    Well, yeah, you AREN'T allowed to fly an ISIS flag on government buildings, so     come at me with a decent argument and stop flipping sides when it suits your case.  either everyone is responsible for everyone and muslims leave.  or offensive means offense and all flags must be burned because i think the american flag is offensive to the colorblind.         Gay Land is not an enemy of the US, did not have it's own goverment and president   own government  Democratic Party  Own President  Rosie O'Fatass and Ellen Degenerate  Gay Army  Tumblr  war with the UNITED states  See the culture wars which are constantly referenced in major media from both sides of the isle             Oh right. Just like how swastikas really represent peace and love? Those nazis just used it wrong?    yeah exactly. they fought to preserve the united states of america. and they won.   now there is no way in hell the enemy flag should have been allowed to fly after that. i don't know who decided to let it go like that.      this flag isnt on a government building moron...  its on a memorial for confederate soldiers.  L2 know what your talking about.        funny 3/10    Um, Yeah actually.  The swastika existed way before the nazi party adopted it. The meaning of the symbol changed when hitler decided fuck all jews.      "Context" refers to procedural language and/or historical exposition that is not connected to a specific argument.     funny 3/10   Awesome! I would like to know what you liked the most.  Was it "Ellen Degenerate"? I thought that was the best         stop flipping sides  We aren't the same person.  Right. The meaning of the rebel flag has also changed.       who cares about offensive? it's a fucking enemy flag. no enemy flags should fly.    if you want too you can, its protected under free speech   Orrrr. Get this, it's a combination of many aspects of political discourse. Every thing had a contribution as to what happened. It isn't either one separately, they go together, along with other things. As well, the south was brainwashing the southern serfs and the North was brainwashing the northern serfs. Everyone needs to get off their high horse and look at this from below rather than from your special little perch.   So I should just accept that what the flag means to me and others is irrelevant, and you and those like you should dictate what it represents to me?  Cool, Thanks Mussolini.         Discussing symbolism   I think that's the key here. A symbol can represent whatever you want it to represent. Un4chanately a single person and groups of racists in the past can use a symbol such as Robert E. Lee's battle flag (or in the case of the Nazi's the "Swastika" or "Twirling logs") as a hateful racist symbol. With enough media coverage those symbols now represent what the racists want it to represent. So I guess.... Blame the media.         You tell em OP all these assholes that want to throw up the racist card everytime something seemingly derogative comes up    no those were uninspired. i guess the tumblr army    If OH LOOK you OH LOOK are OH LOOK dumb OH LOOK enough OH LOOK to OH LOOK believe OH LOOK the OH LOOK Civil OH LOOK War OH LOOK was OH LOOK fought OH LOOK over OH LOOK slavery OH LOOK ask OH LOOK yourself OH LOOK this. Did the South say: A: ANOTHER STUPID FAGGOT CONFEDERATE FLAG THREAD "hey ANOTHER STUPID FAGGOT CONFEDERATE FLAG THREAD we're ANOTHER STUPID FAGGOT CONFEDERATE FLAG THREAD gonna ANOTHER STUPID FAGGOT CONFEDERATE FLAG THREAD go ANOTHER STUPID FAGGOT CONFEDERATE FLAG THREAD have ANOTHER STUPID FAGGOT CONFEDERATE FLAG THREAD slaves" ANOTHER STUPID FAGGOT CONFEDERATE FLAG THREAD and ANOTHER STUPID FAGGOT CONFEDERATE FLAG THREAD the ANOTHER STUPID FAGGOT CONFEDERATE FLAG THREAD North ANOTHER STUPID FAGGOT CONFEDERATE FLAG THREAD said ANOTHER STUPID FAGGOT CONFEDERATE FLAG THREAD "hell ANOTHER STUPID FAGGOT CONFEDERATE FLAG THREAD no ANOTHER STUPID FAGGOT CONFEDERATE FLAG THREAD you ANOTHER STUPID FAGGOT CONFEDERATE FLAG THREAD won't" or: B: OP IS SUCH A FAGGOT "fuck OP IS SUCH A FAGGOT you OP IS SUCH A FAGGOT we'll OP IS SUCH A FAGGOT be OP IS SUCH A FAGGOT our OP IS SUCH A FAGGOT own OP IS SUCH A FAGGOT country." OP IS SUCH A FAGGOT and OP IS SUCH A FAGGOT the OP IS SUCH A FAGGOT North OP IS SUCH A FAGGOT said OP IS SUCH A FAGGOT "hell OP IS SUCH A FAGGOT no OP IS SUCH A FAGGOT you OP IS SUCH A FAGGOT won't."

They aren't going to fly ISIS flags on ISIS memorials. They aren't going to fly Nazi flags on Nazi memorials.   And you can still fly the confederate flag, as that's also protected by free speech. Nobody wants to actually outright ban the confedorate flag, they just don't want it on things relating to government, or paid for by the government, and I'm not going to go to Germany, and insist they start raising Nazi flags because it's my heritage.       Can you just stop with this bullshit argument? Any flag can be flown at any time by provate individuals. It's a form of protest and protected speech. Should the government fly it? Of course not. Do businesses have a right to choose what merchandise they sell? Absolutely. But you can't start pulling away 1st am rights.       yfw everything the Confederate flag stands for helped put the American flag on the moon  Northern and west coast hypocrisy at it's finest.     Doesn't matter, you've already lost in every way possible. But go ahead post about it on an anonymous Chinese cartoon image board I'm sure it will help    nice answer. either all men are held accountable for other peoples actions, or each man is his own.  what is your answer to this. careful. im sure some nigger has gotten in a fight in every state of this country so..... we are all racists, bigots and therefor all could be held accountable for hatecrimes.  this is the extreme of your argument. someone either in my proximity, witht he same symbol, or same skin color did something bad therefore im punished because of his actions.  your white and hitler was white... better yet you may have blue eye and hitler had blue eyes...  best of all your american and americans are currentally stupid so... your stupid?   at what point do we apologize for the extreamists in our culture and continue to live our lives?  muslims are the only one left untouched by this but thats because barrak is a muslim also.                     lrn2SCarolina Capitol Building Rebfag    you shouldn't fucking plant that flag because it represents an enemy of the United States of America. look up planting a flag to get an understanding of why this is bad.   display it all you want. put it on the fucking side of your building, on your garage on your fucking car.   but no enemy flags should ever be planted on US soil        If I had that flag I know I could bullseye the star in the middle with my jizz head on    oh yeah? sedition and rebellion did it did they? wow, good to know.     .same arguments. same people..... thats your own logic     ANON This is not just one guy. You and me both know damn well what people see when they see this flag. We know it's not about "southern culture", southern culture includes racism. I've seen it with my own eyes, and it's not hard to find.     Well sedition and rebellion allowed the union to come into fruition in the first place.  We are a country of traitors.       From what I recall from my brief eastern european education on this matter, the South's economy was heavily based on the cotton farms with nigger slaves, which was not so common in the North.  If South went "fuck y'all we'll have our own country" they tried to do it so that the northerners wouldn't abolish their slavery and the very few very rich 1% of the southerners wouldn't lose their money.  Fuck, history repeats itself at every corner of every fuckin decade, the rich always start wars to protect their wealth. It is always about wealth, the populist, racist, religious, etc ideas are only used to manipulate the masses in order to benevolently go to war.        may i pretty please have an RL picture of a bunch of niggers burning a confederate flag. google doesnt really do it justice..   it does not mean an enemy to me.  it means a struggel of opressed people econimcally and taxation without representation..  i think this country was founded ont aht principle.        No? I am not him and my arguments are different than his. Not sure why you compared us.     You can criticise the south all you want,You can criticise the south all you want,You can criticise the south all you want,    but I love our bad emission trucks, i love our tight knit christian communities and small towns where everybody knows each other.     I fly a rebel flag in the back of my 9mpg chevy    you did it for us           The problem with your argument faggot is all kids are being taught option A. for about the last 20 years now. shit maybe longer. I am 35 and that is what I was taught in California, but I am not a faggot and realized through the power of reading different shit that the war was not just about slavery. That became an end goal to justify the industrial war.    it's the next logical step of what they did that makes it treasonous and makes the confederacy an enemy. they rebelled and were put down.    Exactly what I was thinking but I didn't want to bring in any Marxist critique on this issue.    Anon.  I dont fly the flag, I dont give two shits about it as an artifact. But if you are truly from the south than you damn well know that not everybody sees it as a symbol of racism.   More people think of it as the symbol of Lynard Skynard and shitty domestic beer/ shotguns/ hunting/ other southern passtimes.  Oh it absolutely represents racism to some people, but guess what: So does the US flag.  But hey, nobody is calling for the flags of England, France, Spain, or Portugal to come down. They collectively RAPED and enslaved the fucking world yet those flags fly proud            Thanks baby cakes     If you guessed A,  Nobody "guessed" A.  A is what happened.   I love it when bigots think other people calling out their bigotry are bigots. And I especially love it when bigots ignorant of history think they know history.          But hey, nobody is calling for the flags of England, France, Spain, or Portugal to come down. They collectively RAPED and enslaved the fucking world yet those flags fly proud   You know what the difference is? Those countries changed, stupid southern hicks are incapable of changing.  Kill all of them.         your right, but if the british called in the french troops also we would be arguing about the tradtional american flag right now and not the confederate flag.....     As a southerner who had ancestors in the civil war, youre fucking stupid. the dixie flag was never used as the country's flag, just as the army of virginia's battleflag. For most confederate soldiers, like my family from south carolina, that flag meant nothing.  If our ancestors came back and saw all this shit over a flag most of them probably wouldnt recognize, theyd shoot us before they shot the yankees      Not the person that said 3/10  But I also thought it was funny. I Actually didn't notice that you said "degenerate". Now that its pointed out, I proclaim even funnier!  A kek for you sir! A kek and a half!        We'd be living in American Nazi Germany and wonder why this country sucks so much ass.    What? The meaning of symbols changes over time. The swastika used to mean one thing, now it's agreed that it means something else. The confederate flag once meant something, but the confederacy is gone. It nows means something else. ...that isn't even really comparable to your scenario. I'm attacking the flag, not you. You are not being prosecuted.     Is the U.S.A. really, literally? Literally having a big sore butthole fest over a flag? THIS IS HILARIOUS oh and fuck the media, instead of reporting news, they report stories. Stories ≠ truth   well maybe but they didn't. so that's it. end of story. after that war there is no way the fucking flag should have been allowed to be planted, implying the fucking enemy still controlled that land. fuck that.    It means something now, or the racists in the SC Capitol building wouldn't be so butthurt over it.    it was 3/10 not for funniness. it was funny so it got a 3. as a real response though, it failed.   The US FLAG should be abolished too, because it brings hatred into the hearts of Native Americans every time they see the flag.   Or you could say that we have earned the right to fly the US flag because we almost wiped the Native American off the planet...   Which mean if we almost wipe out all the niggers then they can complain about the confederate flag, that way it's politically correct. Hmmm.. I like this plan.       stop regurgitateing what your highschool teachers tell you.  if you think that what your taught in school is the exact truth than im sure you think WWII was fought over jews.  noone gave a shit about niggers then and noone gives a shit about nigers now.  did you take up arms and go riot in the street and loot in baltimore?  did anyone actually go riot because they were upset about that nigger in balitmore no those that did care prayed and tried to settle the community down.             Yeah it's hilarious you're that unaware of the racism surrounding the Confederacy or that racism is even a problem in this country. Shove your own cock up your ass.    Agreed, even Lincoln called them niggers. The North just likes to pretend it has the moral high ground in that regard. Besides even "if" (and that's a big if) the war was fought primarily over slavery, the people who actually did the fighting and died for the cause of the South were not the slave owners. In fact, the industrial North benefited more from slaves more than the common Southerner.  In any case, its not like any of us actually fought in the war, so who won and who lost is not a cogent argument (inb4 "hur dur you lost the war get over it" - please come up with a cogent argument). The real issue is that the flag is indeed used to promote racism, but to many of us in the South, its a source of regional heritage. I couldn't care less to be honest, but I hate censorship even more. It has never been illegal to fly a particular flag and even be racist for that matter. So let people fly the flag if they want to, even the racists. Oh and by the way if you think you aren't racist, please think again. Everyone is, it's human nature. Stop pretending, you are on /b/ for god's sake.     Samefag.  The rich always start wars to protect and/or grow their wealth.* In this particular case, don't remember who started the war but the end game is always the same       on /b/   in controversial thread   real response   maximum kek       Only in the US would we venerate traitors to the nation as heroes, and decorate memorials and capital buildings with their iconography. These were soldiers who actively sought to fight and kill US service personnel, and instead of treating them like the filthy unwashed terrorists they were, we immortalize them.  They were traitors, and deserved a traitor's death at the end of a noose. Not memorials and flags.     same as what you fucking nitwit    they think it means something because they dont know history. Theyve seen it all their lives as the rebel flag     Only in the US would we venerate traitors   Only in the US would we venerate traitors   We were born of treason, why the fuck would we not?       Oh look here we go again. A stormfag telling someone to "educate themselves" that your "jew high school teaching" isn't education. Fucking faggot.   The Civil War happened because of slavery. Deal with it. Crying for the version that makes the South look noble isn't history. It's asskissing the loser.      Nono you don't understand, it really symbolizes shitty beer and shotguns, not heroes...    /thread    To add on to,  in the 1960s, England France, etc, voluntarily gave up almost all of their colonies, while with the confederate flag, in the 1960s, it was being used to kill people, and to deny people from getting a job just because they were black.  Fasttrack for TTP passed and the only mainstream outlet to report on it was the New York Times because everyone was having a shitfest.      Ask any southerner if they think the civil war was fought over slavery and they will say no  Ask any southerner if they like black people and believe in equality and they will say no  the flag or the true reason behind the civil war is outdated and moot. true southerners and not just wanna be southerners are dip packing buffoons who give americans a bad name        exactly. fuck that. no way should enemy flags be flying. no way should fucking statues be put up of them either, but that's another story.     Hi Anon. I see you called someone a "faggot" I'm assuming you meant this jokingly, but I've been mulling this over in my head for several days and it does not sit right. Let me please (re)iterate you on this word. Not only does it aim hatred at a large group of people that I myself and many of my friends are a part of, the word has the power to tear down and undermine a fight that we have been fighting for decades. I don't know where you stand on the issue, but I'm assuming you value your rights to equality as a citizen of this country. You may think that this is only a word, a mere configuration of letters, but this word is the foundation that keeps LGBT people held in the depths of inequality, while men like yourself toss around hateful slurs in a joking way thinking immaturely that you are immune to hurting anyone. This is not true. Next time you throw this word out (however jokingly and privately you may thing you are using this- in this era NOTHING is ever private), think about those who have struggled for the right to feel safe in their own country. The word "faggot" creates a hostile environment and makes many LGBT people feel unsafe around those who have enough power in society to use such words. Don't make me feel unsafe. I have a right to my safety. And although I have tremendous pride in being a mature, strong, bisexual man, it really sucks when your words get in the way of my pride.      because giving up colonies makes up for all the horrid shit they did   I feel this is a conversation that would never actually amount to anything on /b/  In person? Perhaps, but not here.        Actually WWII wasn't fought over Jews, though it very much should have been a part of it.    Every major player in the war either didn't know about or flat out denied a pogrom against the Jews was occurring.      Get an editor, stormfag. Not reading all that.     using a politician's secession statement as a representative of the entire population   using only four of the seceding states as a representative of the entire Confederacy   assuming that's "states[sic] rights" only applies to whether slaves are considered humans and/or property   claiming any and every source as objective evidence regardless of victor's bias  lol, I bet you think the Northern aggression that started the Civil War and the war in general was fought over slavery. What a fucking idiot.        I really really REALLY like that pasta, mind if I save it?   KARP  It totally wasn't about racism. Seriously, take a look at this excerpt from Thompson, creator of the Battle Flag of Virginia, now commonly recognized as the Confederate flag.   clipping taken from "Daily Morning News" April 23, 1863      Again read the Cornerstone Speech before you make an ass of yourself.    The Republicans fucked up after the Civil War. They should have completely dismantled the South and executed most of the people behind the rebellion.  Instead they made the mistake of compassion, and look what we have today. Teabaggers, basically.      Thanks for sucking our dicks tonite, Bill!    And you know what? Those "teabaggers" are slowly destroying this country.  And when we have all finally killed ourselves off because we hate each other, and only a 10th of of the population remains, you can sit smugly in your grave and say "I told you so!"        yeah 100% agree. it's sad. it was compasson that stayed their hand but if they could have seen what a bunch of white trash losers the south has become they'd know it was more compassionate to cut them all down then.    holy shit, that's a nice flag    It was my pleasure laurie!    Define "enemy" of the United States for me please.   My father is in the military and likes to leave anti-terrorism documents lying about the house. Based on the Federal Governments definition, an enemy of the State can be detained and classified as a traitor for something as simple as speaking out or showing negative opinion of the current Commander in Chief.   I'd post pics for proof, but idk where that document is now.        Oh i like it. Is this the flag of the country of self hating faggots?   Your application for citizenship is still pending.      WWII caused a lot of research and development into technologies that changed the world and how we live today, including the Nazi scientists.  They caused a lot of death, but they also did a lot of great things.  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=-db<wbr>fXp8_qjo</wbr>  [ ]      Have you ever been to the South?    No, but in the end, they owned up to their mistakes, and just let them go. They didn't have to lose a war to give them independence, because times changed, and they realized they fucked up.  With the confederate flag, a hundred years after they lost, instead of saying "Sorry, let's try to make things right" they go and continue to use the flag and say "DAMN NIGGERS WE SHOULDA KEPT YOUSE AS SLAVES".      compassion  Burning the entire thing down, destroying a generation, crushing their economy, ruining the crops, and barring them from legislature for several years while keeping them under military occupation is "compassion"     It's like trying to save a marijuana crop infested with spider mites by not removing the infected plants or burning sulfur to stop any further damage.    let's see. if a place has an army, its own government its own currency and tries to destroy your country (from within in this case) and then a long and costly war was fought with it.   i think we can safely say that's an enemy state.       Yes...compassion. That's what it was.     All which happened before Reconstruction. The Republicans stupidly thought the South was going to straighten up, fly right, and welcome blacks into their society. Guess again?    Who the fuck cares? People saw the flag before this as a sign of racism, or didn't you know whyyyyyy? Fucking history class. If today's monkeys remembered anything from history class there wouldn't be ANY concussion of what things ment. But no today shitfucks explode on to twitter Facebook, what ever clearly picking a side and not understanding the other side. Uneducated    you get automatic admission if you're the product of incest   99% of the South gets in automatically      The southern butt will hurt again!   Confusion*    It is compassionate to allow a defeated enemy to get back on their feet without too much micromanagement. Hey, it worked with Japan later after WWII, didn't it? Not the South.     All of which WAS "reconstruction" Reconstruction didn't help the South at all. That's why it's still shit .      That doesn't change the fact they systematically killed, not just jews, but slavs, gays, communists, etc.    it almost feels like the final battle in the civil war! ah ha hahah ha feels good      it wasn;t meant to help the fucking south. and it should have been a fuck of a lot more overbearing. they got off too fucking easy    This has been brewing well before Roof's shooting spree. Sooner or later there would be call to rid the South's government of flying this obvious symbol of racism.   durr twitter facebook  Free speech really bothers you that much, eh?       tries to destroy your country   If the south wanted to destroy the North, Lee could have easily raped Maryland and southern Pennsylvania. However, the South didn't believe in practicing Total War, unlike the North (see: Sherman's March to the Sea), however, the South merely wanted Independence.   Also by your definition, "a place, a government, a currency" means that ISIS, the Taliban, etc. are presently not enemies of the state and should be ignored so we can focus on the more important issue of historic battle flags flying about.        You only won because you were smarter and more well organized.    it was one fucking country you fucking dirtwad. by taking away half of it you are effectively destroying it, and from within.   why would we let even the possibility of that happen again? remove all flags of an enemy country.      People who ignorantly blind themselves, due to whatever butthole feels they have    That's bullshit. The South had the upper hand at first, and then the North prevailed. Don't give me that "honor" crap about war. The South would have done whatever it could to win if pushed to shove.    ISIS has their own currency, a capital, and their own functioning government.    i'm just giving you an example of one concrete one. it was just about the confederacy. i never said its the only way to be an enemy.   fuck you are dumb.      The north still is. Feel free to compare the test scores of the southern states to the northern.    Push already did come to shove, and the south got bitchslapped back down.    yfw Southern lawmakers are the biggest opponents to better education in the public school system    Gee womder why the south is plagued with bigotry   I laugh at every southerner who goes "Muh guns, muh flag, muh religion! Convert 'em or kill 'em!"  Know who else does that?  ISIS and Taliban       Yeah but the point is both sides would have utterly destroyed the other if given the opportunity. This bullshit about the South not believing in "Total War" (whatever that is) is just a bunch of romantic cock jizzum.    Because the North freely welcomed the slaves into their waiting arms. The North didn't want them either. Oh and here is a bit of reading for you, if you think your ancestors were philanthropic anti-racists. "Northern prejudice, and the inability of those states to assimilate their former slaves, certainly discouraged efforts toward freeing the slaves in the South. Having inadvertently freed the slaves in the state, the Massachusetts legislature voted to bar interracial marriages and expel all blacks who were not citizens. Boston authorities took action against 240 of them in 1800, most natives of Rhode Island, New York, Philadelphia, and the West Indies. White Philadelphians were rioting against blacks from 1805, driving them from the Fourth of July celebrations on Independence Square. Within a decade, the burning of black churches in the city had begun. A Virginia judge, observing the North in 1795, wrote, "If in Massachusetts, where the numbers are comparatively very small, this prejudice be discernable, how much stronger may it be imagined in this country ...?" from North of Slavery by Leon Litwack Everyone is racist. Please get off your high horse.      "better" Right.  Because Common Core is such a good practice.      I can't help but think that anyone that obsessed with 'tradition' isn't living in the present day.     Everyone is racist. Please get off your high horse.  No they aren't, asshole. You might be.      half   how do I geography.jpg   So you're banning a historic flag for fear of another rebellion?   I cannot conceive a time when the South possessed greater resources, manpower or strategic advantage over the North, except following Chancellorsville when Lee marched North. Had Lee decided to go your "push come to shove" route, he would have burned D.C. to the ground to get a surrender from the Union, and recognition from Britain and France.    Gives definition of enemy   But anon I didn't mean it like that   Boy it's sure summer in here                If you think that was compassion in both cases that stayed their hand, you are sadly mistaken friend.    The VP of the CSA specifically talked about it being a fight for slavery. Multiple states also talked about it being about slavery in their secession statements.    This is one of the few cases where the losing side was fighting to preserve what had brought the fledgling country as far as it had while upholding the values that had made the nation a country in the first place.      its one fucking enemy you faggot. do i have to explain every single one? i explained the contextually relevant definition. holy shit you are fucking dumb.    Common Core is a good curriculum by and large. Your Southern buddies don't want it because it teaches objectively and not according to their warped sense of reality.    The north did allow slaves with open arms. In fact, the very first reason specified in the declaration of secession. See     Actually it was superior numbers and their reliance on industry (better supplies, manufacturing, etc)    sause?     The nazi swastika was a modified version of the original bhuddist swastika , the nazi version is drawn in reverse and represents something entirely different than peace. So you're kind of stupid is what I'm getting at.     i don't give a fuck what the original reason was. i doubt any of us really know today anyway with so much revision going on on both sides and not a lot of documentation.  the fact is they became an enemy state, for whatever reason and remained on, for 4 years, until they were put down.  no enemy flag like that, espeically an internal enemy, should be allowed to be planted on US soil.        More like the North had a plan, the South played rape victim, so the North watered down that plan. Same shit the Republicans do to the Democrats now.     implying the states with slaves staying with the north did it by choice     Your post made me laugh a bit. Where do you think you are?    you mean an enemy of tge federal government? Seriously, I don't know if there are just a fuck ton of you people or if you're just always in these threads but holy fuck you are about as stupid as a god damn plant.    Let me guess. Go back to Reddit.  Because in order to post on /b/ you have to be a neckbreathing racist fucktard. This isn't an image board, it's a purity test. GTFO.      I gave you the definition granted by your home nation - an enemy of the state can merely be someone who publicly voices discontent with the acting Commander in Chief. Once you've been noted to do that, the Federal Government has you flagged. Your definition was so narrow I wasn't sure if you were just pulling it out of your ass to suit your argument or if you're still in middleschool.    i mean an enemy of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA you stupid bastard. they had their own government, their own currency and their own army that went to war with the USA.    He's right, you know. The constant racism on /b/ is often shit out by retards and is supported with retarded arguments. It gets annoying.    This guy gets it    gr8 b8 m8, I'd h8 to r8 below 8/8.    it's not just an enemy. you're right that could cover a lot of different things.   it's the flag of an ENEMY COUNTRY.   fuck that's what we're talking about, not just enemies.        I didn't say "allow" I said "welcome" please learn to read. The average Northerner at the time was just as likely to be racist as a Southerner (not as much maybe) but still racist. They liked the principle of freeing slaves and allowing them in the North, but still for the most part preferred segregation. Its true, look it up.     their own currency  worth nothing     but a lot of it is just edgelords trying to be shocking like little pussies    The true enemy of the Civil War should probably be the side that defied the Constitution, suspended habeas corpus, slaughtered hundreds of thousands of their own men to overcome tactical disadvantages, promised freedom to slaves fighting in their armies who then were not freed for several years after, and committed war crimes and the razing of civilian property.  Oh wait, that's the side that won.      Teatard confirmed     being this new   How's school going?      make me    Yeah see posts like this are the reason why we cannot let that enemy flag be planted on any land inside the USA. because people like you still believe this shit and still want to secede.  you're a small miserable minority of impotent white trash whiners. but that's no reason to give it any more credence.   remove all enemy flags.         Look it up  I'll take your word for it, even though the expectation is that you support your own claims... but ok. That isn't really the discussion anyway. The argument is that the southern flag symbolizes racism.     did you just say that the southern confederacy...started a way on the North?    Don't you know who I am? I am Lord God King /b/ufu. I can have you dragged back to Reddit in chains.     If you don't like it, you can get out.     The flag symbolizes states rights. Only over the past century itts misuse has it led to it being compared to slavery    If you had actually spent a long time here you'd know that /b/ usually hates this /pol shit. But sure, I'm new and 12 years old.    If you think the USA is a holy nation of nothing but golden warriors of justice who can do no wrong, you're the problem, not a flag that's nearly two centuries old.      liberals, democrats, and Northerners actually believe this  Subjugation and enslavement of politically-retarded idiots fucking when?      yes by seceding you faggot. by trying to destroy the country from within. this would never be allowed and they knew it.    *war   This is not what they teach in school   THIS IS B8 (OP) The THIS IS B8 flag THIS IS B8 symbolizes THIS IS B8 states THIS IS B8 rights. THIS IS B8 Only THIS IS B8 over THIS IS B8 the THIS IS B8 past THIS IS B8 century THIS IS B8 itts THIS IS B8 misuse THIS IS B8 has THIS IS B8 it THIS IS B8 led THIS IS B8 to THIS IS B8 it THIS IS B8 being THIS IS B8 compared THIS IS B8 to THIS IS B8 slavery    The Civil War was at least partly about the South fighting for the right to own slaves. All the attempted historical revisionism won't change that.    i knew what you meant you great big faggot     That's what the British told us once and here we are kek    The racism is an inside joke to scare off shills shitlords and SJW's, but the cuckening happened and now it just attracts them to the point they wave their dicks, cancer and pasta in almost every thread.       so if i try to leave the usa I'm starting a war? i gues just ctr+v my original comment. you really aren't getting any better at this.   it's the same goddamn thing   I'm /new/  fixed      no you're welcome to leave. go to canada or whatever just don't try to take a part of the country and claim it's now no longer a part of the USA. you will be put down like the dog you are.   holy shit are you really this stupid?      I know it is, but that is not what you called me on. In any case, the flag can mean whatever anyone wants it to mean. I see the flag as a way I want to see it, a symbol representing the South, nothing more. If others choose to see it representing racism, that is their choice. In this country, it has never been illegal to be racist or to fly a flag for that matter. When it is, then you will have something to worry about.    are "you" a state? if not then yes, you can leave. states can't. how is this hard to understand?    They weren't just "trying to leave" faggot. They opened fire at Ft. Sumpter.    what about C "we'll be our own country... so we can keep slaves"     You mean like we did to:  The indians Mexico Canada Britain Russia The Hawai'ians Spain Japan  ... what               Most people are just being racist and edgy to fit in, see pic related.     If others choose to see it representing racism, that is their choice.   It's actually reality. There is "choice" here.     i know right? how can someone be this stupid? i don't believe he's trolling either. he just can't understand this simple concept.  maybe the confederacy had a provision in their draft to leave the stupid people out of it. that would explain a lot wouldn't it?      yes but the USA can't be an enemy of itself you dumb fucker.    like I said buddy, ctr+v. there is actually more than one instance of this in history. see if you can apply your "brain" and "study" this kind of thing. the words in quotes can be googled for the definition, just to help you along. have fun you pansy ass loyalist and god save the queen or whatever you fucking britlanders say.

I'm getting a sweet steven universe vibe from this color   How am I gonna do this....       i explained this yesterday i think   hey ehg, why do you like drawing you killing people rather than you kissing everyone   anytime~   $400   i know murphy i just i can't.... i need sustenance   i saw a picture of a cab driver that took a shotgun to the face left no face but the head was there i just went by that                        admittedly i've been tempted to use the sexy drawing you did for me for stuff, but i decided asking permission and giving you a spot on the credits would be easier than a crazy lawsuit thing later   Did Helly draw that villain/hero request with EHG? I wasn't around to see it.  Sup. 100% awful at drawing, but wanting to practice.   Requests?       $40    he did. helly was the villain. i didnt get to save it though.   かわいいです~   Reauesting ehg with a braided ponytail    Lol, this is great! He even did himself as the villain like I asked. Thanks.   Word up, gangstas  Hows everyone? Requests?     dun give up bruh you can get thru this https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=N8i<wbr>5NLyXZdc</wbr>  [ ]   alright        Shut up Kai.

I hope you all die, turkish scum   fuck muslims and fuck religion in any way  Full of cunts especially in the tourist markets an embarrassment to the old glory of the ottomans   Naziland regelt!    I hope the zombies of a million dead Armenians slaughter every single one of you and festoon your corpses on the dome of the hagia sophia      you mean Istanbul or the rest of anatolia?    Not as pretty as you think it is. Boring. Shitty ideology of Middle Eastern countries but no balls to follow through on anything. Living in the former glory of the Ottomans. You're essentially England but not as successful in any way and have an even shittier culture (which is saying a lot).      go back to it.    You are going to be the seat of the anti-christ and the one world government   https://<span>youtu.be/sR8wTV61zpU  [ ]       çok kisel :^) en kısa zamanda kapağı atıp gidiyorum hayırlısıyla    nereye?    ABD, Kanada, veya Hollanda. Amerika da bokum gibinmiş diyolar da bağnaz amerikalı bağnaz müslümandan daha çekiliyor   I like turkey (the meat, not your second tier nation). PS: kebabs weren't invented in Turkey. Go get arse-fucked by a Greek. With all my (sero)positive love.  Never fapped to a Turkish girl  goat fuckers  Mueslim  No pride in your only success (armenian genocide).  Got a few friends that are Turkish, pretty chill people, I guess. I rate 7/10   You were going into the right way of westernizing, now you are becoming a shit religious dictatorship helping isis.   The EU let countries like Romania and Greece in... but not you. How does it feel to be rejected and deemed less wanted than Estonia?   Dude...that's cold...And Estonia seems to be more wanted than Latvia...   shouldn't exist. this goes for all muslims and muslim countries.  Glorious? GLORIOUS!? You young turks are so hilarious!   (You do know that you can't proclaim your glorious without some kind of achievement?)     I have big benis    Turkey   Glorious  Pick one     Why would you even make a thread like this, fucktard? Its obvious everyone around the world hates us. Even moreso on 4chan. Unless you're not even Turkish and just doing this to feast on the hate against Turks.  Doubt it.       Amına kodugumun yerinde herkes bize düşman   But kebabs m9   i hope every turkish faggot dies of ebola    You make good food, apart from that fuck your country helping isis. you dirty turkish cunt.   The most good food is from the kurdish people    What of it, MI6?    Moldova or Turkey? The EU chose. It wasn't Turkey.    They liek dem kebabs, no? Also top kek and epik memez    With good reasons the world hates you my friend. Look at the bright side, most of the time we don't spare a thought for Turkey.   İsis kill kurds. Enemy of my enemy is my friend. Thats all. No big deal.  Don't cry for me Turkey?   Not all of them. Some want to remove them.  I regard topkek as being the greatest Turkish achievement there ever was.      Turkey kills Kurds also. Oh wait, that was your point, sorry.   sa ben newfag. size hikayemi anlatıcağım. burda karı kız am göt meme görmeye geliyordum. internet kafedeyim bir gün. arkamdan bir kız dedi ki "aa 4çen demi takılıyorsun??" ben de dedim evet. kız dedi ki çok güsel yaaa. sonra sevişmeye başladık içine boşaldım. cocugumuz oldu. özürlü çıktı. dedim diye. meğersem oda newfagmış. bitti   FUCK YOU TURKISH MUDSKIN, LONG LIVE KURDISTAN   5\10 alright people shitty government good landmarks      Thats not good enough. Nobody gives a shit about Jersey either, but they arent hated when they are brought up. See my point? I'm afraid there's no escaping it though. The people that live here are, and have been, mostly muslims. As a result, I am automatically branded a radheaded shitskin. I hate them so much for that, too.       Dirty and subhuman. Long live Kurdistan.    1/10 okudum     Implying kurds aren't mudskins      Women  Heh.     Hassiktir amk sanki seni o meşhur karılar gibi bacaklarını açmış anon gelse de beni sikse der gibi bekliyorlar, vatandaşlık varsa ayrı tabi.    Kurdistan? Where is this country? İs it neighbour with neverland?    Stick to what Kemal Ataturk taught you and you'll do fine.   Türk Musevi penis yiyen  Ottoman empire lol  One of the weakest excuses for an "empire" in all of history    trash   Killing kurds? sure :^)    10 saniyemi geri ver/10    tell that to my blond hair and green eyes you faggot    Why can't we get Turkish cigarettes any more? Not in US, Germany, Ireland, England. Since about ten years ago. What happened?     Denbts     I'm not one for nationalism, but god damn it fuckwit, are you serious?     I got engaged to my boyfriend of 4 years today. We're getting married and in the process of adopting a 5 year old.  How does /b/ feel about this?    Same I'd think about heteros doing the same thing. As long as you're good parents, fine and dandy.    Extremely happy for you! I hope you and your partner have an amazing life and wish nothing but the best to you and your children. :)    You fucking know how /b/ will feel about this ya cunt Unless you're a troll you're a fucking idiot if you can't infer what /b/ will say    will you allow the adopted kid to decide their own sexuality or will you gay them up to the max?  at least wear a condom when you rape the little one. quit spreading aids  Faggot  I'm very proud of how progressive you are   Kekd    maybe jealous, there are a bunch on /b/tards with shitty families    Kill yourself    ok. There are a lot of chillren needing adopting    I feel like gay marriage and racism are obvious distractions from larger political issues like the TTP    I feel the need to point out that op is a faggot   what kind of gays are you, sensible gays or mincing pirhouetting fabulous gays? if former, well done, carry on. if latter, kneel down and headbutt the kerb until your skull splits    well, you're not wrong    As long as it isn't in a church, then I don't care. Have a nice overdue marriage.     Accurate    OP is a faggot but I'm happy for this faggot. Best wishes OP.    I don't think much of it because you are OP and you are a faggot(literally)    Why "as long as it isn't in a church"?    Weak bait    Don't care fag   Who cares? Gay marriage has just been a huge red herring from relevant issues. I'm glad we can move on now.Except it'll probably just be to pot legalization or something even more retarded.  I hope one of you gets AIDS.   congrats fag    None of my business.    I don't even care anymore. /b/ is full of moral tumblr fags. 99% of this board supports faggots and niggers now.    If I could care less I would be dead.     Are you actually that dumb?    Well we're both clean and monogamous ...so i don't see how that would work   Funniest celebrity deaths thread?  I still can't over the fact that Paul Walker died in a car crash LOL.   "HURR DURR I DRIVE SUPER FAST IN MOVIES THAT MEANS IMMA EXPERT IN REAL LIFE OH FUCK NOT A TR_"  Fucking loser. That stupid piece of shit got what he deserved.         Nice the car looks like it was so badly damaged it turned into a destroyed building   thread sucks   He wasn't the one driving the car, his friend was. But it's still pretty ironic   Well, /b/?   1/3 ?   I can get why people would get confused by this question the first time they hear about, assuming they've never taken a high school math class that features probability. But when you've had it explained to you, how the fuck can you keep on denying the logic you're given? You're really making yourself look like a moron.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertr<wbr>and%27s_box_paradox  But yeah, keep on denying something all mathematicians agree on, and that has been proven empirically.  </wbr>      you have already pulled out one gold ball. that is with 100% certainty, and it's not factored into the equation. it's either going to be a gold or silver ball. 50-50   Overrated musicians thread.   We'd have been better off without them then if they are so influencial. 90%of indie music is utter garbage.    this /thread      &gt;&gt;mate   Britfag confirmed.     Faggotry is unnatural and shouldn't be celebrated. In theory, they are less than human. One of the basic qualifications of life, is reproduction, and if they can't or won't, they are useless. They are going against evolution and proudly showing off their mutation. It's disgusting. Yes, while there have been studied that show homosexuality in other species, that doesn't make it natural. Hell, male dominance is natural, yet women still have rights. Maybe next you'll be able to marry your cat or a 10 year old nationwide.    inb4 "sliperee sloope"  It's a form of argument, not a fallacy.      Dude talk about shr3kage    This    slippery slope fallacy   Hey /b/, don't you forget about me.</blockquote>]
