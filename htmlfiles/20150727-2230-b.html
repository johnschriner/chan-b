[ I am on HULK HOGANS side.<br>What is said in private - is private.<br>Unfair dismissal is unfair.<br><br>Hogan was fired in real life from WWE this month for his own personal views about some guy trying to bankroll his daughter.<br><br>He said this 8 years ago in private - on a videotape which should never have been released.<br>In real life, he has now been stripped of ALL WWE honors, hall of fame, videogames, and contracts.<br><br> What a joke.<br><br>Seeing as Hogan has been removed from WWE games, history, and future at this point in time - I see no reason to continue supporting WWE, or its games.<br>Many people who purchased a Hogan DLC have now been left out of pocket - with no word on a refund.<br>This can easily happen again with future superstars.<br>I am simply not willing to risk this kind of nonsense happening again.<br><br> A mans private life is his private life.<br> His views are his own.<br><br>There is much more to it than what Hogan simply implied.<br> Most of us feel the same way as Hogan feels.<br> Simple fact is - if you act like a human - you will be seen as one.<br><br>There is a difference between a NIGGER, and an African American.<br><br>The former causes issues and is a sub par group of humans who love to hate, and love shiny things and rap, which is in fact crap.<br><br>The latter is perfectly fine and are a respected bunch of human beings in most peoples eyes - including Hogans.<br><br>Hogan was not talking about African Americans/black people - He was talking about NIGGERS.<br><br> Deal with it.<br><br>I'm with you on this Hogan!<br><br><br>"I guess we are all a little racist."<br>"Fucking Niggers."</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>holy fuck aye for real this has got to be some proxy to some other shit, what about when booker T called hogan a nigger in a promo those years back? what the fucks the real story here</br>  <br> This </br>  Turns out there is a vid of vince saying nigger to john cena and booker T also.<br><br><br>They are not fired.</br></br></br>  <br>Hulk Hogan also signed a contract that said something along the lines of " We can fire you for any reason, at any time, and you will not do anything about it." I feel bad for him. His wife leaving him, his son getting in that car accident that cost him millions of dollars, his daughter dating red guards. But once you become famous you should get stripped of all privacy. Life isn't fair.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;630 <br><br><br><br>WHOA WHOA WHOA ___LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING NIGGER LMAO</br></br></br></br>  <br>Vince said nigger first ~<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=JtA<wbr>JqeTpDis</wbr>  [ ]<br><br><br>see</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>td;dr: no, seriously, too long, did not read<br><br>/thread</br></br></br></br>  <br> Proof plz </br>  <br>Your autism is showing...</br>  <br> A mans private life is his private life. <br> His views are his own <br><br>he's entitled to his own views.<br><br>he's NOT entitled to lack of consequences for those views</br></br></br></br></br></br>   his daughter dating redguards <br><br>Top kek</br></br>  <br> "Fucking Niggers." <br><br>you, OP, are a LOT racist<br><br>fuck off and die</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>entertainment business is run by kikes, what else did you expect</br></br>  <br>Why should there be consequences for not liking niggers? That's like saying there should be consequences for not liking aids or poverty.</br>  if it's so damn offensive then the black community needs to stop using it too !!!!! .....tired of their bullshit.....the man said it over 8 years ago......, because if that's the case we all should lose our jobs your not going to tell me no one else has ever said the word ....  <br>His wife leaves him for a young buck too. Felt bad for the hulkster. His wife was fucking one of his sons highschool friends. But watcha gonna do?</br>  <br><br>fuck you, you racist fuck</br></br>  <br> His wife was fucking one of his sons highschool friends. <br><br>I guess it was one of the friends his son didn't kill.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't be stupid. He got fired because WWE didn't want to be affiliated with racism. It's like how Walmart no longer sells rebel flags.</br>  <br>thats what you get for being a pillar of moral decency to the masses these days(fucking illuminati psyop personal life jack fucked etc) webank</br>  Seriously this was 8 years ago, people still casually flew confederate flags back in those days. Can we blame him for the sins of his time?  <br><br>BIGNO</br></br>  <br>I will always support the Hulkster. Fuck the haters.</br>  Wait until joel hears this...  <br><br>jezus. racism is never acceptable. it's not like this was in 1949.<br><br>I keep telling you /b/tards this casual racism is wrong. period.<br><br>more proof I'm right and that if you continue this shit in real life, you will suffer the consequences.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  They should also fire booker t.. If nobody is allowed to use the word (even though) everyone does regardless of race, then anyone that say it should be fired, including blacks..  <br> Fuck the haters. <br><br>you use this word "hate" but clearly you don't know how it works.</br></br></br>  <br>So what the fuck did he say?</br>  <br>Yea, his wife was fuckable as fuck too.</br>    wanna get publicity? be willing to say something or point someone out for saying something "racist". WWE is using Hulk Hogan to grandstand--and using Black American and White America and everyone else to get free publicity. 8 years ago in a private conversation about his daughter?! Hell... when folks talk about family--all bets can be off! You have Black wrestlers and others coming to Hulk's defense. What does that say? This is all about WWE(and hack writers and news media) getting more from trumpeting their kicking Hulk Hogan out, than anything. They should apologize for "grandtstanding" at Hulk's expense... and hear what is probably the genreal response... from Black as well as White--I suspect for those who are honest... many have said things or felt things about others--ESPECIALLY when it comes to daughters...family--that they would not want the world to know. IT'S GETTING RIDICULOUS...with all this tattle-telling. 8 years ago? Concerning his daughter? ENOUGH ALREADY...  <br>what's a redguard?<br>and<br>are there nudes of his daughter?</br></br></br>  wrestling is fake  <br>redgaurd is a race of niggers from the elder scrolls series</br>  <br>Can't belive there isn't any nudes of this whore.</br>  <br>There are.<br><br>But do not want.<br><br>Also look at that funny lookin nigger on the left touching that white fags ass ~</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>jidf alert</br></br></br></br>  Any of you faggots know where I can watch the tape? Can't find it for shit. I wanna hear some racist slurs  <br>i want. where?</br>  <br>Fuckin lol'd</br>  <br>Youtube it O_O<br><br>Type in HOGAN RACIST or something.</br></br></br>  Black pepper don't give a fuck<br>White people are giving all the fucks<br>This is a smear campaign by gaeker to drag hulkster down with them when he bankrupts them over his sex tape.<br>Some anti gamergate sjw found the video.</br></br></br>    <br>Hogan is not a WWE employee. All wrestlers and other performers are independent contractors on short-term renewable contracts with the company, that can be just not renewed whenever the company or the performer decides. Hogan has been in and out of WWE (and also of TNA) a dozen times, usually on very short term (i.e. show up for the run up to Wrestlemania and then just disappear) contracts. He'll be back, or he'll show up on TNA again, whenever the company thinks he can sell tickets.</br>  <br>But i do. This is her making out with her kids childhood friend.</br>  <br><br>I don't get it either, the Hulkster was always hanging out with black people, I mean, dude, he rassled with them! What the heck, this is all just bullshit. And now they've even taken him out of the new WWE game. Fuck</br></br>  From what I can tell this has all come from left field. I watch the rebel flag being taken down because of what it represented. Wasn't the pyramids built by slaves? When are we going to take those down? Now back to HH. He clearly used words that are offensive. I this OK? NO! It is not OK. However, going up I listened to NWA..Enough said. Now the movie is coming out. I wonder if the writers will leave offensive language out of this movie? What about one of the best movies staring Denzel Washington? MY N!**@. Its OK to be pubic about it saying offensive things as long you're a rapper, in a movie or in 1994 doing a promo for WCW calling HH a N!**@ by Booker T. In short lets not all get our panties in a bunch just because HH had a private conversation 8 years ago that was leaked.

Loves to give hugs!<br>Family: Unknown, she doesn't seem to have any.<br>Friends: Emma doesn't really approach many others due to her shyness, so she doesn't seem to have many friends. The only ones that she really seems to be comfortable around currently are Cream and Cheese. Try and approach her, maybe she could be your best friend!<br>Enemy: Eggman<br>Abilities: Able to track down Chaos Emeralds from long distances away<br>Relationship Status: Single<br>Appearance: Up in that picture!<br>Accessories: An emerald shaped like a heart on her shirt and a white ear bow.<br>Bio: Emma was born with two differently colored eyes, and seemed to have no parents. She soon found that her green eye helped her track down Chaos Emeralds from long distances away. This skill usually helped her when she was being attacked. Many bad people who wanted to find Chaos Emeralds, including Eggman, tried to capture her to use her for finding the emeralds. This made her scared, and eventually she became so shy that she hid from most others, and usually never showed herself. One day, she saw a rabbit with a chao, that seemed to be her pet. Emma felt that she could trust this rabbit, and talked to them for a bit. Her name was Cream, and her chao was named Cheese. Emma became friends with her, but hasn't seen her other friends yet, since she is too shy.<br>That's about it. :3</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>plz explain</br>  Purge?  <br>kek</br>  <br>sorry forgot bio<br>Sonic OC Character Bio<br><br>Name: Nova<br><br>Genger: Male<br><br>Age: Unknown (Appearance looks to be 16-18)<br><br>Species: Hedgehog<br><br>Personality: More of a fight now ask questions later type of guy, He gets mad when he is annoyed or Frustrated.

He is also able to use the fire to cover up his body like armor from powerful attacks for example. When the fire covers up his body say somebody swings a blade into his shoulder, the blade will just go right through as his shoulder would just reconnect from the fire. Also able to<br>absorb fire or any kind of heat to make his fire attacks much stronger. He can use his fire to sink into his body making his blood pressure rush making a redish aura of steam come out from his skin, and once that has taken place his physical hits are stronger his power of fire is stronger and his able to run faster at extreme speeds. But his body is unable to keep up with this technique, so it puts a strain on his body and becomes worse if he over uses it.<br><br>Strength: 6/10<br><br>Defence: 4/10<br><br>Stamina: 10/10<br><br>Speed: 5/10<br><br>Will Power: 10/10<br><br>Skill: 5/10<br><br>Intelligence: 5/10<br><br><br>Allies: Renji the Dog, Shinji the Dog, Jeena the Hedgehog, Robin the Hawk, Nitro the Echidna, Sometimes with Fang the Wolf, Sometimes with Ace Striker Bounty Hunter Fox.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nanami-tan<br>Why do I know this</br></br>  http://www.randomwebsite.com/  <br>omfg thats amazing</br>  <br>That's a guy</br>  <br><br> Genger: Male <br><br>I don't know why but I kek'd</br></br></br></br>  <br>10/10 would purge</br>  <br>like a boss</br>  <br> http://www.randomwebsite.com/ <br>http://www.zombo.com/<br><br>ty anon</br></br></br></br>  <br>Needs more le</br>  <br>There was a porn thread my English professor was in in may, now my math professor is in THIS thread</br>  Figured since I had nothing better to do I'd upload my Sonic the Hedgehog OC Kei's bio.

She just said "Nothing, I'm fine" but I wasn't convinced.<br><br>Fucking women.</br></br></br>  <br><br> I'm done <br> I find a new job at a furniture store <br> Have enough money for a security deposit at an apartment <br> Move into apartment <br> A week later <br> Today <br> Haven't spoken to her since <br><br>My birthday is in a week, and it looks like I'm spending it alone. She knows I've spent every birthday since I was 10 alone.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Let her drop by the way-side man.<br><br>Complicated women aren't worth it. Damaged women are complicated, normal women are not.<br><br><br>Get some friends, go to a bar, or something. Spending mile-stones alone is shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Her name is Barbara<br><br>its never going to happen<br><br>im 1.61 meters<br>she is like 1.75<br><br>meh.. ill stick with fatties and ugly ones who wants to be with the love of their life anyway</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>My room-mates doing a chick 15cm taller than him, not impossible man.</br>  <br><br>Probably because her last impression of you was you being a fuckwit. Show her you're not like that all the time.</br></br>  <br><br>it just makes me feel so insecure, i cant ask her out, im fucked</br></br>  <br>Ask her out, you fuck-head. Don't have 'What if' hanging over you forever</br>  <br>fuck her. Damn it why couldn't she commit to you. That isn't fucking fair. How can she fuck you and introduce you to her family and all of that yet still kick you to second place? No matter what, that bitch doesn't deserve you. And it was really shitty for her to keep those fucking boots. You're a great man and would be a great boyfriend, anon. She's just an unappreciative bitch who wants it all and doesn't want to pick one or the other. Reconnect with your family and apologize if you can, they matter more.<br><br>Cut the bitch off for good though, she obviously doesn't appreciate you enough.</br></br></br>  <br>fucking deserved, should have cut it off when it was already a shitty thing dumbass.</br>  <br>I don't think she's an unstable girl at all, she's a really good and nice person, but I'm getting paranoid and don't want to lose her.<br><br>A friend of ours even told me some days ago that he'd never seen her in love this way, that when she mentioned me to him she had this look on her face he'd never seen before, and he's known her for years, and now I'm scared she's suddenly lost interest. Just like that.<br><br>She "happened" at the right moment, I was still trying to get over another girl and meeting / getting involved with her pretty much saved my life, and if this goes wrong now it's all going to fall back on me and I have no idea how I'm going to cope with the situation, I couldn't even make it through work today.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>My girlfriend is 2 and a half years older than me and has always been taller than me. Back in highschool, she was like 2-3 inches taller, maybe more. Now it's kinda a 1 inch difference. But fuck that noise, don't let that shit bother you. A girl who only picks guys taller than her is shady and materialistic and isn't worth your time anyways.</br>  <br>Stop worrying about it then, it'll either work out and be fine, or it'll not work out.<br><br>Panicking and seeming insecure and paranoid is unattractive and counter productive</br></br></br>  her names cuntfuck  <br>Righto here goes<br> be me, 18 <br> strayacunt <br> live in a town in a bigass valley <br> few other towns up and down the valley from us <br> winter break, 2 weeks off school <br> first weekend of the holidays, go to 18th in the next town over <br> fairly big party <br> people from towns up and down the valley there <br> most kids all know each other, towns are close like that <br> one girl from a town about half an hour away <br> don't know her, never talked to her <br> decide I'm going to try and get to know/hook up with her <br> we immediately click <br> likes all the same things as me, is really smart, attractive, the lot <br> we talk non-stop over the two week break <br> become super close, texting, messaging, snapchatting etc. all day every day <br> eventually both admit to liking each other <br> last weekend of the break <br> despite both being busy with year 12, homework etc, we set aside saturday for a date <br> in her town, whatever I don't mind I kind of know the town <br> meet her parents, they seem to like me <br> alpha handshake the shit out of her dad <br> spend 3-4 hours out for lunch and just wandering aimlessly around her town talking <br> having a genuinely awesome time <br> best I've felt, happiest I've been for a long time <br> go home  <br> on the phone to her later that night <br> she seems really distant, not interested in conversation <br> hang up, pissed at her <br> next day she won't talk to me at all <br> start getting a flood of negative thoughts, self doubt and all that <br> become really self-conscious and closed-in again <br> everyone can tell I'm different, something's off <br> send an assertive text, asking what I'd done wrong, why she's shitty with me <br> get huge speel back about how she's realized that school is too much of a priority for her, despite having said previously she was willing to try and make it work <br> crushed in every way possible <br> cry self to sleep <br><br>cont. if you /b/ros want</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>just cont ffs.</br></br>  <br>Cassie, she's my beautiful girlfriend.<br><br>That's it really. She's a weirdo, but she's a cute weirdo.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>youre right anons, i will try on that tall bitch</br></br></br>  <br> alpha handshake the shit out of her dad <br>kek, I've been there<br><br>but the whole "can't date because school is too much of a priority" bullshit doesn't make sense to me personally. Sure, college can be busy and hectic, and you may not have much time to see your significant other, but why should that affect a real, strong relationship? What if you only saw each other once a week on the weekend or something? That's enough for my girlfriend and I during our busy weeks. Guess some people have different needs.</br></br></br></br>  Maxine, she's my best friend and I want her so much that it kills me inside. Any advice /b/  <br><br>I think it's just as you said that people have different needs. I know I needed to see my partner more than once a week otherwise I got lonely and upset and when they had to move away for four months it nearly drove me insane.</br></br>  <br><br>Then tell her. Be ready for that shit to be awkward if she says no though but if you accept that it's gonna be weird then you'll be fine.</br></br>  Nick.  <br>This. It's worth telling her, but shit will get very awkward and you may stop talking if she doesn't return the feelings.</br>  <br><br><br><br> this was about 2 weeks ago <br> we still talk almost every day but nowhere near as much as we used to <br> not sure how to treat her any more <br><br>Yeah man, and I'm not even talking college, we're AU equivalent of seniors, and the work really isn't hectic enough that you can't find time for someone every other week.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Das gay mane<br><br>but really, why the feels, Sam? Nick's a cool dude.</br></br></br>  <br> highschool <br> too much work to keep a relationship going <br>yup, definitely bullshit. It's something else. Could just be that her grades started tanking and her parents forced her to end her relationship with you since her grades were getting bad. Or she just got in trouble some how. I don't think you did anything wrong, Anon. Give it time. She probably just got in trouble.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Thanks guys. I'll talk to her tommarow.</br></br>  I have no name to give, there was no "one" who got away because there was no one.  Feels threads are literally for the worst losers out there. Just one big self pity fest.  <br>Story?</br>  Kaite  <br><br>I know I've been in grade 12 too, she could be having pressure put on her by her parents to do better in school, I've had plenty of my friends cut their social lives whether small or large in half to study more.</br></br>  <br>Congratulationship on your perfect life</br>  Christine.<br>First ex. Ended it on a good note after 7 months of literally fucking nothing. Most intimate we ever got was maybe cuddling.<br>Towards the end of the relationship I had pretty good esteem and confidence. I mean she was fucking hot. But after the break up all that esteem and confidence left.<br><br>Still not sure if it was best to have loved and lost then to have ever loved at all.<br>Not sure where the future lies but maybe with the new semester coming up I'll have another chance at a relationship.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You're on /b/?</br></br>  <br><br>I am not sure if this is bait or just really pathetic...</br></br>  <br>That "better to have loved and lost" stuff is bullshit. Loneliness is a small price to pay not to be crushed for long periods of time.</br>  <br> cara <br>was planning on moving somewhere and started to talk to her more, made me cinnamon rolls from scratch before i moved</br></br>  <br>You don't need anyone to make you happy or worth anything. You can be that all on your own. <br>Having a person in your life only changes things for you and makes some things easier, and some things more difficult in its own way. The whole thing is a gamble that could end well or badly.<br><br>Love is when you decide that gamble is worth taking either way.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's what I keep thinking anon, which just leads to a bunch of self-hate and anger but whatever. I keep waiting to see that's she's in a relationship on facebook cause it's the only thing I can think of that would have made her end it.<br><br>You could well be right anon, but I'm not about to start interrogating her about her real motives. I could just give it another six months til school is over and see what happens then. <br><br>Also, would you /b/oys be interested in screenshots of the convo the night she ended it?</br></br></br></br></br>  /b/ what mmo are you playing?  <br>why is every mmorpgs so fucking childish cartoony or anime like? man i really wanna play a good mmo but they all look like they were made for weeabos or 13 year olds.<br><br>pic related: this what an mmo should look like<br><br>oh how, i wish funcom wouldnt have fucked the start up of aoc or at least that people would play this game. the combat system was one of the best ive ever seen in an mmorpg. and the brutality and gore was fucking beautiful every fight even against mobs was satisfying.<br><br>fuck, i really miss this game...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>So far I've very much enjoyed it and it's absolutely gorgeous. <br>So what is vindictus like then?</br></br></br>  <br>why is it spelled with a ph.<br><br>to be cool?</br></br></br>  You get one call, /b/. Who are you gonna call?  <br>Why is that phone hanging upside down?</br>    Call overlord moot to hug me<br> im lonely </br>  Sociopathy and Psychopathy are the next step in human advancement because humans are uncaring and feel the constant need to assert domination over each other.<br>Prove me wrong</br>  <br>how is sociopathy created? by a traumatic childhood experience?</br>  <br>They will never feel meaning in life. They can find something they think is what they're supposed to be DOING in life, but cheap thrills will get old after a while, and sociopaths tend to get burnt out as they get older.<br><br><br>Typically.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>And so do I.</br></br>  Okay /b/ who else has a fetish for exposing friends?<br><br>I don't know I have always had a fetish for seeing gfs of friends nude and stolen photos and things like that but I recently started developing a fetish for first aquiring nudes of a beloved person of a person close to me and expose this beloved person<br><br>Anyone of you experienced this?<br><br>Also, general stolen pics, sluts to expose thread</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice Trips</br>    <br>I go on omegle and stream pics and sometimes vids of ex's and current gf and get off to them turning guys on so much</br></blockquote>]
