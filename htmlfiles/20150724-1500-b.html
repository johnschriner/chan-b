There it was a cartoon show about mysteries, i think it was in fox kids. One of the caracters had 3D glases, and in the intro there it was ovnis and the Stonehenge. Does someone remember the name of the show?  Fucking awesome show.  im leaving for college in a month and already emotionally fragile and the first thread got me nostalgic as fuck  If you are a girl you watched this.  Anyone remember this show?  <br>Tits?</br>  <br>Man that show was awesome! The mix between traditional animation and cg was a fantastic idea.</br>  anyone ever watched the 18+ cartoons back then. there was some show where these guys go into a sex shop and its like a capsule and some detective trying to help them or some shit  <br>Martin Mystery was the shit</br>  <br>I feel like I do. What was it called?</br>  Best fucking show.  /thread  <br>not forgotten either</br>  <br>Ehhh that show had it's moments</br>    robot jones was the shit  <br><br> forgotten <br><br>Bitch this show is NOT forgotten.</br></br></br></br>  This show was pretty funny didn't last long though.  /thread  <br>Got some news for you /b/ro<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=kPn<wbr>i6B2d9QM</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Lol. Truly a forgotten cartoon.</br>  <br><br>Wasn't there an episode where he wanted to fuck the scantron machine or something.</br></br>  <br>Forgotten cartoons fuckwad. That show is legendary and technically canon in the DC universe.</br>  <br>nigga im a boy and i watched this</br>  <br>go back to high school faggot</br>  Bet no one has watched this show  <br>It was cute and had decent moments, not really funny though. It was just really comfy to watch late at night.</br>  <br>Reboot</br>  the show wasnt a cartoon but was a kids show. i remember watching it in grade school. The kids would be in their room and then through magic or something the would be wisked away to another world. I think there was a wizard and a magic stone or something. I can barly remember it but ive always been curious as to what it was bc we never actually finished it. If anyone some how could guess what the fuck im talking about it would be a miracle    <br><br>....As told by Ginger.<br><br>Girls a ginger.<br><br>Just got this.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>holy shit you win</br>  <br>Dragon tales?</br>    I remember this bastard in black and white on an old GE television. The bastards killed it off because he didn't wear pants.. <br> a cat that didn't wear pants <br> fucking pants <br> pnats! <br><br>It's the reason society is so fucked these days.</br></br></br></br></br>  I'm trying to remember this show where there was a squad of shaolin monks who all had their specialties. It was a cartoon on CN or Nick. I remember the main one being bald and kinda short and liking to play some kind of soccer game.  <br>...bitch i graduated last month but that was a lame joke nonetheless</br>    <br>ojrnevdijsnfewiadnwqinsienfiefb yes</br>    one more.  <br><br>Moville mysteries<br><br><br>The urban myisteries series are great<br><br>More cartoons with that ?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Does anyone remember the show where these guys raced futuristic cars that could turn into boats? I think one of the main characters drove a red car and a friend or something drove a green car.<br><br>This has been on my mind for multiple years and I still can't figure it out</br></br>  <br>LILLYMUUUUUUUUUU!!!!!<br><br><br>Fuckin' Corniel and Bernie</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I miss that one. Lots of laughs..<br><br>Saturday morning in front of the TV....<br>Just isn't the same anymore.</br></br></br></br></br>  SWAT KATZ!  <br>I loved this show. I miss that cheeky cunt of a narrator.</br>  <br>no as i was typing it it sounded like dragon tales. no it was live action. Fuck if it was even on tv. it looked like it might have been done in the 80's or early 90's.</br>  <br>At first I didn't like it<br><br>Then I liked it</br></br></br>  any of yall remember when verizon carried this channel, fueled 8 year old weeb me until i grew out of it  <br>that fucking colonel was always trying to get him i remember. The sheep was a character in the cartoon network racing game for the GBA</br>  untalkative bunny  No mention of Megas XLR??    Loved this show so much.  terrible show  <br>Shaolin Showdown</br>  <br>Best shit ever</br>  What was that nick show with the two purple aliens. One was short and round with a red hat and the other was tall and thin with a yellow hat  Ultimate muscle, friend won't shut the fuck up about and can still sing the theme song  Motha fuckin Pelswick!!!  <br>this show for example, anyone?</br>  <br>Xiaolin Showdown?</br>  <br> now realizing the big guy was nothing more than a weebs wet dream </br>  <br>To many soccer moms complained that the humor was too dark. Did you know that the voice of flap jack, (He's also the voice of Giddeon from gravity falls), is using his regular voice? He is a full grown 30 year old man and he has a voice distortion.</br>  <br>Holy fuck dude yes<br><br>JETX<br><br>I used to play on the website every weekend</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kaput and Zotsky?</br>  <br>I feel like I'm the only one that appreciated this show. I watched the shit out of this when I was a kid. I can't find it anywhere. If any of you anons know where to watch it please let me know.</br>  Anyone remember this gem?  <br>ULTIMATE MUSCLE ULTIMATE MUSCLE</br>  Greatest emperor of all time  <br>YES I just found it<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=fQT<wbr>PWAaLpjI</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>I figured that would happen, the last episode seemed like kind of a final fuck you.<br>I did not, I love his laugh though.</br></br>  <br>http://kisscartoon.me/</br>    <br>Jon's Quads was like the ultimate fu to my parents, 11 pm and the head on a board was giving the goth chick a tattoo on her back and shoving his head in her tits...<br><br>Rule34 paheal here I come</br></br></br>  <br>Mothefucking yes nigga, that episode with the giant rat was pretty fuck up for a kid show</br>  <br>agrreed google gknd</br>  <br>first season is really the only good one<br><br>i have on dvd<br><br>but it was awesome cuz the guy who did the crypt keepers voice in the live action did it on the cartoon as well</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes that was it.
