[ Didn't see this in a long time, lets go /b/ Rolling time! o/   Check em  Roll  Heil.  huh  FUCK you OP I am American and have many Jewish friends. Israel is our only ally in the middle east and they are a beacon of democracy surrounded by poor, angry, dumb barbarians. Israel and Jews in generals are smart white people and our greatest allies. GO FUCK YOURSELF NO ONE LIKES YOU FATTY.      come on hitler, we got a job for you   You are quite right. Don't forget Einstien invented the nuke which saved America from Japan. A JEW also cured polio which was hurting most Americans and almost took the country down. Jews also invented flash drives, internet and hamburgers. How anyone could not love Jews is not understandable.       Fried aussie buzzed ask me anything   Has anyone really been far as decided to use even go want to do look more like?

Don't get caught, don't get shot.    You'd do the same time whether it's that or a jewelry store, go big or go home   You'll be rich! $120 in coins and two packs of luckies. Go for it!  Don't.  Now before you go in that liquor store and try to get money out the drawer you'd better think about the consequence.   Stfu mom I'm 15 now I can do what I want    less time for robbing a bank and way more of a reward if git away  dont be a fag rob a bank      Get high first, then go in naked.   Kill yourself, nigger.  yeah. get a job. but if you can't, try and not shoot. i know this idiot nigger that tried to rob a gas station, got nervous and shot. everything exploded. now he looks like someone put a burnt pancake on his face.  Leave no survivors.  As I work at a gas station. Most of the time only the owners have the keys and codes to the safe. And in the register the you are not allowed to hold over $1000. That's just at my store. And most stores will have a silent alarm  Conviente store is better target then?   Eminem plz go    who are you?    I'm you're motherfucking conscience     Ive thought about it before.   go in a few days before you rob the place   make note if how the cashier opens the cash register    when you rob the place, wear clothes you're ready to ditch   plan where you're going to ditch them   bring a very different set of clothes to change into   ex; if you wear red shirt while robbing the place, change into a white shirt afterwards.    get the cashier by surprise   if the counter is too large to sucker punch him, throw something heavy at him   do it suddenly  Ex; glass bottles of drinks. Make it look like you're gonna buy them, but instead smash him with it.  if you're gonna sucker punch him, aim for his chin   most knockouts happen because of shots to the chin    if you have access to helium cartridges, breAthe one if before you rob the place.   wear a mask/balaclava   after you ditch your clothes, go back and help the guy   say you tried to chase the the if down but he was too fast   make a statement to the police if they ask you to                             That's nonsense! Go in and gaffle the money and run to one of your aunt's cribs And borrow a damn dress, and one of her blonde wigs Tell her you need a place to stay You'll be safe for days if you shave your legs with Renee's razor blade         How to get caught 101     But if it all goes through Like it supposed to The whole neighborhood knows you And they'll expose you        Id pickaxe through the ceiling  Make sure its not a 24/hour place       Yeah but if it all goes through like it's supposed to the whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you  Think about it before you walk in the door first. Look at the store clerk she's older then George Burns.       Fuck that! Do that shit! Shoot that bitch! Can you afford to blow this shit? Are you that rich? Why you give a fuck if she dies? Are you that bitch? Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids?        But who are you?    Man dont do it it's not worth it to risk it    You're right...    Look at this p ussy, he prob works at the shitstation and doesnt wanna be robbed   Spend a few months learning to pickpocket. If you get caught its just petty larceny, but its very difficult to prove. You basically have to try robbing an undercover, or youre caught on camera.   Rob a liquor store op     go back and help the guy   &gt;say you tried to chase the the if down but he was too fast   &gt;make a statement to the police if they ask you to   lol wut       good plan until the end where you go back and help   Rob a pharmacy instead. Money and drugs   Not over this shit    Tried to chase the theif down****    This. Public events are fun.    STOP!    Only if you can mask your voice during the robbery    Robbing gas stations is stupid. Try a bank or jewelry store.    Not over this shit Drop the biscuit     Rob a truck stop they have more money in them hit it at about 6 pm. Make sure its a flying j or a petro truck stop. I worked at a flying j and they usually had about 5k split between the registers. a gas station you might get 200 bucks.    /thread    Don't use a gun please.      returning to the scene almost immediately   admitting you're slow       Don't be a nigger. Bring as many guns as you can find.    After you ditch the clothes, it will take a few minutes, just like if you tried to chase the guy down    Don't be a fag and rob a bank    SNATCH AND RUN YALL   Yeah. Don't be a nigger and rob anything or anyone. Get a job and quit thinking you're entitled to something you're not.  1. Wear mask, hoodie over clothes. 2. Park a couple blocks away. 3. Bring a bag. 4. Rob store( use whatever weapon you want) 5. Put money in bag 6. Put mask and hoodie in bag 7. No one knows what you're wearing. Look like, or drive. 8. Enjoy your money          watch fight club and don't rob a gas station   make sure to scream into the mic.

Bailey Jay/ trap thread &lt;3   i find bailey jay attractive    jacking off to jewish men with fake boobs    she is beautiful   Why do servers get so pissy when they don't get tipped as much as they would like? Maybe they should get a real job instead of living off of the charity of others...expecting an automatic percentage of the money somebody chooses to spend is literally the epitome of entitlement and laziness - stop pretending like you have it so hard and that your job is the hardest job there is.Try being a garbage man or a miner or any dirty job, and then tell me that your job in an air conditioned restaurant is "really hard" and that you "work your ass off."  Fucking pig shit lazy fucks.    People can't be satisfied having a job, they want your money so they don't have to start a real career. They prefer opening beers or carrying food because hey, I can just live off of the guilt wrought by social expectation, right? Nigger shit   ok. but why do you care so much?     Because bitches complain about it instead of doing something with their lives.    Restaurants should be paying their servers. It's just a system that's designed to fuck everyone over  Because they do a job and don't even get minimum wage?  we dont stand for this shit in the uk. if you want to tip then tip..... if you dont want to then dont. the waiter/waitress gets paid regardless.     tfw you visit america for a holiday and get dirty looks from servers for not tipping. sorry, i come from a country with a livable minimum wage and don't consider tipping unless i get truly exceptional service.   A job they were forced into doing right?    here here     Doesn't mean the consumer should be paying their wages while the restaurant is wringing them for tipped minimum wage. I pay the fucking establishment not the person who happens to be serving me.     OP is a dick...but he ain't wrong   Servers decide that the world owes them something because they can't get into a career   Any job that receives tips is guaranteed the federal minimum wage. If an employee's tips + pay do not meet or exceed minimum wage, the employer must make up the difference.  In some states the laws are more generous. Here in California all employers have to pay the minimum wage of $9 per hour, not including tips.     I only ever tip the chef, not those fucking monkeys that carry the plates.  i wonder... Sometimes at Mcdonalds or burger king... your shit isnt ready at the time - so they bring it to your table Do you tip them if they do? Cus i dont    mr pink sums it up    Some states can pay their servers tipped minimum wage - in Florida for example, the employees are paid like $4.02 an hour plus tips. And I still don't give a fuck about tipping, if you are going to work a job making such shitty money and literally rely upon whoever you happen to serve for your wages, and you won't get a job that actually pays minimum wage, well nigger you are a nigger    I'd rather get tips than a 10/hr wage. You get more money from tips. Sucks that people are so fucking cheap especially niggers and smelly foreigners.   At least now we know who phone is    because there bosses are cheating them by implementing a tip sharing system and they're to stupid to realize they're being ripped off     That scene was put in there to show how much of an asshole Pink was.    It's a really fucked up concept. A tip is something you should only give for really good service as an extra. Not some mandatory hurr durr you must pay 10% more than the prices on the menu.   At least one other fucking person knows this goddamn law. So many fucking whiners out there that say ohh tip wages are only 2.50 an hour. Bullshit.    Wrong answer. It is federally mandated they get paid at least minimum wage if they don't make tips.     In either case the servers still need wipe way the crocodile tears and understand that they, and no one else, would ever tip...   the mechanic    the garbage man   the doctor   any emergency service or mission-essential workers   grocery store baggers (the Southern grocery store chain Publix, for example, makes the baggers wear a big pin that explicitly states: PLEASE DO NOT TIP ME. And yet Publix makes these employees offer to walk you and your shit to your car and carry the groceries as well, STILL NOT ALLOWING THEM TO TAKE A TIP. Nigger shit)   Last but not least, they don't tip teachers. And that shit aint right.            Here in Australia, tipping is for faggets  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=q_v<wbr>ivC7c_1k</wbr>  [ ]   Fuck em. I never tip. Why the fuck should I tip. I work in a parts store and I install batteries for free as well and read engine codes. I never tell them what's wrong cause They ain't gonna pay me. Fuck em. I shouldn't even install batteries or read codes. That's what a mechanic does. I am a mechanic but Not when I'm working at the parts store.   What always bothers me about this is how overpriced most restaurant food is, yet they don't want to pay the people that work there. A burger and 6 onion rings DOESNT FUCKING COST $12. That's huge profit and yet I'm expected to pick up the slack on the dumb bitches paycheck that brought it to me.    bitches complain about it   Funny, I see so many threads bitching about tipping but hardly any from servers complaining about not getting enough tips.      couldnt have said it better ..     OP what's it like being black?     You were told you had to do that shit before you started, so it's part of your job you knob, of course you should have to do it.     Man its all over the internet, but forget about people complaining on the internet - ask any bartender or server about a bad tip. Just literally say the words "bad tips?" and watch the tirade begin. It's like they rehearsed the rant or some shit.     Even if I were black, I would be less of a nigger than the servers who whine about tipping.         Implying young women get on 4chan to complain about shit    I did not sign a contract for "free labor". In my book it's labor. I charge per hour. I'm a mechanic not some dumb fuck that's a parts monkey. Even though I've been reduced to working with them. Also people feel entitled that I should fix their fucking car/truck for them. fuck that. Fix it your goddamn self or take it to a mechanic you dumb fuck.   ..  Dont tip anyone.. They get their salary.. I dont beg for extra money too, if i get some, thats just awesome.. But never expected..     And btw I actually tell customers I'm not going to tell them what's wrong. I've had so many complaints but fuck em. I don't tell people how to fix anything. My tricks my money making.     This is what bothers me. At a place like Autozone the employees can be asked to do a lot of shit, and they have to do it. I've seen girls in there asking the guys to install their windshield wipers. Fucking wipers! And did she tip the guy after? Not in ten thousand years - she just said thank you and drove away. Same with the code reading/battery installs.   And how about people who do oil changes/other basic shit like replacing belts and air filters or fluids? Don't see anyone tipping them! It's fucked up man they deserve the money more than someone who doesn't even have a career. One person makes my vehicle work (aka gives me the ability to live in society) and the other brings me the food I'd be happy to go grab myself.       Youre not obligated to tip but you are obligated to pay your bill in full, not doing so is theft.     Half of it was comped by the establishment because the service was god awful.   And yet servers would still say "well if you had bad service you should still pay X amount... probably wasn't the servers fault anyway"  The excuses these people will make are downright hilarious.         Wow, and the guys at Autozone are only paid $2.13 an hour?    Faggot ass autozone wanna be mechanic detected.    I started working in a dealership once as a "lubetech" or as I like to call it shop bitch. I quit after 3 weeks and calling injury claim because a lift fucking fell on my foot because the lock didn't engage. I lived quite comfortably for 8 months while my broken ankle healed. I got paid to sit around and get drunk all day. Now I'm stuck working at a parts store. Ohh well. My side jobs make me in excess of 20k per year so I can't bitch to much. Gotta have that one job for tax purposes.    You can discuss adjusting the ammount with the establishment but failure to pay the ammount billed in full is theft and you can be prosecuted for it.   ..    I don't think you understand - your shitty wages are not my problem. Take it up with your employer. If you are willing to get fist raped by tipped minimum wage and still demand that the consumer make up the difference instead of the employer, your problem isn't bad tippers at all. Your problem is you - you are willing to sell your labor and time on the premise that the people you serve will be generous and buy into the greed of your employer in the same way that you do. You need to work on yourself and make career goals - but of course you enjoy the money too much to do that, you'd prefer opening beers or moving plates to actually contributing to society.     let's say that the entire $1,453.93 meal only took the server one trip back to the kitchen to get  let's say another meal costs $145.39, but it took the server three trips to bring out the entire order.  how much should the server be tipped in each instance?        It is federal law that servers are to be paid up to minimum wage if they do not make up the rest in tips. It's the fucking law. Research it. And minimum wage for changing batteries and shit for people is bullshit. every battery change is .25 hours seeing as I've done in excess of 20 this last week and I charge 25 per hour of labor which is really cheap that would be 125 dollars plus diagnostics which is a 1 hour minimum even if I don't diagnose the problem I've done that over times so that's 375 I've lost out on and another 30 times refilling a/c systems for free that's .5 hours per so another 375 in labor alone. Yeah. I'm missing out on a lot of money.     $1,453.93 meal only took the server one trip back to the kitchen to get  Not a chance      If I drop 1500 bucks on a meal I definitely won't want to drop extra cash on some douche who is greedily and eagerly expecting a big tip because I chose to drop 1500 dollars. Not only that, but 1500 is a lot of money - why is there an automatic expectation that I will spend even more when it is my money to spend in the first place?  Servers bitching about tips are literally literally saying "if you will send X amount you need to spend Y amount!" Sorry slut but I will spend my money as I see fit, your presence in my life does not constitute some obligation on my part. Someone paid that establishment 1500 dollars, if they can't pay you better than tipped minimum wage and you are shitting bricks because they did not spend MORE of their money then you are worse than the fucks living off of public assistance.       when it's time to pay the bill simply ask the server how much tip you should give to avoid them complaining about you on twitter.      Also, why are the servers expecting a tip? They didnt do shit on your food anyway.. They just picked up the plate and delivered it to your table.. They shouldnt get shit ..       I would be more than happy to go get my own food from the cook and refill my own cup. That sounds like a buffet but I'm talking anywhere, I'd go grab my order at Chillis too. I don't get why servers pretend like they are doing such a hard job. The first words out of their mouth "I bust my ass, I waited on you, I served you, bitch bitch bitch bitch"  How about the correctional officer who keeps the rapist behind bars and doesn't let him rape your greedy anus? Or the sewage worker who makes it possible for you to deposit the treasures of that same greedy anus somewhere other than your sink?       exactly ..   to my luck, i dont live in a country like those.. We tip here, yes, but its on our premises, and we do it, if we feel treated well and special taken care of.. not just for letting someone grab my plate..     I used to work in a lumber yard and i would often have to load up a ton or more of concrete or 6x6 into a cusomer's truck. It is not customary to tip a Shipper/reciever but i guarantee they work a hell of a lot harder when it comes to serving customers. Why the hell should i have to tip someone for bringing out a damn plate of food?    &gt;tfw you visit america for a holiday and get dirty looks from servers for not tipping. sorry, i come from a country with a livable minimum wage and don't consider tipping unless i get truly exceptional service.   Hey nigger your country ever been to the moon? Didn't think.      Ahh yes the days of working in a jail. Fuck that job. Too much red tape about inmate rights and not enough pay. 9 dollars an hour to be lock in a cell block for 12-16 hours a day is not worth it. Especially with killers. Even a small 400 man facility is hell to work in. I've done some part time at state level. Yeah fuck that noise.   I think its kind of fucked that companies like Boston pizza take a percentage of the tips to cover various losses and they withhold the tips as they see fit as some stupid punishment/reward system. If im paying a tip on a 30 dollar lunch, why should the company get tipped?     Where did you work that you only got $9? I have a cousin who worked at a state prison here in socal and was getting a lot more than that. Hell, my aunt worked at an ICE processing facility locally as part of a security company making $30 an hour.     yeah I'm (hopefully) going to be working in a county jail, if I'm hired I'll be making $16 an hour plus overtime. And it isn't even run by the sherrifs office, it is standalone.    yfw when I average $14/hr as a server, tipping is awesome.    nigger detected    I don't tip either. Last time was some FOB Korean chased after me in the parking lot asking for tip. I told the gook nope, not my job to pay her. Same goes with other waitress wtf should I tip you for taking two steps to bring my food you dumb cunt. Oh and raid on http://ifyoucantaffordtotip.com/i-d<wbr>ont-tip/</wbr>   Why should i give someone money on the premise that theyre underpayed when as sad as it is, they make more than i do....  You guys servers donot get paid a regular wage !!!!!!! They pay taxes on the bills they receive !!!! They literally only get paid of the tip you leave them!!!     I never give tips in jars that are labeled "Tips" or "tips appreciated"   I also never give tips at a buffet *UNLESS* someone makes sure my drink never goes empty. Then i'll give a buck or two.   I also never tip if I'm paying someone at a counter who just made me my food (like coffee shops, they're horrible about this). Fuck you I haven't tried it yet. Maybe I'll give something later.    I *DO*, however, tip my favorite bartender really really really well. As a result, I never have to ask for a beer when I arrive, I always get a new beer when I'm low, even ahead of other customer's at the bar. Plus she flirts with me.          The restaurant service industry is shaddy they don't pay their servers directly !!!! The serves only receive their wage of of the tips, and most of them aren't lazy ,ask around and most of them have masters or bachelors :/ bad economy :/  I HOPE YOU GUYS REALIZE THAT SERVERS MAKE THE WAGE ON JUST TIPS !!restaurants don't pay servers a wage!!!!!!!!! Servers get takes on the food bills so if they get a 200 hundred dollar bill for the table they served they have to declare 200 so if you leave 2 dollars that's the wage they get for serving Please TIP ,California sever !!! Here  See, y'all doint it wrong. I tip decent, and get a reputation for tipping well. My glass is never empty, trash doesn't stay on the table long, it's nice really. That and they are nice to me, which, let's be honest, is worth the money.  Also I tip more if she's hot. Just sayin'      write thank you on business card   leave it by the take a penny at my sandwich shop   put dollar of my own money in   people feel inclined to leave some money   adv $30 a night and a shit tone of change   I keep change and split the cash with my closer   I make like an extra $4 an hour doing this              Here in my country, servers get a wage, and tips are a bonus  Step the fuck up Americunts     so basically, as long as you are at job, you're making a mechanic hourly wage while screwing battery srews like a monkey?  seems like its the company that is loosing money by having an engineer doing mindless labour    what are you crying about?         Be American   Be such a broke piece of shit that you can go out to eat but you can't afford to tip the people serving you   Just stay home. Be poor somewhere else. Stop fucking shit up for the rest of us please.     I tip 10% most of the time, if it's great service I'll tip 18%. Was at a bar a few days ago ordering food and drinks and the bar tender was complete shit. She acted like I was bothering her the whole time. Then a two guys walk in who know her personally and they start laughing and chatting it up about mutual people they know. The rest of the time I was in there I had to wave her down to get another beer and she looked pissed every time I did because she had to stop talking to her friends for a min. I tipped her 5%.   Oh no, we can definitely afford it, it's just that we don't like tipping asshole servers.    What a pathetic reply. Have you ever been to the moon? Piggybacking on the success of other's just like a waiter trying to take what should be the chef's tips.    Tipping is awesome only when you're not a prude cunt about the few and far between that don't bend over for the ass-backwards restaurant subsidization.  Sounds like you do a good job anon, keep it up.     Yes there are crap servers ,but realize that most restaurants skimp on the amount of servers they have ,restaurants are a shaddy business models, so you could have a good server but the restaurant gives them 12 tables?? That's impossible to do a good job and get tipped decent you get diminishing returns if you serve more than 20 people at a time :/   Kek I got a bad tip to great tip sort for you faggots   be me dominos delivery boy   goes to a hous that's already payed for there pizza   highschool kids answer the door and gives me cash and wants exact change back    "keep the change anon" and closes the door    the fuck? There is no change to keep   realize the orders already been payed for   mfw I just scored a free 40$           Jokes on you, she still took your money and can continue to give you shit service knowing you'll still pay up.   I'm Asian and I never tip. Fuck you high school dropouts you ain't taking a cent from me   Pizza tipping is another story, if u ever do deliver pizza don't do the ghetto side of town try the ritzy areas they tend to tip less often but when you get tipped you'll get like like a fifty or a Hondo sometimes     your country ever been to the moon?     amerifats have not been to moon in 50 years.    amerifats could not go back if they wanted    amerifats asstronauts begging rides into space from Mother Russia   kek          Phuck you you Asian prick phuck your cutthroat culture you savages and you cheap phucks!!!!    Lol the rich people and full blown Mexicans never tip and the ghetto peeps surprisingly tip way better than the rich fags and give me free BBQ at times    http://www.dol.gov/elaws/faq/esa/fl<wbr>sa/002.htm  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Z-q<wbr>V9wVGb38</wbr>  [ ]  </wbr>    Fuck you fat Americans how about not eating so much so the servers do less work    Yes there are also exceptions Mexicans people from Mexico City are rich cunts that don't tip they consider themselves more European ie (they have their heads up their butts) so they don't tip then again it happens with most rich people but not all ;/   I only tip you waiterfags if:  1. You take my drink order within 60 seconds of me sitting down 2. My drink is never empty 3. You take my food order within 5 minutes of taking my drink order 4. My table is never dirty 5. Comped items such as chips and dip is never empty 6. You immediately fix any problems with my meal 7. You check on me to see if I need anything else throughout my meal  Otherwise you're not doing your job and you don't deserve shit. LOL at these fags saying "They did a shitty job so I only gave them 5%" You get fuck all from me if you don't do your job.  Tipping has gotten out of hand in this country, I saw a fucking tip jar at a sub shop the other day. All they do is make your fucking sandwich which they have to do if they want you to spend money there.   The dumb cunt behind the counter had the audacity to say "no tip?" I said "What the fuck for?" she said "quality service" I said "You mean making my fucking food? For doing your job?"  I don't fucking get tips for doing what I'm paid for.                  I have worked in the restaurant business for 20 years mostly chef/line cook and I have never seen a bunch of cheap fucks crying over tipping like this. Just cook at home don't you know I have to deal with the waitstaff.   This is only for some states some states choose not do this for example California doesn't do this but Arizona does , however the outomatic gratuity for parties over 5 people is no more unfortunately due to the us federal government law     tfw when you visit another country and don't follow their customs because that's not how you do it in your country.  mfw I visit your country and do the same thing and you call me an ignorant disrespectful fucking wanker  mfw I have no face FUCK YOU FAGGOT         Lies     If you want a "livable wage" then get a real career. Being a server/waiter or wtfe is a starter job, not a life-long career.     Like I said the restaurant business is shaddy some servers are not just serving you!!! They probably have cut staff and are serving you and twenty other people,seconds servers don't clean tables bussers do    You shouldn't be allowed in public, faggot.   why are the waiters on /b so easy to troll?   When I go to france, I try to speak french and act in accordance to french customs.  Come to our country, don't act uncivilized bitch.       servers are beggars. They want strangers to give them money because they're entitled little shits.     There's a restaurant for people like you who don't want to tip. It's called McDonalds. You can disagree with tipping all you want but the second you enter a restaurant with servers that live off tipped wages you have agreed to be part of that system and as such you tip accordingly. If not, fuck off and go somewhere else. It's that simple.   I always tip and i never had a problem with it. how poor are are you basement dwellers? i can't believe people have a problem with this. if we didn't tip the food would be more expensive anyway.    While I understand some of the points you have made, you are 12 years old so I'm calling you a faggot and ignoring any intelligence you think you have.     Okay yes you do have a point for sandwich place they get a hourly wage doesn't matter on how much the people order but for sit in restaurants its different Not lies bro ,I'm not pulling this outbid thin air ,restaurants are not like regular businesses!!!!!they are shaddy     Why? Because he told a fast food bitch fuck off on your tip? Those tip jars are a joke. Especially at drive thru shacks. They're only filled with money by the boss to make it look like others do it.   Working as a chef here in germany we get drinking money. If the service is great, customers can decide to tip but are not asked to or forced to. Every week the money is split equally between me and the waiters. That way we can go out drinking every week without touching our bank accounts.  Also remember that the reduced wage of waitstaff allows for cheap meal cost. Imagine going to eat at middle of line restaurant 2-3 star which you used to pay 15-20 a platter now you're paying 25-30 a platter so in the overall it is much cheaper on the customer to tip waitstaff   that might be true, in my situation it was only 1pm and there were only 8 people there and all were sitting at the bar...she was just shit    Most of them have masters and bachelors its this economy man in the U.S.    respect the customs of the country you are visiting you disgusting europoor.   I would rather eat a seven dollar lunch and leave a five dollar tip than eat a twelve dollar lunch and stiff the waiter.  If you're not making more than the waiter when you eat out, it's time for you to downscale.     And then guess what? Because you were an entitled selfish bigger Jew, they get fired because if they can't get tips then apparently they are doing something wrong. Go eat somewhere self serve if you don't like paying for the service. No, I don't work it, I'm just not an entitled fedora wearing faglord     THE most retarded system in the whole galaxy.    They army entitled ,the wage is your tip!!!! They don't get an hourly!!!! They get taxed on your two hundred dollar tab , so don't leave a small tip that's what they take home    ^This^    Good server, bad server.  Carry plate   Skills       Yeah. The way I see it. If I don't tip at all it shows no class, I consider it a tacky thing to do. She might be shit but that doesn't mean I have to act classless along with her.   Once I had a bar tender serve me a drink and I asked him if he wanted to hear a joke. He said no and walked away. I thought he was joking around with me because he walked right back. So I said, 'ok ready to hear this?'. He said 'apparently you don't know what no means', I realized he wasn't joking and was going out of his way to be shitty to me. I payed for the drink without taking a sip and left. I showed class in the face of shittyness.   Getting shitty because someone else is....that's kind of a nigger thing. They always loose face when someone gives them a hard time.        Then take your sorry ass somewhere else that doesn't include such services. Self absorbed, shill grubbing nigger jew   I am 18 and deliver pizza for the summer. I get paid $9.00/h in Canada and have to pay for gas to get to your house, I'm not just opening or pouring a drink and walking a couple feet. I damn well expect a tip, otherwise there would be a set $5.00 delivery fee on all orders. You fuckers that tip $1 when I drive 15 minutes to your $800,000 home on the water.   If an employee's tips combined with the employer's direct wages of at least $2.13 an hour do not equal the federal minimum hourly wage, the employer must make up the difference. Some states have minimum wage laws specific to tipped employees.  Read the fucking laws first idiot.      funny, in my state, the restaurant businesses even tax our tips out of our paycheck    No that's wrong , restaurant have a special tittle special business they don't have to!!!! And that's what most people don't realize!!!!! This servers don't get paid well unless if tips are good    can we talk about companies penalizing employees for accepting tips? I'd fucking be able to eat thee meals a day if I could   all you cheap pasty fucks: answer to this?  are you not cowards?      expect things at 18   especially a shit delivery job  get used to getting your shit kicked in kid until you grow up and acquire a skill that doesn't rely on the charity of others to house yourself.      Veal Chop Siciliano - $45.00 Brunello Montalcino - Poggio alle Mura 1967 - $1500 a bottle  One trip to the kitchen, servers BTFO       come in see money in take money tray, take the money,    Phuck you I've have serve in California don't fkn tell me what I earned, you fkn learn    and after you say this, the employee...goes back to the job he has to do...the food still has to be cooked to establishment standards...you are pushing water against the tide...     2015   taking advice from necbbeard who lives with mom at 40  MFW  Do you not know what a summer job is?        I don't have to because tips are a luxury in my country. It is not looked down upon if you tip, rather if you do tip the ones receiving it might get offended because they think you pity them.     mfw   no face pic  Fucking retarded newfag. Kill yourself.       nice, classy move. too bad ur a causal racist.     Too bad you're a fucking retarded normie. Get the fuck out of /b/ autistic shitlord.    Land of the free   Employ slave labour     Not the case in the USA     ugh, what an idiot   tipping them for shitty service won't enable them   to continue doing a shitty job  Look, bud, I've worked in these kind of places before. The shitty servers who sit on their ass and bitch about customers always get fired. The ones who actually work their ass off and be attentive to their tables, just become alcoholics. That;s life anon.       It's not tipping, it's poisoning insurance. It's all good and well to have your views on the injustice of the gratuity system. but when you come back and I remember you and add some extra ingredients that ruin the rest of your day, you're fucked. Maybe I get caught, maybe I get arrested, maybe I get sued, but you definitly got poisoned.   this. i'm still saving for college    my guilt does not justify your claim to support a broken system. Tipping has been socially implemented to justify exploitation. The rules you live by does not affect me to get a fucking burger sheep.     This is the case. Like it or not, in the USA this is the system set up in the restaurant industry and if you are not a selfish cheap bitch you'll play along. Non-tippers are receiving lower prices for their meals while regular tippers are picking up their slack. They're no better than welfare niggers.      From the way that message was bungled, I'm guessing you're a server. That also explains why you can't get a better job. Maybe take some language classes down at the learning center and become literate.       First of all if you can spent 1500 on a bottle ,you should tip just not to be a pompous douche    True that man    I'm really tired of this old bullshit lie.  Yes, servers can be paid below minimum wage with the expectation that they will make up the difference in tips. However, if a server makes no tips, the restaurant is legally required to pay them the difference. EVERY server is getting at least minimum wage no matter how many tips they get. If they aren't, the restaurant is breaking the law and they're spineless bitches for not speaking up.  I'm not going to say I don't tip at the start of the meal because most likely I'll get some entitled piece of shit spitting in my food for asking him or her to do their job without me supplementing their income.        Lmao, this  Guess I'll just come to your country and carry my weapons on me  Why the fuck would you come here on holiday if you were just going to act like you were back home all the time  Eurotrash detected          Waiting tables in the States doesn't get paid minimum wage. You shouldn't feel obligated to tip for shitty service, but for the ones doing it properly it's a much harder job than it looks. You have 20 people asking for different shit at any given time, and it's a hassle remembering everything and getting it to them quickly. You should be tipping 10% minimum for adequate service, and if you're being a demanding prick it should be closer to 20%.    this    It's because they make 2$ an hour you stupid fuck op is a major league faggot    Canadafag here. Sorry Euros, but if you go to the USA, just add 20% and leave it for your waitress/bartender. That's the way it works there. Otherwise you'll get treated like shit.   depends on the level of service. i go someplace "fancy" and get like one/two things with a high price point im dont think that is deserving of a large tip.   then tip the good waiters. If you get great service and you feel as though they deserve a tip then tip. If they were shit either tip them shitty or don't tip at all    Don't be stupid ,got banned for language ,second i go to Ucla for chem engineering so I'm not in serving cause I'm a lazy douche    And even if the staff in question is doing everything right, you think the fucking shill grubbing restaurant is gonna keep them around if they constantly have to bridge that gap? No they're gonna throw that poor fuck out and find a new worker.   Like any of you cucks leave the basement.   You may want to believe this happens but you obviously never worked in the industry for an extended period there is a lot of shady underhanded dealings in the business that employees get fucked by.    http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=b3c_<wbr>1435119168 this was the event that made me decide I was racist. </wbr>     I don't even give a shit about the servers or their wages. What pisses me off is having to subsidize your meal because you are receiving a lower price due to the tipping system.     we can't have a bunch of retarded customers clogging up the already cramped kitchen and bothering the cooks. as a line cook that would be a fucking nightmare.    Wtf am I even reading. Is this the standard for college now? Fuck me.   Used to wait tables in college, I don't give a fuck if you tip or not. But make sure you only do that once in any particular place, we knew who you faggots were and adjusted our service accordingly.    Not some mandatory hurr durr you must pay 10% more than the prices on the menu.   10%  poorfag/eurofag detected      There's a difference between breaking laws and ignoring social norms. There's a difference between vacationing somewhere temporarily and immigrating there. People who are on vacation aren't expected to change their cultural identity     why don't you just tip a few bucks you kike. its really not that big of a deal. can you not spare 5 dollars for a tip?    Except both those proffesions usually get paid extremely well...    Agreed    Faggot.    What was the joke?    this sometimes people tip you 50% sometimes they tip you 0% it almost always averages out in your favor  at the end of the day, you make dank Ca$h  unless you're a rude ass-bitch, in which case people dont tip you          They expect great tips because of assholes like OP who treat them like niggers when they are in their establishment.   but it really isn't the food is still expensive as shit    you don't have to change your cultural identity to leave a tip you poverty stricken nigger.    That's not how it works in california they are not making minimum wage ,your taxes are based on the minimum wage and the amount guests spend!! ,the government implemented a system where they are trying to to tax wages but serving is difficult a cause of the bs restaurants so basically it's their way of offsetting taxes but you only walk away with what you get tipped ,so it's a special IRS thing they implemented    A lousy faggot and a pussy. You realize that if the worker in question is always having the restaurant bridge the gap in pay, they'll just get the axe. Man up or go somewhere self serve. They don't have that shit you want? Fucking learn to cook it you lazy fuck    It's a third world country thing, civilized countries actually pay waiters a decent wage    Ummm....I'm a guy and I ask them to install my new wiper blades. Why the fuck would I do it?   WTF America????? Aren't you the leaders of the free world?    Why can't you just not get pissy because you agreed to a shitty "tipped" wage, you must've signed a contract. I pay for the food and service. I don't pay extra because you need the money.     you fucking idiot. They applied for a job where they get paid a wage, they agreed to the terms of their contract and agreed to their wage. Now they cry afterwards because the contract and salary they agreed to suddenly arent good enough.    Fucking WAAAAAH, GIB MONIE MEANIES WAAAAH       I agree with this penny pinching kike.   Because the fuckwit making $10/hr standing behind the register isn't actually qualified to touch your car.    thats what we want you to think    Noooo... you care because you have to pay an extra $3 on your bill and you're a fucking jew.   1. Waiter jobs are harder than any "real" job I've ever had.  2. With decent tips you do not make a decent living being a waiter.        I tip when there is exceptional service not because faggot America says I should.    inb4 hurr durr Euro trash      I tuck a 5$ under my chin and look retarded and say 'what's this?'.....Christopher reves in a strip joint     WAAAAAAH! I'm too poor everyone else has to give me some of their money because I'm poooooor! WAAAAAH!     The tipping system in the USA is designed to allow lower prices on the menu in exchange for paying some of the price to the server based on their service quality. If tipping were abolished, the menu prices would rise and you would still be paying the same amount in the end. What non-tippers don't understand is that they are literally having their meal subsidized by other people by taking advantage of the lower price without paying the expected amount. It's no different from taking advantage of taxpayers money by receiving welfare.   Pretty much, waiting tables was the best paying job I ever had. Unfortunately it's unpredictable as fuck, it's definitely not a steady pay check. You're completely at the mercy of who's sitting in your section and how much they're ordering.    nigger detected. Go back to school and learn how to write properly you dumb ape.    Dude you don't give any sort of tip to your trash collector? I'm in fucking college living on ramen and I still manage. What kinda asshole are you.    Lots of people work as servers to put themselves through college.  I presume you don't know what that's like because you went to college on daddy's credit card and you think graduating was an accomplishment.  It's not. Anyone can graduate if they don't have other preoccupations. I've had to work at a restaurant while doing an intensive major and it was hell. People like you who think you earned shit and that restaurant workers are dropouts are pretty much the closest thing to welfare queens an employed person can be.       ITT 4chan is the guy who doesn't tip leave it to 4chan to not just stiff a server, but find a way to do it on philosophical grounds     harder than any 'real' job ive had    never done construction   never worked in the fucking kitchen   never worked in the dish pit   Nigger like really being a waiter consists of remembering a few things and walking            Problem is that yes there are people out there who are servers who could be doing better with their lives. There are also people, waiters and waitresses, who depend on their tips to support their family. You don't know everybodys story of whom serves you. A lot of college students also take up this job while going to college to in fact better themselves. There are some single mothers/fathers who take this job as well and depend on those tips for their children.   Some people do this job because it pays them well enough to make a decent life for themselves when they have no other choice. Or it at least allows them to make a good amount of money so they can plan for a better future. Not everybody who goes into that job stays there for life.      I do tip good waiters, if they are shit waiters i don't tip them at all, but those who are shitty still complain when they don't get tips.    Completely depends on where you work, really. You're probably not going to make too much working in a place like Applebee's., but if you can land a job at a decent steakhouse you can make bank. Getting a group of guys ordering beer and steaks can land you a pretty generous tip. The best though were middle-aged white women, I'm not a super attractive guy but they were horny and great tippers.     never worked in the fucking kitchen   never worked in the dish pit  Hahaha. I've done both. I don't consider these "real" jobs any more than being a waiter.     B-but muh chefs should get tips  Chefs in most successful sit-down restaurants (chili's, friday's, applebee's, red robin) only heat the food or slap a bun on it. They are not chefs. They are microwave engineers. They are still paid in excess of like $12/hr. They do not deserve tips.    Blah blah blah SERVERS SHOULD GET A CAREER, blah blah blah NIGGERS  Serving has a flexible schedule, ergo one of the best jobs to go to college alongside. All of my other college friends are basically forced into serving.  I don't know how poor you guys are to be hurting doling out a fucking tip. I don't tip (well) when it's just some chick who thinks she can flirt her way into my money and never refill my iced tea (enter hooters, twin peaks, tilted kilt), but if it's some college-aged brokedick, I know they have more at stake than some daddy's girl tittymonster. But if that same tittymonster keeps a smile on her face as she goes back to the fountain twelve times to support my outrageous addiction to iced tea and knows not to ask me if I "SAVED ROOM FOR DESSERT" and subsequently asks me if I'm sure, damn right I'll pay for that class.        It's never a surprise when you don't get tipped. Every server knows who the non-tippers are. If the hostess seats nigs and foreign faggots in your section all day you aren't making money. Man up servers, kiss the hostess's ass like you're supposed to    So much this. like it or not, the system is what it is and if you don't follow it you're just getting free handouts.     no job is easy. thats why its fucking called a job. i dont care about tips and whatnot but you still need to shut the fuck up OP.    ITT: Amerifats tears   Kek bro  College is not what it once was. The stupidest fucking girl I know has a degree in teaching from CSU. She gave me shit for not having a high school diploma one time, even though I started out scooping dogshit and now make 3 times as much as she does as a network engineer. The bitch is an English major and can barely form complete thoughts, and mispells words like "definitely."  I tore her apart after that and called her out for her stupidity, and then her feminist friends united on social media to bash me. Not that I gave a fuck but still -  That's the world we live in, Anon. Your worth as a person isn't judged by your intelligence or your hard work; it's judged by how much money you can throw at the broken education system.           maybe you should stop going to restaurants the premise of which is that the waitresses have big tits and are stupid you gross shitstain     I forgot to add that niggers really are the worst, no hyperbole involved. Even the ones who were dressed well and polite tipped 10% at most. I had an old black guy ONCE who tipped well, and that was it.    Well it's also dealing with shitty entitled people on a semi regular basis. Also batshit insane people as well. Do you imagine that every customer is wonderful and a complete joy to work with/serve? Multiply that times three or five tables of 3 to 12 customers a piece.    top. fuckin. kek.  Being a waiter is only about knowing how to carry a tray and walking around. Stop being an entitled kid. If you don't make a living, then go do something else, and stop moaning like a bitch.  Now a tiny example. I want to treat my girlfriend to dinner. Takes us 20 minutes to eat. Bill is 80 bucks. Paying you 15 bucks tips would mean you are paid 45$ an hour just by me. Not including your other tables.  Go fuck yourself.         It's not the servers that choose the tip, it's the company. Most companies pay less than min wage and rely on customers to finish the paycheck of their employees. Don't be mad at the server for getting mad because they can't control their paycheck and rely on other people to.   That sounds like a good time. :)    says the poorfag. I'm not poor so i can afford to tip 5 bucks because its the social norm in my country.    I'm not a waiter. I've never been one. But I see them running around between crowded tables all the time, putting up with difficult clients, all that bullshit. I don't know how they do it. I think you're fucking stupid for presuming it's easy if you've never done it.    What? First off lrn2 green text faggot. Secondly, if more people stopped tipping, then you can sure as hell bet that the restaurant will throw the dice on new employees rather than hoping there are a good little boy or girl. I never implied shit about the ones literally doing a shit job    Bitch fuck you hostess. And yeah I'm sore because you wont return my calls. I didn't mean that I love you baby.     Don't be mad at the server for getting mad because they can't control their paycheck and rely on other people to.  Union? Strike? Writing to their congressman?     Im not a waiter i just tip. if tips were abolished you would end up paying more for the food anyway. if your too poor to go out to eat don't go out to eat. if your literally getting mad about 5 extra dollars for the tip your pathetic. its the way the system works in this country and its honestly not a big deal at all.    I don't, unless I'm out with people who don't know that going OUT means a bar or somewhere you have a chance at touching the women after. I hate Hooters. I don't know how that didn't come across.    I've done it. It's the easiest job I've ever had. Stop bitching and moaning.    You privileged sack of shit ,realize that it's a job that most people don't want they do it because they need to survive you prick    That's the tradeoff, nigger. You have to take everybody's shit all day with a smile on your face, and your whole job description basically amounts to "being everybody's bitch." It takes a special kind of mentality to do it well.    this If you amerifats want a tip you better work your ass to earn it     My home is 1.2M. Maybe you're talking about my .6M cottage. Try and make sure the pizza is a bit hotter next time faggot.    Serve for one fucking day you fuck    Rule of thumb is tip anyone who does a job that you can do, but decided to be lazy and let them do it for you.    Car Washers   Grocery Store Baggers   Bell hops   Barbers   Vallet's   Waiters    The tip should be proportional to the quality of the service. My barber does a kick-ass job and he charges a reasonable rate, $10 for an old fashion cut. I regularly tip him $5. Down the street at the shitty salon, they charge $17 for a cut, and I give them $3 tip. If the service is so bad that it does not merit a tip, then fuck it, no tip and I will not go back, so I feel no fucks about not giving a tip.   Mechanics are a different thing all together, personal mechanic/Mechanic friend, you hook up with non-monetary gifts. Ball tickets, Beer vouchers, shit like that.   IT Guy? Coffee/Pizza/Donuts. You could take your computer to Geek squad, or find a teenager who is into computers to fix yours for a large pizza and a 2 liter of mountain dew.                Worked as a waiter in Tasmania/Australia Wage received was around $19-$20 an hour. Tipping not expected but happened around 30% of the time anyway.  I personally tip decent service even though it isn't expected here in Australia, but it is never on the bill or in a jar, it is always directly to the server and it is made clear that it is for them, not the communal tip fund to be divvied up amongst the staff.  Regarding American tipping, Why not just charge what you "actually" want to earn for your food and then not have to rely on the money generated via tips to legally pay your staff.rather than some ass backwards math equation that relies on a random variable like people's generosity. And stop calling it a gratuity, you clearly don't behave as though it is a gratuity.         implying writing your Congressman has ever done anything  And there's no leverage for waiters to strike. There are any number of kids out there to replace them with.     Like I said I got banned for language ,don't be stupid    Shut up you stupid fucking land whale. Maybe if you weren't such a retarded cunt, you wouldn't get off on the slightest human interaction with males.    Then grow a spine and speak up or quit. If you really were making less than minimum wage, you would either be fired (and then be able to sue), or you would be given the money you're legally obligated to receive.  There is no reason somebody would stay somewhere that is not paying them minimum wage when there is an abundance of minimum wage jobs available. Waiters and waitresses just like to pretend that it's a huge problem because they want to guilt you into tippimg      This. Most people here couldn't be a waiter for a day without getting fired for calling someone a nigger.   Do you come to a country where coming to other countries and shitting on their culture is encouraged?  If so, please stay home.        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_<wbr>(social) im gonna leave this hear because some of these autists have no idea what it is. </wbr>   american teachers are even less deserving of tips than the food carriers. they can and often do completely fuck up the curriculum by tossing their political views into every little lesson. especially history/sociology/world study teachers. plus they get paid during the huge 2 month break when kids are enjoying summer. the last people who deserve tips on this earth are teachers.    Are you retarded?  If I say "I don't tip" at the beginning of the meal, the server will most likely not care for me. If I don't say shit, the server will do his/her best to make my stay great, and if the server manages to surprise me with great service, of course, a small tip I can give. But if it's just standard service, no tip.  Also, eurofag here        I'm a fucking terrible server. I'll forget your drinks, your special requests, fuck I might not even notice you're there for a long ass time. But the hostesses fucking love me. I make more than anyone else on my shift   As a uk native living in America, the service at most restaurants (including very high end ones) is appalling. I have no problem tipping 15-30%, but there's no fucking way I am if you're going to rush me out of the restaurant and start picking up plates of diners on our table who've finished half way through our meal. Also why does almost every restaurant and bar have a tv? Fucking bad and entitled service in this country.   Well do something, bitch. Make it an issue. Get coverage. Don't bitch about it OTI.    then stay out of america. if your so poor you can't tip you shouldn't be going out to eat let alone going on vacation.     not a part monkey   works at a part store   Lol how's it feel to not only be a failure, but to lie to yourself about being a failure?   I love when backyard mechanics think they know what they are doing.          I'm not a slave I just endorse it      posts a wiki article to define an abstract concept   everyone here is autistic but me   This is stage 4 denial       Lie. http://www.dol.gov/whd/state/tipped<wbr>.htm California and five other states pay the full minimum wage regardless of tips. </wbr>     Yeah! Fuck those servers bringing their TV to work!     banned for language     People like you are the reason why this country is going down economically     ex wafflehouse fag  The servers I worked with always judged customers as soon as you walk through the door. If they feel like you're not going to tip, they'll give you shitty service.  Of course, its wrong on the servers to be so fucking judgemental. However, I've seen alot of servers get shitty/ no tips when I know they're an exceptional server.    I worked as a cook to avoid all the drama because I hate people, working at waffle house made me hate servers because of all their bitching.    how many servers does it take to change a light bulb?  it's not my job                crossing your ones   not reserving that exclusively for sevens and zeros   FUCK YOU, ASS HOLE      Exactly, and what's interesting is if there tips don't average out to minimum wage, they gotta pay them normally, so why do we even tip if they'll make that amount anyway?    It has nothing to do with being poor. I just can't fathom the idea of tipping for something thats not "special". If the server really overdoes his job as a server and makes me leave the restaurant with a "holy shit that was a good experience", he will get a tip. If it's just standard service, no tip.  I really fail to see how anyone else can't think like this.  I don't tip the construction workers for building a building or maintaining the roads, now do I?        its the social norm in the USA to tip waiters and waitresses unless their service was terrible. usually a tip is around 2 to 5 dollars maybe 10 if its a nice restaurant. if there were no tips you would end up paying for it in the food cost anyway. somehow people have a problem with this.    Just sets the tone for the quality of dining experience you're going to receive. I know it's not the servers fault that there are tvs there, but I was served more than once by servers who kept glancing at some sports game while taking our orders.    its just the way it works in america. i don't go to your country and shit all over your customs.    Dam sun u b ignant ass phuck. Did u lrn 2 tk hm 2 da bar?!    You're undervaluing people skills. Keeping people comfortable and happy is a pain in the fucking ass, and is also a skill that miners, garbage men, and probably you, will never hope to have.   So you have to resort to avoiding human contact altogether at your job, and that is inherently going to lose some of the value that a good waiter can have.       No !!!! Dude if severs where getting paid that much they would do it for the rest of their lives ,in that case if you only tipped 15 they tip out the busser 6 bucks and if their is a bar they tip them out also so they literally walk away with less than 9bucks California minimum Wage is 10    be me   at a bar with friends near Chicago for the weekend   almost $500 tab   tip $500 for great service (snapped 10 $100 bills for the girl)   will get treated well next time       I make minimum wage also, why should I tip? I work hard for the money I have, and sometimes I'd like to be able to spend up what little I've saved to enjoy a meal like the rest of society. Why should I tip a server more than I make in an hour for them doing less than an hours work delivering my food to my table? $15 dollar tip is more than I make in 2 hours.     This guy fucking gets it, tip the person who did the fucking work.     This.   Tip System: lower prices, expected to tip based on service quality No Tip System: higher prices, you are paying the same amount anyway.        No real server would say that ....fake as fk!!    If the food isn't up to standards you can refuse to pay. Ive ordered food and not had to pay cause it was made by a bunch of drunk Turkish retards who ruined it,despite it being a hotdog as descripted. But that only relates to the quality of the food not the service    Entitled faggot we weren't all born rich you bling prick     gloryfying a fucking waiter/waitress  Does that make an intensive care unit nurse a God?  Perspective, try it.       I know this, but it isnt the law, if someone doesn't wamt to tip they are not required to.  I always tip at leat 18%. I add this onto the cost of the meal from the get go. $30 steak = $36 steak. Why? Because I was too lazy to go to the store, buy a steak, grill it myself and then clean up after myself afterwards. I'll pay the 6 to the staff for bringing me tea and napkins and sauce and cleaning up after me when I leave.       Car Washers  I wash my own  Grocery Store Baggers  I try to use self checkout as much as I can. When that's not available, I'm never given the choice of whether or not I want a bagger. They just do it. If given a choice I would say no because its a pointless job.  Bell hops  Never used one  Barbers  Tip a few dollars for a good haircut, but this isnt really a job everyone can do well by themselves  Vallet's   <span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/623914298#p623941045">Click here</a> to view the full text.

Greentext or gtfo.     me and all of my cousins during all the summers of my youth used to fuck all day when i was younger, all of them with me, none of theme between them, they think they are the only ones, girls and boys, who knows how many times i have licked my cousin pussy in those hot summer afternoons    I once dissolved a body in hydrofluoric acid, he was a family man    you better have chosen fucking squirtle then    me neither, i've always chosen the leaf type, bulbasaur in first gen    Pics or it didnt happen fagit     leaf type  kill yourself also     I'm not the guy you're replying to, but I'm more of a Bulbasaur man.   Fucked my sister multiple times   I wank daily in my housemate's drity panties. I already made a thread about it a few months ago. Never got caught.    BRUH....    i have none, there were no camera cell phones back than nor digital cameras, what you are asking is impossible    one of my childhood friends chose bulbasaur and used to rave about he was the best cause of solar beam  he got hit by a train a few years ago. i was glad.     I secretly loves CP   I sucked my cousins dick and he sucked mine. I could never get fully erect though    Eric?    bulbasaur and leaf type in general have always been the most rewarding, there is much more strategy involved in the mooveset choice, enjoy your attack only pokemons, charizard stats aren't even that impressive, in first gen was weaker than flareon, just the fact that is a dragon makes everybody to like it   I never finished half life 1   mafia?    i found that pokemon, i will always remember you ;_;     ops wrong quote     Get out of here, go complete it. Then come back.     leaf type   leaf   type   leaf  all of my rage, fucking hipster faggots dont fucking know what theyre on about        Scum   Took some girl I knew for a while to the woods with 2 buddie . Started drinking and smoking weed... After a while I thought it was funny to say we were gunna sacrifice a virgin to Satan... She was scared and blew my friends while I fucked her in the ass.    i never played either half life and have no desire to    So was she actually a virgin before that? hah image captcha is pizza    Safe to say i am a bit of a weirdo and when i was 15 i wondered what would happen if i "presented" myself to my dads greyhound called Duke, so one weekend when he was away at a bike festival i decided to jack off Duke and then show my ass to him. He obviously got really excited and decided to hump my ass, so i pulled down my tracky bottoms and boxers and kind of guided him in, it was extremely painful and hairy but i let it happen and he came in my ass. Continue my obsession with dogs?     I guess vaginal virgin. She was really religious and shit this was her first time ever drinking or smoking and she moved out of town after that    it's a pretty good game, brilliant for its time. it's significance was mostly the engine and mods it spurred.  while you shouldn't let nostalgia fags fool you, HL1 is still one of the best fps out there. you can still play it and have a great time      Holy shit   During a firefight while deployed to a warzone I deliberately gunned down a woman because she wouldn't get the fuck out of my line of sight.   With her out of the way I DID kill the sandnigger I was after.  Committed murder and got away with it       That's the thing though, I played hl2 through to the end, then later started playing one, and just kinda never got it through with.   I think the farthest I got was the part where you have to protect a scientist from the flying baby-head things, dunno how far that actually is.      yes continue    Bullshit how many kids do you have?   Fucked my cousin.   HL1 is just a railway run and shooter. The most interesting thing about it was how it told the story - purely through real time sequences which left it up to you to pick up the pieces. This was very new when HL1 came out.    Isn't that what alot of soldiers do?   Came in my daughter's panties   Oh god    Came in this guy's daughter's pussy    i was only 10 years old when i choose bublasaur, i liked the fact that venusaur had a gigantic flower on the back, then i noticed that with the right attacks i could take down even charizard    At the moment just 1. Can't believe you're on fucking 4chan too    Prove it.   I'm Dirty Dan.   Then whats my name? Cus        GOLD someone fucking screencap this!!!!         Isn't that what alot of soldiers do?  That's what shitbags do in weak units whose leaders don't have the balls to court-martial their ass.     you could not beat a charizard of the same level with a venusaur unless the charizard had completely retarded moves. You could use the missingno glitch and have a million fucking hyper potions and my charizard will still fuck you    It is, and I want to finish it for the story. But the gunplay is so floaty and I just can't keep myself on it for long enough.   Plus I lost my files twice, so there's that.     I fucked my best friend in the ass Im not sure if it was rape though, we were piss drunk and he kept trying to wrestle so I got pissed and took him to the ground and idk why but held him down and yanked his sport shorts and undies off spit on my dick and shoved it in, while I was fucking him i kept saying i tolled you to stop he just layed there were still good friends  I never played a single Zelda game.

They are idiots, they are dead inside, they cannot comprehend anything.  So we take refuge in something that at least has some kind of meaning to it.  We go to see titties, action and entertainment here. Why? Because we want it. Other people want that as well, but only in minor doses. Their main aim is to socialize which can be translated into doing nothing at all. They just sit around like cows in the field.  Many of you probably has some kind of interest in philosophy for example. Have you ever tried talking about philosophy with your friends or parents?
