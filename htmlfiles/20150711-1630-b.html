Last businessman we had who ran the U.S. started two failed wars and ejected us into serious debt. Not to mention he's a hate-mongering racist.  I'm 100% voting for him. I love how he speaks his mind and doesn't give a fuck.  <br>What business did Obama run? I didn't know he had one.</br>  <br> gwb  <br> a buisness man <br><br>Nigga get the fuck out. Like what tha fuck man. Just get the fuck out. Right now, leave</br></br></br></br>  <br>Obama inherited the situation <br>He didn't cause it</br></br>  did anyone see the thread about donald trump giving money at some point to the clinton foundation  <br> started two wars <br><br>I understand what you're doing, but unfortunately you are failing miserably</br></br></br>  I Like him and I don't think he was being racist. I know what he meant, but he used very poor choice of words. But the doctors and engineers and top people stay in their country.  <br>Ya because he never ducked up anything his self. Go back to your cuckold thread.</br>  Don't care bout anything. <br><br>But I'm voting for this guy. The pres never does anything anyway.</br></br>  <br>10/10</br>  <br><br>I'm Canadian but I think this is hilarious. I want him to win just for the endless lulz he will bring. He'll basically shove his dick up everyones ass. <br><br>Please make him president</br></br></br></br>  <br>give me an example</br>  He said offensive shit and didnt appologize. The man is a god.  <br>Race war<br>2nd cold war<br>help isis rise to power<br><br><br>He sure as hell didn't bring any peace.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  His campaign is "IM GOING TO DO WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND I DONT GIVE A FUCK, MAINLY BECAUSE I DONT NEED YOUR MONEY"    <br> Donald Trump <br> being honest about being a racist asshole <br><br>i'm fine with it.<br>he won't win the RNC nomination, though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This guy is a fucking retard. Go Green party.</br>  CHINA<br>DISASTER<br>OBAMA<br>WEAK<br>DEALS<br>MEXICANS</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This</br>  <br>Don't try /b/ro, you can't reason with the idiots :(<br>All they know how to do is go all caps and type CUCK, FAG, KILL YOURSELF because they don't actually know what they are talking about</br></br>  Well he's not actually running, he just wants his name out there and be relevant for a while (plus book deals) just like in 2012, so who gives a fuck. What's pathetic are the people buying into this bullshit. It's a great way to make money, just tell dumb people what they want to hear and get them to root for you.  Come on kids. Trump is a joke. He's just saying shit to create controversy and gain attention. This isn't anything new. Not even the presidential run. Perot already tried the billionaire running for president shtick, back when a different Bush and Clinton were running.  <br>and the cartels dont? if they were "sending" their worst, wouldn't they send the cartel members here? <br><br>Also, what doctors and engineers? it's fucking mexico</br></br></br>  <br><br>I get what you're saying. I love when people speak their mind without hesitation. Unless they're an out of touch idiot, which he is.<br><br> How can he be stupid if he's so rich? <br><br>You can be the world's best heart surgeon and have no idea how to format a hard drive.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought he did officially announced that he was indeed running, through public press.</br>  <br>Green Party? Go back to your trans porn, degenerate.</br>  <br>Under Clader√≥n Mexico really developed. Not a third world country anymore, actually quite developed in certain areas</br>  <br> Perot already tried the billionaire running for president shtick <br>and he managed to snag 18% of the vote.<br>and that was before mainstream internet</br></br></br>  <br>doctors and engineers come from mexico, but they actually go through the process to get here legally</br>  <br>Your type is the reason our country is a shit hole. You like minded delusional retarded hippy think you can take from people who earned and give to those who don't then cater to the mentally ill and we'll be ok.</br>  <br> Race war <br>haha okkkk<br> cold war <br>it's still going faggot lurn2history<br> Isis  <br>The cause of Isis is not Obama but the mess Cheney and Rumsfeld made when they innovated that part of the fucking world. Come on moron you've gotta have a brain that somewhat works</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And? He did it in 2012 and dropped out. Again, it's for his net worth and name. Were you alive in 2012?</br>  He's so funny to think about as a President. He would be the next Bush if he came to power.  <br> &gt;being honest about being a racist asshole <br><br>Just curious, is it "racist" to point out that Hispanics<br>- join gangs at 20 times the White rate<br>- drop out at 3 times the White rate and twice the Black rate<br>- use welfare more than any other group, including Blacks<br>- of those who do graduate, they do reading &amp; math at the 8th grade level<br>- have bankrupted dozens of hospitals by refusing to pay for their medical care<br><br>????<br><br>and if acknowledging the above facts makes one racist, does it also make one an asshole too or does that require separate acknowledgement of un-pretty facts?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>theres many people that I'd rather see president....but none of them are running<br><br>he would be the most /b/ president. plus i think his foreign policy would trigger the happening / day of rope for middle east. <br><br>he has my vote</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not a hippy. I'm actually conservative. But you're a fucking embarrassment to our cause when you can't even tell the libtards how wrong they are. Learn to hold a conversation, that's how you get them to listen and understand.</br>  <br>You're saying being able to format a hardrive is the deciding factor between smart or not?<br>10/10 would read again got me to reply Atleast</br></br>  Politicians are all crooked and untrustworthy. Donald Trump says what he means, not what will sound good on a sound byte... I like that. Also pretty much agree with what he says  <br>It's just wealth man, the cartels stay. but it also attracts a lot of money grabbers that grab the easy life. and have you ever been in a third world country? trust me man, mexico has smart people, there is just no funding and no moneys for projects.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;6271749210 <br>0/10 bait m8 i top kek</br>  <br> race war <br> to blind with white gult to see <br> cold war <br> what is China <br> isis <br> dindu nuff we black now. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>uhhh what are taxes? shared wealth that is supposed to go back to the people. Go back to being a fucking nomad if you want to be a selfish prick.</br>  Only if omarosa is his running mate  <br>yeah agreed. We should just have more incentives for them to come. That way people would think they have to go through education to get here. It works, I lived it in honduras.</br>  <br>Al Gore won the popular vote. The popular vote means nothing.<br><br>Also, I doubt Trump will run as an Independent. And if he does, he'll probably have his votes split between people who prefer the Constitution Party Candidate or Gary Johnson.</br></br></br>  I love how trump piss off all the faggots, the beaner druggies, the nigger welfare bums, the sand nigger terrorists and the demon-rat communists  <br>Okay I pay taxes no problem but what about the illegal immigrants that refuse to become citizens and don't pay taxes hmm?</br>  <br> Not to mention he's a hate-mongering racist. <br><br>How can we expect someone to lead our nation if they won't tell the truth about race?<br><br>Can we have a "leader" who ignores the criminal, education, welfare, healthcare, and budgetary nightmare of the Hispanic population?<br><br>How is it hate-mongering to point out the truth.<br><br>50,000 Latin Kings run the streets of Chicago--- the joys of diversity!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the fact that you hate hispanics make you racist.<br>the fact that you post on /b/ makes you an asshole. xD</br></br>  <br>Unlike you? Who wants people to work 2 jobs to pay for more aircraft carriers, because "everyones out to get us" paranoia bullshit? Fuck off. You right wingers seem to forget the debt you cause under the Bush years with a bullshit war. Fucking faggot.</br>  <br>maybe you need to learn how to write proper sentences because the green text isn't working for you. I have absolutely no idea what you are implying or what any of that bullshit means. Come back when you can scribe a simple sentence then we can talk about the real world</br>  Does anyone else hate how he moves his mouth when he talks?  I think its funny he's such a shit disturber. I'm not even American but I follow American politics far more closely than those in my own country specifically for shit like this since it actually makes politics entertaining. The thing about Trump is that he's not outright lying with what he says, but rather he presents his points in ways that come off as aggressive towards others.<br><br>Still, that fact that he's surging in the polls is interesting. I legitimately hope that he wins the nomination and goes up against Hilary although I doubt it will happen. I think its more than likely going to be another Bush vs. Clinton election.</br></br>  <br>You seem to be implying that illegal immigrants have access to programs provided by tax payer dollars... They don't.</br>  <br>He's great for the Democratic Party</br>  <br>He could actually govern without sucking the dick of every special interest group because he doesn't need them.<br>He could make choices for the U.S. based on what's right for the country, not what's best for his speech tour after he's out of office.<br><br>It's frightening, but he's actually the best option...</br></br></br></br>  I live in a small town in Kansas. I've always been the artsy type..painting, photography...while most other guys around here were more jocky. Tons of guys joined the millitary after high school and now almost all of them are in Iraq. They send letters home saying how proud they are of their wives and how it must be hard for them to deal with their husbands being away.<br>Well do you know how they deal with it?<br>They fuck me.<br>Thats right. While you are away getting your ass hot off I'm shooting myself off in your wifes ass. Thank God for George Bush. I have about 4 wives I'm currently fucking because of his great leadership. I voted republican this year and then promptly went to a shipped off wives's home and came in her mouth.</br></br></br>  <br>Bush vs Clinton? That would be a disaster as Trump would say.</br>  <br>Well dey terk er jerbs!</br>  <br> have bankrupted dozens of hospitals by refusing to pay for their medical care <br>No your right nowhere in history has the whiteman bankrupted the United States millions of times, nigger are you even trying?<br><br> join gangs at 20 times the White rate <br>secret societies and armies are the biggest gangs in the world and most of them are ran by white people<br><br> drop out at 3 times the White rate and twice the Black rate <br>who the fuck cares many people didn't go to school and went on to lead rich successful lives<br><br>  use welfare more than any other group, including Blacks <br>this is sad that anyone is on welfare that means a government's not doing there job, the fact we have any people on welfare is disturbing<br><br> of those who do graduate, they do reading &amp; math at the 8th grade level <br> they do reading &amp; math at the 8th grade level <br> do reading and math at the 8th grade level <br>that whole sentence is full of shit errors, so I am curious what is your writing level?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>but all those shitbags can vote....<br>What a great country.</br></br>  <br>Samefag</br>  <br>you sir, are my new best friend. it seems like someone finally gets it</br>  Have you ever read a post on /b/ and wondered whether or not it is copy pasta? It is almost as though half the posts are pasta. Maybe they all are. Maybe this one is. Maybe it is not. Maybe it will become pasta at some point in time.

(those who create these various versions don't exactly make them for the novice; they wrongly assume EVERYONE is a Geek) And using it was WORSE!!! Besides, I've ALWAYS used XBox, and it's too late to teach this old dog new tricks. And when PCs become as easy to use as XBox, games are as easy to load into PC as it is for XBox, and there's Halo 2 ported to PC (or better still, XBox games are compatible with PC), THEN I'll use it And You PC-ers DARE to accuse Bill Gates of being the 'Antichrist'?! At least he makes his game consoles EASY to buy &amp; use!!!<br>So, until then, I say:<br>GET THEE BEHIND ME, PC-SATAN!!!</br></br></br></br>  <br>LET THE REPLIES BEGIN</br>  <br>CUCK FAG KILL YOURSELF</br>  <br> Obama inherited the situation  <br> He didn't cause it <br>Hahahahahahahahahhahaha</br></br></br>  <br>is this.... going somewhere?</br>  I don't want to start a holy war here, but what is the deal with you Mac fanatics? I've been sitting here at my freelance gig in front of a Mac (a 8600/300 w/64 Megs of RAM) for about 20 minutes now while it attempts to copy a 17 Meg file from one folder on the hard drive to another folder. 20 minutes. At home, on my Pentium Pro 200 running NT 4, which by all standards should be a lot slower than this Mac, the same operation would take about 2 minutes. If that.<br>In addition, during this file transfer, Netscape will not work. And everything else has ground to a halt. Even BBEdit Lite is straining to keep up as I type this.<br>I won't bore you with the laundry list of other problems that I've encountered while working on various Macs, but suffice it to say there have been many, not the least of which is I've never seen a Mac that has run faster than its Wintel counterpart, despite the Macs' faster chip architecture. My 486/66 with 8 megs of ram runs faster than this 300 mhz machine at times. From a productivity standpoint, I don't get how people can claim that the Macintosh is a superior machine.<br>Mac addicts, flame me if you'd like, but I'd rather hear some intelligent reasons why anyone would choose to use a Mac over other faster, cheaper, more stable systems.</br></br></br>  The thing about Trump is that he's the only candidate who seem at all genuine regardless of what your opinion is of his views. The rest of them all seem like your typical politicians who just spit out generic bs responses that are tailored to what is politically correct and what people want to hear.  <br>I really don't get people like this. Do they realize both Shillary and Obama both voted to go to war? People act like 9/11 happened and bush just grabbed a microphone like WE GOING TO WAR..</br>  Because JPEGs are more heavily compressed than other image formats, their information is more volatile and likely to expand at high speed through an unchecked buffer, poorly allocated resource or any other available system space. I'd guess you're probably losing image data through one of these means.<br>You see, when you load a JPEG into memory, the EXtra colour Information Format (EXIF) header is loaded into RAM in order to prepare the video prebuffer for the incoming high-speed flow of colour information from the uncorked JPEG. If your bus isn't ready for this information, the rapidly decompressing file information can flow through other parts of your system.<br>Ordinarily this isn't a problem: as a matter of fact, JPEG was designed for this sort of thing. Older computers couldn't handle the explosive power behind the fledgeling image decompression algorithm, so rather than fight it, image experts invented the Jampacked Picture Extraction and Gathering (JPEG) protocol. They cleverly decided to allow the image data to spray wherever it would, knowing that after the extraction phase would send raw data all over the inside of the computer, the gathering phase would locate it all and reassemble it into an image. With the advent of faster computers the delay between spray and collection is so small as to be unnoticeable, while newer and bigger video cards are more capable of withstanding the onslaught of colours.<br>Still, the primary weakness of this algorithm is the haphazard placement of decompressed data. There's just too much of it to channel through normal means, so any loss of data containment results in corrupted images. In your case, it would appear that you're losing image data through the empty hole where your goddamned shift key should be.</br></br></br>  <br>pasta pasta pasta<br><br>Let's see your xbox outperform my GTX 980, cuck.</br></br></br>  <br><br>You'd best be trolling or we're gonna have to hang you for being a traitorous retard.</br></br>  <br> implying all republicans are the same.  <br><br>Google a man by the name of Ron Paul.

What a lot of people don't realize is that when you smoke, those few minutes of your expected lifespan are literally transformed into the ash you flick away into an ashtray. Ashtrays, each and every one of them, are constructed by a single group running several dozen front companies.<br>Basically, unless you're putting out your smokes beneath your heel or in the ashtray your kid made at camp, you're dispensing your ashen life into this group's eager little recepticle. Their ashtrays absorb the life force from the ashes and sends it to a central holding facility. No one knows for sure what these guys are going to do when they've collected all that life energy, but it's probably going to be huge.<br>Incidentally, there's talk of a rival organization leading the anti-smoking political agenda from behind the scenes. They probably figure removing smoking sections, and thus ashtrays, from restaurants and bars is a good first step towards thwarting whatever it is this ashtray company is trying to do.</br></br>  <br>You cucked yourself to microcock immediately after buying that piece of shit chunk of "hardware"</br>  For nerds?

Have fun with your GMO free water.</br>  Well my first gay experience happened like this:<br>I was about 50 yards or so up this path when I noticed a man standing off the side of the path apparently staring into the woods. As I got closer I realized his pants were down around his ankles and I could see his ass. Now, I'm straight but I have to say that it was a really nicely shaped ass for a man and I took notice. I figured maybe he was drunk and just peeing in the bushes, so I started to walk quieter so I wouldn't disturb him. But as I got closer I started hearing strange grunts and sucking sounds. I realized there was another man blowing him.<br>Now, I'm not gay but I slowed my pace down to watch. I slowed and approached the standing man from behind. His friend didn't take any notice as his eyes were tightly closed. I came right up behind the man standing so that I could have reached out and touched him. That's when I brought the cinder block down on his head, hard. He collapsed on top of his faggot friend and I quickly finished them both off. I rolled them into the bushes and finished my walk. That was only my first of many such gay encounters.</br></br>  <br>healthcare. they can pop out their anchor babies for free, and theyre set. then their kids get all those benefits.<br><br>if you didnt realize that, you're retarded. thats how they get benefits while being illegal</br></br></br>  <br>Then what about those who aren't?<br><br>Can you justify hating an entire race from wherever you pulled these 'statistics'?<br><br>Think about that word: "Entire" for a second.<br><br>What Trump offers is something that frankly isn't going to work.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Absolutely agreed, hence why it takes so long to advance. but I think those money grabbers are what trump was referring to. there is a lot of good people comming out of the rest of the world as well, he just didn't mention that part.</br>  Actually, it's nothing I'm proud of and I still regret to this day. But I digress.<br>When I was 12, I told some of my friends that I thought I was gay. My one friend, Jessica, knew this gay 15 year old guy and showed him my picture. He thought I was cute. We talked for not even two days, and the next day, he came over. He started feeling my dick through my pants, and I felt his. I pulled down his pants, and he had this huge 9 inch boner. I sucked him off, then we did some jacking off to eachother. He did me up the ass for a bit. It REALLY hurt. I couldn't walk right for a few days, and it bled. Then we just jacked eachother off until we came.<br>I felt so bad after that. Mainly because I find sex a mutual thing that you should do in a relationship.</br></br>  alright faggots lets hear your excuses  I don't care anymore  <br>i do, its your mom</br>  <br>cus my wife wouldnt like it</br>  Cuz 4chan  2d&gt;3d  because i wouldnt be able to keep my porn  I do, kek, not all of us are neckbeard virgins  <br>It's because I'm gay</br>  <br>everyone on here is beta as fuck you dipshit</br>  <br>because i upgraded her</br>  <br>no excuses.

Far more trouble than they're worth.</br></br></br>  <br>so you pay for pussy your not going to get anymore?</br>  <br>I have Autism</br>  <br>i'm ugly</br>  <br>nice quads</br>  because my right hand will never say no  <br>nice quads. but no, she makes way more than i do, and almost a decade and a kid in still getting it.</br>  i'm sick and dying.<br><br>who wants to be around that?</br></br>  <br><br>what is it like living with autism?</br></br>  <br>Too many loves and too many heartbreaks.

Friends with benefits is free. Thanks for the compliment though.</br>  I'm a serial killer...they never last long.  I'm probably not a nice guy though really, hence no gf.  <br>ask this guy:<br/></br>  Because i have to convince her to break up with her boyfriend first  <br>Cause once i cum, i realize i just wanted to have sex.</br>    <br>I kind of agree with this guy. 22 now, and I've had 4 long term girlfriends in the past (almost all of them lasting 1-2 years) but as for the future I don't know if I'd get married and have kids. I really don't like taking care of kids and finding them as babies-toddlers to be annoying as fuck on average, and i'd have pretty much no money if i had to care for a family of 3+</br>  <br>I live in iowa and i don't like farming hunting or football.</br>  <br> girlfriend <br>I don't think my boyfriend would like that.</br></br>  <br>I have one and I want out. The bitch keeps giving me blueballs.</br>  <br>Everyone is. Get over yourself. Just because you're doing it faster doesn't make you special.</br>  Because it's summer, girls want to fuck random dudes and I want to fuck random grills  <br>so true.</br>  <br>i'm a total autist when it comes to meeting new people</br>  <br>Yeah. Kinda. Sorta. Also went pretty heavy with my last one. Playing catchup. So fuggit. For now. Meatloafing aside from a fwb</br>  <br> I'm a serial killer...they never last long. <br><br>You're not a serial killer, you're just a wuss.</br></br></br>  <br>I feel that</br>  <br>I realized girls only like me when I have money which leads me to start treating them like whores. It doesn't usually work out long after that.</br>  I do, she's in the other room  I'm gay lmao  <br>because I don't trust women</br>  <br>I don't have time for some Irrational cunt. I'm to fucking busy making money and doing alpha shit like lifting weights, mma, one night stands, fast cars and motorcycles.<br><br>Long term relationship with some needy annoying bitch is literally the worse thing that could happen in my life.<br><br>I'd have to divert time, money, energy from my life of bliss and put it into some ungrateful dumb bitch.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> wow <br> so alpha <br> much badass </br></br></br>  <br>I don't need to keep and pay for a bitch. Women wanted to be equal, fine, they're equal. They can have all the jobs they want and make all the money they want, and I don't have to take care of them like some pathetic dependent.<br><br>Fuck that shit. Marriage is obsolete. Dating is obsolete. Monogamy is obsolete. A person cannot claim possession over another person. Bring on the endless line of sloots and the casual sex.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm a horible person and women seem to think I'm sexist.</br>  <br>your life sounds quite hollow</br>  <br>see </br>  <br> no time for girlfriend <br> time to shitpoast on b </br></br>  <br>Because you said no when I asked you out last week</br>  <br> You're a wonderful guy, anon...etc. <br><br>For all you losers, stay away from girls who say this. It's a form of psychological torture. You are being groomed to be 'that guy' a girl wants to share her feelings with but never fuck. Platonic relationships with females are not normal behavior for heterosexual males.</br></br></br>  <br>b-b-but all she needs is a little more time to see how right we are for each other</br>  I'm ugly  Dick's too big, might kill someone.  <br>She's not.<br>She's going to hold on to him as long as she can getting as much out of him and you as she can simultaneously. When she gets caught because you've gotten super clingy and desperate and leave her some message on facebook she'll get broken up with but tell you she finally did it. Then in a year or so, if that long she'll start this cycle over again with you in the position of the boyfriend.</br></br>  <br>Actually I'm not a wonderful guy.</br>  <br> denounces women <br> claims to have free casual sex <br> actually spends time posting in suicide threads on /b/ </br></br></br>  <br>basically like being a beta fag, an emotional cushion for females?</br>  <br>is this u?</br>  <br>that was my excuse ya dingus<br><br>god damnit, why are you jealous?</br></br></br>  <br>No, why?</br>  <br> all she needs is a little more time <br> more time <br> time <br><br> wakes up in nursing home </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Trips don't lie</br>  I am emotionally dead inside, I'm selfish, when I actually like a girl I can't fucking act right.

It takes a healthy amount of the ignorance and delusion of youth to marry. The main reason you're likely to be a serial marrier if you're married young is, you never have the chance to learn how to live your own life, and go through it co-dependent.</br></br></br></br></wbr></br>  Asexual  <br>married... :/</br>  <br>Oh shit, sorry.<br><br>Is this you?</br></br></br>  <br> implying you need a relationship with a woman to live a wholesome life </br>  <br> can't fucking read, apparently </br>  I'm unappealing and unattractive. really simple.  She told me "You can't expect someone to love you if you cant love yourself".<br>I fucking hate myself</br>  I do have a girlfriend. <br>I'm in a hostel, waiting to go to China to see her. <br>We'll come back together. <br>We've lived together for 2 years.</br></br></br>  <br>the post you responded to was satirical</br>  Because I spend all my time on 4chan looking at these shitposts  <br>anon is doing what makes him happy<br><br>a hollow life sounds like one in which your life has less value because you dump your expectations and obligations onto another, be it your spouse or your fucked up kids.</br></br></br>  <br>yes</br>  ...because I'm married.  <br>Actually I do</br>  <br>OP asked, motherfucker.<br>I answered.<br><br>If this strikes you as alpha badass, you are one sad pathetic fuck.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I know that.

Just fucking sick of bitch shit right now. <br><br>Find a good one young, guys, it doesn't get better. You think if a woman is 40, she's mature? HAHAHAHAHA - they get WORSE, especially if they're single!<br><br>I'll probably start dating again, I'm young enough to still pull off 25-30, and not look creepy. Just not now. I like peace and quiet right now more than pussy and headaches.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>that is offensive, u shouldn't talk this way to people, even though u dont know them.

Post em</br>  <br>I don't want to start a holy war here, but what is the deal with you Mac fanatics? I've been sitting here at my freelance gig in front of a Mac (a 8600/300 w/64 Megs of RAM) for about 20 minutes now while it attempts to copy a 17 Meg file from one folder on the hard drive to another folder. 20 minutes. At home, on my Pentium Pro 200 running NT 4, which by all standards should be a lot slower than this Mac, the same operation would take about 2 minutes. If that.<br>In addition, during this file transfer, Netscape will not work. And everything else has ground to a halt. Even BBEdit Lite is straining to keep up as I type this.<br>I won't bore you with the laundry list of other problems that I've encountered while working on various Macs, but suffice it to say there have been many, not the least of which is I've never seen a Mac that has run faster than its Wintel counterpart, despite the Macs' faster chip architecture. My 486/66 with 8 megs of ram runs faster than this 300 mhz machine at times. From a productivity standpoint, I don't get how people can claim that the Macintosh is a superior machine.<br>Mac addicts, flame me if you'd like, but I'd rather hear some intelligent reasons why anyone would choose to use a Mac over other faster, cheaper, more stable systems.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Honor 6 plus</br>  I'm on the same boat OP, I seriously know nothing about phones and I don't know if I should get an iPhone or an Android, I expect to spend no more than $350 btw.  <br>Oldfag detected!</br>  <br>Chink pls go</br>  Are you trying to buy a phone out right, like used?<br>If so I really like the Galaxy S4, I just got my girlfriend one off ebay.<br>Right at $200.00<br><br>But as a side option, those Blu phones are cheap, probably cheaply<br>made too.
