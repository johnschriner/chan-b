I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class at ministry school, and I’ve been involved in numerous mission trips in Africa, and I have over 300 confirmed salvations. I am trained in spiritual warfare and I’m the top preacher in the entire US television network. You are nothing to me but just another atheist. I will baptize you in 1,000 rivers with holiness the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my blessed words. You think you can get away with saying those falsehoods to me over the Internet? Think again, heathen. As we speak I am praying to my Lord and Savior in Heaven and your IP is being told to me right now on a piece of toast so you better prepare for the blood, blasphemer. The blood of Jesus that saved me and will wipe away the sins from the pathetic little thing you call your soul. You’re fixing to be saved, son. My God can be anywhere, anytime, and he can kill you in infinite ways, and that's just with natural causes. Not only am I extensively trained in the New Testament, but I have access to it's entire arsenal of wisdom and life changing power, and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable soul clean from across the continent, you little Nimrod. If only you could have known what holy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your lying tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re not paying the price because Jesus payed it for you, you foolish sinner. My God will shower fury all over you and you will drown in it.

You're frickin grounded, buttmunch.</br>  <br>Tits plz</br>  When will Atheists realize that everything can't come from nothing?  No atheist believes that.<br><br>In fact, only creationists believe everything came from nothing.</br></br>  <br/>  <br>No, theists believe The Creator created everything. He already existed.</br>  <br>They believe he created everything from nothing.<br><br>Why did you say atheists believe any such nonsense?</br></br></br>    <br>No they don't. They believe he created everything from something - his will.<br><br>Because atheists believe that there was nothing, then BOOM! everything appeared.</br></br></br>  <br>But like I said, no atheist believes that.</br>  <br><br> everything can't come from nothing. <br><br>But God can... amirite?<br><br> MFW I reply to this shit. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How do you know? You know the minds of all Atheists? <br><br>Please explain what there was before the Big Bang then?</br></br></br>  <br>Of course, you wouldn't call him God otherwise.<br><br>But it's also entirely possible that the Creator of this Universe is just a superior being, not a deity. For all we know we are just bytes in the matrix and the creator is an alien scientist</br></br></br>  <br>An incredibly dense singularity. Far from nothing. Every molecule in our current universe was there and accounted for.</br>  I can't even be fucked to think of a clever post.    Athiests think that if God was real where did he come from? And where did that source leading to God's creation come from? After that they don't care  <br>Oh yes, the magic "singularity". And atheists mock when theists fill gaps with God when they do the same with magic invisible things for which there is no evidence.</br>  <br>Perhaps he came from his Mummy's tummy. Who knows. The point is, a creator is as logically possible as a magic invisible singularity.</br>  <br><br>Special pleading.<br><br>Conjecture.<br><br>And something else....<br><br>Ah yes, religious faggotry.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Conjecture, yes. Just like the magic invisible singularity and invisible gravity waves</br>  <br><br><br> magic invisible singularity. <br><br>There you go again. Inventing nonsense and claiming atheists believe it. I never said "magic invisible."</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Show me the evidence for your God.</br></br>  I thought these threads were getting banned?  <br>OK, please provide some evidence for this "singularity"</br>  <br><br>You best be trolling nigger.<br><br>Gravity is real.<br><br>Go jump off a bridge, and test it out.<br><br>Come after and tell us if the math and science behind Newtonian physics is wrong afterwards.<br><br>Better yet, stream that shit. We would all watch it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There isn't any, but that doesn't mean there is no God</br>  <br>Gravity is real, but science can't explain it - especially with Newtonian physics. And please don't make up shit about "bends in spacetime" as if you know what you are talking about or there is any evidence whatsover that such things exist</br>  <br><br>So the lack of evidence, is evidence that God exists?<br><br> MFFW </br></br></br></br>  <br>well shitposted my friend</br>  <br><br>Yes, because a good debate is so much worse than "rate my cock" or fucking furries</br></br>  <br>Ugh, no more furry threads. I'll have to read if there is actual debate and not bullshit.</br>  <br>Of course not, but it doesn't mean he doesn't. Let's be clear, I'm not talking about the God of The Bible - that's just silly. I'm talking about a Creator of what we perceive as the Universe. It's possible that we live in a created Universe, just as it's possible there was no creator.</br>  Where is that image from?  <br><br>Seems like your mind is already made up. The christian god of the bible exists irrespectively of whatever the evidenc [or lack thereof] is...<br><br>Well, that was fun. Conversation is over. Enjoy having the spooky convictions of a neanderthal who cant explain thunder or fire.<br><br>Good night sir.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The fact that the universe is constantly expanding. It's like simple subtraction.<br><br>Certainly more evidence than skydaddy snapping his fingers like Houdini.</br></br></br>  <br>No, I haven't said that. See </br>  <br>Not if said skydaddy used a process similar to the Big Bang to create, or if he built expansion into the parameters of his universe</br>  Not sure if everybody here is a newfag, irregular, or just troll, but STOP REPLYING. this guy posts the same shit everyday with the same picture, and baits the fuck out of retards. Dont bump anymore, report and move on.  <br>What is it expanding from and what is it expanding into because it sounds like you are trying to subtract nothing from nothing to equal everything?</br>  <br>WAAH! I want more "rate my cock" and "gfur" threads WAAH! MODS! MODS!</br>    <br>Yeah well I guess it's just as likely the entire universe was created 5 minutes ago and all our memories are implanted.<br><br>Maybe you are just a brain in a jar in a mad scientist's basement, and as he pulls switches, various electrical impulses trick you into thinking you are "seeing," "hearing," "feeling," etc.<br><br>Maybe we're all hooked into the Matrix.<br><br>All just as likely.<br><br>Or you know maybe the trees grew from acorns, carbon dating really does give us a good estimate for the age of the earth, and the patterns we observe really can help us deduce what came before our existence to some extent.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   This is of course true but its all in limit time frames, the picture is much larger  <br> What is it expanding from  <br>Already answered.<br> and what is it expanding into <br>Atheists don't know the future.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sure, maybe the creator made the Universe a very long time ago, just like it appears. But perhaps time passes differently in his universe, so he sped things up to see how we are getting on.</br>   Creator creates universe <br> goes silent/invisible <br> leaves no evidence of his existence <br> leaves all evidence for Big Bang and evolution <br> humans arrive billions of years later <br> a few humans by some radical coincidence correctly guess that it's all a ruse and the Creator was just testing us <br><br>Wow guys how did you guess the truth? I was so careful to leave not a trace of evidence!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The concept of the future is very prominent in atheist assumptions, you are the ones making the claim that information about the past can predict future events, that is the basis of the scientific method and you say physical space is expanding into nothing but the future.</br>  <br>Evidence like Pi, you mean?</br>  Then where did god come from? And how was he able to create something from nothing?  Lelel sooooo glad god came along and shouted "let there be light" and then everything appeared ex nihilo  <br>Ever heard of a white hole, troll?</br>    <br>No idea, perhaps he was born from his mummy's tummy but has access to technology far superior than ours that can create a simulation of a Universe that can contain self-aware organisms.</br>  <br>No, what's one of those? Another made up magic thing that Atheists introduce whenever they run out of evidence?</br>  <br>when will you realize realization</br>  <br/>  <br><br>Was referring to OP's logic that something can't come from nothing which is complete bullshit if there were to be a god.</br></br>  <br>I think that is what OP is saying. Screw your eyes up really tight and concentrate, then read it again</br>  <br>God is, that is part of the definition of God, for there to be something, it must be observed and God is that which observes all.<br> <br>Things come from God, not the other way around, the universe is just an idea spawned from God's divine imagination, you are just lucky to be part of that and have an active role in the most vivid hallucination of perspective possible.</br></br></br>  <br> everything can't come from nothing <br>When will non-atheists realize that same goes for god?</br></br>    <br>Perhaps they do, perhaps The Creator was, in turn, created. It's more believable than "one day there was nothing, then nothing exploded and became everything, including you"</br>  <br> Things come from God <br>Pics or didn't happen anon.<br>Or sound recordings.<br>Or any kind of evidence.<br>Anything, I beg for evidence.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Exactly. The same goes for god who appeared out of nowhere and decided to create earth. Fuckin Jesus cock sucking religious cunt</br>  <br>So you do beilive everything came from nothing.</br>  <br>You mean like the same evidence there is for the Big Bang? None - just supposition</br>  <br>G8 b8 m8 r8 8/8</br>  <br>Then entire universe is evidence, how much evidence can one god damn deity give you disrespectful little shits?</br>  <br>No, I believe everything came from The Creator who was something - in fact, he was something else</br>  <br>G8 b8 m8 r8 8/8</br>  <br>G8 b8 m8 r8 8/8 <br><br>And you keep saying you beilive everything came from nothing.</br></br></br>  <br>Why do you beilive everything came from nothing? That's retarded and only creationists belive that.</br>  <br> Then entire universe is evidence <br>No it's not.</br></br>  <br>You keep falling for the G8 b8 m8</br>  <br>One creator creating another creator aka god means pretty much polytheism since there is more than one god.<br><br>So at least all the monotheist religions don't.</br></br></br>  <br>Stop falling for the b8 m8 and stop posting in b8 threads.</br>    <br> how much evidence can one god damn deity give you <br>I want a miracle. No Jesus-face-in-toast shit, some real deal that overrides the laws of physics.</br></br>  <br>Give me proof that evidence provides truth, that the past can predict the future, and that there is nothingness outside of the universe for space to expand into.</br>  <br>Still falling for b8 m8</br>  There's every possibility that something can spring from nothing.<br>My idea is that maybe the universe did start off from nothing. Because within nothingness there are no laws preventing anything else from happening. So anything could happen. And QM implies a sort of probabilistic nature to reality which means things can be in a state of 'something' and 'nothing' at once. It's only when we interact with the system that it becomes a 'something rather than nothing. It quantifies itself in a way to distinguish itself from its environment.<br><br>Also, why would it make any more sense that there was nothing but the creator who made the universe, rather than just the universe simply happening? Both of these make the assumption of something just being there, but the creatorless version has fewer assumptions</br></br></br>  <br>I know you think everything came from nothing, stop saying that, it's retarded.</br>  Our universe is just a science fair project by some grade school kid. Prove me wrong.    <br>Falling for b8 m8 stop posting in b8 threads</br>    <br>He only got 5th place too, prove me wrong.</br>  <br>when will xtians realise everything didn't come from god's ballbag?</br>  <br>Falling for b8 m8 stop posting in b8 threads.</br>    <br>Give me proof that I think, then try to provide some evidence of what I think or quit using evidence of something so complex as a scapegoat.</br>  <br>He won first place. He is so proud of his project that he has us in a shelf, otherwise he would've disposed of us a long time a go and we would be dead by now.</br>  <br> 1969 <br> humanity lands the first Travis on the never ending moon. </br></br>  <br>Oh fuck off and find a cock thread to play in, the grown-ups are talking</br>    People still reply to this shit? And without saging    <br>Stop pushing the idea everything came from nothing, only dumb creationists think that.<br><br>Jesus you sound like a broken record constitute posting you think everything came from nothing.</br></br></br>   2015 <br> still believing in fairy tales <br><br>Grow the fuck up, you're not a small child anymore.</br></br></br>  <br>G8 b8 m8 r8 8/8</br>  <br>Falling for b8 m8 stop posting in b8 threads</br>    G8 b8 m8 r8 8/8  <br>Fairy tales like "there was a singularity", "dark matter" and "gravity waves/particles" you mean?</br>    <br><br>The childlike Empress is more likely to have actually existed than the God you foolishly believe in.</br></br>  <br>Why do you keep saying you beilive everything came from nothing?</br>    <br>G8 b8 m8 r8 8/8</br>  <br>Falling for b8 m8 don't post in b8 threads</br>  <br>believe what you want, godfag!<br>the believe in god was made to get a bunch of people under control... but than... the whole god stuff went out of control and all the fucktards believed the shit they were fed with.<br>than after lets say 1900 years or something - people started to think again and set a questionmark behind god... some of them... and they have bcome more and more so now the majority of people thinks that all this crap was bullshit and there are other people - like you, who believes that someone from out of clouds touched the ground and made rapists n stuff.. keep believing that -&gt; leads to fucktardness</br></br></br>    When will Christians realize that god can't come from nothing?<br><br> b.b.b.but god was there the whole time... Please don't touch my wee wee again Mister priest... <br><br>So... This means that something could exist before big bang? Big bang didn't come from nothing?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Falkor is more likely to be real than ridiculous things like ghosts, leprechauns, fairies, or angels.</br>    <br><br>Falling for b8 m8 don't post in b8 threads</br></br>    <br>Falling for b8 m8 don't post in b8 threads</br>  <br><br>You act like there aren't autistic christfags reading these threads getting butthurt regardless.

He forgot to turn the hairspray nozzle around, and when he sprayed it, it basically just lit his fucking sleeve on fire.<br><br>The second it lit, he screamed like an absolute girl and freaked the fuck out. Me and Derek got the fuck outta there, and he had to go to the emergency room for some really minor burns. He never even got in trouble for it, but I knew his dad and he probably beat the hell from him after that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>u serious m8</br>  <br><br> Once, she put a presentation in wich se appear naked with his fingers into her pussy </br></br>  <br>I'm going to call you "Random Capitalization Man."
