I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across theUSA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it.

Sauce?</br>    cringe thread   dutch   <br>Cringe? that actually looks awesome as fuck you autism.</br>  <br> you autism. </br>  <br>pls commit suicide</br>  <br>rather gay</br>    <br>What am I looking at here?<br>Did they just whip up some butter and then put it in a beer?<br>Or is that just some non-alcoholic mix-drink for kids.<br>The first would be mild cringe, the second wouldn't be anything at all.</br></br></br></br>  <br>How are movie-themed drinks autistic? Or is it just because it's Harry Potter? Either way, this is some weak shit, OP. <br>Also, wizards aside, that shit looks tasty and you know it.</br></br>  <br>newfag<br><br>pls an hero</br></br></br>  <br>hes right, its not really cringe.<br><br> that actually looks awesome as fuck you autism. <br>that is cringe</br></br></br></br>  <br>Butterbeer sounds pretty fucking good. I dunno what's cringeworthy about drinks. What are you, some super-anti-alcohol nazi?</br>  <br>harry potter based beverage</br>  I'm pretty sure they actually serve those at Universal Studios at an obviously themed area.  <br> calling newfag <br>go suicide too newnigga</br></br>  <br>What's the cringe worthy part?</br>  <br>How does that answer my question?<br>I know where butterbeer comes from. I'm just saying what did they make the drink showcased in the image?<br>Butterbeer is not real drink and it was never explained what it's made of in the books.</br></br></br>  <br>you cant tell someone to suicide.<br><br>its commit suicide, you dont just suicide.<br><br>not the guy you replied to but your'e a dumbfuck</br></br></br></br></br>  i find it cringe sitting in a cafe doing wizard stuff.<br>look i know it looks tasty but its pretty autistic if you sit there cosplaying harry potter and ron weasley</br>  <br>Because it's Harry Potter and Harry Potter is for le nerds. Bottom line is that OP is a faggot and his post wasn't even cringe-worthy.</br>  <br><br>Pretty much....getting excited over a movie based off a children's book is pretty 'tistic. But using it as an excuse to make creative mixed drinks is completely reasonable imo. Fuck I'd drink alcoholic beverages based off fucking Sanic if they looked good.</br></br>  <br>i dunno ask them</br>  <br>Will you pls suicide yourself?</br>  <br>why dont u go suicide urself</br>  <br>Um....I'm pretty sure this is stuff you're supposed to make at home because you want a reason to get drunk and there happens to be a Harry Potter marathon on...I dont think they sell this anywhere</br>  aight sorry is no cringe, i just am a faggot.<br>start the cringe already</br>  <br>Just fucking look up butterbeer recipe. Fuck!</br>  <br>It's warmed, de-carbonated cream soda with imitation rum flavoring, sugar, and butter added. It is then topped with vanilla-infused whipped cream.</br>  <br>I think it actually is a real drink<br><br><br>http://medievalcookery.com/recipes/<wbr>butterbeer.html</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>So yeah, it's just an non-alcoholic drink for kids.<br>How is that cringe at all?<br>Serving this to a bunch of 8-year olds who are into Harry Potter is a decent idea.</br></br></br>  did you guys really think they but alcohol in it?<br>in the books the students drank it</br>  <br>alrijgth alright i get the idea!</br>  <br>You are the cringe</br>  i hope this 404's  <br>thanks</br>  http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=hnUw<wbr>T_hmgWs</wbr>  [ ]  <br>is this supposed to be cringe?</br>  <br>You clearly didn't watch the whole thing.</br>  <br>Probably because it's Harry Autist based. I could name at least ten movie-based drinks that made it in the real world. Bukkake and Rivella are the first that come to mind.</br>  Washington thread  360  yoo any 509 in here  <br>509 as well. pullman here.</br>  <br><br><br><br>nice <br>Moses hole checking in</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>What year at WSU?</br>  Puyallup  any Olympia/Lacey or Spanaway?  <br>College is for losers.
