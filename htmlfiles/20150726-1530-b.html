[ Hey /b/? What's your excuse for not having a gf?  those shorts are wicked awesome.  Mario and Yoshi  i see a good age gap between the two.  <br>I've seen some good yoshi porn tho.</br>  <br>the harpies suck the life out of you and leave you penniless.</br>  Because women are people and not a trophy of status we're entitled to.  don't want one :\  <br> sarcasm? </br>  here yah go, bros  because all these squaires make a circle  im not smart enough to meld a horse and a nigger together like you OP  <br><br>I do.<br><br>Her retarded ass is in the shower high as a kite talking to herself so loudly it's starting to wake up our 12 week old son. <br><br>I should have listened to my Nan &amp; married a nice Irish girl. This Russian woman is fucking insane.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They better have the ac on, I feel hot looking at it.</br>  I'm over it.<br><br>I'm 31. I've been in about five long-term relationships. I've been married. It's all a farce. Romantic love is just a ploy by nature to get you to reproduce. If sex didn't feel amazing, nobody would ever bother. I'm still a primate, I still have biological urges, but I can sait them with a cleverly-shaped piece of silicone and a little lube. I go to work, I come home, my bank account climbs, and I periodically buy something neat. I don't want kids. I don't want a person in my life to constantly have to impress or entertain or tolerate. I don't even want fucking pets, I just want people to leave me the fuck alone.<br><br>It's like suicide, only I still get to see new movies.</br></br></br></br>  Every gf left me without saying what was wrong. All of them happy relationships.. well maybe not the first one but she was pretty fucking hot and I wanted to bang.  <br><br>I can't find a woman as beautiful as her.</br></br>  <br><br>I have nothing to offer anyone, and be a waste of their time. <br><br> Besides I am a year away from wizardry so to hell with it.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I like this guy.</br></br>  <br>it's from Canada.</br>  <br>Fuckin post it</br>  <br>i am on the phone.

They're choosing to miss out</br></br></br>      <br>lol "god tier" and "rap" in same sentence fragment.</br>  <br>What if some of us have listened to MBDTF and just find it to be bad? I loved College Dropout, Late Registration and Graduation but I just found MBDTF to be boring for the most part. There are a few great songs on there but I don't think the album is anywhere near the quality of his first two.</br>  <br>You have good taste nigga</br>  <br>Captain Murphy is Flylo<br>shit guess i took the beat</br></br>  <br>I feel like they know it's good but don't want to admit cuz kanye</br>  <br>Daaaaamn.

I'm just at walhell while I finish school. I'm five classes away from a BA</br>  Worked at Hasta La Pasta Italian grill. I bussed tables it wasnt a bad job, old people would have parties and whit and leave their 8 dollar glasses of margaritas and wine and whit behind. Stupid old rich people, so before I left work I would clean the private rooms(no cameras in these rooms) at night get drunk on left behind alcohol and walk home.  <br><br>Just finished school anon, I'm working on it. I've gotten so much more bitter towards people since I started working there. It's not good for a social life.</br></br>  I worked these shit jobs you guys are talking about while in college. After getting out and getting a big boy job with responsibilities and being very humbled when you fuck up, I kind of miss these shit tier jobs. I met good people at those jobs and made good memories and never had to take my work home or worry about shit. We could just leave at closing and go out for drinks or whatever. Cherish those shitty jobs while you can.  Hospital janitor here. <br><br>Lazy fucking CNA and nursing staff cause us to do much more work than needed. <br><br>Full toilet hats (the little plastic things they piss into) Commodes full of shit, body fluids were not supposed to deal with, all left for us to clean.<br> <br>My supervisors are fucking retards, we could get more work done if they didn't get involved.<br><br>This place tuns on fucked up FML</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Retail inventory<br> we show up at 7 AM, have to be done by 2 PM <br> race the clock all morning <br>:&gt;hurr durr store isn't prepped<br> herp derp customers think we can help them <br> lousy background music with way too many GEICO ads <br> tfw stuck in traffic on the way home <br><br>FML</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> BA <br><br>So you can continue to work there or...?</br></br></br>  <br>What kind of job do you have where you don't have to deal directly with customers?</br>   be cook <br> don't deal with shitty customers <br> only their shitty orders and the dumbass servers who allow it <br> in the middle of the rush <br> "she wants 3 different sauces on her pasta" <br> BITCHWHAT <br> "can't you just like pour it on top" <br> no actually, I have to make each of the sauces she wants to order and you should goddamn know this because you've worked here a year <br> waste 3 pans and 3 bowls when we're already short on both <br><br> "she wants the chicken on one plate, the noodles on another plate, and the sauce on a different plate" <br> fuckingcomeon <br><br> guy orders linguini with mussels and clams <br> double mussels, double clams <br> server only charges for double mussels <br> do you think clams grow on trees bitch <br><br> Spaghetti and Meatballs <br> 6 oz pasta, 6 oz of meatballs, 8 oz sauce <br> "extra meatballs, and also meat sauce" <br> that is 3 times as much meat as pasta <br> they finish it <br> how do you live with yourself <br><br> we don't have a microwave <br> server asks me to warm up coffee on stove <br> customer complained it's cold <br> no it's not but ok <br> coffee is literally boiling when it comes off the stove <br> taken straight out to dining room <br> gets sent back <br> "it's still cold" <br> what are you a dragon <br><br> "she wants gluten-free pasta with her chicken parmesan, she has a gluten allergy" <br> grill chicken breast, melt cheese on it, put on top of tasteless rubbery corn-pasta <br> food gets sent back <br> "she wanted the bread crumbs on the chicken that it usually comes with" <br> HOW THE FUCK DO YOU NOT KNOW WHAT GLUTEN IS WHEN YOU'RE ALLERGIC TO IT YOU STUPID BITCH <br> OH YOU DON'T KNOW BECAUSE YOU JUMPED ON THE LATEST "HEALTH" FOOD TREND <br> I BET YOU'VE BEEN SCARFING DOWN OUR TABLE BREAD BY THE LOAF </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> "less demanding" <br>  works in fast food <br><br>Get the fuck out</br></br></br></br>  <br>Retail inventory is easy as shit.</br>  <br>Interesting. I work as surgical tech and I have to say I really do abuse the ability to just call housekeeping to come clean the room after surgery. But it's how we (CNA's, nurses, techs, etc.) are trained. <br><br>Some patient's family member just posted on Facebook his chair was dirty and the bathroom had "mold" in it in the particular room. Those corporate assholes have a typical knee jerk reaction and just immediately fire the house janitor responsible for that room. Folks think a hospital stay is supposed to be a four star hotel experience.</br></br></br>  <br>Surgical tech...my "customers" are asleep when I deal with them. But on the flip side you have to deal with nurse/doctor/anesthesia/tech drama.</br>  <br>Get something mildly better while I continue school. Fucktard.</br>  <br>Nigga, to me that shit was hard. Do you have any idea how hard it is making 4-5 burgers in 3 minutes or less? That shit was hectic and hard 24/7 because I worked in MCDONALDS DOWNTOWN NYC. There was NEVER a dull moment. That shit was more demanding than a gf who is cock hungry and all I did was slow them down, so I left.</br>  <br>Retail in general is easy as shit<br><br> 19. Get job making $9.25/h <br> work really fucking hard all day everyday. <br> meet gm, DM, and vp <br> in a year and a half running entire back operations making $18/h <br> 6 months later store manager making 50k a year <br> be me today at 25. Running a B volume store in flordia. They paid me to move here. I work 50 hours a week and make 90k a year.  <br><br><br>Hurrrrrr durrrrrrrr. Retail is hard</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Being a cashier at walmart actually is kinda fun. It's easy as all fuck. Plus it's helping me with my weight problem, because I keep losing weight.<br>2ez.</br>  <br> not being good enough for fast food <br>This guy</br></br>  <br>Fuck you, faggot.</br>  <br>Wait, you work at Wendy's, and you're going to look down on others? You do realize that food service and hobos collecting cans are on par, and the grifter is actually better than you because he has entrepreneurial spirit?</br>  <br>Been on both sides, and honestly fast food is pretty demanding. Fast paced, little down-time, hot &amp; humid environment, constant danger of injury, having to swallow shit from idiot customers and douche managers, and perhaps worst of all knowing that you're a nameless cog in a meaningless job and that your very existence is considered a punchline, all for shit wage. <br><br>My advice to anyone stuck in fast-food; try to get a job in a "real" restaurant. Even if you're just the dish pig, the environment is much better, and possibly they could teach you skills for an actual culinary career if you so choose.</br></br></br>  <br>It's not hard if you suck up hardcore. When I was young and in retail while in college I just couldn't make myself do it. I did have a friend who sucked up to the company so much and made it to manager. We make equivalent salaries, but the stress you go through running a corporate store for even 90k....yeah, no thanks.</br>  <br>Ohhhh no. Flipping burgers one grill is hard.</br>  <br>How much $ do they offer.

Normally, I wouldn't care, but he runs away, hides, hits, and has an inclination for grabbing my butt.<br> be end of first day <br> parents come to pick up their kids <br> shit kids dad comes to get him <br> pull him aside <br> let him know what he's done all day <br> "He's four, you're putting too much pressure on him" <br> Didn't know not disobeying basic commands was difficult <br> "Have you tried giving a time out" <br> He's been giving himself time outs <br> "So when can we put him in hockey skates" <br> I need a drink <br><br>I've worked as a skate guard, had some issues with customers, but when there is a parent and their child involved, just shoot yourself now and save yourself from the pain. <br>I'm still working the camp right now, I have a 17 year old assistant, but she burned out faster than I did. We give shit kid candy to do stuff. It's been working well. I hope he gets cavities.<br>Through talking to the kid and his dad and brother (who isn't as bad) I've found out that they are extremely wealthy. They have two nannies. One for each child.

Every girl I've ever dated has beat around the bush about me being gay.<br><br>They're probably right given that almost every single condom I've ever bought has been used to put something up my butt.<br><br>Just when I saw this thread I was about to fap to a tranny porn video and fantasize about being the tranny bottom.<br><br>So, yea, thanks OP. I'm 100% a gay bottom who needs to find a guy to be a bitch for.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  all the time  <br><br>Have you tried craiglist? Many bi-curious men in there, I have heard</br></br>  <br>Jip, even fucked a guy and shemale to be sure. (as it turns out, no)</br>  <br>I did but im just not attracted to men at all, like right now id barf if i watched gay porn, but sometimes its the only thing that turns me on.<br>Ive had sex with women and pussy is definetly ny rhing.</br></br>  <br><br>are you sure? Maybe you didn't try anal...</br></br>  <br>Yea, but I'm scared of AIDS and crazy people. I've actually had options in person in the past... I used to work with an ex army captain who made it REAL obvious to me that he was gay.<br><br>Used to fap to the idea of being his bottom, but I never pursued it because I suspected he was a bottom too.</br></br></br>  After having a sexual encounter with 2 of my cousin, one male and the other female(separate encounters) when I was maybe 12, I know that I like women and I'm straight.<br><br>Encounters will full way too since I was at that age where I just wanted my dick in something and my cousin(s) were happy to oblige since I guess they just wanted a dick in them and to feel the warmth of another person's body on them which I enjoyed too.<br><br>Me cumming inside my male cousin didn't have as much as an impact on his life as when I came inside my female cousin and she got pregnant.</br></br></br></br>  <br>my gay what?</br>    <br>I did, i loved it when i had that gay phase thing, tried it next time when i wasnt in that state and i literally vomited once i put something up there. <br>Also i forgot to mention at those times i also fantasize about being a tranny/sissy and cock whore...<br>Then i fap to that and feel pure shame.</br></br></br>  Who is my gay?  <br>Top kik</br>  <br>What about my gay? He does good lawn work.</br>  <br>no, but i do wonder why all the MODS are such niggerish faggots</br>  Now dating this wonderful trans mtf :) yes I may be gay for this same reason.
