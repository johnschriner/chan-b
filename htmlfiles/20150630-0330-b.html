One, it doesn't fucking matter what it stands for. Free speech protects unpopular expression too. Two, what it stands for is a desire for local self governance, which is exactly what the founding fathers actually wanted. Hate to tell you this you ignorant cuck, but there were no "good guys" in the US Civil War. The north was no more anti slavery than the south, and the emancipation proclemation did nothing and Lincoln knew it.</br>  <br><br>If it has SO much historical significance, why isn't the fucking flag displayed in a museum? Hmm?</br></br>  because slavery.  <br>Wrong. The south wanted to follow the path the founding fathers had in mind and not become the shithole the country is now.</br>  <br>they didn't want to be apart of the nation because they were going to lose their slave industry. it wasn't about them becoming a nation, it was about fighting for human rights or enslaving blacks.</br>  <br>stfu retard, you never know what you're talking about and you post all the time.</br>  <br>everything else is. flags are special. when you put a flag in the ground you are claiming that ground for what is on the flag, if it's an enemy country or ideology. <br><br>do you understand that or not?</br></br></br>  <br>i have no problems with any redneck flying this flag. i just don't think it should be flown by any government entity. better?</br>  <br>Not sure what you're trying to say<br><br><br>I like how this strawman comic completely ignores the fact that the flag in the comic actually wasn't used to represent the confederacy for most of the war.<br><br><br>Why wouldn't I be able to?

Fewer game breaking bugs and overall better playability and sense of direction and progression.<br>Fallout 3 was a better experience but mostly just because of timing and having played it first. Compared to other games released around that time (compared to games released around new vegas) fallout 3 steals the show despite it being buggy at best and broken at worst.<br>On the whole, I enjoyed playing fallout 3 the first time I played it more than new vegas the first time.</br></br>  <br> http://strawpoll.me/4773755 <br> people saying fallout3&gt;fallout2 </br></br>  The one you like the most.  <br> http://strawpoll.me/4773755 <br>If the top answer here isn't 2 I'm gonna have to choke a bitch.</br></br>   fallout 3 better than fallout 2 <br>HAVE YOU NIGGERS NEVER PLAYED FALLOUT 2 BEFORE VOTING GOD DAMN IM MAD</br>  2 is the overall best one.<br><br>1 and New Vegas is pretty good.<br><br>Tictacs is very good, if it has a bunch of lore rape like talking furry deathclaws chilling with actually retarded tribals in your BoS base.<br><br>Fallout 3 is somewhat but it's incredibly fucking stupid. <br><br> "I'm looking for my dad, a middle aged man." gee. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>easy niggra</br>  <br>This should be the general consensus.</br>  <br>Fallout 3 might've had a few not entirely logical quests, but atleast it was fun and immersive and there was always something cool to find.<br><br>I haven't played 1 and 2 but if they're as bare as new vegas I don't think I'd like them.</br></br></br>  <br> I haven't played 1 and 2 <br> 2 <br> bare <br> fallout 2 being fucking BARE <br>opinion discarded as ignorant dipshit who wants to talk about things he doesn't even fucking know about</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>*Fallout 3 is somewhat decent.<br><br>The problem is that FO3 is a very shallow game compared to 1, 2 and NV.<br><br>Read here.<br><br>http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysi<wbr>dedtale/?p=27085<br><br>The original Fallout game was a gritty world where you explore the vast California desert in search of a water purification chip. It drew influences from Mad Max, campy 50’s sci-fi movies, and pulpy comics of the same era. It had a streak of pitch-black comedy running throughout it. It wasn’t about the 1950’s, it was about the future that the 1950’s anticipated. It was a game that took place in the future of the past.<br><br>Bethesda saw this template and concluded that a Fallout game needed to take place in the desert, it needed to be about water, it should contain screwball comedy, and that it should be the 1950’s forever.</br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  1. Fallout 2<br>2. Fallout NV<br>3. Fallout 3<br>4. Fallout (1)<br>5. Fallout Tactics (could be higher, since it had MP, never played MP tho)</br></br></br></br>  <br>Jesus christ I kinda coasted through the fallout 3 story but I never realized how fucking retarded it is.<br><br>Now I'll never be able to play the FO3 main quest without cringing.</br></br></br>  <br>Fallout 3 is the best game, but the worst 'Fallout' game.</br>  why.. why does the broken, poorly ported mess that's new vegas lead.  <br>I don't see how NV was poorly ported? The best version of NV was on PC and once it was patched it ran quite well.</br>  <br>You mean after Bethesda succeeded in waiting for a community fix? the only reason gamebryo is so mod friedly, is that Bethsoft is a bunch of lazy fucks. Also, both 3 and nv have almost no compatiblity with win 7 and above. The integrated facegen engine is known to lag horribly, because it's poorly optimized. Yes, it may be the best version, but it's still shit.</br>  <br>I'm running NV and 3 on Win 8 just fine and I'm not a huge faggot like you</br>  <br>because the content, the game writing, and the overall atmosphere of the game was more true to the original games, such as 1 and 2 - with a new gameplay interface from 3. that's why.</br>  <br>It's okay though because everytime NV crashes for no reason I go see what /b/ is doing.<br>47% achievements complete. Still got a long was to go before 4 drops.</br></br>  Basically if you don't agree that 2 is the overall best you are a colossal pleb and should commit suicide rapidly.  <br>fallout 4 gonn b gr8</br>  <br>this</br>  <br>It ran like shit on ps3 tho.<br><br>Dunno why they couldn't have worked on the console ports more since you can't mod them to fix them.</br></br></br>  4  <br> 2015 <br> 4chan <br> not respecting other peoples opinions and differences </br></br></br>  <br>if you're retarded you probably have a different opinion on a lot of things.</br>  <br>I can't respect others opinions when they're wrong.</br>  <br>Opinions cannot be wrong, you colossal faggot.<br> only facts <br><br><br>Eat shit. What movie is that from?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I believe that Hank Hill is one the most complex and realistic characters in Animation. Although on the surface he appears to be nothing more than a redneck, if you actually watch the show and read between the lines, he's a lot more.<br>Hank Hill, and by extension King of The Hill as a whole, is at its core about showing that one group is not always right, and one group is not always wrong. It's not just blind Liberal bashing by some angry Texans, or angsty Liberal bawwing like Family Guy, it's somewhere in the middle.<br>Hank is a man who represents traditional family values. He works a just-above blue collar job, has an ugly wife, and a kid he fails to understand. He enjoys working on his lawn, grilling, and selling propane (and propane accessories).<br>because he represents traditional values, he often butts heads with newer, more liberal ideas. Now about half the time, he will have a hard time adjusting, but ultimately realize that it isn't that bad, or is even correct. But the other half of the time, he exposes it for the bullshit it is and tries to save those who have been brainwashed.<br>And that's the thing, Hank isn't a racist or Homophobe, or even a devout Republican. If that was the point of the show, he would have voted for Bush in that one episode. No, Hank is a good man who just has a hard time adjusting.<br>Hank stands by his family, his friends, and his family values, and this is why he is a good character. He has a hard time understanding his son, like a lot of parents, but ultimately loves him and accepts him for what he is.<br>When you really get down to it, Hank is so much more than your average sitcom father. Unlike the bumbling Homer, he is a very real man who many people can relate to THEIR fathers. he is the next progression in mature cartoons and sitcoms, a complex character, not a 1 dimensional caricature.<br>In short, he is the Average Joe the typical person represents, and that's a good thing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fallout Tactics <br>had a big LAN party <br>32 people with 6 on a persons team<br>fucking epic</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fallout 3.<br>Mostly because I played it first, New vegas is cool, but the story wasn't as interesting or engaging for me, I wanted more interesting Vault designs and "hidden" backstories.<br><br>Fallout 3 had amazing things you could piece together if you explored the world and playing it through for the first time completely blind I didn't have any issues with it at all that a lot of people seemed to have.<br><br>So, that's why.<br><br>Though New Vegas did have somewhat better combat, the world didn't feel nearly as threatening or fun, or like a wasteland like Fallout 3's map was.<br><br>But I think it's silly to say either one is truly objectively worse than the other, everyone has their opinion, personally I really love Fallout 3.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>+ I have never played Fallout 1 or 2 or any others than 3 and NV.<br><br>Reason for this is that the games seem very dated and the way 1 and 2 play is just not for me, that's literally my only problem with them, I should probably try them out at some point though, but not sure if it's worth it anymore.</br></br></br>   the reason why people don't like 1 and 2 is because the best parts of the game are 90% text and they are too stupid to read   <br>yes bingo</br>  <br><br>That's somewhat true, but at the same time when I play video games, I play them because I want to play a game, not read something. While sometimes the best stories are indeed within the text (like in Fallout 3 for me the best part was the computers telling stories) I prefer having the story told to me differently. <br><br>It's hard for me to go from a game that has a lot of action and things happening all the time, to a game that's almost nothing but walls of text to read. (Given I've never tried, as mentioned, probably should.)<br><br>I'm sure that the games were fucking amazing and probably still are pretty damn great to this day, but for the "modern" gamer, it's a tough sell.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  What's everyone thinking Fallout 4's sidequests will be like?  <br>it's a story driven open-ended turn-based strategy/rpg game not an action game. you're in the franchise if you just want "things happening all the time"</br>  <br> for the "modern" gamer, it's a tough sell <br> "modern" gamer <br> muh braindead cawwadoodies </br></br></br>  <br>Maybe I phrased it wrong, I didn't quite mean it like that.<br><br>Given I've never played 1 or 2 so I can't say much, but from the little game play I've seen, it doesn't seem like it would be fun for me personally.<br><br>Although, again it's just a hard sell for me since I got into the series from F3 and I haven't really played any turn based games in my life. Like I've tried a bunch but all of them have been more or less annoying with the combat system making the game not as fun to play for my personal tastes.<br><br>Maybe I'll go and try them out and see if the story is enough to keep me going through it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice trips.<br><br>I understand what you mean, but not everyone can like everything and as someone that hasn't grown up with nor played a lot of turn based games from back in the day, it's hard to go back.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't like everything either but FO2 is objectively one of the best RPGs. Maybe you just don't like RPGs.</br>  <br><br>New Vegas is amazing. I have to play through it again every few months or so.</br></br>  Hands down 3, people love to hate it because it took a new direction but objectively it was the best: best world, best atmosphere, most effort put into it.<br><br>I have played 2,3 and NV, all with all the expansions and the order goes:<br><br>3, then 2, then distantly NV. New Vegas was an unfinished lazy piece of shit that only ever shined when it had a few callbacks to 2.</br></br></br></br>  <br> people love to hate it because it took a new direction <br>The direction was DOWN. It's not a good thing.</br></br>  Fallout 3 is best, it finally realized the potential of the world from the first 2, to the point where it makes you wonder if interplay eventually planned a 3D installment based on how good the world suits it.<br><br>Unfortunately it is also quite different in tone to the others and so 4 probably won't follow in its footsteps.</br></br>  <br>Could be. Though I play them all the time, just not turn based ones.</br>  <br><br>The direction was darker and more harrowing, with a greater emphasis on the apocalypse. The goofier, fun atmosphere of 2 was necessary because a top down, graphically limited rpg like 2 would be so boring trying to be realistic.<br><br>I think its a matter of taste but 3 was much more compelling and immersive for me, even though I played 2 long before and loved it too.</br></br></br></br>  Only think I can say 1 and 2 had better than 3 was much better character loadouts where you could play as some really odd builds - I fucked up my first 3 playthrough trying to recreate my hand to hand agile with jinxed perk character from 2 and it took me a while to learn to play 3 you need small guns and nothing else. <br><br>Still 3 is the best one.</br></br>  <br>I don't actually know why people think New Vegas is better than 3, anyone want to tell me?</br>  <br>Your all a bunch of cod kiddies.<br>Like 3&amp;NV.<br>Fucking faggots.</br></br></br>  <br>There wasn't anything cool to find other then the aliens an point look out fallout 3 is and was shit.<br>Just because you played it when you first got a boner doesn't mean it's good grow up and learn to judge shit on its value.<br>Fallout 3 was a new graphic for fallout seris but it's pails to 1$&amp;2 and brotherhood.</br></br></br>  <br><br>It's literally only the butthurt that 3 was different than 2. New Vegas was by all objective accounts a shitty game, it was a lazy, unfinished derivative of 2 with occasional "hey remember this guy from 2!". <br><br>I loved 2 but it needed the goofiness and jokes to compensate for the lack of immersiveness inherent in older games, so when 3 pulled it back to just black humour and otherwise grittiness I thought it was amazing. <br><br>But some people got furious about this, basically turning a 13+ game to 18+. <br><br>Anyway my main gripes with NV was that the graphics were shit compared to 3, the world was bland and empty comparatively, and the story was a bit unbelievable.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>http://<span>youtu.be/wvwlt4FqmS0  [ ]<br>Here you go niggers.<br>Get educated.</br></br></br>  <br><br>There wasn't anything to look at - obviously coming from someone who's never actually played the first 2. <br><br>They were some of the first games I ever played and for your information the wasteland in them is a 'minimap' where you skim across on the way to settlements. <br><br>If you're going to try be a hipster about a popular new game, at least know a little about the games you're pretending to play. <br><br>3 may have faults but the wasteland was much fuller than any other installment. Retard.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>kek</br></br>  <br>Your a nigger play 1&amp;2<br>Then you can have an opinion.<br>It's like oh Diablo 3 is better then 1&amp;2...oh what no I never played them lol cuz of de grawphics.<br>I bet you like the wazer wafle too you pinko.</br></br></br></br>  <br>When I first started up and played NV through without basically sleeping once I was very disappointed with the story and the world.<br><br>Which is why I never understood why people liked it so much, it's fine as a game and it has some good and fun moments, but F3 was incredible for me, with all the characters, quests and stories in the game that could find by exploring the wastes I enjoy the game still greatly even after probably tens of times completing it, it's always a joy to go back into the wastes and experience it.<br><br>New Vegas I played through 3 times and a 4th time with all the DLC and honestly I don't want to play it anymore, meanwhile I still play F3 every now and then and I haven't uninstalled it once. <br><br>Nice to find people who agree when mostly I just see people talking about how NV is better.<br><br>It makes me feel validated for having an opinion and as a human I like when people like the same things I like.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Cod faggot who likes mass effect and cocks and doesn't like or know what a role playing is.</br>  <br><br>Most people prefer 3, it's just the neckbeard hub of /b/ where people didn't like a RPG becoming a mainstream hit. But saleswise and review wise 3 was much better received.</br></br>  plebs.... all of you.....<br><br>everyone knows the greatest fallout is wasteland 2</br></br>  <br>Fallout 3 isn't an Role Playing Game.<br>You have two options.</br></br>  <br><br>Pretty sure if you build a character and have an input into the story outcome its an RPG. Being turn based isn't a necessity.</br></br>  Fallout 3 finally made Bloody Mess what it was meant to be, so 3.  <br>Graphic don't matter when it comes to gameplay<br>Cod kiddie <br>Also I played all fallouts besides brotherhood and both wastelands.<br>I loves desert rpg <br>Let's not mention the anime I've watch <br>Also what do they eat in fallout 3</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Except nearly nothing matters in FO3. All the sidequests exists in their own microcosm.<br><br>The only quest that seriously affects you as a player is the blow up megaton one. And even then moira fucking brown doesn't die because why should players miss out on the high quality content by making the 'wrong' choice?</br></br></br>  can we get a wincest story thread going again?<br>i'll repost mine from earlier<br><br> be me <br> be 19, have flirtatious sister who is 17 (always flirted with me at home etc) <br> be first night on a cruise liner in med <br> dinner time <br> have to share a table with another family <br> they have a daughter who is hot as fuck <br> dat cleavage <br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/624737995#p624737995">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes i'm </br>  <br>OP here</br>  Op still writing?

I have discovered a video of Emily Axford, that girl that is well known from her work at CollegeHumor, that features her in a gang bang! Here is my evidence.  <br>You're not the sharpest knife in the drawer, are you son.</br>  <br>Wow that's neat! I didn't know Matt Murdock posted on 4chan.</br>  I will be posting the full sized screenshots.  <br><br><br>doesn't look like her</br></br></br>  <br>different lighting and different facial expressions cause that to seem to be the case.</br>  <br> thinly veiled collegehumor clickbait </br>  <br>Doesnt look like her</br>  <br>Nice try faggot</br>  <br>Why would college Humor try to advertise by saying one of their employees is a whore?</br>  <br>How fucking lonely are you, kid?</br>  <br>You do realise OP is always a faggot?</br>    I don't even care who it is. I just wanna see more. Those strings hng  still hot, sauce  <br>OP here. I have more proof.

Good, it means I am correct.  <br>if you've come across the video then post it if not fuck off</br>  Baking in le epic bread  <br>I watched it on the 24th of May, 2015 and the dumbass that I am forgot to save the link. I looked through my history and couldn't find it. I will keep looking.</br>  <br>haha... haha.... ha.... that's not how it works.</br>  <br><br>The both have black hair and a face!<br><br>It's her alright!</br></br></br></br>  <br>so youre saying you found it took screen shots of but didnt bookmark or save the link anywhere or remember her porn name?</br>  <br>If I were wrong, surely you could easily prove I am wrong.</br>    <br>and green eyes, and a similar face structure, and white skin. IT IS HER!</br>    <br> I'll take basic logial fallacy for $400 please, Alex </br>  <br>you can't prove you are right therefore you are wrong. you have the positive claim and burden of proof it isnt our job to prove everything wrong</br>    <br>What can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence. I have provided evidence thus you must prove it is faulty. Seeing as how you have continuously failed at doing so, I am right and you are wrong.</br>  <br><br>LOL<br><br>Hitchens Razor Bitch!</br></br></br></br>  <br>I literally posted it before you did and I have provided evidence. Now you can either prove my evidence is faulty or accept defeat.</br>  <br>youve claimed to have a video and posted blurry screen shots. how the fuck is that proof all three screenshots are of a blowjob and if it was a gangbang scene why would all he screenshots you take be of the same shit. your proof is as much as a redneck having a blurry photo of a light in the sky and jumping to the conclusion its aliens</br>  <br><br>The look similar is not evidence you fuckwit.</br></br>  <br>Her face is clearly present in all three screenshots dipshit.</br>  Adriana Chekik or some shit right.  <br>They are so similar, either it is her or she has a clone/twin.</br>  <br>Have you considered that there are people on this earth who look very similar to one another, even though they are not related?</br>  <br>The noses aren't the same at all. Porn chick has a narrow bridge upturned, rounded tip. <br><br>College humor chick has a widened bridge and straight out, narrow tip. <br><br>Unless she went all Michael Jackson and hit a new nose, that's not her. <br><br>Thanks for playing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>all of the same shot? in an entire gang bang scene. why only those three shots? and who takes screen shots of a video then cant find the video where they knew she was in it and decided to take photos of but not remember?</br>  <br><br>Look! Difinitive evidence that Bigfoot is real!</br></br>  <br>No... as far as we know that's someone that looks like her, you're supposed to prove it's actually her.<br><br>holy shit did you even finish school?</br></br></br>  <br>http://webmup.com/5b428/</br>  <br>I think the video was a complication of several videos so perhaps it only had that one scene.</br>  <br>Your analogy is terrible.

It's the best imo. Haven't played it in awhile, because I'm at the level where you need to be a member to play and I don't have the time or money to do that. You can make a free account. You just don't get as many skills and less of an area to explore/quest/tasks/ect. But it's still fun. I have friends that play the free version all the time. RS3 is more like wow and RS Classic is well Classic.</br>  if you have been a fan of Diablo, then look at "path of exile"<br>The Last part will come this summer. but 3/4 is free to play already. And NO PAY TO WIN! You can only buy new texture for your char.</br>  <br>as if classes even need that many abilities on their bars after pruning cockfag</br>  <br>holy shit, you're actually playing SWTOR without a subscription?</br>    <br><br>Being edgy enough to focus on one of the two suggestions for the sole purpose of giving oneself a reason to talk shit<br><br>You're a sad, confused little guy</br></br></br></br>  <br>you think this is me retard? you should know wippe</br>  <br>the ways things are going, you'll likely have to wait til 2025 yes</br>  <br>Also forgot to say, Guild Wars 2 and Elder Scrolls Online are good too. Even though people call ESO Shit. I like it for the stories/quests/ect. idgaf</br>  <br>LOTRO went from really fucking good to absolute shit.

Very classic stuff so far, but done consistently good.  <br>welp, they overdid questlines, and over-updated the game, causing lots of bugs and overall discomfort to the player. Its becoming some runescape like shit. They keep increasing the cap level every few months. you work your way up only to be further set back.</br>  <br>Oh, trust me, I love Tolkien stuff too. It was awesome that the game was based off the books and not the movies. <br><br>However, it more then ticked me off when I logged back in after the free to play transition and found that I had to BUY the quests in an area I had unlocked a year ago!</br></br></br>  Play a Private server.<br><br>Kronos for vanilla, Dalaran for Wrath, or wait for corecraft for TBC.</br></br>  <br>Fucking gay ass WoW with its disney cartoon fucking graphics and retarded plot lines. Fuck you, i bet if i kicked you in the ass a thousand cocks would fall out</br>  <br>is it worth going back to WoW? I just never knew how to make money in that game besides besides being a lower tier mining slave =/</br>  <br>he's just a dick<br><br>i didnt play much of LOTRO, but from what i got out of it everyone on there is pretty chill, and really into the game. it's got a strong community<br><br>i got banned for saying "fuck" though. watch out for that, they have a very low tolerance for abuse and swearing. but again that's kinda cool cause it weeds out the dickheads and means only nice people are left</br></br></br></br></br>  We need more sandbox MMO's. Those are good..  <br>Ffxiv dude...</br>  <br>Are you sure you logged back onto the same world?</br>  I okay WOW TBC on a 2.4.3 godtier private blizzlike Server<br><br> nearly bugfree <br> all raids working (even SW) <br> 1,5k-2k Players online </br></br></br></br>  <br>I will say that you will have a hard time finding a game that will give you the shakes during a good fight like EVE</br>  <br>name?</br>  <br>Don't listen to this faggot. I've played RuneScape for 10 years and I regret every minute of it, because once you're hooked on the grinding for exp, that's all you do. Grind grind grind.</br>  <br>Is WoW bad then? It has all of those and more jackhead</br>  <br>Come join me</br>  <br>The problem with FF14 is that it relies on the "Run the same 2-3 instances until a new patch" logic.<br>That's literally all of the endgame. PvP is pretty dead and the current design doesn't exactly make it fun. It gets boring fast.<br><br><br>PoE is fucking boring too. For the sake of leveling until the end of A4M, it's not bad. You get to watch your build grow until completion.<br>After A4M, it's nothing but maps. And by maps, I mean not a lot of maps. Map drop rates, at least on beta, suck after about 70. You'll be hard pressed to maintain a decent map pool.<br>Aside from that, maps are a shitty endgame anyway.<br><br><br>Eve is the only valid option.<br>You just need a purpose and a corp. Lots to do, PvP is alive. The only trouble is training time.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>no it's r u n e scape<br>as in Are You Any Scape? (scape being slang for pro when the game first came out)<br>idiot</br></br></br>  <br>Weeds out the dickheads and means only nice people are left. Basically hardly anyone is left except mostly housewives, RP nerds and kids.</br>  path of exile although it's arpg  <br><br>excalibur wow</br></br>  <br>Clearly it's rune scape<br><br>You puppy raping meth head</br></br></br>  <br>This is consol but i loved it, amazing graphics, immersive story, no super gay fishing/mining/runecrafting bullshit</br>  <br><br>TERA has the most fun mechanics, not sure about the content, was a while ago since I last played it.</br></br>  <br>garrisons were kinda cool until you realised they basically turn the game into a Facebook farming simulator</br>  <br>Its pretty sad that you know that.</br>  <br><br>Echo Of Soul</br></br>    <br>RIP Star Wars Galaxies</br>  <br>yeah. Endgame in PoE can be boring if you dont like playing maps. (I love them)<br>But till you get to lvl 70 you have hours of fun. And there are SO freaking ways to play a char, so you can just start a new char.</br></br>  <br>Neverwinter is pretty good.<br>ESO is alright, I'm stuck on it. <br>Those are the only two I know that are mentioning.<br>Ffxiv is whatever. Got boring real quick.<br>Gw2 got boring fast as well. Hit the end game, did it several times and left it. <br><br>ESO is addicting if you like the elder scrolls games.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why not play TBC<br>best patch ever<br>mostly balanced pvp and pve wise it is godly<br>and yes private servers are f2p</br></br></br></br>  <br>hows the bait taste, faggot?</br>  <br>Wannabe old time MMO fag. If you didnt play UO stfu</br>  Everything other than WoW will just make you want to go back to WoW.<br><br>So just start with WoW. You can use in-game shekels to pay the sub fee. Up to level 20 is free indefinitely anyway.</br></br>  <br>Whoops forgot to post picture</br>  <br>Kind of surprised no one's mentiononed TERA yet.. questing is probabably the weakest part, but cobmat is really fun. BUT Gunners areally OP as fuck and there's almost nothing but since the most recent patch..</br>  <br><br>KEK<br><br>how did you guys fall for that? were you dropped on your heads as kids?<br><br>omg haha</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>KOL kingdom of loathing</br>  <br>Enlighten me what's TBC?</br>  <br>Before my time, the closest sandbox mmo i played was Mortal Online. It is still going on and was actually a decent time. However, the dev team was so small and the community would deplete and grow too often.</br>  <br>No, WoW is definitely the worst it's been. People just sit in their fucking garrisons the whole time and sit in queues. You hardly see anyone outside of instances anymore, and it's meant to be an MMO. It ruined the whole dynamic of the game.</br>  <br>the new patch sucks balls deep<br>seriously why are people playing anything past woltk</br></br>  <br>The Burning Crusade</br>  <br>Playing dat excalibur as we speak, good shit.</br>  <br>my god thats how I feel. when i play comp I just feel like im playing another wowclone that just happens to be set in tamriel. when I play console, I feel like I'm playing morrowind/oblivion/skyrim with some friends. the experience is just better for some reason.</br>  <br>SWG was of a time before MMOs were combat only<br><br>most of the classes would instantly die in combat lol. you could play the whole game as a fucking weaponsmith, musician, architect, POLITICIAN<br><br>game was sick</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not only is that not an MMO, that game was complete shit.</br>  <br>Not the poster but would say Burning Crusade on Private Servers</br>  Lineage 2 for best pvp but stupid 24/7 mob grinding to get stronger.<br><br>Archeage for good PvP. It's a sandbox game, so you can earn gold in 103352235 ways to get stronger.</br></br>  <br><br><br> nearly bugfree <br>Just fuck off. Spending 5 minutes in the /wpsg/ in /vg/ and you'll notice that it's no where near bugfree.<br>The raids are missing mechanics and shit, and 1.5k-2k players is a lie.<br><br>Plus it's high rates and pay to win.<br><br>tl;dr fuck off faggot</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>excalibur best Server!</br>  <br>One of the greatest games I have ever played. Shame the developer couldn't pay the state back. Heard they wanted to make an online mmo sequel. Greatly missed.</br>  <br>Yeah my fondest memories of that game was walking into crowded as cities and then finding something to do afterwards. Although i didnt play WoW for years, I got the full taste up to Lich King before all the other stuff came out. That's sad to hear... We need sandbox MMOs!</br>  <br>same<br>just started playing again last week<br>also imo tbc is just the best patch<br>since vanilla has too many issues with pvp</br></br></br></br>  Just got ESO and I'm hooked on it, though I'm sure there's better ones on PC  <br>Ultima master race reporting in<br>(Not the one you replied)</br></br>  <br>Sounds like a RP heaven and what an MMO should consist of, options! Yeah my friend and I always hear about Ultima Online and Star Wars Galaxies in relation to sandbox MMOs. So we have been stranded trying to find functioning sandbox MMORPGs since we got a good taste with Mortal Online.</br>  <br>Archeage was the definition of cancer. Broken game, pseudo-semi-limitless classes options when only 10~ worked and 3 were ridiculously overpowered. Pvp was based on whoever stuns first wins.</br>  <br>Diablo 3 is alright. Poe fags just hate games that they aren't good at. <br><br>I will say this though, diablo 3 is great when you're leveling up. Once you hit max level and start to get paragons it'll get boring. Endless grinding for better gear, the same content over and over again. Maybe you'll get lucky and hit a hidden rift/greater rift.<br><br>Last time I played, the drop rates for legendaries were astronomical. I've heard they fixed it, but not sure to what percentage.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You sir are part of the legendary culture of mmos</br>  <br><br>I played that shit on my renegade 2.o bbs back in the 90s<br><br><br><br>Rift. Fucking Rift is good shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, true. Check out Crowfall, it looks promising, but might flop. The world is destructable and fairly unique.</br>  <br>Don't solve problems like a retard when the labyrinth obviously has a mirror axis.</br>  are there any good fun servers for WoW? With a lot of players and shit?  Elder Scrolls Online. 20 dollars on instantgaming  <br>if this is autism test... why do you morons use the windows.</br>  Relevant post<br><br>I'm looking for something dark. A darker MMO that goes beyond the general "Rated T' feel. The olden days had some dark MMOs, but they are all outdated. Anyone know of any newer ones that have this feel?</br></br>  <br>lol d3 is a game of hard grind<br>its like d2 dumbed down so people wont rage because they get shitty loot all the time<br><br>and yeah d3 is good when you try and hit 60 or 70<br>but past that its just super repetitive also its kinda dead because there is no pvp</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Uh, no.<br>Neverwinter is based on a cash-shop model. Not to mention, their latest "Module" broke PvP even more and made PvE even more worthless.<br>Neverwinter is the poster-child for a company that literally only cares about the money.</br></br></br>  <br>Shit was cash<br>I guess you're a part of it as well?</br></br>  <br>d3 f2p stops on King Leoric.<br><br>Its worth to play and is replayable to attain better gear but its not long, you can complete it in 2 hours or less.</br></br></br>  <br><br>If you want Vanilla I'd recommend Kronos.<br>If you want TBC, I'd recommend waiting for corecraft, as the only two passble ones are bigged to shit.<br>If you want Wrath, I'd recommend Dalaran-WoW.<br>If you want Cata, I'd recommend Atlantis<br>If you want MoP, I'd recommend killing yourself.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> retail </br>  Age of Conan  <br>It's not really worth.<br>There are better games with more innovation and better graphics, for a lot less money.</br></br>  <br> Plays Guild Wars 2 and ESO <br> Also a huge Rune Scape player <br>This explains so much</br></br></br>  <br>Getting to 60 is fun, anything after that is boring. Agreed 100%</br>  <br>He's right you know.</br>  <br> God tier <br> f2p <br>Topkek.</br></br></br>  <br>hahahaaahhahhhaahaahhhahaahhaahhaha<wbr>haa<br>Fuck MoP</br></wbr></br>  <br>Tard. In this example every gap shall be a door.</br>  <br>none, modern mmos suck just play project 1999 or find a UO private server</br>  <br>  Warcraft sucks balls </br>  <br>But ffxiv sucks. The art looks like Disney, and japan animators had a baby.</br>  <br>That's the story of all MMO's, wow was literally the best experience i've had during TBC &amp; Vanilla, shit even Wrath wasn't too bad but after that it just went down the shitter, all you do is grind rep do dailies for shitty recipes and items for your game</br>  Eve for comp. most in-depth and most end game options. <br>ESO for consoles, but its better with a friend or two</br>  <br>I think you mean, you suck at Warcraft. GL failing in the others OP</br>  <br>I never said WoW was bad jackhead. I just can't get into it anymore. I was in beta. Commander Gargondle. Salute me, betch.</br>  <br>thank you</br>  I've heard Farmville is a good game    <br><br>wow virgins</br></br>  <br>Can confirm. ESO is great on consoles. If you don't have friends to play with, add me on ps4 and I can invite you to my guild. Mics only though. Need em for communications during difficult encounters.</br>  <br>It honestly does, though, I'll bet you joined in cataclysm</br>  Ive been enjoying wildstar and its going f2p soon. Rift has great pve as well, though pvp leaves a lot to be desired.  <br>im going to try out ArcheAge some people told me its good so im gonna look for myself.</br>  <br>WoW will always be the best MMO. Most people are getting bored of it now tho and its definitely getting worse.</br>  <br>Absolutely. I was pleasantly surprised, particularly after I'd heard how much of a train wreck it was on PC. Aside from the starting towns, there's rarely any lag, and the combat is fun. It's exactly playing Skyrim with other people.</br>  <br>this pretty much it<br>but i never played vanilla on retail and joined tbc way too late<br>so im playing tbc on private because the recent patches have clearly dumbed the game down that people just want to afk queue<br>it made me miss the walk to the summon stone thing and world pvp</br></br></br></br>   <br>Not OP but this is related to my interests. Any recomendation which servers are good?</br>  <br>Exactly. It actually turned out well. During pc beta it was horrible</br>  <br>d3 was fun to play until max level. d2 i still have installed, just for 1-2 times per month when i get nostalgic</br>  <br>excalibur wow is good</br>  <br>D2 is great. Love the way you can build your character to your exact speculations. Put stats into anything, build your own runeword items. Along with jewels that let you adjust how much damage you do.<br><br>Once got my ass kicked by a low level amazon with items that had nothing but max dmg jewels. Beat my smiter in few hits.</br></br></br>  <br><br>low-intelligence-b8<br>i can tell by the pixels</br></br></br>   tfw WoW is just a shell of its glorious former self <br> tfw no other MMORPG will ever be as good as TBC/WoTLK era wow <br>draenor feels like queue up simulator, you just sit in your garrison and queue up for shit<br>and every other MMO just tries to copy wow because thats what makes money</br></br></br>  <br>Eldevin.</br>  God I miss darkeden  <br>d2 is pretty dead now<br>and getting past nostalgia<br>its just plain hard grind and it gets kinda boring specially with no one to party</br></br></br>  dayz  <br>It still is.<br>Almost NOTHING has changed.</br></br>  <br>Pserver wow or swtor, others are shit.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=qmz<wbr>Tdl_KEFc</wbr>  [ ]</br>  The good option are : <br>  FF14 : New expension just came out, good competitive pve, shitty pvp. <br>  Wildstar : soon F2P, good competitive pve (but they didnt added new content since launch execpt 1 raid boss), shitty PvP. <br>  SWTOR : havnt played since it's F2P, the PVE was good but with a lot of bug, the PVP was fun. <br>  GW2 : the PVE is useless, WvW sucks, sPVP is really good and fun when you play in a good team <br><br>  never played ESO, Archeage : but they look like shit-tier game <br><br>Some edgy option : <br>  EVE Online : Players are the main actors, really complex mechanics. Alot of people enjoy it because the world is really rich and maybe because the skillcap required is really low (it's more a rts than a real mmo, and you control only 1 unit so the apm needed is really low) <br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/624746640#p624752870">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Ragnarok online</br></br>  <br>e z p z</br>  ITT; we discus if being gay should be made illegal again  I want it to be illegal again. So I can feel dirty when I do it.  <br>No, it shouldn't be. Faggots fagging doesn't hurt anyone, so is there any non-religious reason to make faggotry illegal?</br>  Then you'd be banned OP.  <br>b-but it harms traditional values...How will boys learn about keeping women in line?</br>  1 fag = 1 free pussy  <br>That sounds a might biblical there champ...</br>  <br>Yeah I've already gone back to being straight. It's just not the same now that its so accepted.</br>  <br> is there any non-religious reason to make faggotry illegal? <br>Not really.</br></br>  <br>This was kept quiet in my hometown. <br><br>A bunch of guys were drunk in a park, and one of them cut himself on the slide. A few hours later a kid cut himself on the slide.<br><br>The kid got AIDS.<br><br>Turns out the guy was gay and had AIDS.<br><br>Tell me there's no problem.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Some faggots have AIDS <br> Better assume they all do <br>Is this really what you're going with?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Then who would make threads on /b/?</br></br>  <br>Make slides illegal</br>  <br>You're not going to legislate the mental illness out of people but at least they would be encouraged to keep it in the closet where it belongs.</br>  <br>Perhaps the slide shouldn't be fucking cutting anyone in the first place, before we go into just how A-&gt;Z the fallacy that you just made is.</br>  <br>Therefore gays should be banned.<br>And slides.<br>And AIDS.<br>And kids.<br>And you.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>don't forget the town, drinks, and blood should also be banned.<br>and if you want you can also ban time for allowing this to happen, and his accomplice space.</br></br>  <br>This. Because straight people don't get aids. There's literally no medical record of straight people having aids. That kid was probably gay too.</br>  <br>Lol I'm pretty sure that can't even happen. Afaik AIDS becomes inactive quickly from exposure to air.</br>  <br>Nah bro, he said it happened so it must be true.</br>  <br>I think the slide was also gay</br>  <br> implying gay men want anything to do with women and their bullshit </br>  Crimes need victims to be valid.<br><br>People saying homosexuality being legal is harmful are just like feminists bitching about women who are hotter than them being allowed to show off. How insecure do you have to be with yourself to see people doing what they want as some kind of offense to you or society as a whole?</br></br>  There is literally nothing wrong with being gay  <br> we discus if being gay should be made illegal again <br><br>It should, end of discussion.</br></br></br>  <br>That's a lie because aids dies if it makes contact with air you dumbfuck</br>  <br> is there any non-religious reason to make faggotry illegal? <br><br>Yes, it's against nature. If you don't even obey the laws of nature, then why would you even obey laws of men. Queers are criminals by nature. Let's do away with them.</br></br></br>  <br>Hahahahaaha closeted homosexual detected</br>  <br><br> discus </br></br>  <br> aids dies if it makes contact with air <br><br> implying viruses are alive <br><br>facepalm.jpg</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That sounds like bullshit. If you got AIDS that way you're the unluckiest fucker alive. It doesn't live outside the body for very long.</br>  <br>This is literally the best thing about being gay.<br><br>Not dicks.<br>Not the new ruling.<br><br>The best thing is you don't have to give a flying fuck what some stupid ass airheaded Stacy is doing.
