Confederate Flag pulled from a state capitol   Walmart no longer selling confederate merchandise   Amazon no longer selling confederate merchandise   Large confederate flag in Tampa on private property may be removed    "Gone With The Wind" may be removed from sale   Jefferson memorial may be taken down   Dukes of Hazzard toy cars no longer on sale   Civil war games removed from app store   How does it feel to be on the same side as SJW's?             feels good man   This is so embarrassing, and I'm British. I hope all "SJW's" get an incurable disease.    A symbol of failure and idiocy may not be available in the future? That's going to be hard on the inbred hicks but it's not like they're not used to being losers.    you lost. get over it.   How's freedom going America?   This is how history repeats itself.    Who gives a shit you lost the war deal with it.  I'm surprised the flag was allowed this long.  If your beliefs change because you can't fly a piece of fabric on the end of a pole that's got the right pretty colours on your beliefs can't have been that important to you any way right?       Wish dime was here.   If you disagree with someone no matter what the issue, it's kind of like they're controlling how you think.  Also, if you seriously give a shit about the confederate flag, i'm really sorry about your poverty and shit-tier education. Maybe if you become a janitor in a northern state your grandchildren will one day absorb some modern culture.       SJW's  OP there is nothing wrong with being aware that social justice is a necessary component of our society. You seem to think it's cool to be an ignorant bigoted dipshit because you're on a "notorious" web site.   IRL I would bitchslap you so fucking hard for being this big of a faggot. Really.      Sleep tight puppy   I agree with your first paragraph but internet threats are the dumbest shit.     "Gone With The Wind" may be removed from sale   Good, that book is shit.      I'm surprised Walmart is going along with this. They had Duck Fucker merchandise and it still sold even after King Dipshit decided to air his homophobia on TV.   Who's butthurt over racism at Walmart?       implying the word social justice has the meaning it used to     OP deserves it. Deal with it.     thinking people care so much about a flag because it represents something no one on earth was alive for   being ok with the government banning what fabric you can put on a pole  You're the definition of a faggot.      this       American History   It was kind of a big part of the reunification after the war. This idea southerners were forgiven, were as American as the northerners, that we were brothers. It also means Confederate history is American history. Confederate deaths in the war were still American deaths and we count them equal when talling up the bloodshed and loss to the Nation.         calling someone bigoted unironically  They make tumblr for your kind, shitlord.      9 more people were killed by guns   "i know what will stop the killing! banning some random flag!"   america is fucked. everyone here is retarded        the flag was allowed  I don't think you understand how this country is supposed to work. That's the biggest problem actually, you weak willed faggots have no sense of right or wrong. I'm not sure how it got this bad.     Social justice means exactly the same thing. Granted there are gender and transgendered issues right now. Faggots talk shit on social justice because they don't want a better society, they want to get what they can from this oppressive yet lucrative corporatist social paradigm that shits on the poor, women and people of color. It's really that simple.    Lots of single mothers blaming men for their problems. Men hating women ruining average joes lifes. Angry teens turn to shitty adults.    They make /pol/ for you to suck another nazi cock faggot. I've been here longer than you were born. I'm not going anywhere. You are.    You'd be the first faggot complaining if someone in your neighborhood started flying the ISIS flag. There is literally no difference between the two.    That's because what was said wasn't even bad. Elements of the media just did their damnedest to twist it. For once it didn't work.    Yeah it really was that bad. But Walmart decided to keep selling Duck Shitfucker merchandise. Maybe there's been more outcry over the Confederate flag, but I would be surprised if the average Walmart customer demanded they keep selling that shit.   Why do sjw's always get so mad when the proof is against them?   Idk, im a southerner and it pisses me off. Slavery was the smallest part of the reasons for the Souths secession. The northerners controlled congress and kept tarifs high so cotton farmers couldn't make any money. The south was paying almost all of the federal governments budget while the feds only built things up north and the south made less money than the northerners. They couldn't afford to pay workers so slaves were a must. RE Lee would have been president in the south next and he would have abolished slavery. Fucking winners write history though, so most schools just teach it was over slavery. It's sad.      It's political correctness run amok. That's what you get with a republic. Politicians trying to pander to everyone and offend no one.     Because a symbol of racism should be so acceptable in society.  Fuck you.      What, that he doesn't agree with it but isn't going to do anything about it?   tolerance       The average Walmart shopper would probably fly a Confederate flag without thinking twice they're so fucking stupid.       American is dying, and you have the pleasure of sitting on your back sides and complaining about it on the internet. Way to go heroes.   No wonder the USA is a dying empire.    mfw no more PAX Americana   mfw China will become our great overlords   praise china             Hello binary thinking.    Because free speech should be banned, right? Just because someone's opinion is deplorable, that person's liberty should still be preserved.  Actions are illegal, and laws against actions can be enforced.  Ideas, opinions, and possession of an object should never be illegal.        yeah because dividing people into groups like that isn't counter productive... jesus fuck anon  you do realize women are way more privileged than men in the west right?      hello intellectual superiority complex    Actually our country is getting better. People are actually demanding that bigotry be drastically addressed. It's part of civilizing this society, which has been on the back burner since the Bush Era.    shhh     Gays don't shop at Wal-Mart, blacks do. That's the difference     Oh look a stupid stormfag chart "proving" that there's no gender differences.  Rape yourself.     It's the proud loser flag, it literally says "we lost the war but fuck you". The flag is embarrassing and the whole argument to remove it is a joke, I don't really care if they keep it or not.   I wonder whats next on the list of things to destroy in order to protect people's feelings?     Tiny dick chink confirmed.     No by all means keep sticking your head up your ass. We're all ears. Tell us how the SJW's are fucking up your perfect racist world full of social and economic inequality.   the confederate flag is un-american. it is nothing more than a symbol of failed rebellion against the union.  no one should complain because no one lived in the south before 1864.     Honestly, I could see a comprehensive Internet Posting set of protocols being developed. It's more than needed these days.     Because they can't comprehend defeat and when they encounter one they'll just yell muh soggy knee     It would've required more explaining if I'd just called you a retard. Or practicing empathy toward a group or side of an argument you don't readily agree with. There are reasons that aren't just all about racism why people see that flag, or the Confederacy in general as not equivalent to fucking Hitler or the collective sin of slavery.   Them dame yankies want a war?    Its a symbol of racism to those who only pay attention to that aspect of the Confederate states.  They wanted to split from the Union, the Union got pissed, made a deal with black political leader, said hey if we win war free all slaves. The Union turned the war into a war over slavery instead of what it really was, a war to keep the south from doing what the Union basically did with England.        defends racism   calls others "retards"   good jorb faggot       hahaha.. calling me a stormfag... here's how much sjw's and stormfags have in common: there's even a subreddit where they exclude which group is hated on then ppl try to guess if it's a sjw or stormfag https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Z-Z<wbr>X5V4Qft4</wbr>  [ ]    Because the proof is always against them, and they really hate that. Remember, it's only morally wrong to look down on something if they are white. That's the SJW code of ethics.    No it wasn't faggot. Stop revising history.  The Civil War occurred because the South refused to outlaw slavery. That is the principal reason.    You can take your American Revolution comparison and shove it up your fucking ass.       Continuing hot celeb thread from yesterday      i'll lurk for a while, then maybe post if the thread picks up    that acne   Yes, her head is covered in zits.

A week ago, some anon posted his ex gf in a "Pics you shouldn't have shared" thread. It was a massive album of this blonde girl.  I downloaded a zip he made, and then I posted her on reddit realgirls.  Today, I get a message from that girl. She claims that she was under age in the photos and that she has contacted the police.  My question, am I liable? All I did was download images from a public domain and repost them elsewhere, without any knowledge of her age.  This is the girl, does not look under age at all.           Whatever ill keep posting this vixon  77777  Wonder if she was molested  No loli thread,can someone make one? I'm too lazy.  bump  here ya go           Thanks     Hey /b/ro i rolled trips today  learn to drive manual, fag   auto pussy. that tacho is just an ornament    Driving automatic is for kids    yo engine light on nigga   lol 6000 rpm max what kind of potato do you drive...  My powerband starts 6k lol     Op is not a poorfaggot like you all         implying the automatic transmission is not clearly an improved technology allowing for simpler more streamlined operation of the vehicle       It's operation being simple is literally the only advantage. In every other way, manual is better.   OP here,    i drive manual    sold my lada     parts are hard to get from russia.       I'll av' youu knouw I'm British and can drive a stick! Youu Americans always make me laugh with youur autoumatic transmissiouns and how youu doun't play real fououtball!   Just rolled em as I'm in the thread.     Look everyone! Someone can drive a stick! Omfg this is such huge news! Driving a fucking manual is a huge accomplishment.      In every other way meaning what? Ease of use is the only measure as far as I'm concerned.   manuals are a lot better on gas, i find them more fun to drive and sometimes auto transmissions dont wanna fucking downshift &gt;:[  dis shit disapear 2 times now  me n m8 cookin up some old style dumpsta meth shakenbake way  ask us anytin but nuthin stupid       Do you know any sort of chemistry basics or are you planning on killing yourselves with your ignorance?    he went college for chemistry he nows wat hes doin we cook before n shit hits hard    So what the fuck do you do if he's the one that knows everything?    And if he has a college chemistry education, the hell is doing a "shakenbake" way? Awful yields and impure product.    Take pictures, post on /b/    im like his handy man i get him wat he needs and hold stuff i know each step but he does it all     everything about this post perfectly sums up the south.   How do you make meth?     do u know how hard it is to get cookin stuff when u have no job in this and 20 year old white kid u will never get real setup without cops being told about u     Go fuck yourself Yankee pussy boy liberal nig loving faggot bitch.     haha i wish south we in arkansas now if we was south we cud get a real setup goin    Watched Breaking Bad   Thinks it's that simple   You fucking dunce, OP      Jesse!

Fuck you ghetto trash, can't wait for you to poison yourself with your shitty meth      das a dope ass show but they do this shit so fake on it. in the start trailer was way more real nobody cooks in a nasa lab   and atleast u learning to use ur head one day u will make plutonium and say thanks to us also like i said this shit hits hard u wudnt call it shit if i let u hit it          You can't even spell simple words and form a decent sentence, what makes you think you can understand chemisty?     Yea, it'll you hard alright when it starts decaying your mouth and shutting down your kidneys. Thank god drug users die quicker    1) a real chemist making enormous quantities would use a lab like that 2) the DEA taught them how to make meth so the show would be accurate     See  He's a counter top.

If that's meth its fucking trash. Glass is called glass cause its clear and "pure" that's worse than penutbutter garbage.    Good thing I don't have to worry about getting stabbed by a meth head desperate for a fix when I go buy paracetmol at the store.     Holy shit that's low quality, did you cook that in a toilet? Certainly not worth more than my car.      hahaha its not what our meth looks like this is mdma its my m8s he can get $40k for it at least  and meth is not clear like water its more cloudy stop watching make beleve shows       how an baby is formed?

I'm gonna need an explanation for that blue apparently female square, I'm afraid.       favorite game soundtrack  The theme from Oblivion always sounded very close to the theme from Pirates Of The Carribean to me     It's from Thomas Was Alone.
