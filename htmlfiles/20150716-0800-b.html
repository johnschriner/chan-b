I then looped it and jerked off like crazy  <br><br>I fapped to that scene while it was happening.<br><br>Dem tittays doe</br></br></br></br>  <br>Second</br>  <br>Saved</br>  Shame!  <br>What about if I became erect?</br>  <br><br>You're part of the problem if you watch this show.</br></br>  <br>BLASPHEMY!</br>  <br>You know that was a body double, right? Girl who plays cersei or however you spell it was pregnant during the filming of this scene. Some uk paper outed the girl who stood in for her body. She said she enjoyed being looked at and put on display for all of those people. Chick is hot. Jerked off to her.</br>  <br>SHAME, SHAME, SHAME!</br>  <br>Headey been using a body double since s1 anyway</br>  Post pics of your depressing single guy dinners<br><br>bonus points if you cried while eating</br></br>  nothing wrong with the food but the amount is fucking huge what are you a horse  <br>Well first, that looks like a fucking huge meal.<br><br>Two, that doesn't look depressing. I eat ramen noodles and drink water for the most part... <br><br>Fuck your "depressing" meal, I'd love that meal.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br>My thoughts exactly</br></br>  <br>wtf nigger. How is this depressing?<br><br>What are you people, from the suburbs?</br></br></br>  HIJACKING THREAD. THIS IS NOW A MASSIVE GET THREAD. CHECKEM  <br><br>Is this a fucking alien pizza?</br></br>  <br>from detroit why</br>  As a single guy, my dinners tend to be microwaveable... or delivered pizza. Pic related, I eat this at least every other day.<br>But that all changes today! Or tomorrow or something. I just got some cookbooks and I'm going to start trying to cook the majority of my food. So that should be cool.</br>  <br><br> Asparagus <br><br>Are you trying to remind yourself how pathetic your food was everytime you piss, OP?</br></br></br></br>  still in bed too  <br>that looks delicious</br>  <br>Good. Please tell me I'm not the only poorfag in here.</br>  <br>He doesn't really mean it, he just wants to show us the meal he's made<br>OP, you don't need be like 'lol look at my crap meal' just be proud you made it, it looks nice dude.</br></br>  <br> depressing <br>that looks awesome</br></br>  I don't cry while eating. I cry when I look at what I have left to my name.<br><br>Pic related</br></br>  <br>God, I'm so jelly at the US for those Hungry-Man products. Should I be?</br>  <br>No. They get watery and taste like shit once they're heated up.</br>  <br>What do you do anon?</br>  <br>When they first came out yes. Like all American food products they become smaller and smaller to increase profits after becoming popular</br>  <br>I tried freelancing online in a dying town with no jobs and failed horribly. <br><br>No one's going to hire anyone to build a website on freelancing forums from the US when there's Indians who claim to do it for $100 per PSD.</br></br></br>  <br>They're like nicer tv dinners. where are you from?</br>  <br>No, utterly disgusting.</br>  <br>I don't know if they're worth being jealous about. But I enjoy them. And it's a lot of food for not too much money (they go on sale pretty frequently).</br>  <br>kek</br>  <br>imagine food that taste bad while tasting like nothing at the same time</br>  <br>Norway. We get nice sous vide microwaveable TV dinners here, but we don't get large portions and deep fried shit.</br>  <br>Are you on food stamps, unemployment or housing? get on it dude you've had your money stolen from the feds time to use those services</br>    <br>What the fuck</br>  <br>that is so sad</br>  Me right now, lunch time  I now wish I took a picture of my spam, macaroni and supermarket brand cheese casserole.  <br>I use to eat microwaveable frozens.... enjoy your cancer : )</br>  <br><br>bag chips in place of french fries and an empty fajita... ep1k</br></br>  <br>the fuck is that cheese dick? You win</br>  <br><br>Assuming this is a 12" dinner plate.<br><br>7 ounces lean beef steak<br>12 ounces of breaded...what...chicken nuggets?<br>An entire zucchini, cut in half and baked with breading and probably cheese<br>4 ounces of steamed green beans<br>4 ounces of steamed asparagus.<br><br>Congratulations OP, that's enough food for 2 people.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 2015  <br> believing microwave food is more carcinogenic than other food </br></br>  <br>I'd say it's enough for four people, but then I'm not American</br>  <br>I cried.</br>  <br>Being from detroit is more depressing more then anything.</br>  <br>You could argue the point.<br><br>If it were a lunch I would call it 4 portions. If it were a dinner I would call it 2. I imagine there are 1600 calories there.</br></br></br>  <br>stay sad plebian fat fag. If you buy all your own ingredients you are much better off than frozen shit tier</br>    <br><br>whats your paypal account name? fairly richfag here, I'll buy you a pizza or some shit even if this is fake.</br></br>  <br>kek</br>  <br>what are those lumps of deep fried shit near the bottom of the pic?</br>  <br><br>is that a chorizo?</br></br>  <br><br>probably fish<br><br><br><br>at least in detroit you can feel superior for being white since there are so many niggers</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's true, but the issue here was microwaves, not fresh vs. frozen.</br>  <br>Nothing quite that fancy my friend. That is a dollar store hotdog. Probably past the expiration date.</br>  <br> that shit <br> chorizo <br> being this much of a fancy faggot <br> being so out of touch with reality <br>wew lad</br></br></br></br></br>  I ate plain rice today. Nothing attached. Just boiled rice.  <br>Remove the cheese sticks and that's a damned nice meal. Are those razor clams?</br>  <br><br>Potato Croquettes<br><br><br><br>What the fuck would I want fish and beef together for?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How dare you dirty my name, that is a mattessons smoked sausage from asda, costing £1.50 or $2.34.</br>  <br><br>What cheese sticks?<br><br>It's baked courgette</br></br></br></br>  <br> Are those razor clams? <br>Are you seriously asking if OP breaded outside the shell of a clam?</br></br>  <br><br><br>well it looks red-ish and chorizo isnt much more expensive than a hotdog at least here in spain, specially such a shitty looking one<br><br><br> What the fuck would I want fish and beef together for? <br><br>idk man, it would be better than "potato croquettes"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>how is that depressing that looks good as shit</br>  <br><br>best one yet<br><br>what the fuck dude xd</br></br></br></br>  <br>neat!</br>  <br>That's soulcrushingly awful.</br>  I eat the cheapest instant ramen I can find once a day every day out of Tupperware containers. Fuck you op I want that shit you have. Thay aint depressing  <br>Why all these dinners gotta be sad? <br>Dammit, Im not a feminist but why do you all have to depend on a woman for food.<br>Fucking learn to cook good food.<br>You'll still be single but have good or great meals.<br><br>And OP, that looks delicious</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you eat like this regularly... how are you still alive? Surely malnutrition will kick in at some point.</br>        <br>k this takes the cake</br>  <br>You're not alone<br>I've been eating fried rice with some leftover onions for the last two weeks and will probably continue until this month ends</br></br>  <br>Three types of crisps, some nugget fuckery, BBQ sauce and a snack sausage with dip? That's not dinner, man.</br>  <br>ok the cheese I'm not sure about but dem spagetti hoops are all good.</br>    fishdicks w/ wedges and stuffed potato baglets. gf gone since saturday, but no tears.  <br>nugget fuckery<br>el oh el</br></br>  <br> on a plate <br> not just dumped onto the table <br><br>Well aren't we fancy? What's it like being so wealthy?</br></br></br></br>  <br>That looks pretty good OP, i had a big bowl of white rice yesterday and peanut butter nutella bread for breakfast this morning.</br>  <br><br>is that supposed to be a steak? it looks like a steak shaped hamburger</br></br>    Don't worry, when you have a GF you can eat delicious meals like this.  <br>If I sat down to eat and saw that, I would blow my fucking brains out.</br>  <br>why plastic plate ? poor fag ?</br>  <br><br> Owning a table <br> What are planning on have the queen over for high tea, John D Rockefeller? </br></br></br>  <br>thats what Salisbury steak is ya dingus, its made with ground beef</br>  <br>ironskull19@gmail.com<br><br>Thanks man. I'd love a pizza.</br></br></br>  <br> plastic plate <br>kek</br></br>  <br>how fucking fat are you?</br>  <br>I thought this was a joke until I read her tweets. Just one out of 150 million people in this country that have to go.</br>    Can someone explain this shit to me?<br>Like how did people discover honey?</br>  <br>seen bears do it</br>  <br>This <br><br>Or it just fell down and cracked open<br><br>Are you really that retarded OP? Or just too stoned or whatever?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Or the first guy to milk a cow</br>  ah i love the look of honeycombs<br><br>do anyone of you guys know the feel when you are biting into a comb full of honey?<br>fucking delicious with a epic consitency</br></br></br>  <br>probably some faggot looking for a dick to jack off</br>  <br> human baby sucks at womens titties <br><br> see how cow baby sucks at wierd 4 penised cow titties </br></br></br>  <br>Similar to biting into a waffle that isn't soggy from the syrup yet</br>  <br>Haha gay</br>  <br>idiot they saw the fucking bear eat it!</br>  <br><br> thousands of years ago <br><br>"Hmm... I each berries, fruit and other shit I find in trees and on the floor. Might as well taste this sticky stuff"</br></br></br></br>  <br>how is eating honey gay?</br>  Sometimes I wonder if /b/ is actually a 8th graders community  <br>They learnt it from the Winnie the Pooh animations.</br>  <br><br><br> <br><br>Hehe its jus hella gay bro, you know, lighten up</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>how did people discover honey?<br><br> Big wind storm <br> Dead tree fall over <br> Let's take a look! <br> Oh, this was that bee tree <br> What it that stuff they are all loading up with, taking away? <br> It's fucking delicious! <br> Do you think all bee trees have this stuff? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>watching animals eat it</br>  <br>I was just kidding</br>  <br> Or the first guy to milk a cow <br>Are you fucking kidding me?<br><br>Cows have babies. Baby cows live exclusively on mother's-milk for weeks or months. Clearly there is food value in that milk. It's pretty obvious that if we can keep milking the cow instead of letting the milk dry up after the calf is weaned, HEY, FREE FOOD for people.</br></br></br></br>  His name was Dave.  <br>Sounds like a 9th grader who thinks he's way more mature</br>  <br>IT'S NOT FUNNY!!!1</br>  <br>How do you know??</br>  <br>But who show bear? Honey always win.</br>  <br>Kek'd heartily</br>  <br>You can literally almost ask this about anything. Comon b tards let's have some common sense here.</br>  <br><br>Same fag</br></br>  <br>Haha gay</br>  <br>May I introduce you to the theory of evolution? It became kind of a big thing in the last past weeks. Everybody's talking about it</br>  <br>no?<br><br><br>samefag btw</br></br></br></br>  <br>Thank you</br>  If you really think about it, Alot of things we eat look Nasty like muscles or squid plants as well Tomato's were poisonsus back in the day night shade plant..It was out of Pure Hunger did we start eating these things and finding out they were quite tasty... Hunger drives humanity to do alot of things make us make sand witches when were hungry or to lash out when we go past the point of hunger..  <br> Or the first guy to milk a co <br><br>This. If you've ever seen or been around bears, then you'd know that they eat literally everything and will pretty much try to see if something is eddible no matter what it is.<br><br> pic related <br>I've seen these assholes tear open gas cans to see if there's something they can eat inside.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm confused. Who's who now?</br>  <br>I can assure you they teared open those gas cans just for fun. Their sense of smell is 5000 times better than a dog ones.</br>  Primitive man was looking for a more renewable source of semen  <br> Seeing bears having fuck near beehive.  <br>Wat?</br></br>  <br>the fuck is honey?</br>  <br>I'm kind of amused that you actually spent time to think about this shit and write a comment</br>  <br>A popular pet name</br>  <br>im this guy<br><br><br><br><br><br>and the other one is a mentally challenged faggot</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Trying too hard</br>  I reckon it went as follows;<br><br>caveman got stung by bees, <br><br>caveman got mad<br><br>caveman bash beehive<br><br>caveman runs away because of ensued swarm<br><br>caveman comes back after few hours and discovers honey</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What about potatoes. <br><br>Who thought "yeah this poisonos root tumor of this boring plant might actually be delicious if cooked for an hour"</br></br>  <br><br>This guy? <br><br>No, that's me</br></br></br></br>  To me it's quite bizarre how we discovered bread in ancient times. Especially since wheat wasn't as full of grains per stem as it is now.<br><br>Someone saw a scrawny plant with no fruit and decided to go and thresh it manually. Then the person was left with a handful of shitty seeds, thought it was a good idea to grind them, add water and cook the flour.<br><br>Like, how ingenious does a person have to be to come up with all this?</br></br></br></br>  Probably emulated animals, much as negroids still do today.  look up scaphing honey related  <br>what really gets me is how they discovered cheese...</br>  <br>Some retarded indians who also threw down heads from pyramides in the jungle</br>  <br>They forgot about a bucket of milk in the basement. <br><br>How long are we gonna play this stupid game?</br></br></br>  <br>aight, fucking white people</br>  <br>Horry shet how do u know</br>  <br> They forgot about a bucket of milk in the basement.  <br><br>BUT HOW DID THEY INVENT THE BASEMENT?</br></br></br>  <br>A beehive was broken open, abandoned by the colony. Someone went up to it and went da fuq, dis smells delish, dis taste delish.<br><br>A bear probably smacked the fuck outta the hive, and was monitored by a human. or a human found the hive.</br></br></br>  <br>Do you REALLY wonder about this? Like seriously? The human species is incredibly curious and tries out everything food or sex related. Plus we cook everything with water and fire. Dude, common…</br>  <br>google it faggot</br>  <br><br>It's weird shit that comes off an insect's arse that 3rd worlders use instead of HFCS, poor cheap-assed faggots.</br></br>  <br><br>Who was the first person who thought to eat an artichoke, or even tried to get NEAR one.</br></br>  <br>That literally summarizes the first two posts in this thread.</br>  <br>Good point, good point…</br>  Do sheep expand in the rain like my wooly sweaters?<br><br>Where can you buy pre heated ovens?</br></br>  <br>Tom pls go</br>  <br>when you are really, seriously, desperately hungry, you will eat anything.<br><br>that is basically the simple fundamental answer and truth to your question, and why people have discovered all kinds of weird shit to eat/drink or use as medicine.</br></br></br>  <br>That's neither a good question, nor funny.</br>  <br> how they discovered cheese... <br><br> Ok, we've discovered milk <br> I have some milk but I want to take it with me on this trip <br> What container? <br> How about this animal stomach from what we butchered last night? <br> Ok, let's walk! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> If you were a hunter gatherer. <br> You find insect goo, or a root, or a bud, or onion <br> You're going to take just a little bit <br> And hey, if it's sweet </br></br></br></br>  <br>Ok :(</br>  <br>And you really think nobody in this whole thread has ever mentioned this?</br>  <br>Fell down and got picked up. OH NO! My hands sticky. Better lick it clean. TASTY!<br><br>I fell down and grabbed trunk of tree. OH NO! my hands sticky. Better lick it clean. TASTY!</br></br></br>  <br>It wasn't meant to be funny. As for it being "good" it's relative to each reader. Do you know what an artichoke even is? Apparently not.</br>  <br>by my reading, no.<br><br>nobody has specifically pointed out that DESPERATE HUNGER is the driving motivation behind this and many other food source discoveries and innovations.</br></br></br>  <br>9gag styled cringe</br>  <br><br><br>No, both liars. I'm this guy:<br/></br></br></br>  <br>/thread</br>     Gorak smells good smell in bee nest <br> Gorak thinks bee nest is good food <br> Now Gorak smash puny bees and take good food <br> Puny bees stinged Gorak, but Gorak runned faster and now have bees food <br> Bees food is good food, Gorak was right! </br></br></br></br>  <br>im no liar, i was pervectly honest</br>  <br>So what was the meaning of your question?<br><br>I meant good in a way of valid or useful. A question that nearly everybody can answer is not a good question. Unless you actually don't know the answer - but then you must be stupid.<br><br>Therefore: Are you stupid?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yes</br>  <br><br>Sorry dude:<br><br><br>And some other posts but I think you're able to scroll yourself</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>my sides</br>  How did they invent god?  <br>I know. I was messing wit you. Wanna fight irl?</br>  <br>Well then we have something in common.</br>  <br>they found out who was phone</br>  Humans have no doubt tried to eat just about everything at some point in time.  <br>In modern theology based on Kant they explain the origin of god as an idea by belief itself. <br>You as an individual are "trapped" in a world of physical limits. But your mind isn't limited by those physics. Therefore something or somebody (god) must have put you into this world. <br><br>And that's why they invented god.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to know who the first person was to look at a lobster and say 'hmm....I'm gonna eat that motherfucker"</br>  WHO WAS THE FIRST GUY TO THINK FROGS LOOK DELICIOUS.
