Probably eating cause I was a fat kid. I didn't know about it until like 5th grade though, my mom (single parent would you look at that) decided it wouldn't be good to let me have any idea of what was going on... for years.  i was at home watch dragon ball z on cartoon network because i was sick, my mother wanted to watch the news and i said after goku kills frieza  I was studying thermodynamics and experimenting on melting steel beams with jet fuel  having sex with the gf, now ex..<br><br>had tv on and there were new all about it but I didn't really care. Just kept fucking. Didn't know how big it was till later.</br></br>  <br>I was home schooled and my mom made me watch the news with her all day. I was very frightened. She wouldn't stop crying. I still think about it.</br>  <br>so green he pisses grass</br>  Was programming, told the secretary to stop spreading rumors, went home for lunch to watch it on tv. Scary weeks afterwards, figured we were all about to ship off for war  <br>I was cheating on my girlfriend with her mother i ended up marrying her also still happily married btw.</br>  <br>I was ten btw</br>  <br>Fighting off a super bad hangover. By the time I got up, all the buildings were down and they were showing the replays.</br>  <br> weeks </br>  I just happened to be skipping school with a couple friends, I went to one of their houses and then a park and smoked some weed. Pretty average day for me.  <br>Damn you missed out, I saw it in real time and it was crazy.</br>  <br>it's Canada, you can't fire people willy nilly.

I walked in on my mum crying and asked her why. I didnt understand why she cared so much about people we didnt know.  Working for an airline, booking travels. Minutes after the planes crashed into the buildings i listed the passengers on the flights (amadeus) and some minutes later the flights where unaccessible.

Because claiming that the moon was split serves no purpose today. You did not witness it. As for the Quran then you are free to pick it up, read it and listen to it recited on youtube.<br> Say: "If the mankind and the jinns were together to produce the like of this Qur'an, they could not produce the like thereof, even if they helped one another." [Qur'an 17:88] <br>  And if you (Arab pagans, Jews, and Christians) are in doubt concerning that which We have sent down (i.e. the Qur'an) to Our slave (Muhammad Peace be upon him ), then produce a surah (chapter) of the like thereof and call your witnesses (supporters and helpers) besides Allah, if you are truthful. [Qur'an 2:23] <br>  And this Qur'an is not such as could ever be produced by other than Allah (Lord of the heavens and the earth), but it is a confirmation of (the revelation) which was before it [i.e. the Taurat (Torah), and the Injeel (Gospel), etc.], and a full explanation of the Book (i.e. laws and orders, etc, decreed for mankind) - wherein there is no doubt from the the Lord of the 'Alamin (mankind, jinns,and all that exists). <br>  Or do they say: "He (Muhammad(P)) has forged it?" Say: "Bring then a surah (chapter) like unto it, and call upon whomsoever you can, besides Allah, if you are truthful!"

I view, and this is the salafi view, that all these terrorist organisations are misguided and only use Islam for their political agenda.

It is, however, not what you or others make it to be. it's a set of rules made to limit the Muslim countries on how they interact with foreign countries. <br><br><br>Abu bakr, the best human after the prophets in the view of the Muslims, informed the muslim army when he was a Caliph <br>  O people! I charge you with ten rules; learn them well! <br><br><br>  Stop, O people, that I may give you ten rules for your guidance in the battlefield. Do not commit treachery or deviate from the right path.

You can't just say "Quran and sunnah". Everyone agrees that there has to be interpretation. I follow the understanding of the 3 first generations of Muslims. The Prophet did say:<br><br><br>  "There will be from my Nation a people who will deem fornication, silk (for men), alcohol, and music to be permissible; and there will be a people who will camp beside a high mountain, when a poor man passes by them and asks for a need, they will say to him, 'Return to us tomorrow.' In the morning Allaah will make the mountain fall upon them and the others (who are saved) are transformed into apes and pigs, until the Day of Judgement."
