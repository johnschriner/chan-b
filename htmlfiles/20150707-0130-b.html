Had a coworker that was okay with doing it nsa, then she caught morals and didn't want to because I was married. So I paid $20, and then $50.

Don't be afraid to walk out if she's not what you expected; you owe her nothing. I once walked out when I saw drugs. Don't be afraid to ask about fetishes either, they probably heard it all. It took me awhile to break through my shyness tto ask her to pee on me, which she kindly abdliged. <br><br>You also do t want just a cute face, get someone who has awesome sexual energy, seems to really be enjoying everything, and doesn't make you feel awkward.</br></br></br>  <br>max $120 aus</br>  Don't ask about her tattoos.  expect what you paid for.

If anything showed up, they were not allowed a room to work in, so there is pretty much a guarantee that there will be no after-sex consequences.<br> That being said, its expensive as fuck to go bareback <br><br>2) Security<br><br>3) No Shenanigans<br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/626170244#p626172951">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Check TER or another review service. Look for ones that people say are true GFE non-rushed, personable, etc. Check the reviews in the same way you would looking for any other service because that's exactly what you're doing. You don't expect to be buddies with your plumber or accountant so don't expect to have any meaningful relationship with an escort.

I'll start    <br>wew lad<br>bad bait is bad</br></br>  <br>Saved that one but never used it</br>  <br>To get answers for your questions, you are required to comply a simple request called TITS OR GTFO.</br>  <br>4chan is more welcoming than those special hamplanets on tumblr<br><br> Which is kinda sad but it shows whats wrong with them snowflakes </br></br></br>  I believe that Hank Hill is one the most complex and realistic characters in Animation. Although on the surface he appears to be nothing more than a redneck, if you actually watch the show and read between the lines, he's a lot more.<br>Hank Hill, and by extension King of The Hill as a whole, is at its core about showing that one group is not always right, and one group is not always wrong. It's not just blind Liberal bashing by some angry Texans, or angsty Liberal bawwing like Family Guy, it's somewhere in the middle.<br>Hank is a man who represents traditional family values. He works a just-above blue collar job, has an ugly wife, and a kid he fails to understand. He enjoys working on his lawn, grilling, and selling propane (and propane accessories).<br>because he represents traditional values, he often butts heads with newer, more liberal ideas. Now about half the time, he will have a hard time adjusting, but ultimately realize that it isn't that bad, or is even correct. But the other half of the time, he exposes it for the bullshit it is and tries to save those who have been brainwashed.<br>And that's the thing, Hank isn't a racist or Homophobe, or even a devout Republican. If that was the point of the show, he would have voted for Bush in that one episode. No, Hank is a good man who just has a hard time adjusting.<br>Hank stands by his family, his friends, and his family values, and this is why he is a good character. He has a hard time understanding his son, like a lot of parents, but ultimately loves him and accepts him for what he is.<br>When you really get down to it, Hank is so much more than your average sitcom father. Unlike the bumbling Homer, he is a very real man who many people can relate to THEIR fathers. he is the next progression in mature cartoons and sitcoms, a complex character, not a 1 dimensional caricature.<br>In short, he is the Average Joe the typical person represents, and that's a good thing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Fuck off you nigger faggot sjw cock slurping rainbow flag flying fuck  <br>oh my...</br>  <br>how is 4chan more welcoming? all i have done is created a thread and everyone is telling me to tits or gtfo? its scary to think what you guys would do to a young trans girl or a homosexual boy. i hope you all stand on lego bricks!</br>  <br>REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></br>    <br>because you're shitposting</br>  <br>non of you have answered any of my questions though &gt;.&lt;</br>    <br>Why don't you try standing on your own feet first?</br>  <br>Ask pol This for a more unbiased opinion</br>  <br>Because:<br>1.No names - nobody knows who you are,how often you come here or what kind of fetishes you have<br>2.Nobody fucken cares - TITS OR GTFO is a levelheaded answer to all your problems<br>3.We love cats<br><br> And yes i know b8 </br></br></br></br></br></br>  i will anwser<br>1.Tits or gtfo<br>2.Tits or gtfo<br>3.And lastly tits or gtfo</br></br></br>  <br>Tumblr is full of so social justice warriors<br><br>Modern feminism is a joke, only stands for false rape accusations and the patriarchy complaints<br><br>Tumblr only accepts females and trans so stfu<br><br>Yes we are</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'll bite anyways. <br><br> why do you guys hate the all-inclusive progressive social network tumblr? <br>Because it's not.<br><br> Why are you guys against feminism so much? is it because you dont think woman are human? <br>Because it's devolved into a sexist reactionary movement<br><br> why dont you think 4chan is as accepting as tumblr is?  <br>Anonymity makes it far more accepting. You can be hated in one thread and loved in another. With a username, you gain or lose notoriety through your actions.<br><br> do you conciser your self bigots/sexist/racists/homophobic/tr<wbr>ansphobic/ as everyone else on the internet thinks all of 4chan is.</wbr> <br>No.<br><br>Now tits or gtfo</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Bro you just described everything i believe about him, the comedy in the show is that way to its a beautiful thing.</br>  I hate feminism, because all i ever hear from it is women going batshit crazy, not once have i heard anything good come out of feminism.<br><br>4chan is anonymous. never tried tumblr, but I'm fairly certain you have an account and a name associated with you. here, there is no way for you to be found.<br>A lot of us are bigots/sexist/racists/homophobic/tr<wbr>ansphobic/, but not all of us</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>ok thank you =^.^=</br>  Rules are rules  <br>It's because you are not respecting our culture and traditions. Your tumblr privilege is showing. Now our ways are simple, just tits or GTFO.</br>  <br><br>Who is this "4Chan"?</br></br>  <br>To be honest... some of the feminists want to get rid of alimony<br>Which is noice<br><br><br> But thats about it </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>OOOOOHHHHHHHHHH</br>  <br>yeah go to /pol/, they will be very pleased to answer all of your questions</br>  <br>Have fun ill be waiting to see you there newfriend</br>  <br>This nigger nailed it</br>  <br>oooh shit, dis gon b gud</br>  <br>But we like fags and trannies.</br>  <br>4chan is a place where to express yourself freely even when all you have to say is cancer. or sharpie in pooper. this is how real freedom looks like, and it creates complete clusterfuck this is why we need imperialism back and those curly wigs. seriously lads I CANT STAND THIN NORMIEBULSHIT REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEE</wbr></br>  Alrighty then <br>First: We don't care about tumblr. <br><br>Second: Men and women are different, you can run from it, we look different and we think different. <br><br>Third: Tumblr got some issue, i have found more fucked up peopole on tumblr then 4chan. (its full of autism) <br><br>Last question: we are sexist and racist because everyone is different and everyone doesn't fucking NEED to love everyone. we hate some, we love some, YOU are the same.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Its on<br>copy paste has been put on /pol/<br><br>let the ride begin</br></br></br></br>  <br> we <br>How about you suck your daily cock alone</br></br>  <br>Only closet faggots like you do<br> /pol/ had declared this a gore/rekt thread </br></br>  <br>i heard he was a genius hacker</br>  <br>/thread <br><br>Now pop out those milk duds you landwhale, do something useful</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;47576169  new thread  <br>nothing so far, I hope they will respond with great hospitality to our tumblr friend</br>  <br><br>I always asked myself, how a person can be, at the same time, victim, and agressive at the same time<br><br>  durr durr, you are so bad with me, kill youself <br><br>Wat.jpeg<br><br>Is that kind of people mad or something?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Were not in denial of our own un acceptance for people, but you are. There have been threads started by woman clearly stating they are woman and no "tits or gtfo". The only reason everyone's saying that is because you're from tumblr. If any ignorant child even were to post something slightly racist he heard from someone else you guys would hop on him and make him viral, maybe ruining a large part of his life with no remorse because you're blinded by you're denial. Tumblr is also the one who coined "cis scum". Tumblr also constantly generalizes white men as bad people who beat their wives and shoot up school. You're just as if not more un accepting.</br>  <br>I would like to know what music he was listening to before it happened</br>  GAS THE KIKES<br><br>RACE WAR NOW</br></br>  <br>I shouldn't have generalized. SOME of us on here like fags and trannies. We all call each other faggots. That part is true. But to say that 4chan hates trans people is a lie.</br>  <br> 4chan is a place where to express yourself freely <br> bans you if you post picture of any clothes girl under 18 <br><br>half chan fagget, it's ok to browse this site, but don't belive it has free speech</br></br></br></br>  <br>he dead?</br>  <br><br>le race banane</br></br>  <br>tumblr seems to be a britfag<br><br>and the fact that it went on /pol/ eliminates some of the b8 possibility</br></br></br>  <br>I'm not gay but 4chan does have a lot of fag shit on it. s/fur and tranny threads. Gotta admit that.</br>  <br>Nah bro, just getting a facial</br>  <br><br> why do you guys hate the all-inclusive progressive social network tumblr? <br>It's not all inclusive, and it's almost completely populated by females whereas 4chan is almost completely populated by males. We're just too different, you know?<br><br> Why are you guys against feminism so much? is it because you dont think woman are human? <br>Most people think women and men deserve equal rights. But the people who label themselves as feminists are those that seem to think females are SUPERIOR to males, which isn't true. And they only appear to think women deserve only the positive things men have that they don't, not the negative. (eg, not enough female CEOs but truck drivers, rubbish collectors, and other people that do the hard dirty work don't need to be female)<br> <br> why dont you think 4chan is as accepting as tumblr is? <br>Tumblr's all about accepting women's rights and gender fluidity or whatever, we on 4chan don't really care. There's no need to continue to make a huge deal over something like that that's been discussed for decades.<br><br> do you conciser your self bigots/sexist/racists/homophobic/tr<wbr>ansphobic/ as everyone else on the internet thinks all of 4chan is.</wbr> <br>Well yeah, we just don't care...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> le race banane <br> le race <br> le </br></br></br>  <br> gotta admit that <br><br>you sound like you are indeed gay, and loving it</br></br></br>    <br>I don't know. But I'm a white cis privileged male that supports Hitler and I look down on minorites. I also think trans aren't humans, but abominations. And during my free time, I support GamerGate.<br>Now go make me a sandwich while I sexualize MLP characters.</br></br>    <br>I am disappointed so far</br>  <br>within the limits of state law you pedofag</br>  <br>There where a lot less before the fappening brought all the reddit fags over</br>  <br> inb4 overused <br>/b/ro, she's had enough sandwich's</br></br>  <br>If I were, I think I would know. I'm not. I'd rather fuck Emily Ratajkowski than Channing Tatum, you know what I'm saying?</br>  <br>fat bitch gonna need more than a sandwish...</br>  <br>I'm all for a racewar, but in reality I'm a flabby 30 year old shut-in surrounded by pizza boxes and piss stained trackpants</br>  <br>I can just see her being so fucking proud about her stupid board<br>best thing she ever came up with since mixing mayonnaise and pancakes for her breakfast<br><br><br>fucking olivenigger and his debt derailed the bread</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>no his eye is wide open.</br>  HANG THE NIGGERS  <br>True. You're right about that. And there'll probably be another one and yet another influx of faggots coming along for the ride. This fucking place is such a melting pot of shit anymore, that it's actually sad.</br>    <br> fucking olivenigger and his debt derailed the bread <br>I am surprised they still have internet connection</br></br>  <br>You should understand that what you get out of each sub is different and you picked the absolute worst to make a serious question, you fag tumblr twat</br>  Cringe thread. GO!  <br>good one anon</br>  <br>I googled her then fapped</br>  <br>Good job.</br>  <br>hehe you can laugh, you are american, but my country is one of those who sent them money</br>  <br>sorry im swiss, and this shit is gonna make us lose money too<br><br>still laughing about it tho</br></br></br>  <br>sorry then, I thought you were someone else</br>  <br>Why did they reject the bailout? Are they stupid or smart for doing that?</br>  <br>Me too, but I got a dusty rifle and a case of rounds.</br>    <br>JEESUS I LOST MY SHIT THEN SHIT AND PISSED MY PANTS AT THE SAME TIME YOU ARE ONE FUNNY GUY</br>  Too many trannies and commies.<br>Hate fat delusional useless people,<br>Especially violent and attention seeking subhumans, but mainly because its been subverted by cultural marxists.<br>It is more accepting.<br><br>GAS THE KIKES RACE WAR NOW.<br>HITLER DID NOTHING WRONG EVER.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>well...<br><br>I think they are smart to say no to the FMI mafia and friends, people where just fed up.<br><br>On the otherside, they gonna have a very bumpy ride from here on and thats the fault of years of absurd and stupid gov choices.<br><br>So they are nor stupid nor smart, they just fucked themselves over the years and nothing will help right now</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>I would hope the master race had better bowel control... It it almost one and the same as trigger discipline.</br>  <br>being that new</br>  <br>all I care is this: My country is more poor than Greece used to be, and we still had to send them money. Will we ever see at least something of that money?</br>  <br>Incorrect! We also accept straight males if they are willing to correct themselves and listen to us. Have you never heard of my qt teenage boyfriend whom I met on TUMBLR?</br>  <br>I shat myself twice laughing at your post.</br>  <br>In what state is pictures clothed girls illegal? People have pictures of family members on the wall, is that illegal? Is it illegal for girls to walk outside to, or is it legal to see with in real life, but not a picture. If you google "girl", is all that illegal content? And why are only girls illegal, and not boys, is this sexism? Of course not you fucking autistic small mind. Picture of clothed girls has always been legal, 4chan is just not a free speech platform.</br>  <br>This!</br>  Sage  <br>nope<br><br>sorry</br></br></br>  <br>How to be accepted on 4chan:<br> step 1: lurk for a year <br> step 2:post occasionally, if someone calls you a newfag; stop <br> step 3: When people stop calling you a new fag, you are welcomed <br><br>How to be welcomed on Tumblr:<br> step 1: Don't complain about your problems, they don't matter because you are white, male, cis, straight, or christian. <br> step 2: always look at the ground, because making eye contact with a woman can cause a rupture in the space-time patriarchy. <br> step 3: Give up because you are Cis white male scum <br><br>p.s. gr8 b8 m8 8/8</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  http://sft425.tumblr.com/ op's account  She posted her tumblr in /pol/ and said not to give it to /b/. <br>sft425.tumblr.com</br>  Women aren't human  <br>OP literally never said anything about their sex you fucking retard <br>and stop taking the bait you faggot</br></br>  <br>I will make this easier for you in two points.<br><br>1.Tits or gtfo.<br>2.

Atleast we don't use hypothetical victims and wish death threats on people. Like tumblr does. <br><br>The reason I hate that shit hole site is minorities use there ancestors as tokens exploiting there hardships and because they are the offspring of there cum they share the same experiences. This is a lie, everything is so triggering to them I doubt they could handle the civil rights movement if it happened today. The user base is toxic they exploit tragedies and feed off of being victims.

They try and play it off calling racism systematic oppression but that is what we call quackery nowhere outside of your echo chamber is it defined as that. Hatred is hatred, and lets be honest you demonize white men like hitler demonized the jews. Making up false claims and telling everyone its there fault for your shitty situation. Most of us don't work in a fortune 500 company, were on the same playing field as you.  <br>I took the time and checked her tumblr, she seems to at least a bit understand the hypocrisy of feminazis</br>  Feminism is about gaining equal rights and opportunities for women, and allowing women to have control over their lives and bodies. At a time when women are sexualized and objectified in so many cultures, feminism is also about empowering women and young girls.<br><br>4chan cannot see how this is true because they have an extreme case of cognitive dissonance and just want to empower themselves.<br><br>We see hundreds of threads everyday objectifying women and it is imperative that we stop this.<br><br>Consider this thread the first wave.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sure, like tumblr never objectifies neither women or men. You are so full of shit, along with your site. At least we all realize we are autistic.</br>    GTFO NORMIE FAGGOT  <br>Feminism is a joke, it's just an excuse to bash men. You're hypocrites, go die along with the rest of tumblr.</br>  <br>You seek out the things that offend you. If you don't like what is on 4chan, don't come on this website. Simple as that. Now go back to tumblr faggot</br>  <br>faggot here, why everyone is laughing at this? explain pl0x</br>  <br>No, its not. You dont really know what feminism means do you? Look it up. Its the belief that men and women should have equal rights and opportunities. If you are smart enough you would realize we fight for equality.</br>  <br>fuck off newfag</br>  <br>okay, then call it equalism or something.</br>  <br>That's what the word means. Tumblr doesn't "fight for equality" all it does is say everything is beautiful like being unhealthy (by your own power, not a disability) and bash men for being the root of all evil. Go back to your cancerous website.</br>  <br>Nice pasta m8</br>  <br>checkm8</br>  <br>You obtained equality long ago.<br>Modern day Feminism is just a movement for female superiority.<br>You're happy to keep the social conventions which are in your favour, ie - men holding doors, paying for everything on dates, not hitting women, first off any sinking ship. But not the ones against you.<br>Double standards.<br>You see "sexism" because you're not an attractive girl...which is a the perfect easiest thing to be in life.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shitty b8 if I've ever seen one</br>  <br>What equality? Women are paid less than men for the same jobs. A large percentage of the world refuses to recognise rape within marriage as a criminal offence. Women still deal with catcalling on a daily basis. A woman is raped every six seconds. Its not about female superiority. You convince yourselves that there is equality by ignoring the injustices.</br>  Fuck you OP, faggot ass nigger  <br>Melbourne?</br>  Your soul is mine!!!  <br>There's injustices on both sides, rape within marriage?...you mean sex when she didn't feel like it? And catcalling isnt am injustice. The forced silence men have been castrated into these days when it comes to feminism is. Nobody dare speaks out for fear of being called sexist. And as for pay... Well, you need to ask yourself why men have been the dominate gender for the whole of mankind (barring a few stints)..are we the stronger gender? If so then, yeah we should get paid more. Im not the strongest, best looking guy in the world, that's why I don't date supermodels. Should I just get on with it and accept that or moan and try and shame the supermodels for going out with the stronger more attractive males.</br>  <br>Underrated post</br>  <br>Fucking kek m8. Thx for that</br>  <br>The woman being paid less bullshit is bullshit. Women EARN less than men because men are stigmatized to work to pay for the house/kids/food/wife. Just because some women don't like catcalling doesn't mean all women don't. Rape or sexual assault? The way Tumblr defines rape it's no wonder why the rape statistics are equal to the Congo during its civil war. You know, the one that used rape as a weapon of war. You didn't mention how atrocious it is that men get raped in prison constantly. Do feminists care? Nope. What about child abuse? Women are majority when it comes to abusing children mentally and sexually. Do we hear about wanting to change this from feminists? Nope. It's all about female superiority, from drunk =/= consent with women and not men, favoritism in schools in all forms, elementary, secondary and college, to men not having the rights to their own child and being financially crippled in divorce courts. We do not live in a patriarchy. There is no rape culture and I'll be fucked sideways by the only nigger rabbi that doesn't have aids before free speech is destroyed by the perpetually offended otherkin Trans logic goat fuckers.</br>  <br><br>rekt</br></br>  hello i am kappa  <br>Hello Kappa, nice to meet you.</br>  the feminist movement, is a full of morons. They're more concentrated on having women seen as a greater gender than men. The movement should be directed at equality, but instead they focus and creating reasons that actually have no benefit to making women's lifes better. There is no excuse to be a fat lard, but body acceptance is a necessity to them. They say stop saying "don't get raped" rather than "stop raping", which I agree but that isn't how life works. There will always be sick people in the world, just like how there are parents that beat their children, steal, or other things that are horrible. I am a female, and I was sexually abused as a child, and I wouldn't teach my daughter to where what she wants, and expect a man not to rape her because he shouldn't, I would teach her not to dress inappropriately and watch out for predators. I would teach her that there are sick people out there male or female, and to always keep distance from people she doesn't know, and be aware of relatives or close family friends. Yes, it's not fair we don't get paid the same amount as men, but some reason there are more rallies to allow women to be topless in public. I don't know about other women, but I personally don't want to be gawked at when I'm out with my family because I think that's "equality". The believe in killing an unborn child because they can't own up for being a whore. I don't really follow the movement, because I think it's fucking stupid in most ways, but what I've heard really shows what direction this generation is headed and it's sickening.<br><br>you can't take anyone seriously on here, most of the time.</br></br>  <br>no</br>  <br>Holla me anegro</br>   first question: why do you guys hate the all-inclusive progressive social network tumblr? <br>i don't<br>fb is cancer tho<br> Second: Why are you guys against feminism so much? is it because you dont think woman are human? <br>i'm not, nope<br> Third: why dont you think 4chan is as accepting as tumblr is? <br>what<br> Last question: do you conciser your self bigots/sexist/racists/homophobic/tr<wbr>ansphobic/ as everyone else on the internet thinks all of 4chan is.</wbr> <br>nope none of those things, live and let live, to each their own, fite da powa etc.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yo kappa</br>  I agree that if a woman works in the same job as a man, she should get paid the same amount, and that there should not be any special treatment because of gender or race. That is equalism to me. Feminazi "body acceptance" and other ideologies are bullshit  If you 4channers really think that feminism is about female superiority then you're wrong. But I cant do anything about it because you sexist scum like inequality. So be it.<br><br>This is a warning to 4chan. Tumblr will not ignore this. We WILL act. We WILL make sure that misogyny will not go unpunished. Expect us.</br></br>  What does /b/ think of her?

I'd have had your six mang. Not gunna greentext, but I had a similar situation in high school with a male libfag history teacher. Faggot put hands on me and I pushed him over a desk.<br><br>Felt good man.</br></br></br>  <br>I fucking hate americans holy shit</br>  <br>Hory sheet<br> inb4 heterosexual relationship </br></br>  <br>Probably a scam</br>  <br>Ok, she confirmed its satire, but there's people reblogging it and supporting it still</br>  <br>gets me every time, but I find it hard to believe people can be so awful on the one hand and so powerless on the other. <br>Maybe I am a bit naive but it somehow looks too black and white in the story. <br><br>Its a good story though, I rage every time.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm American and I understand your hatred for these people and people like them but we aren't all like this.</br>  <br>because there are real people doing it now.</br>  <br>  not knowing what bulking is </br>  <br>Lost</br>  <br>those fat men,have no idea about their long last brother<br> yfw you'll never get this joke </br></br>  <br>oh fuck I lost so hard. penis=male/boy vagina=boy/girl this is biological fact not opinion.</br>  <br>wat</br>  <br>Not to mention the chromosomes support it even more</br>    <br>Nah, you either had no problems, or you were hanged.</br>  <br> squirrelkin </br>  <br>Alright, finally got me. <br>Worst think about this shit: I'm not sure if these people are serious. <br>If I read things like "all womyn are bitches 'n whores" here, I know you guys are trolling and memeing, but if I read shit like that on tumblr or twitter it's kinda different.</br></br></br>  Well, got to go now.

Oh the sweet irony.</br>  <br>Don't worry, guys. The full post explained the satire. She was making a point because some bitch said something about her "trauma" from walking home.</br>  <br>Why are so many Americans like this?</br>  <br>I guess guys no longer need to hide boners, no instead whenever a man gets a boner he should pull it out of his pants for all to see, it is natural after all</br>  <br><br>Male pain is a myth.<br><br>Men often go on and on about their 'difficulties' in life, how they've supposedly been hurt and impaired in an attempt to equate their base experiences to that of women.<br>I'll break the misconception here though: men cannot actually feel pain, as men do not actually feel.<br>Pain and suffering requires emotion, spirituality, empathy and thought beyond a base level. Any negative emotion 'suffered' by men is barely registered on any meaningful level.<br>What men tend to call 'pain' is nothing more than manipulative impulses. A man calling out in supposed hurt is only trying to force women (actual human beings) to pay attention to them.<br>I'm writing to hopefully educate some of you men.<br> <br>Nothing you feel is of worth.<br>Nothing you feel is of consequence<br>Nothing you feel is realistic<br>Nothing you feel empowers and improves other's lives.<br><br>Do not consider your own worthless 'feelings' to mean anything, support feminism, support women and support the advancement of actual beings, instead of dedicating your lives to your own worthless screaming flesh.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=hD5<wbr>f8GuNuGQ</wbr>  [ ]<br>Let the Jim-bob rustling intensify.

It's not as ethnically and culturally homogenous as many countries in Europe or other places of the world are. Americans hate other groups of Americans, and hate being lumped into groups with them.</br>  <br> race is a societal construct with no basis in biology </br>  <br>Penis=male<br>Vagina=Female<br>Anybody who disagrees is faggot. nuff said</br></br></br>  <br>Rule 1 fagits.
