Honestly porn and masterurbation probably ruined my marriage. Found myself not being attentive to my wife, not having a desire to have sex with her...at least not enough to bother trying since porn was so much easier.<br><br>I'd advise against it if you plan on ever being married.</br></br>  maricón, sigue ordeñándote  <br><br><br>Is there any way to assume it that doesn't imply smoking or is it the only way?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Why would you want to stop?

Not finding my wife attractive as I used to. Day 3 of 30. Pray for me.<br><br>I dont want to end up like this faggor</br></br></br>  <br>Sauce?</br>  <br>Your dick get's desensitized. Or rather look at it like this. It adapts to how your hand feels. The pressure you use is nothing like a vagina. The friction nothing like one either. Even the fucking speed at which you fuck your hand is different.<br><br>If you're like me and went years without pussy and then start getting it you'll end up not being able to cum from sex. Now I have to reteach my brain to want pussy more than the hand. I'm doing it just like you would teach a dog to eat it's shitty dry food over wanting canned deliciousness. Only feed my dick pussy and stop jerking off. <br><br>Jerking isn't bad for you but it can have natural consequences.</br></br></br></br></br>  A Demon Warlock threatens /b/ It is up to us to defeat it.

I need about $40. I'm sorry for begging but I'm a faggot. Picture is it, needs a new screen. <br>My PayPal is mrorionge@gmail.com</br>  <br>That's a bios screen, not an error message.</br>  <br>I'm not talking about the screen. I'm talking about the huge fucking crack in it...</br>  <br>Use an external monitor? Were you planning on replacing it yourself? Screens are generally more than $40. What's the model type?</br>  <br>Oh I was told it was about $40 and that it's easy to replace, and I can't use an external monitor. It's a Toshiba Satellite A135-S4527. It's old as shit<br>But yea I was planning on replacing it myself, as again, I WAS told it was easy.</br></br>  <br>just sent you 900€ anon<br>enjoy your new laptop.<br>greets from novomatic austria</br></br></br>  <br>Just because you buy a screen replacement doesn't mean you can't fuck it up, and you bet whomever told you that is going to charge a service fee. You can expect to pay at least $60-$80 dollars, maybe more if you fuck up the laptop.</br>  <br>Yea man</br>  <br>OP, is this anon legit? Smh</br>  <br>I was talking just $40 for the screen itself and for me to put it in my self or whatever... I see screens between $42 and $60 for my model, so how hard can it be to replace it myself? <br>Am I being a complete retard here?</br></br>  <br>He's not but its whatever</br>  U gave ur computer glasses?  <br>Looks like it</br>  <br>It's pretty hard, but if you do decide to take that route, make sure you look at tutorials, because a lot of models require you to completely disassemble the laptop and put it back together. Some parts are made from fragile plastic and break easily. You're going to want to know where they're at.<br><br>Not trying to hate, but good; I've been here over 7 years and never saw a dime. I did donate a few steam games once, but then faggots started making those steam begging threads.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh yea I'll watch a lot of shit, read up on it and all. And in regards to te second part, same here. I just have to find some way to get some money. Again, I'm poor, but there's obviously others worse off than me. And I've donated 2 games, one some random guy sent me and te other Fallout New Vegas Ultimate Edition that I got from a friend. Too bad I really can't play anything now :/</br>  <br>might be hard doing it yourself if you dont know what your doing. my mom found a laptop but when you turned it on the screen was fucked up no crack just fucked up so i decided to take it apart. bad idea lol i ended up tearing of the screen and the keyboard. was harder to take apart then i thought lol.</br>  I have the same problem if anyone can help I can't get my screen to come on at all its a dell aluminum my exgf poured mountain dew on it and it sizzled and screen went out please help even a dollar will be helpful<br>jsisk59@gmail.com is PayPal</br>  trap thread?<br>trap thread!</br>        Hey everyone, it's time for Game of /b/ros! Who's up for some go/b/?<br><br>This time with a twist. I've noticed that a lot of people have lost interest in go/b/ because eventually, it all get's boring. So, I decided to mix it up a little. This is an old map, but as most of you can see, with an entirely new continent in the oceans. Atlantis has come, and which one among you will be the one to gain it's power and reign as King of Atlantis.<br><br>PLEASE! PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD! READ WHAT IS WRITTEN ON THE MAP. I'm a no shit's given OP, so please read the included explanation for the Atlantis DLC. Also, to those thinking of soloing the quest, don't. You see how many T's Atlantis has? Not to mention how difficult taking the stronghold is. You'll need allies.<br><br>Also, no fucking hugboxing. No having more than two allies people. You can break an alliance, but only once per thread. Now, good luck to you all.<br><br>We;ll start with five players.<br><br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/630806358#p630806358">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  ffsdfsd  <br>hey wtf are you doing attacking a peaceful city</br>  bump  Does anyone in /b/ knows wtf is this?<br>It has been there like 4 months ago, and it's very painfull<br>I didnt visited the doctor yet.</br></br>  More!!  <br>Warts grow roots like trees.
