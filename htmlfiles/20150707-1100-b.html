Her family is also very close-knit and non-niggy. She also has a better body than most asians thanks to her Caribbean genetics.

So many good ones I saved</br>  Alright /b/, I start my detox tonight.<br><br>Ask a meth addict who's starting rehab today anything.</br></br>  bump for interest.  Why did you decide to stop?  <br>You ever heard of 'Rock Bottom'? That's pretty much where I'm at. Basically, life is pretty shitty right now, and if I continue to use, I'll either end up dead or worse.</br>  <br>Where did your parents go wrong?</br>  <br>Do you have anyone supporting you through these moments in your life?</br>  Wats the longest you went without sleep on a meth binge  <br>They never really went wrong anywhere. I lived a pretty good life growing up. It's my own fault that I'm like this.<br><br><br>Really, my girlfriend is the only person supporting me. She's a former addict and was the person who finally convinced me to enter rehab.</br></br></br></br>  Can you see lithium crystals develop when you smoke shake and bake meth?  <br>Longest I've ever gone on a meth binge without sleep was about a week and a half.</br>  <br>Yeah, but only if it's really shitty stuff.</br>  <br>Idk what all you're willing to answer, but let me ask anyways... What's the absolute worst thing you've done while on Meth? Also, what's the most vile thing you've done to attain Meth?</br>  Did you fry your brain? Do you feel stupider now, or struggle with things you could do before? I know a guy who smoked method all the time for 26 years and he is now legitimately retarded.  <br>Worst thing: Hit my girlfriend in a meth rage.<br><br>Vile thing: Pulled a gun on my former dealer. I nearly shot him. He wouldn't give me the amount I wanted, even though I had enough money.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't really know. I mean, I don't feel completely retarded (I've used for about 5 years now), but then again, I'm sure half of my brain is fried.</br>  <br>had your "last" fix yet?</br>  <br>Do you think you'll relapse? Ya know, how most people do their first time trying to be clean.. Do you think you will? Or do you think your willpower and your girlfriends support will suffice for you to not.?</br>  <br>I had my last fix 4 days ago. Still high as I type this.</br>  <br>I'm gonna try my hardest to stay clean. I know most former addicts turn the whole 'born again Christian' route, but I'm atheist, so I don't really need that. I'm sure my own willpower can make me stay clean. Plus, my girlfriend's the only person I love more than anything in the world, and she knows how to keep me on the straight path.</br>  <br>Hmm... Do you ever plan on having kids?</br>  <br>Yeah, I do. My girlfriend and I have talked about a family for a while, but I really want to be clean before that can happen. I'm afraid that if I'm high around my kids, I'll do something to hurt them or kill them.</br>  <br>Good for you op. Meth is a nasty habit. My girlfriend is a recovering meth addict. She's got a few years clean. Good luck and much love</br>  <br>Do you think you'd be doing what you've decided to do if you didn't have your girlfriend?</br>  <br>Thanks. My girlfriend's the same way. She's been clean for about a year and a half now.<br><br><br>Most likely no. When you're an addict, you pretty much cut everyone out of your life. Besides my girlfriend, I never see any of my close family or friends anymore.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you plan on seeing them after you get clean? The question I'm about to ask is simply theoretical and bot intended to upset you. Do you think if your girlfriend and you broke up, you'd relapse?</br>  <br>I'm planning on seeing my mom and dad right after I get clean and finish rehab. I haven't seen them for about 3 years now. If me and her broke up, I don't think I'd stoop that low to begin using again. There's so many more alternatives to depression and heartbreak than drug use and alcohol use.</br>  <br>Good. I'd love to ask you more questions, but I have to go work now. Good luck Anon!</br>  what #number of try?<br>best moment ever in life?<br>moment you want to bein?<br>suck a dick for 20 euro?</br></br></br>  <br>1. I've done meth for 5 years.<br>2. There's no good moments when you're a meth addict.<br>3. I'd like to be clean, married, and have a family.<br>4. I've never sucked dick or done anything sexual for money.</br></br></br></br>  <br>how come you started taking meth?</br>  <br>whats worse then dead?</br>  <br><br>1 - accept<br>2 - i meant your whole life dipshit. you would be lying if you said you did not have one. guilty pleasures included ofcourse!<br>3 - I means, the moment in your past which you could relive. not some fantasy shit in the future.<br>4 - The question is, would you do it now? right now.. a stranger comes up to you, and offers it. 20 euro to suck his clean dick. Would y Mr addict for 5 years?<br>5 - howmuch money did you got and howmuch did you spend on meth?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  even though you're probably not a millionaire or anything at the moment, your life just way, way upgraded by dropping the meth. imagine if you went back? that'd be such shittiness.  kek<br>the first day is easy<br><br>you're fucked son, seek outside help</br></br></br>  i took about 1500 mg lyrica today is this still safer use?  <br>You know how the always say 'marijuana is a gateway drug'? For me, it was. I started smoking weed in high school. I'd gone to raves my senior year, but nobody at raves has weed. All they had was coke and MDMA. So, I started to use that, with coke being the main thing I'd always used. Around my junior year of college, I discovered meth and I thought the high was amazing.<br><br><br>Well, being sold into sexual slavery is pretty shitty.<br><br><br>2. Best thing that's ever happened in my life was meeting my girlfriend. If it weren't for her, I wouldn't be going to rehab.<br>3. I'd love to relive my high school years, except I'd stay away from weed this time.<br>4. Would I do it now? No. I'm not that much of a scumbag.<br>5. Normally, I spend about $600 a month on meth.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't really use Lyrica, so I can't help you on that one. Sorry man.</br>  Got sober from 8 years of daily Rx opiate/heroin abuse on Feb 22 of this year. Doing well so far but everyday has its challenges. What kind of treatment are you going into? just detox? detox then inpatient? Detox then intensive outpatient? 12 step based?<br><br>My best advice would be to go to sober living when you're done with your program, to take suggestions and know that the shitty way you're feeling is only temporary.<br><br>Good luck anon, much love.</br></br></br></br>  <br>2 - cheers<br>3 - meant one moment but yeah, whatever. that tells me weed was bad for you. Happens.<br>4 - Atleast you got a steady income!<br>5 - probably is answered already, imma go and look.but what kind of work do you do?</br></br></br></br>  <br> nobody at raves has weed <br><br>wtf kindof raves did you go to? you must not be in Cali, because our raves have weed everywhere.</br></br></br>  <br>Good luck. I'm a recovering alcoholic and recovering benzo addict.<br><br>My rock bottom was drinking hand sanitizer and lysol. That was it.<br><br>You won't die or anything you'll just feel fucked up for a day or so.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>oh and to add I spent like $40,000 on weed, alcohol and benzo's over 5 years.</br>  <br>Want some meth?</br>  the fact that you're posting on b means you will relapse. <br><br>This is the bottom of the barrle of an already shitty website. You have no life and you're posting on the worst board of any chan. If you dont find something thats a real time killer you'll relapse. and if you keep browsing /b/, a board that constantly tells you to kill yourself and do drugs, you'll relapse. You're a loser and if your girlfriend dumps you, which she will, the first thing you'll do is find meth. Fix your life with websites that tell you what to do and stay off /b/, or die. /b/ is actually going to kill you. Which is probably good in all honesty do you even care about yourself anymore?</br></br>  <br>Thanks, much love and good luck with sobriety to you too.<br><br>I'm going into detox then inpatient. It's the same my girlfriend went to when she got clean. Afterwards, I'm not really sure what I'll do. Maybe join a 12 step program.<br><br><br>I build computers from my house and sell them. People tell me what they want for parts, I get the parts for them, build the PC, turn it over for profit.<br><br><br>I live in Seattle. I've heard that a lot of the raves around here have weed, but back when I went to them in high school, nobody had it.<br><br><br>Thanks man, good luck. My rock bottom was hitting my girlfriend in a fit of rage when I was frying hard.<br><br><br>No, but thanks for the offer.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're a dumbass, I've been clean for 3 years now and have used 4chan the entire time.</br>  <br> how does that shitty explanation makes weed a gateway drug? Coke is far worse for your brain m8. Weed isnt a gateway drug, rave party's were! And you are weakminded!</br>  <br>Oh,so your some weak little bich that needs ppl to tell you to not do meth? <br><br>You're such a bitch that you need someboy to hold your hand and guide you away from it?<br><br>Just kill yourself pussy.</br></br></br></br></br>  hello i need friends.  <br>To be fair, alcohol is the gateway drug.
