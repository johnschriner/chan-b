[ Ex GF wants to get DPed by me and another dude. Should I do it? She picks the other guy.  Has anyone done this or something similar before? Advice?  <br>Don't do it</br>  <br>it's your ex, you only live once, do it. also where's the pic faggot?</br>  <br>did you just drop a YOLO?</br>  I've done it many times, if it's already an ex go for it. It's pretty awesome to slut a girl out like that. Is it Devils threesome or French threesome?  <br><br>If it's a nigger, walk out</br></br>  <br><br>Or a jew</br></br>  Right, where is this sluts picture????  Depends if you want to become almost a fag OP.  <br>or another man</br>  <br>Do it so you can surprise DAP the bitch while you're at it.</br>  <br>Do it. Just make sure that at any given time, you're penetrating her (mouth, ass, pussy, with either your fingers, tongue, or dick). Otherwise you'll start to feel left out, and your inner beta will take over.</br>  <br>My worst fear would be getting into that situation and I was nervous so I couldnt get hard, but the other dude easily had a raging erection. Would feel like such a bitch,</br>  <br>that's a concern. I have a big dick, but I am also a little worried she will choose someone bigger than me.</br>  Fuck it, it's an ex anyway! Go for it!!  Post her faget  <br>Shit yeah, I met this girl recently who said she wants to try a 3some with 2 guys. I could be the one guy but for fuck sake I have bladder shyness as it is. Now I must get a hardon with some guy there.</br>  <br> Ex-gf <br>Of course do it. Eiffel Tower her while you're at it. It's not cuckoldry if she your ex. And don't let the balls touch, or your a fag.</br></br>  <br>Only if you pick the guy and she agrees that you can do/say what you want including pee in her ass</br>  these are her tits. won't post face.  oops.. THESE are her tits.  <br>How the hell did she ask you that?</br>  <br>Mmmh would suck and cum on them</br>  <br>Moar!<br>Show body at least</br></br>  <br>via text message.</br>  <br>..No I mean like she just straight up asked you or what?</br>    <br>yea pretty much. she knows me well enough to know I am deviant and that I would be interested.</br>  <br> Ex GF <br><br>shes going to do this with or without you anon. She invited you. Get over yourself and do it.<br><br><br><br><br>also this</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Quints get. Chek'd.</br>  <br>checked.<br><br>Anon is correct. Either you're ok with another dude being there or you're not, but you don't owe her loyalty or shit.</br></br></br>  <br> Should I do it? She picks the other guy. <br> She picks the other guy. <br>She already has picked the other guy anon. <br>Leave her.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Checked</br>  <br> Ex gf <br><br>Op, go for it. I'd advise more caution if she were a current significant other, but here you've basically got nothing to lose and I hear it's like nothing else.</br></br></br>  <br>Ex</br>  <br>Mega checked</br>  We should raid something  <br>ITT: Children.</br>    bump  this twitch fag<br> thegreenayylien <br><br>songrequest<br><br>kike nose</br></br></br></br></br>  bump  <br>call-ins</br>  <br>NYPA nigger</br>  I think it would be cool if we could wreak havok on a larger scale.

Her friend turns out to be an incredibly cute moe cliche.<br><br>Being a huge beta loser, I immediately bleach my mind of any possibility that I could date her.<br>I also knew that 2 other guys actively liked her, one being pretty handsome, so I said fuck it and didn't even try.<br><br>Oddly enough, she starts calling me more. One day after I walk her back to her dorm, I mention that I'm tired and she offers to give me a back massage. "Uh..I might just go back and get some rest" was my brilliant response. I go back thinking that was a little odd.<br>cont.?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  30 years old never had a job or gf here. what do i do now?  Furry chatroom. 2007 was wild times for everyone, man.  <br>This girl and I liked each other as evidenced by wanting to spend time together. I asked her to be my gf. After a couple years things were still good so we decided to get married. We've been married 11 years and things are still pretty good. <br>Isn't that how everyone does it?</br></br>  <br>You lucky bastard</br>  <br>A week goes by and I am walking over to a study group with some of her friends in another dorm one night. I pass her walking beside handsome dude carrying groceries. Don't really think much of it and just say hi. <br>About an hour later she calls me up out of the blue. She just wanted me to know that she wasn't dating him, he was just helping her with some groceries. I'm confused and ask why she's calling to tell me this. She says that it's inappropriate to walk with guys at night like that and she didn't want me getting the wrong idea. <br>k..<br>I eventually ask her out because it gets obvious even for me. She fucking turns me down. I was pissed at myself for being so stupid that I actually thought a girl like that would like me. <br>The next day she calls and is very sheepish on the phone. She says she does want to date me, but she had never really dated anyone after middle school and was nervous.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tinder actually. What started as a one-time thing turned into a 9 month relationship.</br>  <br>that'll be me in 8 years</br>    Found her laying down in a back alley fucked over and raped   knew her since elementary school. <br> she moved to california in 10th grade. <br> so sad <br> huge crush on her since I first knew her. dreamgirl.jpg <br> she moves back several years later and comes over to say hi.  <br> hug <br> fireworks/galaxy explosions/ more cliches <br> broke up with my girlfriend of 5 years to be with her. <br> she says yes <br> been together extremely happily for almost a year now. <br> plan on moving in together in January. <br> plan on marrying her. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I eventually ask her out because it gets obvious even for me. She fucking turns me down. I was pissed at myself for being so stupid that I actually thought a girl like that would like me.  <br>kek<br> The next day she calls and is very sheepish on the phone. She says she does want to date me, but she had never really dated anyone after middle school and was nervous. <br>jealous</br></br></br></br>  My wife and I were fucking back when she was living with her girlfriend of 3 years. Her ex killed her self four weeks later    4chan<br><br>...I'm serious</br></br>  <br>How the fuck did you manage that?</br>    Omegle, live with the bitch now.  oldfag here. all my girlfriends picked me. any girl i ever tried for, i failed. sad but true  <br> tfw attractive, fit and social <br> girls into me, but most of them look like shit <br> the only girls I would date do not even live in the same state as me <br><br>I still don't care, though, if I want to invest time on someone that girl better be a qt</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>there are people out there who actually do this sort of thing, they feel lonely and want to know what it is like to have a gf, no joke</br>   be me <br> high school <br> qt 3.14 petite,Junior(I was a sophomore) <br> wore cute little outfits(i.e. skirts, dresses, overalls) <br> Told myself that I needed her <br> knew it would never happen <br> decided to just talk to her and be her friend; That was good enough for me <br> A few months later, I decided that I couldn't handle not having her; Was still beta-fag about trying to get with her, but never had problems talking to other girls before her; so I was actually surprised I felt like that. <br> Tell my friend(stereotypical work-out fag) I'm into her <br> he decides that he likes her too <br> me being beta-fag I was, Tell him that he should go for her <br>(I know; I'm fucking retarded)<br> Didn't hear much about them being together, like... ever. <br> didn't even know they ever went out <br> skid ahead a few months <br> Last few weeks of school <br> She and I get close <br> she came on the last day, for me <br> had a blast, fucking around campus all day <br> We hang out a few times during summer <br>(Cont.)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm a knife </br>  <br>I see what you did there</br>   go to mall with three friends <br> know one of them is interested in me <br> have my eye on another on who I'd never met <br> one that likes me tells me I should text her <br> refuse for months <br> finally give in and text her and start dating <br> getting married soon </br></br></br></br></br></br>  I fell asleep  <br>by posting the full pic</br>  <br> How did you get your gf? <br>ma grill died last month</br></br>  The stories and information posted here are autistic works of fiction and falsehood Only a faggot such as OP would take anything posted here as fact.

(she turned him down like twice) <br> Workout fag would walk with us too (ok, whatever) <br> I switch one of my classes to get into hers(Contemporary video; Like filming movies and shit) <br> Shit was cash <br> We get closer <br> One of our films that we made together kinda made her fall for me(It was this romantic film; Everyone loved it) <br> One day we're walking together and she begins to talk about how she feels about me <br> Tells me how our time during summer helped her develop her feelings for me <br> "I really like you, anon. But I still have feelings for 'Workout fag' and I don't know what to do" <br> I say some deep shit about how it's her life and how 'she should do whatever she would feel most happy with' and 'I'm not gonna tell you how to live your life'; 'No matter what you do, all that matters is that you're happy' <br> I tell her to put it out of her mind for now, and let's just enjoy our day <br> She agrees <br> we continue walking around the neighbourhood <br>(Cont.)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>sry anon, i just found that pic on 4chan</br>  <br>Abducted, raised, trained.</br>  <br>Aids</br>  <br>she is 10/10 asian who weighs 100 pound and has 32g cup. u might as well kill yourself</br>    <br>is this person real?

You're a person, not some prize to be won. You can do whatever you want to, and he should be happy with that" and that I'd be happy with whatever she chooses, as long as she's happy <br>(at this point he is still messaging her and then she throws her phone on the ground and breaks down in tears. This kills me)<br> I say "God, he's such an asshole" <br> a few minutes of silence, i ask her "want a tissue?" and then pull out one of those little tissue packs <br> she giggles and takes one <br> a few more minutes pass <br> I ask if she's ready to go <br> she says "sure" <br> I walk her home <br> during our walk she tells me "Thank you so much, anon. I really appreciate everything you've done for me today. Everything you said made so much sense, and I think I know who I want to choose." <br> I tell her that she shouldn't decide yet, and that she should take some time for herself before she decides. <br> She looks surprised, and agrees <br> We get to her house and sit for a while, talking to her sister about what had happened <br>(Cont.)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>10/10 includes face retard. she is with a modeling company. just because your life is sad and your ugly doesn'y mean that everyone in the world is</br>  <br>If you have a long distance relationship more then likely your girl is fucking someone else<br><br> I was the someone else </br></br></br>  <br> your  <br> doesn'y <br>Not sad enough to where I can't type, slopes are 7's at best.</br></br></br>  <br>pointing out someones spelling and grammar is clear sign of defeat. go back to reddit</br>  <br>You're only saying that because you have no rebuttal, nig!</br>  Can we have some cute, but deadly lolis?

Anonymous grew out of /b/ but is not made up of the same bunch of retarded man-children who sit around and laugh about saying nigger all day.  NO ONE CARES ABOUT SOME SMELL BABOON FACED FILTHY NIGGER  <br> anon never existed <br>this</br></br>  <br>B-but the news.. It says that it's a group.<br>Seriously though I think the whole anon thing was a weapon that was good for one battle. Now it's just a propaganda point. An army without a leader or soldiers that can be used to support any retarded idea.<br>Wait for it, next 'Anonymous supports Hillary 140,000%' will be a thing.</br></br></br>  /b/ is just a trash dump. anon has moved on and away from this bullshit. anon knows real power. /b/ is just stuck as a 20 year old white guy who is sexually confused and frustrated...but actually 45 years old and fat with crooked broken glasses. <br><br>anon has nothing to do with this shit hole.</br></br>  Even when analmoose was a thing it was just a bunch of kids shitting around on the Internet<br><br>Fuck Chanology and what it did to imageboards</br></br>  Anonimoos is real. Hear they are without masks  <br>this<br><br>People don't fucking get it.<br><br>Even in that pic OP shared: "Anonymous Says"<br>You can't say that. Because anonymous never made any collective decisions.<br><br>News media just made it into the l33t h4cker group story that everyone eats up.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, that's the point. Its almost perfect. But when you look at the big picture the odds of someone being hung in their cell by (presumably) a police officer is insanely low, not to mention that there are hundreds if not thousands of better choices. Mix that with the fact that she recently said something like "now they use guns instead of ropes" just makes it obvious that she planned this. Though I would think it was a spur of the moment thing rather than something she planned for months. Could be wrong there.</br>  <br>gr8 b8 m8<br><br>and if not b8 i pity your understanding of things</br></br></br>  <br>we reserve the right to admission</br>  <br>I wonder if anonymous will ever out or hack-fight that hacker 4chan, whoever he is.</br>  <br>I heard of him</br>  <br>kek</br>  <br>libs don't want to believe</br>  <br>He was on the news that time. Pic unrelated but OC.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ghc<wbr>mo2x2GaY</wbr>  [ ]  <br>I think its a little ironic how Anonymous, a thing that 4chan more or less invented, is now in the same category as memes and and all the other shit we invented that is now the property of self important fags on Reddit and other havens of utter faggotry. If I could erase anything from the history of the internet it would be Chanology, that was what ultimately convinced SJWs that anonymous was some kind of hive of socially conscious edgelords. I seriously want to punch anyone who even owns a Guy Fawkes mask.<br><br>Maybe we should just make Anonymous the new ebaumsworld, just star doing crazy destructive shit and blame it on them and Reddit.</br></br></br>  <br>ANAMOOSE IS KOMING</br>  Forget about the anonymous shit or whether or not she killed herself;<br><br>Pig had no right to tell her to get out of the car or to forcibly remove her</br></br>  <br>ugh don't remind me of chanology.<br><br>And actually, that's an interesting thought. We can don the guy-fag masks again and mess with shit, and then all the preteen faggots that are anoneemoose will get sad.<br><br>We'd also be feeding the media.

We are Legion. We do not forgive. We do not forget. We do not floss. Expect us.  I really am amazed that the whole idea of 'anonymous' has blown up like it has since 2006ish. <br><br><br>That being said, whoever or whatever controls what 'anonymous' says now is a fraud.

I mean, all other generations for the most part were too, but what makes millennials especially susceptible is that they *think* they're that much smarter and up to date with things than everyone else. Most don't realize that while they're getting fed more information than anyone else had access to at their age at any other time in history, the hand that's feeding it to them has an agenda all it's own.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>lol someone is summer</br>    <br>It is still a thing.. only now the name is being used by SJW wannabes. <br><br> We created the brand, sadly our image which was created for nothing more than a way to joke and scare fox news took off.. it appealed to 13 year old faggots.. those faggots are now in college.</br></br></br>  <br>socialism is an economic model not a cultural one you faggot</br>  <br> learn your 4chan history <br>Oh goody, old man Summer has come home to roost.</br></br>    <br> We created the brand, sadly our image... <br><br>jesus christ....</br></br></br>  <br> And I don't think it's a coincidence that race relations have magically become so much worse in the eyes of everyone (especially the media which just adds jet fuel to the fire at any given opportunity) the past 8 years since Obama - people realized the wars overseas were a bankrupt venture, and so Obama had to find another way to divide and conquer.  <br><br>Rly?</br></br></br>  <br>Yep, this<br><br>Remember those pictures of those little 13-14 year old faggots wearing ANONYMOOSE masks at the chantology protests back in 2009?<br><br>Those faggots are hitting their 20s now, and they've grown up around all this 'social justice' bullshit, entrenched.

It's not really Obama so much as the cultural/economic elite though, Obama, like every other president for the most part, just does what he has to to keep his job. <br><br><br>I know it sounds tin foil hat-ish, but I don't care. If you've ever done any sort of in depth study of history, you'll see the elite class doing similar shit throughout most cultures throughout most of history. It's just the law of power.
