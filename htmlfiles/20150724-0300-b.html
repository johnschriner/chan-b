Will still need to hold a presentation about that, but I have some time until then.<br><br>The computer is pretty hopelessly outdated. I'll just swap in a new harddrive (old one vibrates massively) and install linux. Hopefully no rocket science.<br><br>These inspections are mandatory each second years. I've been gradually repairing broken stuff on the bike for weeks now. One month overdue already. Damn TÜV and it's high standards...</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd say 2, the floor has carpet, and I have blankets.<br>It also helps my back re-align.</br></br>  <br>3, because everyone needs pets in the morning.</br>  <br>This scenario <br>also applies to you</br></br>    <br>1, It might seem a little creepy if I sit there for several minutes, doing nothing.<br>I want to make sure she feels at home on Earth.</br></br>  <br>She wakes up and then a sudden development ensues<br><br>Your...<br><br>1.Mom comes in and screams at the sight of her<br>2.Sister and comes in and immediately runs to her and pets<br>3.horny furry brother comes in and pops a morning wood</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>upon waking her up this is next</br>  <br>If I could have a fusion of 1 and 2, it would make the most sense.

NIC, Sound Blaster, ATI Mach32 video card (on the incredibly odd yet incredibly fast VLB bus) and 16 megs of ram. The I/O card can handle four hard drives; I'll install DOS one one with plenty of games (I grabbed a torrent with [nearly] all DOS games ever made and it's time to nostalgia) and some sort of UNIX clone on the other(s). <br><br>Linux and its monolithic kernel aren't going to work, save for DSL linux. I love me some DSL. <br><br>NetBSD is also planned. NetBSD runs on pretty much anything, even such a low-spec machine. <br><br>The battery on the 486 still holds a charge. After twenty years. <br><br>(sorry for babbling; I miss sfur, no reply necessary)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>OHFUCKFUCKFUCK.<br>I tell them it is an anthropomorphic dragon named Obsydian whom was fabricated by a race of extraterrestrials.<br>Need not panic, she is friendly.</br></br></br>  <br> Want some breakfast? <br>You have to eat all the eggs<br> But seriously though, what now? </br></br></br>  <br>They all say "And you're not afraid?"<br><br>You say <br><br>1.I love her<br>2.Everything is going to be ok<br>3.nah</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>2.<br>There is no need to be afraid of a benevolent presence.</br></br>    <br>Youask her if she wants to...<br><br>1.get some clothes<br>2.invite her to see the world at the mall<br>3.tell her more about her</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Checked.<br>Is this branching off or merging?</br></br>  <br>2.

It's kind of sloppy, if you ask me. Especially because the first part is pretty insightful as far as the furry porn community is concerned.<br><br>Though Hardiman seems like he was the decent sort, to me. I'm not into his stuff, but I can see why people would be.</br></br></br>  Continuum of this thread is prioritized.  <br>I've had a base dream, with branching concepts, for over 25 years. <br><br>So many things have happened to me in that time span, but the base dream has never changed, not once. <br><br>I think about them coming back, all the time. Sitting down and talking to one of them, about anything really, is worth more to me than all the treasure in the universe.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>I've always wanted to do what was in the dream, it looked like the minority was rising against the government and we were winning.<br><br>Tell me that doesn't sound fun as fuck.<br>(Raining a shitstorm on a corporate building)</br></br></br></br>    This thread will be bumped!  <br>How fun! <br><br>My dreams are similar. Taking on the government, by myself, but I'm certainly not a human in these dreams. <br><br>Funny you mention corporate buildings, for in my fantasies and dreams, I always end up kidnapping high-value targets from corporate buildings. <br><br>It'd be quite fun to crash into a skyscraper, at any level, running through windows and walls as if they were paper, grabbing the target and exploding out the other side of the building in a spray of broken glass and other materials. <br><br>The look of terror on all the humans' faces is priceless. All the while, I'm grinning and look like I'm having a ton of fun.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Tallest building in a group of 5?<br>I am with this flying armada of jetpacking hellions with varying designs, who manage to have a distaste towards the building.<br>Some of them got knocked out of the air :(</br></br></br>  <br>Time to end this<br><br>You are caught in the act and your mom tells you <br><br>Your mom saw everything and she says one of the 1,2, and 3 following depeding on what you say.Now what would you say upon being caught?<br><br>1."Get rid of her"<br>2."Looks like you'll have to marry her"<br>3."She stares in to nothingness"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>2<br>Oh lord being walked in on.</br></br>  Bump.  <br>Technology seems to be curiously absent. <br><br>Closest I get is a double-headed axe and jet-black armor (half-plate, if I had to guess what to call it) that's more or less impervious. <br><br>All senses are thousands of times more powerful than a human's. <br><br>There's also the ability to move and think so quickly that everything appears in slow-motion. It's rather easy to dodge projectiles. <br><br>While I'm unsure about 5 buildings, mine happen in some random downtown area in a highly-populated, major city. <br><br>I need to pay more attention to these dreams and perhaps keep a dream journal. <br><br>Thank you for sharing these intimate dreams.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The End!<br><br>You marry her and have 5 hybird kids.You age but she does not because she's a dragon.And so you live a happy life</br></br></br>  <br>How does the ending make you feel?</br>  <br>also,checked</br>  <br>If we spot similarities, we will discuss, right?<br><br>I've never done this type of thing before.<br>I wonder what those kids looked like.<br>Also, did NS switch off?</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Bad asses like kemonomimi dragon and yes it did,NS is down</br>  <br>It doesn't seem down for me.</br>  <br>I can see names<br>But not yours</br></br>  testing for testicles    Oh shit, it is down.  <br>Yes, yes, of course!

It's just that, depending on the scenario, either I would have one hell of a problem, everyone would have one hell of a problem, or the furries would end up living a really miserable life for the most part.<br>Would totally like having anthros in society, but I don't see our society accepting them as people.</br></br>  <br>I have saved pics from almost all of your posts.</br>  <br><br>http://vocaroo.com/i/s1zgqLgei64V</br></br>  <br>23</br>  Bumpin  <br>Sfur threads are glorious! <br><br>Nice meeting you.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>http://vocaroo.com/i/s1ciZRoB1Xz8</br></br></br>  <br>A pleasure meeting you too, Radzyn.</br>  <br>Gonna guess <br>20</br></br>    <br>Guessing your last 2 numbers in your post.<br>21 as implied.</br></br>  <br>I'm 21 :3</br>      <br>I don't think there would be more prejudice than normal. If people can convince themselves that people who look exactly like them, but are part of a different group are literal demons, I don't think they can do much worse for anthro's.</br>  <br>Do you think the Christianfags would be the ones who do the most damage to anthros if they were real?<br><br>watterson</br></br></br>    <br>Good question.</br>    <br>wouldn't be surprised</br>  <br>They'd be all like "animal fuckers!" and I'd be like "where's your god now?"</br>  <br>Fuck no.<br><br>Muslims, man. Being a literal anthro in the Islamic world would be hell.<br><br>Christians might talk a big game, and they impose their shitty rules on everyone if they get the power, but it's a long time ago that Christians went full Crusade on anyone.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If the whole world turned anthro, they question a lot.</br>  <br>Enslave them all. <br><br>They will be forced to worship us.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah,they'd be with it because goat grils</br>  <br> Christians went full crusade. <br>This part amused me.<br><br>Kek.</br></br></br></br>    <br>correct</br>  <br>But let's get real,do you think they would get the same treatment like the blacks did back then?<br><br>Would sex be a taboo?<br><br>Is michelle Obama a man</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>I think they would be prioritized above normal people, seeing as though they have abilities we don't.<br>Sex? maybe.<br>Yes</br></br></br>  <br>I've never wanted to be a stalagmite so badly!</br>  <br>I think that might actually be ice.<br>Holy shit did NS crap out again?</br></br>  <br>For starters, the way Americans treated blacks had more to do with America, and less with Christianity. Americans used Christianity to excuse it, but that shit isn't new, nor unique to Christianity. In fact, the system of slavery that still exists in Mauritania excuses it with Islam, but slavery isn't universal to the Islamic world.<br><br>The real question is, how many head honcho's and Christians in general get turned into furfags? If there are enough among them, you can bet your furry ass that they will find some way to integrate it with their beliefs.</br></br></br>    <br>Hmm. Namesync fail. <br><br><br>I thought it was ice, too, but I don't know if ice forms like that. <br><br>Also, shoving ice up my ass was the most painful thing I've ever felt; I don't have a vagina to shove ice in, but I can't imagine it being much better-feeling.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A christmas story for reference.</br>  hey /b/, name my band!  <br>Chicken Allah King</br>  Foreigner  Stone Temple 9/11Pilots  Hello /b/ <br>Post your favourite food</br>    <br>No kebab removal!</br>  <br>Cevapi looks like a turd sandwich</br>    <br>These things have always been my go to fav since I was a kid.

No mater what you do, you will have someone bitching like a little school girl.<br><br><br>Good morning top sober ship!</br></br></br></br>  <br> mfw Drei's event </br>  <br>Hello anon~ Southern please.<br><br>Guts, what a lovely surprise. You look very handsome today.</br></br></br>    <br>Heh, pretty good! A little tired though, and I did meet one of my former enemies on the other realm...but other than that I'm doing pretty good. How are you?</br>  <br>This. I know it's hard but if someone hates you and you don't reply to their hate that's just you tellin' them they ain't shit to you.<br>Also Dio is going to be kill when?</br></br>  <br>Flattery gets you nowhere with me.</br>  Lets get a real feels thread going.<br><br>Sick of the whiny "but she's with someone else. Muh Feels"<br><br>Fuck you. Feels threads used to bring people to tears.Fucking get in here, post what you got...</br></br></br></br>        <br>His dad sounds like a complete faggot</br>      <br>gave me shiver</br>    <br><br>fuck off the 2 of you faggots. go fuck up a trap thread or ylyl or something.</br></br>  Worth the read  <br>cried, through its long way to the climax</br>  <br>its blurry for me</br>  Who is this girl? Don't look at the comments, that's all bullshit. Pic related.<br><br>PHub: view_video.php?viewkey=1336561227</br></br>  What's your reason you don't kill yourself /b/? For me it's just because I don't wanna miss cool future stuff. Every time I think suicide would be cool I change my mind because I'll miss things like Fallout 4. Or the new Star Wars trilogy. Or even just a musicians music who I won't get to listen to. I just don't wanna miss cool future stuff. What about you guys?  her  I just wait the right moment to jump off of my five story buiding.  wait for the sky to fall as the rockets shoot down to the ground  <br>yeah cant die yet the new slayer is coming out soon ALSO FUCK STAR WARS JJ LENSFLAREHOMOCRAP</br>  <br>Sorry to hear that.</br>  <br>Because on the one or two occasions where I think life has actually taken *that* bad a turn, I realize that it can't get any worse, and in turn that it can only get better, and that's more than enough reason to keep going.</br>  I think about it daily, then I think of my friends that grew up without fathers and how I couldn't do it to my son  <br><br>The two singles they released are fucking heavy. It's dope.</br></br>  Too hard  <br>what OP said</br>  <br>If you have a son then you can't kill yourself and if you think about killing yourself daily your a greedy fuck<br><br> It's no longer just your life </br></br></br>    I simply enjoy too many things in life.  <br>like one father i heard who had 2 young kids. he killed himself cos his wife was dying of cancer. funny thing? she recovered and now the guy's dead and didn't even care about his children if she really did die</br>    Usually that my parents would miss me or be sad at what I had done. <br>Luckily my mom has terminal cancer and soon there will be nothing to stop me from ending the hellish parody of the human experience which constitutes my life. I will touch the gates of heaven, for I have done my time in hell.</br>  I don't know, you tell me.      yeah there is still many movies, music and games to play so why kill myself but I do sure wish had another person to cuddle late at night hmm :/  <br>don't think that killing yourself will end you up in a "afterlife paradise"</br>    ITT: We take the 15th photo in our /b/ or reaction image folder and post it, you also have to think of an applicable situation by posting it with the text "tfw...". I'll start.<br><br>Tfw you hear kids playing new Pojemon games ask "What's a Charizard?"</br></br>   tfw furries consume /b/    When you read someones opinion on /b/     tfw Summer has begun   new trap shemale cd mental illness whatever thread  Who wants the vids?  <br>Yeah, I'll try again.</br>  <br>Is this worthy</br>  Only takes one nigger to ruin shit<br><br><br><br>You are that nigger</br></br></br></br></blockquote>]
