Deze wereld snakt naar vooruitgang en nuance. Ten eerste moet religie worden uitgebannen. De enige manier waarop dat kan is met educatie, niet met wapens. Religieuze aaphoofden worden namelijk alleen maar religieuzer wanneer je tegen ze aan trapt en ze verteld dat ze echt letterlijk het syndroom van down hebben om in 2014 nog te geloven in gedateerde kutboeken en daadwerkelijk hun hele leven leiden aan de hand van dit boek ( voornamelijk moslims en amerikaanse christenen ). Wanneer religie is uitgebannen en we niet constant bezig zijn met achterlijke kut brandhaarden en conflicten over welke bebaarde arabier 1500 jaar geleden gelijk had kunnen we eindelijk streven naar een tweede globale golf van verlichting. Dan komt er een wonderschoon 2 kind per persoon beleid die gekregen dienen te worden tussen 28 en 32 jaar oud voor optimale gezondheid en ontwikkeling van het kind doordat de moeders zichzelf ook al persoonlijk ontwikkeld hebben ipv het domme neukvoer van christenen en islamieten die op hun 18de al zwanger raken en vervolgens met een immatuur brein trachten een kind fatsoenlijk groot te brengen. Op deze manier gaan we overbevolking te lijf en tegen die tijd zal alles gerecycled worden en houdt men zich ook aan deze regels omdat we het niveau van domme Amsterdam Noord buikslotermeerplein zijn ontstegen. Vervolgens ligt de weg vrij voor constante wetenschappelijke vooruitgang, ruimtevaart en een nieuwe vorm van ruimte imperialisme waar we waarschijnlijk alles weer heerlijk gaan verpesten door evolutionair biologische onontkombare processen van groepjes denken waardoor planeet x tegen planeet y gaat knokken.

The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it.

<br>No, the point is there is no fucking "training" excuse for smurfing in League.<br><br>Smurfing doesn't make you better, or help you practice. It is entirely for stroking your ego.<br><br>You do not get better by fighting shitty players.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>I thank you for confirming that I am a member of our species that isnt trash.</br>  <br> someone actually thinks figure 8 eyebrows look cool </br>  <br>Well that's not really accurate to just lump everything into a tournament structure and pretend you know what you're talking about. In tournaments seeded players typically, or are more likely to get bye's, or face off against unseeded players because they're already generally recognized to be at a certain skill level in their specific "group." Plus, it'd make for terrible entertainment. But it's already relative, there isn't a magnitude of difference in skill level between these players. <br><br>Tennis, Football, baseball, wrestling getting placed or even having "access" to a tournament is based on your division/club/league. <br><br>An all-american lacrosse player is not going to play in an MLL tournament. <br>A Div III tennis player is not going to play an ATP tournament. <br>And not necessarily skill based but a 190lb wrestler is not going to face off against a 150lb wrestler.<br><br>There is nothing really analogous to smurfing in competitive sports, and in a lot of sports attempting to enter into tournaments where you shouldn't be in often will result in some form of administrative punishment. In competitive play, of all sports of any kind, you should be placed with people who are in a general range of your skill level. League's division system attempts to do this but breaks down on several key points:<br><br>* First and foremost queuing with a lower ranked players will cause league's match making system to attempt to queue you up with generally far lower ranked players than the person you queued with. The system is trying to create a good *average* MMR between each team. However, that one "high ranked" player is still enough to completely roll the other team so long as his team mates aren't literal idiots.<br>* League's MMR class/division system is now largely based on grind mechanics. It's generally recognized to be less finely-grained than the previous straight up MMR system, and makes it easy to "play" the system so to speak.<br><br>Text limit is now 2000 characters?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Text limit is now 2000 characters?
