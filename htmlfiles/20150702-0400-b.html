[ FUCK feminism  I hear dat  <br>Yes. And while we're at it, let's get women off the road as well. They're a fucking menace!</br>  <br>Your satire is bullshit, feminist.<br>Feminism is deeply, deeply flawed.</br></br>  <br>How is that even related, you fucking feminist?</br>  <br>but, why?</br>  FEMINISM IS SHIT  <br>That pic just proves that men are irresponsible and stupid</br>  <br>You do realize these "facts" are precisely what feminism is fighting against ?</br>  <br>you are a fuckin autist and deserve nothing but cancer<br><br>check my edges cunt</br></br></br>  <br>Thats bullshit and you know it. Modern feminism is nothing more than an attempt at a power grab and not wanting to accept responsibility for any consequences therein</br>  <br>Bullshit</br>  <br><br>It also proves that men are generally the ones to take the higher risk jobs (thus higher pay), something females generally refuse to do.</br></br>  Modern day feminism is just Women wanting "equal rights" to men + the benefits they already get. It's beyond a joke, no wonder people moved away from "Feminism" and started calling themselves Human Rights activists etc.  <br>Rrriiiiight. Calling it "modern" so you show you know what you're talking about. So you show you're not spitting on the two first waves. Smart. <br><br>Except you have no fucking idea what feminism is. You've read tumblr blogs and watched half naked girls protesting and you know feel you've got enough to have an opinion. <br><br>The funny thing is, if most feminist ideas were applied to everyday life, your existence would not change one bit. <br><br>Dumb fuck. Who fucking cares about you anyway. History has shown how your kind of people fails everytime. You will be no exception.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Throne of lies</br>  <br>Over 70% of the western world doesn't identify as 'feminist'. <br><br>Likely because unlike first-wave feminism (which was about suffrage) and second-wave feminism (which was about equality in the workplace), third-wave feminism is largely about man-hating, and very little else.</br></br></br>  <br><br>..."History has shown"....<br><br>...If history has shown feminism to be the right path and if those who oppose it "Fail every time", how are we in such a totally 'oppressive' world where such a movement is needed?<br><br>I mean, you kind of raped and defeated yourself with that stupid fuck statement.<br><br>"History has shown that my point is right and your kind never win, now please change the system to reflect what history apparently already has!1!11!111!1"...<br><br>Did you even read what you fucking wrote?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  DON'T BE FOOLED BROTHERS THIS THREAD WAS CREATED BY FEMMISTS RUN WHILE YOU CAN!    <br>Second wave was about the basics rights over one's body, fuckhead. <br><br>Every single girl I fuck is at least a little bit feminist, and believe me, they don't hate men. <br><br>But you're right. If the majority thinks feminism sucks, then feminism must suck. It's how it works, right ? The majority's never wrong ?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Civil rights ? Ever heard of them ?</br>  <br>You sound like one of those atheists &gt;:(</br>  i'm just here for the shitpostin don't mind me  moar shitpostin    <br>Perfect exemple of a stupid ass article used as proof against feminism. Wow ! Some feminist are dumb ? All of them must be dumb !</br>  the shitposting continues  <br>You can stop arguing now friend, they gave up already</br>  <br><br>"Civil Rights" is a joke. A hoax. A wet dream of a tiny minority of the world's most policed and maintained nations.<br><br>Go to 90% of the planet and wake up to realizing that slavery is still alive and well. Widespread genocide and rape is alive and well.<br><br>You think that the socially architected, policed and century-long devised first world nations' revised policies that have existed in sum total for less than a handful of centuries puts a dent in the reality of human social science of millenia?<br><br>I love college and those who go to it today. They teach you such propped up horseshit.<br><br>"Civil rights".<br>Laff.<br><br><br>Must be nice to live as the top 9% of the population and decry how relevant the decisions of the top 1% over the top 9% are somehow relevant to the realities and defining attributes of the 100% of the species.<br><br>right?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>don't mind me i'm just shitpostin</br>  <br>Anybody with a brain knows feminism is tainted. If you had a brain, you'd leave the movement and not associate yourself with them.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;62515928 <br>"There are worse things in the world. Let's not do anything about what sucks at home." <br><br>I'd like to talk to an adult, please.</br></br></br>  derailing a bit, so bit more relevant shitposting now  <br>Great realist post.</br>  <br>Dude. You're on 4chan. Avoid using the word "brain", it's not a concept we know about, obviously.</br>  <br>PLEASE REFRAIN FROM USING BRAIN. IT IS MY TRIGGER.</br>      <br>saving that</br>  <br> lel'd <br> also, shitposting </br></br>  <br>why are you even on 4chan if you are a tumblr feminist who gets buttfustrated at the first mention that maybe feminism is horseshit</br>  <br>bob's burgers are the best burgers</br>  <br><br>Checked</br></br>  <br> tumblr feminists on 4chan </br>  <br>feminism itself is a noble thing, but the fat fuck third wave feminists that just want to blame society for their personal issues, profiteer from false victimhood and are just hypocrites in every way need to all die slowly and painfully. They do far more harm than good to genuine gender equality efforts.</br>  <br>'cause I remember when 4chan wasn't about whining about potentially lost privileges. Man up, pussies. A feminist hate thread every fucking hour ! Are you fucking serious ?</br>  <br>Feminism, otherwise known as getting belittled for no reason.</br>  <br>Or why not, feminism; some good reasons to stay off 4chan.</br>  <br> implying that 4chan was for the brave when? </br>    <br>Or feminism; great isms for everyday labels for doing what I feel like doing.</br>  <br>Point taken. Half-taken. Still a bunch of pussies for crying about something that doesn't have the slightest influence over their lives, though.</br>  <br>So women are fighting for the right to die?</br>   first world problems   <br>I'm going to peel your fucking skin off, then glue it back on, ad infinitum.<br><br>ur fhkin dead m8</br></br></br>  <br>duly noted, same with atheist threads. gotta dig deeper for the laughs these days</br>  MRA? More like MRGAY! Amirite?  <br>Of course they fucking are ! They're figthing for equal opportunity. It also means equal opportunity to make it as a soldier and to die on the battlfield. <br>If you're talking about homicides, though, don't be so fucking dumb. It has nothing to do with equal opportunity. Only with, as it has been said, men being stupid.</br></br>  <br>Interesting points. I would like to read more from you. Do you perhaps have a blog?</br>  <br> homocide <br>mfw</br></br>  <br>You act as if you arn't a middleclass whiteboi that lives with his parents :/</br>  <br>The only sensible post ITT</br>  <br>Tell that to Sarkeesian &amp; co.</br>  <br>run that body up and down as the guy sing</br>  <br>Sarkeesian is sometimes wrong and a bit of a drama queen ? So what ? There's still a problem about how women are percieved in society. If you don't agree, just stand aside and let us do our work. you won't see a difference afterwards anyway.</br>  <br><br>I'm not. I'm a middle aged white man who's traveled quite a bit and seen a lot of places most people like to pretend don't exist, as well as some very nice places. Nor am I some activist; I simply don't pretend the realities of the world aren't there. I don't think we should be the world's saviors, but it's foolish and conceited beyond measure to hold arguments as if the comfortable bubbles of western civilization are somehow relevant depictions of the average human being's conditions.<br><br><br><br>Nope. No blog here. Not worth my time, who does a blog reach but people who already have their minds made up and/or are looking for agreement? <br><br>It's like how useless and ineffectual things like change.org or tumblr are.. it's just a circlejerk of armchair activism. It achieves nothing in the real world. Congratulations, you did your +1 Activism for the day, now go have a poptart, have some sex and go to bed. You're a 'good person'.<br><br>Thanks though. Assuming you aren't sarcastic.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>tune in, turn on, drop out<br><br>do you fuckers even SWIM</br></br></br>  Feminism died in the 80's when the housewives burned their bras, got their bachelors' degrees, and realized they preferred having their husbands pay for everything. What we have in this day and age is bigger, gay, female supremacists claiming to be feminists because they get off on righteous indignation. They don't want equality, they want revenge. For what exactly varies.  <br><br> Futashy <br><br>Fucking hot</br></br></br></br>  <br> middle aged white man <br>I really hope I won't waste my time on 4chan like you do when I'm your age. What a succesful life you must live.</br></br>  <br>*bitter, gay, female supremacists<br><br>Still technically correct, just not what I meant.</br></br></br>    <br>tumblr is actually a pretty useful way to get a (contrived, teenage) following if you're into digital/graphic arts or short form poetry.<br><br>He was being sarcastic.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't mind Feminists who think like this, but if you want equality you support Egalitarianism rather than Feminism in my mind. No matter how you try to avert/block/ignore the fact that Feminism is represented by people like Lena Dunham (sex offender lel), it's just true unfortunately. Started as a noble cause, corrupted with cancer by our generation of retards</br>  <br><br>If i'm able to travel the majority of the world in reasonable comfort and spend weekday afternoons lounging around browsing whatever may please me at the moment, I'd suppose i'm probably having a successful life indeed.<br><br>Although that's some nice ad hominem you got there. I'm sorry high school's being rough on you. <br><br>I believe in you.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>High school's fine. It's all the teachers who want me to fuck them that are annoying. That, and the fact that I have to save the world from an alien invasion twice a week.</br>  <br>Sarkeesian is sometimes wrong<br> sometimes <br><br>Have you ever read or watched the inane bullshit she spouts? It's painful. No wonder all her articles have ratings disabled and comments closed.<br><br>She's also conned stupid people out of almost $200,000 with unfulfilled promises from her kickstarter, yet she's still the poster child for third wave feminism and it's incoherent rage at anything with a penis</br></br></br></br></br></br>  There's a harvard senior who pubblished a paper saying that if research lead to controversial results it should be aborted and deleted. They can't stand facts like that the mean IQ of males is higher than theirs. If feminists were in power we would still think that the earth is flat..  <br>If you feel threatened by a youtube channel, I'm sorry for ya.</br>  <br>true, she's still not as batshit insane as Brianna Wu or Zoe Quinn though.</br>  <br>underrated post</br>  <br>Sorry you feel 'threatened' by an anti-feminist thread on /b/.<br>Don't know where you get 'threatened' from but it sounds ridiculous.

Human rights altogether is a tiny niche thing that exists exclusively within clusters of "Westernized Culture". <br><br>The endless debate about how western culture isn't culturey enough is just hilarious.

But they don't need to; I don't think the world needs all its' problems fixed; that's a rather idealistic and naieve sentiment.<br><br>It's okay for the world to be a fucked up mess. It's always been thus, and will likely always be thus. It's just simultaneously a little sad and a little disgusting when people who live in such ridiculously good standards do nothing but decry their own 'problems' and 'situations' as though they were somehow not having a fantastic situation.<br><br>The overwhelming majority of the world exists in shit-smeared poverty and life-threatening conditions on a daily basis. Weeping about some guy exposing himself to you or your jilted statistical analysis of your 11 cent pay deficiency is insane.<br><br>Not to mention generally just offensive and arrogant.<br><br>For anyone to claim they're an "activist" or "feminist" or "human rights advocate" and not be proactively working to end the veritable tsunami of human abuses around the world and instead focus on completely fucking retarded issues like "wage gaps" and "social images" is nothing short of disgusting.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this</br>  <br>funny thing is, the people who participated in the first 2 waves would probably look at "feminism" today and reject it</br>  <br> It's okay for the world to be a fucked up mess. <br><br>That's easy to say when you have enough money to own a laptop. It's not ok that 10 year old kids in Africa are drugged and used as warriors. It's not ok that a Syrian family doesn't know if they will be decapitated at any moment. It's not ok that chinese kids are used to produce shoes for ungreatfull little twats that in their whole life will never work half as hard as they do. Something has to change!</br></br></br>  <br>That goes without saying, human rights is something that 90% majority will find themselves employing one day. Whether its implemented by the 10% "patriarch", or the rise of some sort of liberal ideals sparking from somewhere in or around the nation. <br><br>As flawed as it is, we're all doomed to get in our knees and let it fuck us harder, and harder everyday for the rest of the foreseeable future.<br><br>Laff</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  inb4 SJW faggot </br>  <br>Not him, but niggers and chinks have it coming.

And it's all fault of those damn fucking charities making millions on you mongoloids still donating because of your white guilt</br></br></br></br>  <br>you didnt read his post:<br>he was saying that all this is ok. That it has always been like that. Also he said youre arrogant.</br></br>  <br><br>Kinda. Being one of the few priveleged members of an empowered and protected bubble of western culture though allows for the acquisition of enough money which means you can essentially exempt yourself from the worries of the world.<br><br>I mean, sure, you can call that selfish or evil or ignoring the world around you... but in reality, it's just making the best of what's available and enjoying life.<br><br><br><br>I admire your view on this, but it's an idealistic and naieve view. You're young, and I once thought like that too, but in time you'll recognize that humanity collectively deserves to be where it is. People aren't worthy of much better than the state of how it is; people are not inherently good. I wish the world wasn't how it is; but that doesn't stop me from acknowledging it's precisely where it 'should be'.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>The only statistic of value in their is combat deaths and custody. Either categories are brought on by our own misdoings. <br><br>And even then combat deaths is debateable since we don't have a draft anymore and our soldiers are all volunteers</br></br></br>  <br>I'm sure the Dinosaurs would reject the Republican Party as well. I should know : I'm from /b/</br>  <br>actually its less money, that exempts you from the worlds problems. Do you think there is one child in africa, that weeps for you sometime? They probably dont even know you exist.<br>Same for any homeless man here. As if they would care about poor people elsewhere.</br></br>  <br>I'm still waiting.</br>  <br>I love you.</br>  <br><br>Niggers need kids to work and to provide for the family. Your argument makes no sense.<br><br><br><br>This is delusional thinking and it's because of this that the world is still where it was and will be for many years to come.<br><br><br><br>I do realize that it's quite naive and I know that nothing is going to change as it never has. It's within the human nature to treat others like shit. But just because something is the way it is I don't think it's a good excuse to condone it. Also (with no arrogance or offence intended) how can you know that the world is where it should be with absolute certenty?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>As someone who believes in equal rights for everyone I can't call myself a feminist because of shit like this. The entirety of the movement is tainted with putrid idiocy.</br>  <br><br>Well that's a valid point in regards to access to information, but not so much in regards to "Having problems".<br><br>Some rapper once said something about having 99 problems. I may have more awareness of other people's problems, but I myself haven't got any to cope with.<br><br>Whereas said starving African children have 99 problems and international information regarding wage gap disparity isn't one.<br><br>But dysentary, aids, and rapacious looter-militias raping his mother and murdering his father for their single loaf of bread and half of a tennis shoe? That's on his list.<br><br>Shrug.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So you can't call yourself anything. Idiots are everywhere.</br>  <br>Are you fucking retarded?</br>  <br>1/2</br>  <br>2/2</br>  <br><br>If it wasn't where it should be, it would be otherwise.<br><br>Things are where they are precisely because that is how they should be. When they should no longer be thus is determined by those who make it so. If you're so confident in being a world changing visionary, I encourage you to do so and go forth to reshape the reality for us all.<br><br>Fact is though, that while an overwhelmingly large group of people feel that they are some sort of visionary and will have an impact on the world... they won't. They'll eat some pringles, fart, get laid and go to bed. For decades. And then die.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>kek feminist spotted</br></br>  <br>Other categories**</br>  <br>You are really that stupid.<br>Niggers die like flies because their land is overpopulated.

Especially now when people fight for rights because being pansexual or whatever matters.</br>  <br>4 july?<br>Atleast that's what they say here</br></br>  <br>You've probably wasted at least 2 fucking years' worth of breath saying fucking of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of, you fucking oxygen-guzzler.</br>  <br>Haha really?<br> OY M8 DOES ANYONE HAVE THE D8? <br> WHY YES KIND MULLEYWHACKER IT'S 4 JULY! <br> FOR WHAT? <br> OY I RECKON HE SAID IT'S 4 JULY! <br> 4 JULY! <br> YES 4 JULY, HAVE A TAPPY ONE, OATES! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe that's why Americans are so fat</br>  <br>Kek</br>  <br>How often do you get asked about the date?</br>  Just another thing non americans get to spend their days thinking about, then claim as a reason they hate americans  <br>USA is really the only thing Europe fucked up. Hell, we shipped convicts to Australia and it turned out much better.</br>  <br>Does it bother you, Anon?</br>  <br> oxygen guzzler <br><br>You produce 25% of all world's trash and guzzle oil like crazy.</br></br></br>  <br>That's irrelevant. It is still faster to say the date without the word "of". This is an objective fact. It goes right along with everything that makes an American an American. The less effort, the better. The more efficient, the more streamlined, the better. Piss off with your "of".</br>  <br>yes. They write / say dates July 4th 2015<br>yet in 4 days time they will all say: "happy 4th of July" which is contradicting their date method.</br></br>  <br>But people tend to know what month it is, the most important bit should be at the front of the sentence. "4th of July". not "July the 4th"</br>  <br>In which case they'll simply say "It's the 4th" and be done with it. That would be sound by your logic, no?</br>  <br> Because "July 4th" eliminates the need for the word "of," <br>When I went to the States in December and watched the news, ALL of the presenters said "December THE 5th" etc.. So you're substituting 'of' for 'the' which technically takes longer to say :^)</br></br>  <br>It's embarrassing that jealous europoors make this type of shit and take it serious stay pathetic europe</br>  <br> implying it takes longer to say "the" than "of" because it has more letters in it <br>Eurofag logic at its finest.<br>Also<br> implying Americans only say dates one specific way </br></br></br></br>  <br>Because we can afford it, unlike Eurofags.</br>  <br> looks at GDP of Switzerland <br> looks at GDP of USA <br> ,,,, <br> wat.jpg </br></br></br></br>  <br>The only reason theirs looks better is because it's that faggot ass metric shit.</br>    <br> that gay pride flag <br>my sides</br></br>  <br>top kek...</br>   go America  <br>Go where? To the moon again?</br>  <br>Too bad you can't go there with the IMPERIAL system</br>  <br>like</br>  We keep it because it amuses us from how butt hurt people get about it.    <br>That's a sideways thumb. Implying uncertainty or lack of confidence in your opinion. Eurofags know deep in their heart that America is actually better.</br>  Because when searching for a file or something, having the month first makes it easier, you'd probably need all the files from a specific month, but no one ever will tell you "fetch me all the files that were done on the 16 of each month", is more of a practical thing.  <br>cause numbers are metric now? did you fegits also abolish the decimal system or what?</br>   A yard was originally the length of a man's belt or girdle, as it was called. In the 12th century, King Henry I of England fixed the yard as the distance from his nose to the thumb of his out-stretched arm. Today it is 36 inches. <br> At first an inch was the width of a man's thumb. In the 14th century, King Edward II of England ruled that 1 inch equalled 3 grains of barley placed end to end lengthwise. <br> Americans measure things based on the variable lengths of girdles, British king's arms, barley grains and thumbs </br></br>  <br>Top kek true</br>  <br> actually better <br>seriously, how stupid are you? do you even have basic education? try doing ANYTHING in science or engineering with you gay ass imperial system and see how that works out for you... or go to a college/uni and see how it's done there... might wanna think befoer you talk</br></br>  <br> try doing ANYTHING in science or engineering with you gay ass imperial system and see how that works out for you... <br><br>They actually did that in 1999 and look what happened:<br><br> The Mars Climate Orbiter (formerly the Mars Surveyor '98 Orbiter) was a 338 kilogram (750 lb) robotic space probe launched by NASA on December 11, 1998 to study the Martian climate, atmosphere, and surface changes and to act as the communications relay in the Mars Surveyor '98 program for Mars Polar Lander. However, on September 23, 1999, communication with the spacecraft was lost as the spacecraft went into orbital insertion, due to ground-based computer software which produced output in non-SI units of pound-seconds (lbf×s) instead of the metric units of newton-seconds (N×s) specified in the contract between NASA and Lockheed. The spacecraft encountered Mars on a trajectory that brought it too close to the planet, causing it to pass through the upper atmosphere and disintegrate. <br><br> use imperial system <br> blow 300 million dollars </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Lel</br>  <br>So europefags made the American way of measurement</br>   this thread <br> not even gonna read it <br> just going to assume that it's full of neckbeards arguing because they can't easily convert between systems <br> seriously, imperial for day to day, metric for SCIENCE! how hard is that? <br><br>I bet you niggers bitch about mexicans speaking Spanish because you failed it in high school.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the impressive part is that they managed to even GET TO mars using fucking pound seconds<br><br>topkek</br></br></br>  <br>fucking this</br>  <br>and where are the advantages of the imperail system in day to day life over the SI-system?<br><br>come on, the only reason why the us hasn't already changed and probably never will is the immense cost</br></br></br>  <br>And despite the fact that you hate Europe, you still adopted their flawed shithouse measurements before they adopted the more logical system.<br><br><br>And that's where you're wrong. NASA uses the metric system. "instead of the metric units of newton-seconds" indicates that NASA specified metric, not imperial.<br><br>So, thank Europe for getting you to Mars.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it's a system of measurement! it's not supposed to be an awesome rollercoaster, it's supposed to be effin' practical and useful for science and calculations in day 2 day life or the economy</br>  <br>i don't blame NASA, i know they use metric, cause they are all scientists, i blame lockhead for the contract</br>  <br>inches and yards are easily approximated by the human body. That's just about it, but since that involves most peoples day to day use of measurements.<br><br>Although fuck fucking imperial liquids.
