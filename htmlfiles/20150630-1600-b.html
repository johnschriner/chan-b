[ Hey /b/<br>Is there a way I can psychologically torture someone till he commits suicide?<br>Because my neighbor is raping my sister and I want him dead.</br></br>  <br>yeah, there is a way. im actually pretty good at those kind of things. have you ever made someone cry just by insults?</br>  <br>1/10 for making me respond. Call the police and stop being an idiot.</br>  No, not really.    Every night do something to his house, vandalize it, throw eggs or rocks at the windows and get the hell out there, if you're suspicious and think he's catching on to your patterns then start every 2-3 days instead of every night, do things that would piss him off, spray paint "I FUCK NAZI NIGGERS" on the front of his house, using gloves of course for the spray can, start escalating the vandalizing, throw bricks at his car or windows, leave threats, confusing letters at his door, don't write them how you normally print, of course.  <br>Yes observation is the key</br>  <br>Just start fucking around with shit. Find a way into his house and move everything 5 inches to the left to start with. then everyday just escalate the shit out of it until you're leaving murder notes attached to the body of the deer that you left in his bathroom the day before.</br>  <br>'fraid not. <br>people who commit suicide inflict that mental condition on themselves, it's not like turning on a lightswitch. <br><br>i take it by the active "raping" you mean he's fucking her but she's underage.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If he's raping your sister, then just beat him to a fucking pulp like with a bat or something</br>  If this is actually true, just call the damn cops.  <br>Kill him yourself and plead temporary insanity</br>  Like... he's raping her currently? If so, kill him. If not, either she should stop hanging out with him, or it's not actually rape.  <br>Give him aids, cops wont arrest you.</br>  <br>Call the police you stupid fuck. For how long do you intend to "torture" him while your sister is getting raped? What the fuck?</br>  I think I'm going to kill him right now...<br>Just wait for me and don't leave this thread.</br>  <br>godspeed anon. <br><br>  crime of passion </br></br></br>  <br>im hoping</br>  <br>Don't pussyfoot around it faggot. Grab a syringe, sneak into his house when he's asleep and just inject air into his veins. It'll cause an air embolism, it's untraceable (as long as you don't leave prints n shit about), and it'll be fucking quick. Make sure you inject a lot though, and only one injection.<br><br>protip: bring bonjela and rub a little gently on his arm where you want to jab him. Numbs him and the prick won't wake him up.</br></br></br>  <br>people who commit suicide usually do it because of their own problems<br>it's not like your going to cause this person's life to continually run into bad luck, but whatever.<br>be a pussy--do what you do--why don't you just kick his ass or call the cops?</br></br></br>  Fuck your sister first,he won't want sloppy seconds  <br><br> needle mark <br> untraceable  <br><br>Stop watching so much tv faggot.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Timestamp or <br> gtfo <br> Gtfo <br> GTfo <br> GTFo <br> GTFO </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>DuDe, tie him to a chair and cut off his dick then sufucate him long enough that he almost passes out, then splash some water to wake him up. Do this 4 to 6 times. Always even numbers, if you dont im going to fucking killed you bitch. Then heat up a tire iron or something metal and shove it in his ass, if the skin starts to get glued on it just shake it a bit and shove it in harder. Then let it sit for about 3 minutes( enough time for it to cool off), afterwards yank it out with full strength. Let him sit there crying with his bleeding dick and ass. Then jerk off on his face, call him a faggot. Do the ass thing with other items and make sure he doesnt bleed out while you're torturing him. Have fun.</br>  Police here, what the fuck is this anon wanting to do?  <br>He would not long after having his dick cut, nigger.</br>  <br>*he would die*</br>  <br>Oh yeah faggot. Hey bill there's a needle mark on this guys arm. Oh yeah frank it must have been that little shit from next door, lets bring him in.</br>  <br>Time stamp with badge, Officer. OP is being a faggot again, just read the fucking thread.</br>  <br><br>Shit OP you better watch the fuck out now that Bill and Frank are on the case.</br></br>  Why don't you quit being a little bitch and break into his house and rape him?  <br><br>Not if you seared it. I forgot to mention this. It also hurts like hell.</br></br>  <br>Why not just rape your sister with him? Sharing is caring newfried :^)</br>  --- This thread has been reported ---  <br>op dont kill him that will to easy 4 him you have to destroy who he is inside as a person and let him live with the pain. for your instance i would walk into his house detain him my fav is beating till they knock out then slowly cut a piece of his penis every day just giv him water dont want him to end the suffering till he is nothing. concealed ofcourse and if you want you can ram his but with something sharp</br>  <br>Seriously bro, those two are some NCIS level detective shit. watch your back.</br>  <br>This is the best idea in the thread.</br>  <br>Not too sure I agree or not. I've been surrounded by suicide (some as a concept, others actions, including myself at a point), and I believe something has to happen psychologically before they snap. The brain is hard-wired to preserve itself, and that has to be flipped off by something before they Actually consider it (Not in an attention whore way, but a end-the-suffering way).</br>  <br>dont be a faggot and put a gun to his head</br>  <br>move shit in his house, just small stuff. then after a few months of constantly moving shit just get 3 gallons of pigs blood and pour it hon his bed. then just light him on fire and there ya go, problem solved</br>  <br> tell doctor you smoke and want to quit <br> ask for chantix <br> tell neighbor its oxytocin  <br> tell him if he drinks on it it makes u more high <br> shoot him in the face <br><br>Forgot where i was going half way through</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's awful OP, of course I'll help.<br>It's simple, folow the guy around awhile and get video of him raping your sister then just post it on /b/. I'll take care of the rest.</br></br>  pussy faggot just shoot him in head and get over with it.. if you simply stage that he had a weapon its no longer murder and called self defense and you are scott free and you get no jail time and get hailed as hero  Put him in a situation where suicide seems preferable to the alternative.<br><br>That's pretty much it. If you don't know how to do it you won't ever know how to do it. You should probably kill yourself for asking.</br></br>  Grill passed out drunk at my house, what do  take a dump on her face, post pics  cum in her pussy  <br>Call 911 get her home safe</br>  <br>Make me some burgers</br>  <br>show me her feet w/socks :/</br>  <br><br>Go to bed</br></br>  <br>when she wakes up, insist that she eat 12 eggs</br>  <br>Fuck the dog</br>  Spank it then go to bed that seems to be working for me.  <br>take a pic of her face</br>  <br>Dog the fuck</br>  Rate on a scale from 1 to 11?

Go to work, get home, play vidya, get drunk enough to be able to fall asleep &amp; repeat.</br>  <br>I remember one day in High School. Our school had a block party real fun shit. And a friend said that he would give me a ride but had to bail. So it was really late and I had no ride home and I lived quite a long way from the school. So another friends said fuck it and we ran the entire way to my house. That shit was amazing, it was dark as shit we had chill music playing and we ran. It's times like those that you really are glad that you have friends you can call family.</br>  When I got this nice Pepe  whe she told me i was going to be a dad... then she started crying and said he wasn't mine...  <br>JARED wtf are you still doing bitching about your bday</br>  <br>Hahaha</br>  about 5 months ago when she told me she loved me, right before she left me.  <br>What happend then? INB4 molestation</br>  <br>Stop fapping to fucking traps and man up</br>  <br>Did you punch her in the stomach for being a cheating cunt? Or were you too cuck to do that</br>  it isn't the environment that make's people sad, it's themselves. If you want to be sad, it's up to you.<br><br>But since I know what you mean, it was when I met my first girlfriend (long dinstance relationship) for the first time. Apartment was 100x cleaner than my house, food was delicious, city was marvelous and lost my virginity. Or shit, I just had all of that happiness because I was in love, but I'm not sure, things were great.</br></br>  <br>Are you a cuck or just a bitch I bet you are still with her kek</br>  <br>She never loved you just loved to use you, she left you for a man with a bigger cock</br>  Meh idk. Girls suck.  <br>today op. get on my level</br>  <br>Faggot detected, I bet your some fat sissy that had to become a bottom bec you cant get women, take what you get right? I bet you take lots of BBC</br>  <br>naah, she became a single mom because that other fucker left her, she left school and i told her to go fuck herself, so she's by her own in her crappy life.<br>also i beat the shit out of the other guy xD</br></br>  <br>no, she still text me, but i'll never be with a cheating bitch</br>  14 years ago.  <br>Saturday making out with a girl I really like.</br>  <br>How big is your penis</br>  <br>keep telling yourself that nigger, she will call you after the nigger shes with and you will take the bait like a mosquito fish.</br>  <br>Block her or butt fuck her and make it hurt</br>  <br>Long drunk runs home with friends in high school was the fucking best</br>  <br>February this year. It was the last time my girlfriend came to visit me at uni before the relationship fell apart. She'd been my best friend for two years before I asked her out, and we went out for 8 months before she left me for another guy, most likely cheated on me, and left me a broken, lonely shell. I get about an hour or two of sleep every night, but all I want to do is sleep so I don't have to think about her. I want to go out and get drunk and have fun with my friends, but they ignore me. I think I'd been close to depression since my dog died, my grandad developed leukemia, and my mom developed multiple sclerosis, and her screwing me over may have pushed me overy the edge. I don't even know why I'm typing all this, but I've tried reaching out to people and no-one wants to know.</br>  <br>How big was her cock meat?</br>  Happiness only comes when you work for it<br><br>I've got a sob story about an ex too, but that doesn't stop me from being happy, and it shouldn't stop you either.</br></br>  the last manic episode I had. probably should see a doctor about the moodswings. don't care, can't afford it. so if I end up killing somebody during a manic depressive paranoia-filled rage, I can truly say<br> thanks Obama </br>  met my best friend in my last year of highschool. We would chill every day together. We used to do the stupidest shit like get drunk and high as fuck then go steal mailboxes or break lightbulbs, stupid shit. We lived together for a bit but things fell through. I haven't even spoken to him in a good 3 years. <br>Worst feeling ever, I just want my homie back</br>  <br>The last time was when I called her on Skype last, two days ago.<br><br>Seemingly, I am only happy when I talk to her.</br></br></br>  <br>Meant over, not overy</br>  <br>Ya hes a cuck he will end up eating BBC cum out of her cunt</br>  2 days ago. <br>Girl I've had crush on for 7 years asked me if I wanted to hang out.</br>  When I was inside my dads testicles  <br>Fucking the memories dude.</br>  <br>Honestly.. During the first year or 2 of my last relationship. Was the happiest I had ever felt in my life. The relationship ended 4 months ago and I'm still feeling some intense pain from the split.. But it had to end. You realize that you're both too different people but just can't accept the fact..</br>  I have no fucking clue  <br>Its called man up underage bitch, go to a hospital check in the ER they will help you if not anhero faggot</br>  <br>my sides 7 years? Dude you are beyond friendzoned by this time she prob thinks your a faggot</br>  I don't know if I ever was genuinely happy. My life at the moment feels really bizarre because for the past 5-6 years, my emotions have been dulled down so much from all the shit that happened that I honestly can't give a fuck anymore, even when I really want to. Even when I really should. My dad died from leukemia last summer and when I heard the news over the phone, I wanted to mourn, but my face was unwavering and I could speak clearly. There were no tears running down my face, and to this day, I still didn't shed a single tear over his death. I really wanted to. I wanted to feel something but I just couldn't, and it's only getting worse.  <br>this was 4 years ago for me. I have not changed. still just work, come home and drink til pass out, rinse and repeat. even on my days off I found another job to fill my time<br><br>You'd think I'd be rolling in the money but I'm spending it as quick as I make it. <br> Protip: Don't start going to bars alone after work. Its an oddly comforting and expensive habit  <br><br>me too</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Seems they both got what they deserved for being asses. Good going at least on that part.</br>  <br>fucking teenagers being sad at everything, even at death of a fucking dog.</br>  When i drunk lsd  <br>Its called being underage</br>  <br>I'm 21, but I might do that</br>  Yeah it was about 2 hours ago when I started feeling drunk<br>There's hope that I might not have a panic attack tomorrow!<br>But what good is hope</br></br>  <br>Ya your a beta queen</br>  <br>A couple years ago when I just showed up at my current unit. I was mailed a paper my niece had written. It was about who your hero was and she had written about me.</br>  <br>Sometime around 1991, with a brief respite on Oct 12 2012</br>  <br>All the time. Doubly so when I smoke some dank greens.</br>  <br>it takes 8 months to completely forget a long-term relationship.</br>  <br>And that's what you get.</br>  <br>Story?</br>  <br>You do know drinking makes anxiety worse the next day right faggot? You do know when the alcohal leaves your body it will cause you to get panic attacks right faggot? You just set your self up for a 100% chance to have severe anxiety and an attack tomorrow</br>  I didn't lose all hope at once. I mean i was happy during childhood and got a little bit sadder everyday since then. I don't know the exact day I woke up and said to mysef "Hey! I'm an unhappy person!".  <br><br>I visited Prague a couple of weeks ago. Loved it, felt so at home there. Depressed since leaving,</br></br>  <br> Get together for old friend diagnosed with brain cancer after beating it a few years back <br><br> More aggressive, going to Belgium for emergency surgery soon <br><br> All of us are there, stupid fucking retards on phone catching up with each other instead of involving cancer friend in conversation <br><br> Spend time with him talking despite being a bipolar autist who no one likes talking to, he enjoys it somewhat <br><br> His mother and family pay for all meal, after eating I can't really take it anymore, feeling bad so hug him goodbye get his number, go out and spend what little money my parents have on cigars after I said I'd quit <br><br> Two packs of black n' mild shit tier fuck shit <br><br>Other than that, there is…<br><br> Spend $79 to get OSHA-10 and GHS Haz. Comm. certifications to see if construction places and apprentice programs would be more willing to hire me <br><br> Six apps so far, not a single reply, probably threw it away since I'm 18 and never had a job despite volunteer work, labor service projects, Eagle Scout <br><br> Poor as fuck, need to help dad out with bills and I just spent more money to get a fucking useless cert. <br><br> Two family members living the NEET life off my fathers back, but I consider myself just as bad as them for buying more cigars <br><br> Can't even take solace in the fact I'm trying to get a job and certs to get a job, dropped out of college due to bipolar, parents really despised me for that <br><br>I just want to smoke a cigar, get high, and lie in bed for a while alone. Six people can get very very tiring in a two bedroom apartment with low square footage.<br>I need a fucking job man. The apps say<br><br> entry level <br>Great, where do I apply<br> 3 Years experience minimum <br>rekt<br><br>Just that, and coping with nomeds for bipolar because poor/shit insurance.<br><br>What a shit. Happy when I was a kid.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  No alcohal tonight but I'll take some xanax and be good to go what about faggots  I live in Canada and am really thinking of trying out antidepressants. What do they feel like? do they really make you happy? What do they generally prescribe in Canada? (QC to be exact) <br>I heard some great things about Xanax, don't know how to get the prescription though and even though I heard it's only temporary</br>  Last night when I got blazed af with my friends  <br>Awesome!</br>  <br>Stick to cannabis.</br>  <br>Perhaps you need help too if you think 21 is in the teens</br>  <br>Xanax is a benzo if used as needed its great for panic attacks BUT its highly addicting faggot drs will persceibe starting .5mg twice daily and maybe 1mg for panic attack be wary of it..</br>  <br>Yes, please develop a severe benzodiazepine habit to cope with your pathetic life. Come back in a year, if still alive, and post results.</br>  <br>Depends on anti depres meds there are hundreds its worth a shot ti you find the right one</br>  <br><br>horrible unhealthy mindsets and lifestyles guys please stop</br></br>  <br>Before the woman I love started dating my best friend.</br>  <br>Happiness is for pussies, you fucking cunt. Go out and be an ubermensch, stop complainin about how shitty your life is and learn to love the shitness of existence</br>  I dont remember  <br>nah I was the biggest pothead for about 3 years.<br>It costs too much and everybody who's a pothead turns out to be a gigantic faggot. I knew 30 something year olds hanging out with like 14 year olds. <br>I don't wan't that shit. I just want help to get through this rough patch. I have problems that I don't feel like elaborating here and I feel Xanax could really help, honestly. <br>Sorry for not making the most of sense, drunk as fuck</br></br></br></br>  <br>This. Traveled a bit around Europe with my girlfriend before going back to her home country (Canada). Been feeling like poo poo ever since.</br>   tfw life of loss and failure <br> tfw get it on track <br> tfw all of your family hates you <br> tfw /fit/ because you think it will change anything <br> tfw you cant even talk to your siblings because you hardly know them <br> tfw money, looks, women but still are just empty inside <br><br>The drugs numb the pain. Everything I have achieved in life is meaningless without anyone to even care if you exist.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I purposely ignore people sometimes even lead them on only to leave then so they feel bad, ever since i moved because i don't want new friends</br>  <br>I'm a hotel manager. I employ people in entry-level jobs. I never need to advertise positions because I get a steady flow of resumes and people requesting and returning applications to beheldon file. Don't restrict yourself to only applying to places that are advertising a vacancy.</br>  I'm the happiest I've ever been. I have an amazing job that pays well (firefighter) and an amazing wife with a child on the way. I am currently at a buddies house about to LAN battlefield hardline and drink.  <br>Probably in the summer of 2010.<br>Just graduated, had a lot of friends, hadn't gotten laid yet but the way things were going it was no doubt imminent, i had energy, and i was fit. <br>All ended in spring 2011 when I had my first panic attack. Never been the same since. <br>Gained weight, don't have nearly as much energy, can't focus at school or work, and talking to women just feels like a chore.</br></br></br></br>  Well two days ago I was high as fuck on molly on a beautiful sunny day listening to Snails and Kill The Noise while a topless chick flopped around next to me. So then.  <br>Will do thanks anon.</br>  <br>I can understand not wanting to have to fuck with people. Just answer yourself this: are you happy?</br>  <br>Xanax caused me more problems than any other drug I have ever used. If you take a little bit too much of it say goodbye to your friends and family because they now fucking hate you or dont want to even think you exist.</br>  <br>Cannabis usage and being a "pothead" are not one the same. Sorry your experiences have been so sad and negative. Drinking is not going to help. Neither are benzodiazepines especially if you drink with them. Worst zombie humans I have ever met went down a long road of benzo abuse.</br>  <br>one and* the same</br>  Yesterday. Cuddled with her and talked until 4 in the morning.  <br>I moved and live in a very isolated town and know literally nobody. I would buy some weed if I could, but sadly I don't even know anybody here. Although I don't want to become one of those guys who's 35 and chills with 16 year olds, weed does help depression. Alcohol is everywhere though. It's not healthy, obviously. That's why I'm thinking of trying antideps. I just need sometthing idk life is horrible man</br>  <br>As soon as I lead some more people on and make them feel like shit possibly kill them selves i will</br>  <br><br>When I was in driving infront of someone who had their right blinker on for about 2 miles and when we stopped at the light I waved to him and he noticed, he waved back. I know it's not much but i've learned that those little moments have kept me feeling "alive."</br></br>  <br>Go to the gym, take the shitty feelings turn them into rage and lift bars up and down for an hour or two.</br>  <br>That is highly unfortunate. No adult should have to "chill with 16 year olds" to obtain such a beneficial plant. I genuinely hope more people gain safe, professional access to high quality lab tested cannabis. If and when that time comes for you, I would recommend a 1:1 THC:CBD ratio sativa strain such as Harlequin.<br><br>Alcohol, by comparison, is the fucking pits man.</br></br></br>  When I was with my ex girlfriend 3 months ago. True story  Does drug induced happiness count? If so, Friday. If not, I had a good day around the end of May.  A month ago<br> Girl I went to college with needs work some work done at her parents house <br> "Hey anon, you do landscaping and patios right? My parents need some work done and I remembered you said you're good at that stuff!" <br> Offer to help, grill is there and hangs out with me for 8 hrs while I work, just talking about whatever all day long. Was awesome.. I've been single for 5 years, and this girl is cute. <br> After work her folks beg me to stay for dinner. They were so happy with the work I did for em and we got along well.  <br> After dinner we all had some drinks together, the daughter and I bought tickets to go see Jurassic World the following weekend. Life is fucking perfect <br> Next week we go see the movie, but right after she has to run to a cousins graduation party <br> MFW I never see the bitch again.  <br><br>She replies if I text her, but I've never been big on texting. She said she likes me and wants to hang out but everytime I try to make plans shit doesn't pan out. She's likely too hot for me. Idk what went wrong but now I fade back into my lonely existance.. go to work, come home, drink, work on my house, drink more, pass out, rinse and repeat.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>last time I was with her. about 8 months ago</br>  <br>Listening to snails. <br>My nigga</br></br>  I did acid and now im just always happy because life operates like a trip  <br>I molested my teacher.</br>  Today, gospel choir was awesome.<br><br>Every Praise,Every Praise is to our Go--ho-od.</br></br>  <br>when my sister and i were getting along<br><br>but i get pretty fukin happy when the breeze hits my soggy ballsack in the morning, so im managing</br></br></br>  I honestly don't even remember lol, probably never<br><br>I don't really expect to be happy though. Anything above general misery is pretty good by comparison for me.</br></br>  <br>A few high dose DMT trips did it for me. Pushed me through some difficult life decisions nearly instantaneously. Never been a big fan of LSD but to each their own.</br>  when i was with my wifu here a pic of me and her  Right now, life is good.  i took a few tremedol a few days ago<br><br>felt good</br></br>  <br><br>7 for me. Do you ever think of trying to rekindle? Or have you tried? Personally I don't think I could at this point. I'm the one who broke it off but question it everyday.<br><br> that feeling of waking up next to her <br><br>But yeah she was sort of a huge bitch</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>cant remember b/c I drown my life out with drugs. probly gona kill my self soon</br>  <br>i'm happier than i've ever been right now, got money, bitches, and good health.</br>  Stop bitching and create your own happiness.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=E6M<wbr>-XUW4xYY</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Fuck you Monday.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I can't remember</br>  <br>Take some mushrooms</br>  <br>That Pepe looks so sad I genuinely feel bad wow</br>  <br>today was great, aced a Spanish test. then went to the Lab ( I work as a physicist assistant for side cash in school) and pull out some superconducting CuxBi2Se3 crystals I grew. then went home and told my 10/10 GF and fucked her after which I smoked a blunt. life sucks</br>  <br>Have I ever been?</br>  <br>this shit man. this shit really resonates with me.<br><br>That feel when you get boosted and hopeful and then you just get shit on. fuggin A</br></br></br>  <br>Take some acid with your best friend, it can teach you emotions</br>  the beginning of this month  <br>7 hours ago, during the moment I decided to break up with crazy gf, but decided against it.</br>  <br>You're a lot closer than most people. Texting sucks but if you feel your really connect with her its time to get out the comfort zone and go for it. You already made a good impression on the parents.</br>  <br>It doesn't make anxiety worse till after 24 hours.</br>  Be the master of your existence, not its slave.  <br>using /b/-translate: stop being a faggot or an hero. what are you waiting for?</br>  Id say about almost 2 years ago. Every day feels like i have the weight of the world on my shoulders and no one cares about it.<br><br>The only thing that keeps me going is my gf...</br></br>  <br>your gf is either retarded, a saint, or your hand<br><br>get a grip faggot, everyone has problems</br></br></br>  <br>I reaaaallly wanna do dmt</br>  <br>Happiness is overated. May 2013.</br>  <br>When I stepped outside today at 12pm to walk the dog and it was still warm. Completely dark but just the right temperature.<br><br>That made me genuinely happy.<br><br>ps: central europe</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yuuuuuup he murdered everyone</br>  <br>I hear ya man, she says she's into me and wants to spend time together but she never texts me first, when I try to come up with a specific day to hangout she always has a reason not to. I tried to get her to go on a weekend trip with me too, like a month from now, (she's known me for awhile) and she came up with reasons why she couldn't do that either. I'm just gonna cut my loses. <br><br>If she's actually interested, then she must not be my type because I need a little more affection than she's shown.</br></br></br>  <br>Good advice...</br>  <br>I hope, one day, it is approved for medical therapeutic usage. I could see clean, medical grade DMT helping people far more and far quicker than long-term antidepressant dependency.</br>  yesterday  ill give ya some sage advice from someplace faaaar beyond where you are<br><br>my "credentials" for depression?<br>molested at 4 or 6 nothing too bad, digital penetration, oral cop.<br>living in the third world, some foreign army bombarded my hometown <br>SEVERE ptsd most of my youth.<br><br>it trained me to have zero regard for the word "tomorrow" <br>and i'll tell you this about you depressives, you've got so much regard and respect for that word <br>you spend so much time living in tomorrow you feel like you've stopped existing in today.<br>now im not saying "be like me hurr durr"<br>but i will say what would DEFINITELY behoov you is to spend a couple days where the word tomorrow isnt even in your vocabulary<br>just try it</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Today, I had a date and we had a good time.<br><br>You can do it anons, I believe in you. Unless you are a trap fan then go fuck off to /lgbt/ or die.</br></br></br>  <br> tfw money, looks, women but still are just empty inside <br>Not trying to belittle your problems or anything, but you know some of us didn't win the genetic lottery, don't have any money and have no luck with women. But I'm sure your problems are very real to you.</br></br>  Today, chated with a friend about what's like fucking girls and we shared our experiences though mine were limited to the one girl I gucked  I had a date today with a girl who isn't really pretty and we made out and shit and now she asked if she's my girl but I don't want that but I also don't want to hurt her because she's really sweet what do I do?  <br>I wish happiness was in such short reach for me as well.</br>  Hey <br><br>This  was my point.<br><br>the level of self-loathing self-destructive faggotry is pathetic<br><br>those faced with the worst often express the greatest hope for a better life. they are the strong and the willing. not these teenage crybabies getting dumped or passed over by girls wanting to an hero over it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> so i beat the shit out of the other guy xD <br>Fucking anon when beast mode. Proud of bro anon</br></br>  Probably some time before middle school. That was 2007.  <br> new gaming PC <br> not waiting for Skylake <br>anon..</br></br></br>  About ten minutes ago I poured out a nice glass of tawny port. I'm starting to feel a nice buzz. Even better, my wife is drinking some too, which means she's trying to get drunk because it helps her relax when she feels like getting fucked up the ass. I'm rather happy right now, but not as happy as I'll be in an hour when I'm buried to the balls in my wife's asshole.  <br>Wine: the best anal lube since forever.</br>  <br>yeah well good for you anon</br>  dropped acid saturday and was pretty happy   HAPPINESS IS THE PURPOSE OF LIFE <br><br>STFU M8</br></br>  <br>This<br>Happiness is just an emotional state , you're not supposed to feel it all the time, that doenst mean you have to be a depressive edgy faggot whenever you're not happy</br></br>  When girls sent me pic related  <br><br>Hahaha that's like next door <br>Waldwick here</br></br></br>  <br>at least these faggots are better than the delusional red pill trolls. the former know they are hopeless losers, the latter actually think they will be alphas one day if only they find the right way to manipulate women.</br>  Yesterday for about 20 mins <br> be me <br> texting this girl for past few days <br> she finally texts me first <br> text her back <br> no response  <br><br>Texted her "hey" a few hours ago and still nothing.

These pharmaceuticals are shit.</br>  <br>I thought it meant to be jumped by black robbers<br><br>sorry for your loss</br></br></br>  <br>nice debs fag</br>  <br>what do you recommend instead?</br>  <br><br>Still, agree on the xanax. Benzos in general. If you must, try to stick to the -pams like clonazepam (klonopin) rather than the -lams like alprazolam (xanax).</br></br>  <br>She likely used you, anon. The upside is that you have skills that women find useful<br> mfw I have no such skills </br></br>  <br>about 6 years ago when I was unemployed.<br><br>It's not that I'm lazy, I'm just happy not doing anything.</br></br></br>  <br>are you more secure now since you don't have thing to lose?</br>  the last time i was on antidepressants. i dont even remember what it felt like.  <br>was it an abstract kind of feel?</br>  <br>I'm still here.. and oh well. I still got paid $300 for a days work, free dinner and drinks. I think she just wanted to see if she could make me interested. She did. <br><br>Maybe I'm her 'backup' or something who knows. Like I said...  "If she's actually interested, then she must not be my type because I need a little more affection than she's shown."<br><br><br>Meh. Vodka and cranberry tonight. Howre you anon</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Also skills are easy to come by these days. Wanna know how to do something that you don't know how to do? Youtube it. Fake it til you make it bro. <br><br>Fear, or laziness?<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=eXG<wbr>q8rlq2I0</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>you should add painkiller to that so you would be like max payne</br>  <br><br>Organic food. Exercise. Forging new friendships as often as possible (yes, this includes putting yourself in high anxiety situations if you have trouble relating to others; it will make you a better person).<br><br>If you must with the drugs: High grade lab tested cannabis. There are many cannabinoids so the specific combination would depend on the particular individual's needs.<br><br>Finally, hopefully one day people will have greater access to medical grade psychedelics. In the right settings these can have amazing effects on life outlook. The preliminary clinical results on PTSD sufferers (lsd here) and terminally ill patients (psilocybin here) are very positive.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was happy when I finaly had the courage to ask out this girl working at a store I would go to she even seemed interested I ask her out she says yes (omg no way) I get her number and now she won't talk to me wtf why give your fuckin number if your Just gonna ignore me either go out with me or just say no I'm good or I have a boyfriend fuckin bitch</br>  <br>I bet you havent lived a shitty depressing lifeless friendless lives like us.<br>you sound like a fucking robot.<br>fuck your own dick while you are active asshole.</br></br></br>  <br>lol she's probably one of those "nice girls"<br>translation: neckbeard with a vagina</br></br>  <br>  this includes putting yourself in high anxiety situations if you have trouble relating to others; it will make you a better person <br><br>how though, I usually just go knee weak, palm sweaty then drop the spaghetti<br><br>then I see people, but can't unseen their disdain of me from their eyes, then I spaghetti even harder, and I become known as the legendary spaghetti dropper<br><br>if people want to get rid of a friendship or a relationship, they come to me for advices</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>anon, live the life on the fast lane, don't come to /b/, we are all too much of losers 4 u</br></br>  <br>What happened?</br>  <br>I was born</br>  <br>wanted to die for years now. i dont want to hurt other people by doing it. So im hoping i get cancer</br>  <br>I suppose not. Fucking my own dick might be interesting if I could.<br><br>Then again, I always force myself into uncomfortable situations because it has never killed me and I have always come out with new relationships as a result. I just don't buy the "poor me" mentality is all.</br></br></br>  <br>I feel for you man. I don't know if I was ever truly happy I just try to find escapes from my daily life to pass the time.</br>  <br>i see your progress with the onglish is well on track<br>lemme know when you're done with your esl class<br>i'll drop by a feels thread and say "hola"</br></br></br>  <br>Well, you have some humor. That always helps.<br><br>Also, I get awkward as fuck at times. Still, I force myself into situations where I won't be comfortable because it has never killed me and it usually ends up interesting whatever the result. The thing is, no matter how epically you fuck up social situations, you don't die and people forget about you. The world is huge and I am generally happy being relatively meaningless and forgotten. Armed with that, I am the master of my social world.</br></br></br>  <br> Tell her your gay and just want friends. <br> Slowly work your way into friend circle. <br> Over time you will find yourself becoming closer with her and her friends. <br> Pick one that clearly is into you be it her or her friend. <br> Begin to let her know your questioning your sexuality and that you feel attracted to her.  <br> She will feel like she turned you straight. <br> Now you have a new group of girlfriends which you can fuck one or more. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>why don't you just have sex with them really fast and then run away</br>  <br>That could also work you may want to yell 'surprise' just before penetration it looks good in a court of law later.</br>  <br><br>For the record, though, you are responsible for your shitty depressing lifeless friendless life. Unless you're still a minor, in which case you get a pass because you still have a lot of growing up to do. But if you're an adult, no excuses, that shit is on you now.</br></br>  <br>The last day that my gf was mine.<br>Been a year and never got over her.<br>No contact did nothing.<br>Seeing other girls just made it worse because it made me realize how great she was.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This is just bad. Deception only works if you don't have anything in your life that acts as a contradiction to your claim.</br>  <br>If you were to only feel constant euphoria and I were to punch you in the face you wouldn't feel mad, but euphoric; which obviously is bad for you, for your survival<br><br>Luckily people with such a rare trate didn't make it in the past</br></br></br>  <br>Well if shes someone he doesn't know he can create whatever story suits.</br>  When a bunch of jewish girls cheered me on while I played DDR  <br>but why would you want to do that</br>  Today. My friend is back for 6 months and we're gonna scissor our vagoogoos so much (^:  You can really tell emotional maturity here based on the degree to which "being in a relationship" or "getting laid" is the source of happiness. When you come into your own and forge your own happiness, all that shit comes easy. The only thing I miss about being a kid is not paying bills.  <br>XD I believe you friend.</br>  <br>Until she delves a bit deeper and he either has to rush the plan and risk her figuring it out, or take the risk of accidentally exposing himself through some slight oversight. It never works unless either he has only short-term plans for her or it's a small part of a bigger plan. If his whole plan is "pretend to be gay until she likes me enough that I can say 'NOW I'M STRAIGHT'" then he'll be fucked.</br>  <br>Fiance cheated, lost my mates in the field, got bones broken , almost died like 9000 times, got shot twice , had an abusive mother, father wasn't in my life like 70% of my childhood etc...<br>I have no idea what happiness is like anymore, but if i'd have to guess i'd say it's what i feel when i come back from my shitty work and my cat comes runing at me and starts to grind on my leg. kinda makes me feel like someone would notice and miss me if i die right here right now.</br></br>  <br>Nah can confirm it works friend. <br>Do you want to be a pussy or get the pussy?</br></br>    August last year, one week into (voluntary) conscription. (Denmark)<br>It was so exciting, I'd never felt so alive... Of course, I didn't realise at the time that I would have a mental break the week after and drop out, leaving the last of my desires unachievable. I've been living in more or less complete apathy since.</br>  <br>why not both</br>  <br>Look, it sounds trite as fuck I admit. But really, the key to getting laid is being yourself. This won't mean you get to bang 10s, but you'll get to bang a whole hell of a lot more when you stop being such a faggot and just do your own shit. You will attract your equals and you will fuck plenty.</br>  <br>Who ever said i was a girl faggot</br>  <br>I want to get pussy without being a pussy. Lying about what you are is about as much a bitch move as you can get without getting the operation.</br>  <br>Oh, and stop being clingy. The reason so many of you, once finding a lady, end up calling her crazy is because you, yourself, are the same crazy basket case full of bullshit. It just takes time after fucking to realize you both hate each other because you hate yourselves.</br>  4th grade or so  <br> Reading comprehension <br>That was my point. Lying about being gay or some shit doesn't help you in the long-term and creates confusion where instead could be opportunity to take your relationships beyond what they are. People often forget the old phrase "Honesty is the best policy". Why is it the best policy? Because lying is a short-term solution with far worse consequences.</br></br>  <br><br> vagoogoos </br></br>  Earlier today. <br><br>I bought a awesome bike for 120 funny store on that. but whatever ill ignore it anyway.<br><br>Im 21. And i fucking love my bike i dont ride around with a helmet or any ssafety gear (im not white) and i fucking love going down hills. Oh and i like weather in 70 f. <br><br>It feels so good to go down hills at like 50 mph and stand up and feel the wind.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah I was agreeing with you. It took me a lot of failed relationships to realize I needed to just do my own shit until the right girls came through my life. Seeking women to bolster your self esteem, especially be deceiving them, will always lead to disappointment.</br>  <br>You sound smart man. Deep down everyone knows this shit, but it takes balls and/or confidence to be yourself.</br>  <br><br>When I used to get along with my neighbors and they really liked me.It all ended when I got pissed off at my dog for barking outside.I went out and yelled that I was going to break her legs and throw her in the swimming pool if she didnt shutup..Now I get shitty looks all the time.<br><br>I hate the fact i can go from 0 to 10 at any given time.</br></br></br></br>  <br>nobody replied to this?

That was the idea.</br>  <br>The 2001 attack on the World Trade Center was orchestrated by the Bush administration in order for us to have an excuse to put troops on the ground in the Middle East. We were fully aware that there were underdeveloped nations in that part of the world, and we knew that they had oil. They needed an excuse to invade those countries, so they fly an airplane into a building full of people at work, and of course, that pissed people off. Because of the religious extremism that took place in the middle east at the time, it was perfectly believable that they could be blamed for the attack. Once they had deceived everyone, they then made up a story about middle eastern nations having "Weapons of Mass Destruction." Weapons that were never found. While everyone was distracted, we continued to drill for oil to make money, because that's all the government cares about.</br>  <br>WE'RE DONE HERE<br>/THRED</br></br>  <br>tl;dr Bush did 9/11</br>  <br>SO MUCH THIS</br>  <br>I AGREE WITH THIS GUY A LOT</br>  <br>THIS GUY GETS IT OK</br>  Steel beams can't melt jet fuel.  <br>GOD TIER POST</br>  Still really pissed that a worthwhile disaster came and went and I never manifested a single superpower.  steel beams can't melt jet fuel  <br>The "my dad is obese and yells at my mom in public" haircut.</br>  <br>END FO STORY</br>  <br>SO UCH THIS</br>  <br>Figures, it's not a real picture.</br>  <br>Jews and Cheney did it</br>  <br> this butthurt <br> about something you had absolutely nothing to do with <br><br>people like you are why tumblr exists. stop breathing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>underrated post</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>why are you samefagging on the dumbest post ever? please fucking kill yourself you autistic nigger lover</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>THIS</br>      <br>/thread</br>    <br>we've killed many more of them in the past decade or so than they did at 9/11....read a book fucking edgelord</br>  <br>SO MUCH THIS</br>  Don't let your dreams be steel beams...<br><br>JET FUEL IT!</br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ppA<wbr>eMWFCqC8</wbr>  [ ]</br>    Felt jeans can't steam raw beans  ITT: Alot of pople saying "jet fuel can't melt steel beams"  <br>Steam clean my peen's jeans?</br>  <br><br><br><br><br> Flies two planes in both world trade centers <br><br> Flies plane in pentagon <br><br> Another hijacker tried to take out White House or State capital, plane gets taken down in the field. <br><br>If the ones who did the "inside job" wanted to start a war, then they sure as hell overkilled it.
