Likely a brown recluse. The wound will get necrotic (rotting liquefied tissue). Brown recluse spiders are also known to carry staphylococcus aureaus necrotizing faciatis known as flash eating bacteria. You better get her medical attention ASAP. I'm an RN and wouldn't BS you.  <br>Hey, earth to all 9th grade biology dropouts:<br>You know how jet fuel can't melt steel beams?

I just had this happen last year tomorrow it will be worse and will not get better without antibiotics. Well, most probably.

I had one of them on my foot a long time ago. I'm a little -strange- so I dug the dead tissue out just to get a good look at it.</br>  Go to the ER. It's probably a spider bite they will probably drain it and give her antibiotics after to prevent an infection. You don't want it to get any worse if left untreated it can become necrotic as the tissue dies which can lead to septic shock. <br>- your friend the Internet</br>  <br><br>spiders don't bite people in their sleep<br><br> it's a myth </br></br></br></br>  <br>carcinoma.</br>  She probably creeped it out by almost crushing it. So it prob bit out of instinct. Normally, though spider bites have big swells but tiny wounds. It's uncommon to leave a hole that big. Might be allergic or something.  <br><br>looks like a fifth nipple<br><br>suck on it and see</br></br></br></br>  Thats necrosis. Get it checked before they have to cut a hole in her arm.  <br><br>where the fuck did you hear this?</br></br>  At the hospital now, will keep you guys updated  <br>Listen to this faggot<br>I got MRSA and I waited before going to the doctor and I got very painful boils all over my groin and a painful rash all over my lower body for my stupidity</br></br>   nice trips son.  <br><br>OP actually wasn't a moran today.</br></br>  <br>Actually, that's precisely how most brown recluse bites happen. They're called brown recluses because they tend to hide places rather than build webs put in the open. It's very common for them to find their way into a person's bed, then bite a person who unknowingly lies on top of them.</br>  <br>Is you wife a skeleton OP?</br>  <br><br>ummmm, everywhere that non-idiots talk about it.<br><br>here, for one, faggot.<br><br>http://arthropodecology.com/2012/02<wbr>/15/spiders-do-not-bite/<br>------<br><br>Spiders do not bite.<br>FEBRUARY 15, 2012 / CHRIS BUDDLE<br>Last week, the arthropod lab was lucky enough to be highlighted on the website “Montreal Openfile”. When discussing our work with spiders as related to McGill’s spider collection, I was asked about the most common misconception about spiders, and I responded quickly with the following:<br><br> There are a lot of misconceptions about spiders. The most common is the idea that spiders frequently bite people – they do not. Most so-called spider bites are caused by something else. Spiders generally have no interest in biting us, and would rather feed upon invertebrates. I have been working with spiders for over 15 years, and I have handled many, many kinds of live spiders and I have never been attacked by a spider.<br><br>It is really quite astounding – almost anyone you talk to seem to know someone who has been bitten by a spider and/or they themselves have a personal story about a spider that bit them. These stories often include anecdotes like “it really, really hurt“, “the wound swelled up and festered“, “I was bitten over and over again in the middle of the night“, “the spider ran right at me and bit me” etc. Related directly to this are the numerous questions I get about the brown recluse spider, and its occurrence in Quebec. If I believed everything that people told me, I would NOT be an Arachnologist, and I would fear for my life – Venomous spiders everywhere!!!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> goofball </br>  <br><br> inb4 jews </br></br>  <br><br>brown recluse spiders are limited to the southern, middle US<br><br>anywhere else it aint that</br></br></br></br>    bumping for OPs update  <br>4chan</br>  <br>wow op, its obvious what this is<br> mfw ashy nigger skin burn <br> heard it was cancerous <br>your wife is obviously cheating while you sleep<br><br> once you go black, stay the fuck away from me </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wonder who is being this post and article...</br>  <br>I'm just saying<br>no one wants to catch ashy roody-poo skin burn<br>that shit is highly contagious</br></br></br>  <br>bot fly for sure</br>  /s/Fur Mk.CCXXI [SubMk.II]<br><br>My the night sky above my neighborhood is <br>being lit up like skies of Libya during a <br>particularly severe air raid.

The silver samurai was this sissy black guy cliche I've been seeing lately pop up everywhere</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Looove me some makise kurisu.</br>  <br>It was really average. The Lego Movie should have won the Oscar last year.</br>    <br>I don't really like Steven Universe porn but whatever</br>            <br>Agreed</br>    <br>At least the R34 that came of it is great</br>  Personal fave            <br>True. I haven't watched rv in SO LONG. I've missed so many Steven Universe episodes. I actually like it too</br>                <br>While I'm sitting here at the desk I should be watching this on Netflix</br>  <br>teen titans!!!</br>  <br>Naruto!!!!</br>  <br><br><br><br>I only liked the first part of the anime. After they changed the opening they lost me.</br></br></br></br>                        <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Thanks</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No problem</br>    <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Thanks anon, don't know why, but I love this girl</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Plot sucked too, and I hated all of the characters because of their cookie-cutter personalities. Sure it's a kids film, but it's fucking annoying when adults have Pixar nostalgia jizzed into their eyes and are too stupid to realize movies like this and Frozen aren't the greatest movies ever.<br><br>But I'll be damned if some good R34 didn't come out of it.</br></br></br>  <br>Everyone loves her.</br>  hullo  <br>I think they both were decent movies. But again, I don't even think the Lion King is that great...</br>      <br>Tentacles?</br>  creepshot thread            BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUMP  <br>I can't stop thinking rocky dennis.</br>  bump  bump    <br>based<br><br>but if it was a woman sucking a dick; <br>slut</br></br></br></br>  ITT: OP using old images from last nights thread  exactly right    i see theres MOAR?  <br>Interesting</br>  <br>yeah it is</br>  YEEEEEES  <br>Too bad we will never witness it</br>  <br>noice!!!</br>  <br>you are very right, for the exact reasons you are thinking of</br>  <br>A man can only dream</br>  Was having a good time posting earlier but I think it's bed time.  YOU must reveal  <br>Nice. Milf?</br>  <br>dreams are good</br>  <br>But realities are better ammmiright???</br>  <br>Any safe ass shots anon?</br>  <br/>  <br>Thank you anon for sharing</br>    OH LAAAAWD  <br>Nope, just an older chick with a banging body.</br>  <br><br><br><br>What do you use as camera?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh you are welcome good sir</br>    <br>Any possibility of the vid?</br>    <br>Dear diary anon was good today</br>  <br>lol</br>  <br>Ya looks good</br>  <br>I have thought about editing it for viewing<br><br><br>I have 3 I bought a clock for her room it has a built in camera and SD card slot that is what you are seeing now. She looks dead at it some times in the films almost takes your breath away<br><br>I also have one in the bathroom same clock style on the toliet.<br><br>I also have a voice recorder built into a key chain trinket on her key chain</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Are you the guy that was on my oc hidden camera shower video thread a few days ago?!

Want a name drop or other gay shit? Let's hump. Get in here. This is OC.
