I would read the history book during history class instead of listen to the teacher cause it was more interesting and every sorrid mess that the US participated in was listed there. Trail of Tears, 1812, Spanish American war, its just the teachers would skip these things because we only had so much time, and they wanted to spend however many million years on the revolution again. <br><br>Fuck Johnny Tremain.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Or involves a lot of cholesterol.

Not to mention the huge infrastructure for textiles being north, and when the tariffs were registered that southern slave cotton could be shipped north, and not to France or England, it started crippling any semblance of an economy for the southern states. Combine that with having an increasingly anti-slavery movement in both the north and the south; it's a lot easier to explain to idiots that slavery caused the civil war than tariffs. Most people don't even know what a tariff is and what they can or can't do for a country.<br><br>I don't think a single person (sane) in the country will say that slavery was a good thing. I don't even think most people that push the issue even care about slavery. <br><br>People are still completely offended by the flag of NAZI Germany, but it's not banned here. Why ban something so culturally important to society in general?<br><br>We're in a history thread.

I CAN GOOGLES</br>  <br>Go suck on a million throbbing horse whiners. Anyone who says slavery wasn't the main cause of the war can catch bird flu and read a Fucking history book.

Why do I need 10 sources for a 5 page paper??? That's a little ridiculous. Fuck you Dr. Smithers of Austin peay  <br>Kek, you should check the news better mate. They just found a Russian WWI submarine off the coast of Sweden</br>  <br>Hmm, good question. I personally think they were mostly treasure hunters hiding behind the cross, which really influenced their mind jk they were saints because they killed niggers heil hitler</br>  <br>The faggots banning the Confederate flag are the big Corps that want to look PC and generate sympathy with buyers though. The Gov. aint banning it, just removing it from its positions of prominence in government facilities. Which honestly HAS been long overdue. Southern culture my ass, the flag in SC was put up in 61, to protest desegregation.</br>  <br>How often do you molest schoolboys?</br>  <br><br>Is it true almost everything I've learned in History class is bullshit (at worst) and half-truths (at best).<br><br>For example, the Indians. I never knew they fought off Vikings (who were the ultimate badasses of their time). Also, they chopped down so many trees that they likely caused an ice age, built a structure that was so gigantic it makes the pyramids look tame where they conducted trade and business using widely circulated currency, and that one of the worst plagues in history wiped them out. <br><br>This was the ONLY reason Europeans made it here; are timing was perfect. We arrived when they didn't have the strength to fight back and did all the clearing of the land for us.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What was it, a hollowed out log?</br>  <br><br>1)How accurate do you think medieval/ancient knowledge/history is? Given the fact that information has been passed down for more than 800+ years. Appart from knowing names of legends such as Genghis Khan and Joan of Arc, how do we know if they are actually responsible for what we think they are ? <br><br>2) Do you believe Jesus actually existed, or a story of fiction.<br><br>3) Do you believe history largely repeats itself ( wars, slavery etc ) due to lack of historical knowledge in the masses, or simply because of our crude human nature ?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>To be honest, I am. I've wanted to be a teacher since I read the Magic School Bus as a kid.<br><br>2) Definitely not. That's maybe a third of it.

Caligula was an enemy of the senate because he enacted a bunch of shit for the lower class. People didn't want anymore of that 'nova homo' shit again.

That's something the history departments in colleges tell you to make you go "Whoa, this major isn't completely shit"</br>  <br>1) Depends on the matter, there are just general rules in history including both scholarly and archeological evidence. When archeological evidence is found with names carved in stones or shards then it's common sense. Scholarly evidence already poses more problems. This is mostly due to two reasons: (1) lots of written accounts are lost over time leaving only one or two accounts which are oftentimes not even contemporary while they may have been copied, (2) there was a lot of propaganda going on. <br><br>2) We can use that information for your second question; although still a sensitive subject, there are actually quite a fair amount of contemporary written accounts talking about Jesus in one way or another. What makes the case stronger is that these written accounts come from different cultures/politics, also the Romans for which the subject might have caused a negative influence.<br><br>Now then, that does not mean the gospels are right, since they clearly pose fictional parts. Furthermore, there has been no archeological evidence (accepted) that proves jesus existed making the case not airtight. There is however for instance scholarly evidence on Pontius Pilate.<br><br>3) History repeating itself is part of human nature. There are only so many different forms of behavior one can out, hence different manners of behavior keep coming back. War is in our instinct.<br><br> also not OP </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I genuinely enjoy history though. Would this change it?</br>  Why do you think the West played such a dominant role in history?  <br>Do something that you love, but at the same time, realize that it may not be entirely realistic to depend on a history degree to get you in the door if you don't want to be a teacher or museum curator. It may be a better minor if you don't see yourself doing those things.</br>  Wait, you can teach with only a bachelor in history ? I'm finishing my masters this year, i can't teach until i do  <br>I'd actually say Christianity. Like Islam, it's a religion that tells its followers to spread the religion, which discourages attitudes like isolationism. Meanwhile, in places like Ming China, after Zheng He was done piddling around in the Indian Ocean, they dismantled their navy and just went isolationist.</br>  What are your opinions on Hayden White's metahistory and the linguistic turn? Did you read it? Did you read the answers to that from Carlo Ginzburg, etc? Are you familiar with the discussion?  <br>Well, I got certified in NC and I took a bunch of courses and tests for that certification. Keep in mind that NC has a SHIT school system.<br><br>That said, good luck!</br></br></br>  <br>Hey, I wanted to know your personal opinion on King Henry VIII of england. Our true lord and savior.</br>  Crusades, good or bad? Do you think they were necessary for the Western world?  <br>I thought his views were pretty interesting. Metahistory was a decent read. I didn't read the answers from Ginzburg, however.</br>  How did the muslims manage to successfully conquer the Iberian Peninsula and not another part of Europe such as Italy?  <br>A (literally) gigantic dumbass<br><br><br>Killing people is bad, but it did bring nations together that absolutely hated each other against a common foe.<br><br>Fourth Crusade onward just pisses me off.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> War is in our instinct. <br>So sooner or later mankind will wipe out itself in a nuclear war?</br></br>  is it true that aliens built the pyramids?  how does it feel to teach 28 uninterested children?  <br>Pardon, but I though there was merely Four Crusades, I recall that the Forth caused so much damage that it was one of the many causes for the fall of the Byzantine Empire.</br>  <br>The Visigoths were weakened because of Justinian. He spread the Byzantine Empire to the Iberian peninsula, but this warfare led to Justinian's Plague, which weakened Europe. It absolutely ravaged the Visigothic Empire. I'd say that, had Justinian not tried recapturing so much territory in such a short amount of time, Iberia and even North Africa could have seen a non-Muslim rule. Hell, maybe even the Levant could have remained under Byzantine rule.</br>  <br>Don't bother, it's like he didn't read the damn thing.<br><br>Favourite big-name historian?</br></br></br>  <br>Do you ever think about fucking students</br>  Have you ever watched the series Crash Course World History on youtube? If yes, what do you think of it?  <br>there were many more crusades, for example the Children's Crusade or the crusades against the Hussite rebellion in Bohemia<br><br> not OP </br></br></br>  <br>Thanks for the reply, I gotta look into these Crusaders.</br>  do you enjoy watching Indiana Jones?  <br>There were nine endorsed by the Catholic Church. The Fourth Crusade eventually did lead to Byzantium's fall in 1453, which was largely an inside job. Jet fuel can't melt Theodosian Walls<br><br><br>Possibly, but I don't think humanity is any worse than other species. We just have the power to kill more things at once.<br><br><br>No<br><br><br>Pretty good since I trained for years to do it. It's a job. Someone's gotta be bored at some point.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Could be, although things did get more civilized. I guess a full out nuclear war would never happen, but never say never. Kids fight, adults fight, it's just a matter of showing ego's the strongest and most powerful. And fear.</br>  <br>The Justinian Plague? I heard the quick Expansion of Islam was made possible by a severe war between the byzantine and the Persian Empire, which weakened these to major powers?</br>  <br>Hey, Asking a shit tonne of questions here. But this is a little theoretical so to speak. How do you think Europe would have turned out if the bubonic plague wasn't introduced via infected fleas. If you can't answer, it's all cool since it's more guess and personal opinion than history.</br>  <br>Well, I've always had a soft spot for the classic historians. Livy, Tacitus, stuff like that. Biased? You bet, but they paved the way for modern historians.<br><br><br>No, because I don't like prison food and buttsex, but there are some great looking students. Yay for professionalism.<br><br><br>John Greene kind of pisses me off, but some of his videos are good for opening lectures and units.<br><br><br>Only all the fucking time</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  any advice for someone about to go into uni for history and secondary education?  <br>Not OP, but here we call this something like "what-if-history", and well, history already barely retains scientific status, this kind of things drifts away from that and enters more and more mere speculative territory. We're really not trained for that kind of thing.</br>  <br> People are still completely offended by the flag of NAZI Germany, but it's not banned here. <br><br>Neither is the Confederate flag. It's just that you shouldn't fly pro-Slavery or pro-Hitler flags flags outside government buildings.</br></br></br>  <br>The war definitely didn't help, but the plague arguably did more damage overall. It was basically the Black Death but during the Dark Ages rather than the Middle Ages. Hell, even Justinian caught it.<br><br><br>There would definitely have been a lot more people, which would have led to problems in Britain and Ireland during the Industrial revolution. The renaissance may have started earlier because the Black Death really threw a wrench in Italy's plans to say 'fuck you' to the HRE, especially Venice. MAYBE there would have been an earlier Italian unification.<br><br>I recommend the Years of Rice and Salt if you're into Alternative History like that.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Aye aye, understood. Just something I ponder upon time to time.</br>  <br>Shadow a teacher and make sure it's something you want to do. Do it at a shitty school, too.</br>  <br>OP of the Plauge bit, thanks for the recommendation! Going to look into that when I get time.</br>  <br>Favourite historian guy here, can't help but feel like your answer kind of dodged positioning yourself in the current field.</br>  <br>Why do you refuse Wikipedia as a source?</br>  <br>Actually the Byzantine empire was in a downhill slide pretty long before it's eventual collapse. They were getting attacked from all kinds of different sides and they had internal religious struggles. The expansion of Islam mostly happened so rapidly due to trading in the Middle-East. There were a lot of scattered cultures and bedouins back then, who saw something in Islam and were fairly easily converted on trading routes. Of course then there were also Saladdin and later Mehmed the conqueror, who fuckin tore christian forces apart, strengthening the power of islam.</br>  <br> duke_william_i_the_bastard <br><br>fixed that for ya</br></br></br>  do you have a beard?
