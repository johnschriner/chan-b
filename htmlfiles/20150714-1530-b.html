One of the few American delicacies that is impossible to not like.  <br><br>Making your own is the way to go of course.<br><br>But most restaurants with the balls to serve it, at least in my experience, have proper hollandaise.</br></br></br></br>  An Italian Beef from Augustinos in Carol Stream. West Chicago store needs to step it up. Best sandwiches.  <br>i think i will try to make it the next days, just googled it and it sounds like something i want to try<br>im living in germany so no chance that i could order it in any restorant or fast food shack<br><br>i have a deep fat fryer so i can make decent pomme frites and gravy wont be a problem to but what cheese should i use?<br>cant get hands onto the original one</br></br></br></br></br>  My buffalo wings  <br>Formerly from the UK?

Gyro tastes like a cheap imitation of shoarma.</br>  <br>Ever since they took this off the menu I died a little......</br>  <br>thanks</br>  <br>Word. Pretty much my go-to take-out comfort food. I love General Tso and sesame chicken.</br>  <br>You can get poutine instead of fries in most fast food combo meals for an upcharge like at Harvey's, McDonald's, A&amp;W, etc.<br>You can even get poutine at the snack bar inside Costco's...and it's actually pretty good poutine! The Quebecois make hte best poutine though. They invented it</br></br>  <br><br>Where is this from? Never head of this.</br></br>  <br>they still have it at the Subway near me. The Seafood and the tuna are hit-or-miss for some reason. Kind of a shame, once every couple months the seafood sensation is fucking perfect.. just make sure you salt &amp; pepper it.<br><br>Also they don't seem to have the chicken salad at all anymore.. boo</br></br></br>  <br><br>I have noticed this as well.<br><br>Not like i'm a snob when it comes to gyro meat, but a lot of the shit they use is obviously crap.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Name a food more god tier than a fucking gyro. <br>Everything else.</br></br>  <br>no probs</br>    <br><br>I really need to get to canada asap.<br><br>Poutine speaks to my inner american. I'm a fat kid stuck in a skinny kid's body.</br></br></br></br>  <br>We always have the tuna but never heard of the seafood.</br>    <br>holy shit that looks good</br>  Mcdonald's lobster roll! fuck yes!

Pick the opposite door.<br><br>God slayer: I'm sure this is cheating, but I'd "accidentally" push the birds off their stands and apologize to both of them.

TOS wasn't a masterpiece. Sometimes it's just a bit odd. DS9 and TOS are interchangeable in their value. But there are some good TOS.

You'll truly respect the brains ability to change emotion after experiencing this night and day feeling</br>  <br>*his</br>  good  <br><br>Truth</br></br>  <br>it fulfills the purpose of my existence. seriously.</br>  <br>good</br>  <br>It's the absolute definition of God-Tier!</br>  <br>I know that feeling the moment I try jizzing on my own face/mouth</br>  <br>but if your married, and you actually love your wife, its pure ectasy.</br>  doggy, she does the work, but painfully slow. Like so slow it takes you like 10 minutes to cum, but when you do, it's a god damn eruption. One of those cums where you almost feel sick to your stomach aftewards because you lost so much fluid. You have to go to waffle house to re energize.  <br>Bags of sand m8</br>  milky coins and salt  <br>fuck off faggot</br>  <br>Hahaha yea. "Fuck yea ima eat my cum fuck yea i love eating cum mmm cant wait for it.to splash on my face"<br><br>*Cums*<br><br>"Wtf. God damnit. Shit what was i thinking this is gross as fuck"</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>some primal subspace subconscious shit happens because you feel like you're passing on the genes potentially, and fulfilling your manly role/destiny on earth. even if she's on the pill or off her cycle when it's "safe zone".<br><br>that's the diff btwn that and pulling out which is just "ooohhh that feels nice".<br><br>i don't come inside except very rarely.</br></br></br></br></br>  pretty great, especially if you havent fapped or had sex in a couple of weeks. if I cum a lot and I'm fucking my girlfriend fast sometimes it feels like I'm ramming my dick through a hot gooey wall and I have to slow down because the wall is getting thicker and thicker and harder to get through. <br><br>totally explained that wrong but still, feels great</br></br>  <br>Well you're a faggot who doesn't fuck her well enough and uses the word "cuddles". If you fuck her right, she'll turn over and fall asleep and leave you alone</br>  <br> not just having a GF on birth control <br>i've probably pumped a gallon of cum up there over the past 5 months</br></br>  <br>u fokn wot</br>  <br>that's not how you do doggy at all my friend.<br>When doing it doggy style you should pull the weight of the girl on to your cock. Use both of your hands on her hips and you literally do all the work and use her weight to lance her with your dick.<br><br>L2sex</br></br></br></br>  if you slide as deep as you can meanwhile cum its feel like a blowjob  <br>ask your mom</br>  <br>I second this.</br>    <br>name of bangirl?</br>  <br>once you do it, you will realize why you are a male with a penis<br><br>there are very few things in life that feel as good<br><br>on a side note: that feeling of anxiety you have about not wanting to die a virgin, that will cease to exist.</br></br></br></br></br>  Life-affirming. You feel like part of the human race for a change.  <br>it cause ur terrible at having sex if uve satisfied her shell fall right asleep</br>  <br><br>Can't read?</br></br>  All these faggots talking about how it's the greatest thing ever and I'm just like "meh"<br><br><br>If you're fucking for the finish you're fucking for the wrong reason. Sex is about power.</br></br></br>  creampie time?  <br> Virgin detected </br>  this is all bullshit. I prefer head, or even handjobs. People tend to tense up and just shoot instead of cum hard when the cum in a girl. Also you are all forgetting the absolute dread of accidentally cumming in a girl. Terror.  <br>no, I'm not a virgin. I'm 24, and have been with my girlfriend for 5 years.</br>  <br><br>Power is about power. You need therapy if you're trying to compensate for your real life in your sex life.</br></br>  <br>Dafuq ia qrong with you? I was bustin nuts inside my exes after about a month or so..making sure they werent pregnant or some shit</br>  <br>This.
