[ America is a dogshit country, and is easily provable. You aren't even the 10th best country, at anything. Fucking loud n' proud losers. inb4 MUHARMIES.<br><br>One way is to look at how America now compares with other countries in key areas. The group of twenty advanced democracies—the major countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), including the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Japan, the Nordic countries, Canada, and others—can be thought of as our peer nations. Here’s what we see when we look at these countries. To our great shame, America now has<br><br>• the highest poverty rate, both generally and for children;<br>• the greatest inequality of incomes;<br>• the lowest social mobility;<br>• the lowest score on the UN’s index of “material well-being of children”;<br>• the worst score on the UN’s Gender Inequality Index;<br>• the highest expenditure on health care as a percentage of GDP, yet all this money accompanied by the highest infant mortality rate, the highest prevalence of mental health problems, the highest obesity rate, the highest percentage of people going without health care due to cost, the highest consumption of antidepressants per capita, and the shortest life expectancy at birth;<br>• the next-to-lowest score for student performance in math and middling performance in science and reading;<br>• the highest homicide rate;<br>• the largest prison population in absolute terms and per capita;<br>• the highest carbon dioxide emissions and the highest water consumption per capita;<br>• the lowest score on Yale’s Environmental Performance Index (except for Belgium) and the largest ecological footprint per capita (except for Denmark);<br>• the lowest spending on international development and humanitarian assistance as a percentage of national income (except for Japan and Italy);<br>• the highest military spending both in total and as a percentage of GDP; and<br>• the largest international arms sales.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>In regards to ops picture, I love these people on Facebook who do these "20 day weight loss challenges".... OK so you're doing it for 20 days, THEN WHAT? Are you just going to go back to being a lazy fatass. Why not make it a "lifetime weight loss challenge"?</br>  <br>Juice for two weeks, destroy their insides, go back to hamburgers. Baffled why they yo-yo weight.</br>      <br>Yet here you are, crying about my country. I'm sorry that we just don't care about whatever third world shithole you call home. <br><br>Stay jealous my friend</br></br></br>  that's how capitalist countries turn out eventually. Not a surprise.  <br>It would be a pleasant change for once, that when you nice people trash our country, you at least tell us where you are from because it's obviously better in your opinion. But you won't, because you know you're wrong.</br>    got awful quiet in here<br>op blew his load in the first post</br>  <br> muh freedom <br>'MERICA <br>Cheeseburger <br>liberty</br></br></br></br>  <br>germany</br>  <br>American here.<br><br>You have no idea how often I've wished I was born somewhere else. I lost the birth lottery, but at least I'm not in some South American or Mid-Eastern shit-hole.</br></br></br>  <br> the major countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), including the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Japan, the Nordic countries, Canada, and others—can be thought of as our peer nations. </br>  <br> germany <br><br>we all know where this is going now</br></br></br>  <br>the only possible route</br>  <br>Yes, I saw that the first time. I didn't realize you could from more than 6 countries at the same time. Thanks for pointing that out.</br>  Lost me at "highest infant mortality rate". US is 5.2/1000 births. Afghanistan is highest at 187.5/1000. US is 34th best out of 188 countries. Not the best, but ceratinly not the worst.<br><br>Yes...we are too fat. Because we've spent many years becoming the greatest economy on earth so that we can afford to both thrive as a society and to support fat, lazy slobs. You have them there too, wherever you are (assuming you are in a country where you have access to food and clean water like all of us fat stupid Americans). You just don't admit it.<br><br>Get your facts straight, you jealous fuck. Enjoy the shithole you live in while I work my high-paying job in safety, then go home to clean my gun, work out, watch a movie on my high-def big screen television, eat safe and healthy food for dinner, and then fuck my beautiful girlfriend. Have a nice life, shit-for-brains.<br><br>And of course we keep a huge army...so when a pack of fucking morons like you get out of line, we can send in a few JSOC teams and heavy bombers to kick the living shit out of your entire army.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>still assblasted that the allies dismantled their "1000 year" reich</br>  <br>jolly right my friend. we gave jerry a right arse kicking, we did!</br>  Oh...you are from Germany. No wonder you are jealous. We soundly kicked your ass (twice), you have Nazi shame and/or rage, and you are getting ready for your country's economy to completely stall out since you geniuses decided to buy into the whole "Eurozone" thing and support all of the bums in Greece, Italy, Spain, etc whi still refuse to reform and pull their own weight. Makes the UK look pretty fucking brilliant for keeping their own currency, huh?<br><br>Have fun working to support the European welfare society, and hoping you don't get destroyed by some North African immigrant terrorist in the near future.<br><br>No wonder you hate America, you silly German fuck.</br></br></br></br>  niceme.me    <br> the allies <br>You mean the britains and russians</br></br>  <br> We soundly kicked your ass (twice) <br> americans actually believed they decided the world wars <br>topkek</br></br></br>  <br>nice try friend</br>  <br>Well, they certainly didn't hoist the american flag in Berlin</br>  <br>And you say America has the shitty educational system. Try reading instead of just looking at the pictures.</br>  <br><br>For real? you should read a history book to find a clue. Entry of America into both world wars ensured that all of Europe is not speaking German today.<br><br>And no one here even wanted to be in WWII until Pearl Harbor. Saved European and Asian asses, we did. Who else was going to pull it off...the French? The Brits fighting valiantly but hopelessly over-matched? The Chinese? What a joke...<br><br>Fact.<br><br>Who decided the World Wars, genius? Hmmm...must have been those brave partizans.<br><br>Gimme a break.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>funny thing is<br>our economy is still better than yours and we never had any problems with terrorism from the outside<br>and i dont hate america<br>canada is pretty fine<br>i dont even hate us-americans for being this<br>what i hate is the us-american government, some us-american people but i truly hope that you guys can get over your puritanian heritage soon<br><br>and no, im not jealus, why would i?<br>i can go to school for free, after that i got a degree that is more worth than your collage degree, then i got into university, also for free<br>after i did my msc i got a great job in 3 weeks and you know what?<br>i did not lend me any money, no, actually after i finished my studies i actually had a positive account balance<br>you can only dream from this</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Norway. So yeah...<br><br> /thread? </br></br></br>  <br>russia</br>  <br> someone believes that America wasnt the deciding factor in both world wars <br>gr9 b9 m9</br></br>  <br>you could say the same about every other country that was part of the wars and that wherent part of them</br>  <br><br>Actually, they did. Berlin was partitioned very quickly with the Americans holding their part and the Russians holding theirs. One building does not a city make.<br><br>And the Russians would have still been bogged down and getting their asses handed to them on the Eastern front if the US had never shown up and actually forced the Germans to fight in Western Europe instead of just pillaging art, drinking wine and fucking French girls.<br><br>Truth.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuckn bait nigga</br>  <br><br><br><br>Guys, what are you doing?</br></br></br></br>  <br>i think i still have some 3rd reich history book from my grrandparents somewhere around in the basement for the keks so yes<br>what do you believe what they write into historybooks?</br></br>  ITT: butthurt Europeans  <br>Why do you wish you were born somewhere else?</br>  So America doesn't rate #1 at absolutely everything? Does anyone? No? Thought so.<br><br>The fact is if you are pretty well off, like the top 50% of the economic ladder in America! life is actually pretty fucking great. Yeah in the ghettos it sucks. But that inequality thing swings both ways, for every shit clinic in downtown rusted shithole you have incredible hospitals like John Hopkins. America is really a tale of two nations, and taking the average isn't a fair comparison when a crap clinic is just 30 minutes from a private world class one. If you live middle or up, America really is a great place to live. People from all over come to America to get educated in science, math, engineering, and tech fields, and many opt to stay. So maybe... Just maybe... America may not be the end all be all at everything. Ok. But we are STILL seen as the land of opportunity by many. We are STILL the nation everyone turns to when something happens. Americans don't do state charity much, in terms of foreign aid. But remember that even a small percent of our economy can flood most nations in cash. And it doesn't factor private charity given by Americans, the number of private charity groups led by Americans (warren Buffett and Bill gates have given billions in charity, and pledge more through the Bill and Melinda gates foundation, etc.). <br><br>Note I'm not mentioning ww2. I don't think its relevant to the convo really. But America is still the guarantor of European security. During the Cold War does anyone truly believe that West Germany or France could withhold the soviet hordes? No, they probably couldn't, we saw what happened when the soviets and Germans squared off last. To this day most euro nations are in a weaker state than they were in the Cold War, and with a resurgent Russia NATO's existence has been reinforced. So bitch and complain about America all you want, but we still are a world leader with no one rising up as a suitable replacement to fill the void.</br></br></br></br>    <br> And the Russians would have still been bogged down and getting their asses handed to them on the Eastern front if the US had never shown up and actually forced the Germans to fight in Western Europe <br>In 1944, the war was basically won already. The USA saved the Russians, yes, but not through military intervention. They saved them with their gigantic economy, by shelling out tanks, airplanes and supplies so the russians could survive the first few months of the war, until their factories started running again.</br></br>  <br>I feel like Russia had staying power but lacked an ability to push. Although I might be wrong, the world wars have never been a subject I was interested in studying.</br>  <br>Btw yes I'm aware of China's rise, but a communist dictatorship that gives zero fucks about anything outside east Asia or their colonies in Africa is NOT approaching the same international leadership role America still fulfills. Russia is in the same boat, having maybe the potential but not the will or actual benevolence.</br>  <br>finally some sense in this shitstorm<br>Hitler was better than Bush, tho</br></br>  <br> UN <br>stopped reading there yurocuck</br></br>  <br>In theory, the USSR was superior to Germany in every aspect. The problem they faced was that they had to evacuate all their factories behind the Ural, to get them away from the rapidly advancing Germans. Thus, they couldn't produce tanks or weapons during the first months of the war and had to depend on american supply trains</br>  <br>LOL is your father Donald Trump</br>  <br><br> what is the Soviet Union </br></br>  <br>yeah, but we have the world's best bacon bruh</br>  <br>the only problem is that neither side will agree, so I'll assume they aren't this stupid and just like arguing...<br> This picture shows the exact shitposting I mean... </br></br>  <br>actually spain has</br>    <br> so I'll assume they aren't this stupid </br>  <br><br>Nope...not a Trump. Just an average, successful American with a great life, who occasionally gets baited into talking shit to jealous Eurotrash.</br></br>    <br>Why did so many people have a problem with this movie?</br>  <br>nice try, sadly I'm not as physically impaired as you</br>  <br>They had? I thought is was pretty good, Bruno Ganz played Hitler well</br>  <br><br>Tfw no one refutes this and shitposting continues</br></br>  <br>AMERICA IS FOR THE RICH.<br>If you are not rich in America you are a fucking pleb and you don't even realize it!</br></br>    <br>Why when Uk beat america in freedom land</br>  I hate America, because they fought Germany for no reason other than some crazy Japs attacking a ship.<br>They made us the poor eurotrash we are today and I will not forgive them stopping Germany from conquering Europe.</br>  <br>What did you think this thread was for?</br>  <br>Dann warst du noch nie in den USA, Deutschland ist USA in jeder Hinsicht unterlegen, außer du bist aus der Unterschicht, die will aber auch keiner haben.</br>  <br>In ww1 Germany attacked the Lusitania, an American ship.<br>In ww2 nazi Germany declared war on the us before America declared war on nazi germany, gr8 b8 m8</br></br>  <br>Not gonna lie love the gif lol</br>  <br><br>Isn't that the beauty of it? Our poor plebs don't realize the true nature of their condition in the US simply because they are better off than 90% of people in the rest of the world, and feel totally entitled.<br><br>How many trailer homes here in the US have 2 cars parked out front, a firdge full of food thanks to food stamps and a couple of flat-screen TVs inside? Most of 'em.<br><br>I'd rather be poor and unemployed in America than working-class in Africa of the Middle East. I'm planning on living for a long time.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Lol, being reasonable on /b/ <br><br>I don't think the hitler/bush comparison is fair though, as much as I dislike him.</br></br></br>  <br>USA shill pls go and stay go</br>  <br>No. U.S. aid in the first few months of the war was nonexistant, and the tanks and airplanes they sent was worse than the tanks and the airplanes already in russian service. <br><br>Ivan won world war two.</br></br></br>  <br> And of course we keep a huge army...so when a pack of fucking morons like you get out of line, we can send in a few JSOC teams and heavy bombers to kick the living shit out of your entire army. </br>  <br>Yeah, Hitler was the far better statesman<br><br>You're just as bad as stormfags and 'Muhricans</br></br></br>  <br>The single most effective picture to get every murican mad ever</br>  <br> Saved European and Asian asses, we did. Who else was going to pull it off... <br><br>lol read some actual history faggot<br><br><br> pic related </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Like anyone under the age of 40 gives a fuck about Vietnam. Everyone knows we should never have been there in the first place. Just like Iraq.<br><br>We got our ass handed to us in Vietnam, but we never really committed to winning there either.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Of course you didn't. That's why you burned down the jungle in a desperate attempt to kill the few peasants who kicked your asses on a daily basis.<br><br>And who enters wars to win them anyway, am I right americunt?</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Maybe you should read some history, faggot. The Japanese had already destroyed the Russians once in 1904-1905. They were headed that way again and hungry for more, if only they'd not fucked up and bombed Pearl Harbor, dragging the US into their new Pacific empire.<br><br>The Germans had them stalled out on their west, and was basically holding the entire European end of the country under siege.<br><br>Had the US not come in and divided the efforts of both Germany and Japan, Russia would have been divvied up by those two countries within 2-5 years.<br><br>Deal with it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Using niggers as a representation of any country makes that country look like shit.</br>  <br>Is Europe a country? I've never heard of them</br>  <br><br>You are exactly right, genius. We sometimes enter wars simply to support and enhance our military industrial complex and to ensure that our military remains the dominant fighting force in the world, bar none.<br><br>Fucking brilliant, but dumb-asses like you could never see it. Most do not.</br></br></br></br>  <br>lol overestimate your contributions much ameritard?<br><br> inb4 but, but muh freedumbz </br></br></br>  <br>So did the Japanese (with American help, we armed and trained many), the French, and the Chinese. And the soviets lost to the mujahideen. And the Germans lost to damn near everyone. And the Italians too, and to Ethiopians. And the Brits lost to a bunch of Americans and later some afghanis. Shit happens. Just because America didn't fare well in Vietnam didn't mean the soviets went "Hurd derr them americanskis are pathetic, invade Europe now comrade commissar Vlad leonid", we still were t one to mess with.</br>  <br><br>Russia would have won the war alone. More like "Thank America that Europe isn't speaking RUSSIAN today."</br></br>  <br>And you are so proud of it, too!<br>The American people are truly most deserving of every terrible thing that ever happened to them.<br>Hearing about the brave men of Vietnam gives me hope that one day the unrighteous American regiment will be broken.</br></br></br>  <br>army and hollywoodian propaganda is the only thing that poor americans have</br>  <br>Why posting that?<br><br>Leave them oblivious, collapse, and let the rest of the world applause and enjoy the show.</br></br></br>  <br>haha warst du überhaupt schonmal in deutschland? lmao</br>      <br><br>Actually Canada has</br></br>  <br><br>It's easy to confuse pride and pragmatism, isn't it? I actually said above that we never should have been there. That war was a travesty and a total scam of the American public. But our government makes these unfortunate decisions, not the people themselves...look at the protests and the resistance movement in the 60's and 70's. It was the most unpopular war we ever fought.<br><br>I'm glad N Vietnam kicked our asses and sent us packing. We had no business there.<br><br>But I understand why we were there in the first place.<br><br>Unlike you.<br><br>And by deduction, I guess you hope that the Afghanis will one day rise up to destroy Russia, that Israel will nuke Germany into oblivion, and that the Congolese will get their shit together and invade Belgium?<br><br>Jesus....the idiots on here.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tl;dr: Germany is shitposting again about dubya dubya 2 again</br>  <br><br><br>GERMANY?! LOL! NAZIS AMIRITE GUYS LEL TOPKEK XD<br><br>I'm not even German and this is just pathetic.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> • the greatest inequality of incomes; <br>He's going all out!</br></br>  <br>Actually America has<br><br> pic related </br></br></br>  <br>And Silicon Valley.<br>And heavy equipment manufacturing.<br>And many of the best aerospace companies like Boeing.<br>And some of the worlds largest auto firms.<br>And some of the worlds largest banks.<br>And some of the worlds best engineering and medical schools.<br>And some of the worlds best private defense companies.<br>And some of the worlds largest charities.<br>And the worlds only space program to put a man on another stellar body.<br>And the CDC, which is a world tier force against illnesses.<br>And the worlds bread basket.<br>And the home of the UN.<br>And the home of the Federal Reserve, which at various points housed priceless artifacts such as the British Crown Jewels during WW2.<br>And the smithsonian.<br>And a huge number of broadway shows.<br>And more national park space than most nations have actual space.<br>And a wide range of climates to live in.<br>And the national weather service whose radar data is used globally.<br>And we track the space debris of the world, no one else can do it with our precision.<br>And marvel and DC comics, among other smaller firms.<br>And a crap ton of wineries and micro breweries.<br>And bourbon.<br>And a long list of inventors and innovators and writers.<br><br>But I guess yeah, we ONLY have armies and Hollywood. Gr8 b8 m8</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You are my enemy. I don't care about the rest. I want America in ruins. I hate you and you think you are better than me. This will not stop. I want America dead.</br>  <br> Yet here you are, crying about my country. I'm sorry that we just don't care about whatever third world shithole you call home.  <br><br> To our great shame, America now has <br><br>American education at work.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>back to back off by 1 rofl almost chek'd dem trips<br> also <br>muh freedoms</br></br></br></br>  <br> And a huge number of broadway shows <br><br>uh-oh someone here is a bit "fabulous"</br></br></br>  <br>You're also the largest country to have legalized gay marriage...</br>  <br>so true</br>  <br><br>Actually I don't hate you or think that I am better than you. How could I? I don't even know you.<br><br>I was just lucky enough to be born in the US and to take full advantage of the great opportunities presented to me. Yup...blind luck, and some hard work to go along with it.<br><br>I actually pity people like you. It is mindless and poorly-reasoned hate like yours that is poisoning and destroying much of the rest of the world.<br><br>I truly feel sorry for you dude, to be filled with such hate. Maybe you should get up from the computer today and go do something to make your life or your family's situation a little better.<br><br>I mean besides posting hate online or harming someone else. You know...something of value.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This isn't me confused about muh freedoms, we lost our strategic goals in Vietnam. But so did literally everyone else who has invaded them in the last century. The fact is asymmetric war is hard, it's difficult, and no one has a really great and cheap way to deal with it. Pretty much every nation has gotten its ass handed to it at one time or another, and in the case of imperial nations it's Usually involved some guerilla warfare. There are exceptions, but guerilla warfare is a big problem to deal with. But with drones I would argue that's coming to an end. We live in a world where you can have a missile armed robot patrol the skies. It's cheap. It has no family. There is no letters home, no one cares if it dies, no PMN mines to take off its foot and no questioning orders. New imperialism is robotic man, and it never has to end.</br>    <br>Hatred is for the lonely and unloved.<br>I hope whatever is going wrong in your life to make you feel this way gets better, Anon.<br>Get well soon.<br>-An American</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think its fair to say that broadway shows count every bit culturally as Hollywood. It wasn't long ago people showed up to vaudeville, and the theaters in America are still filled up. I'm not "fabulous", I just think its important enough culturally to count in the list.</br>    <br>*culturally significant, sorry for the error</br>  <br>Right, your country is the richest, but it is in decline and Germany is getting better and better. Your future generations will suffer and while you might be well off I still take great pleasure in the thought that your grandchildren will have a harder life. You will lose the title sole remaining superpower and I'm not the only one hating your country. You had to play world police everywhere and make others miserable while at it. This will be great. I hope China will be tough on you. I really really hate you.<br>And my life is not bad at all. I will be good and my family is not poor.</br></br>  <br> I'm not "fabulous" <br><br>which in fact means that you are 110% homosexual<br><br> because you put weiners in your butt </br></br></br></br></br>    <br>fuck you spanish cunt, merica bacon pisses over your tapas cunt strips</br>  <br>fixed that for you</br>  <br>France has more than that and attracts more tourists per year<br><br>fuck you, fat yank cunt</br></br></br>  <br><br>Planted when the US wasn't yet the steaming pile of shit it is now</br></br>  <br>The euro is an experiment that may be ending soon, and disastrously at that. German economic domination of Europe is coming to an end and you are completely dependent on Russian resources. Whatever fate you wish on us at the hands of the Chinese, I assure you the Russians are going to be far more forceful on Europe when they decide to do something you dislike, say, turn off your natural gas in winter. We are entering a world of multi polarity, much as it was at the beginning of the 1900s. But the future is still do I aged by America, China, Russia, and maybe Brazil and India if they get their shit together. But unless Europe makes a central government that isn't just a currency ploy I think you will continue to be at the mercy, alternatively, at America the indispensable ally that keeps the Ukraine crises from being repeated all over Europe and Russia that uses oil and natural gas as potent weapons to do whatever it wants. Your anger won't change that. Empires don't die anymore, nations blessed by populations, abundant resources, and military strength just rebound. The Russians are rebounding. The Chinese are rebounding. The Indians are rebounding. Even if America stumbles it will rebound.</br>  <br>Hahahahaha!</br>  b8. America is obviously the best country and any who argue are new fags bullshit b8ing u  <br><br>We may be in decline, bro. Time will tell. But I would have rather lived in a sweet villa in 4th century Rome (in decline) than in some smoky shit-smelling hut with 10-15 other Visigoths, Ostrogoths, Vandals, or whomever.<br><br>My life is great, and I'm fine where I'm at. Hate away...it doesn't affect me in the least.<br><br>I hope that someday you can feel the same and stop being hateful, jealous and all twisted-up inside over things you cannot affect (unless you get up off your butt and do something to make your life better).<br><br>Enough of this...I need to get back to making lots of money.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   implying America didn't cause the shit in Ukraine themselves to begin with   I blame the damn commies, and those aliens and their anal probing  <br>This Europoor hate we have seen lately is exactly a byproduct off this failure. Greece is just the beginning. The rest will fall like dominoes.</br>  <br>You never kicked Germany's ass you stupid fuck.<br><br>In the first world war, you never even got into Germany. In the second one, it was the Soviet Union who won the war against Germany.</br></br></br>  <br>You mean the smithsonian? Sure. Not surprised, they have the louvre and stuff. They also conquered a shit ton of places.<br><br>France doesn't have a lot of things on that list, don't be mad just because you can't think of one country that has all that. Cuz they don't have Silicon Valley, they don't have the UN, they don't have a space agency wholly their own that has put a man on the moon, and they don't have anywhere near the pop-cultural domination America still enjoys. But they did have mini-tel, I guess that was nifty.<br><br>And I never mentioned tourism. Though we do have Disney world AND Disneyland. Oh, yeah add Disney to the list.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br>jews and niggers nothing more</br></br>  <br>The soviets made ukraine independent. The Russians and Americans and Ukrainians signed a deal in the 90s that if Ukraine turned over its nukes that the Russians would respect is border sovereignty. Guess the Ukrainians got burned on that deal tho...</br>  <br>*future is still dominated, fuck my autocorrect</br>  <br>planted in a studio in america</br>  <br>TL DR</br>    <br><br>kek, sad</br></br>  <br>I make lots of money too with things I enjoy. I doubt you will ever be better off than me. And I will not be some cuck accepting an inferiority. <br><br>The world doesn't stop changing. You took Germanys chance to be a superpower like you and yes, it will be small for the foreseeable future, but the life standard of our population I already equal to yours with just a 2% difference. I do believe we will become better at this than you or at least stay equal. That I enough victory, I don't need a controlling political role i have nothing to do with. I want us to be better off than us citizens. Our relations with the world are not as bad as yours.</br></br></br>  <br>Pretty much.</br>  <br>Prove it</br>  <br>So all the apollos, filmed, poured over, was planted? <br><br>The soviets, who would call us out on our bullshit, just stayed quiet? Didn't say anything? Just quietly abandoned their own moon landing mission why? Because I would love to hear your theory as to why the soviets, masters of film and media propaganda, would miss out the opportunity to call "bullshit!!!!!,!" And do it themselves "for real". But they didn't. We won that leg of the space race fair and square, and in 50+ years no one has repeated it.</br></br></br>  World economic system is based on USD. Nuff said  <br>All Russia did was provide the most cannon fodder. A Pyrrhic victory at best.</br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br>Not for much longer. Other countries are rapidly losing faith in the USD due to our skyrocketing debt. Sadly, the end is nigh. Bad times ahead. Maybe no computer. Maybe no home.</br>  <br>And that's why Germany isn't necessarily as great even if your living standards are equal, because the world deserves a leader to offer an image of a better future, weaker nations need a stronger one to help them when in need. The Un is torn in too many directions. Europe is vulnerable to Russian wolves to the east. There is a place for a strong western government to advocate a western image of freedom, a market economy, and so on. And in a world of dictators and wolves, a guardian of the west, or even a black knight if you prefer, is vital to safeguard what we have built over two thousand-plus years of western culture. Criticize America all you want, had it not been for us the soviets may not have stopped at east Germany.</br>  <br><br><br>Yes you did my friends whit the brits fightning in butt-fuck nowhere desert and they´re air bombing of villages,towns and factories and the muricans with they´re involvment in the last year , while we lost 20 million people and they took out half of our country, but ye you did fine mate cheers</br></br></br>  <br>Good shitpost, /b/ro<br><br>Go back to /pol/</br></br></br>  <br>Nah our bond rating hasn't shaken. Our debt isn't so much important as our debt to GDP ratio, which isn't nearly as bad. Yes, in absolute terms it looks bad. But we also generate a fuck ton in GDP every year. And we are also owed a lot from loans we give out. National debt isn't like household debt.</br>  America's problem - niggers.<br><br>If we had no nignogs we would be leading every good category by a large margin.</br></br>  <br> our peer nations <br> our <br>b8 or no, you're still retarded</br></br></br>  all americants in this thread should remember germany has one of the highest approval ratings of america, and German-American is the most common ethnic group in america, topping in at 50mil members. Just saying.  <br>No please, go ahead and keep ranting. We'll just be over here, dominating the world's economy, spreading aspects of our culture everywhere and having the most powerful military.</br>  <br>Just imagined if we would've sent the niggers back to Africa. We would be shitting on you Euro fags.</br>  <br>Americans on vacation in Europe</br>  <br>Then get off your fat lazy ass and join ISIS already so I can watch a liveleak video of you getting blown up by a predator drone from my living room.</br>  <br>lol no</br>  <br>Indeed, it is sad to see Muricans thinking they did anything in the WW1</br>  <br>And yet in ww2 German Americans still went and fought and killed the Nazis in droves. What's your point.</br>  <br> and they don't have anywhere near the pop-cultural domination America still enjoys. <br>Not really sure it's something to be proud of</br></br>  <br>As I said I don't need a swollen ego about being a protector. That's just an idea in your head as an inhabitant of your country anyway. It doesn't affect you or me in comparison in this very moment. You just do some extra work for us. You're not greater now. I want us to be more comfortable than you Americans and we are on the best way to get there.<br><br>Your people will lose sooner or later. Have fun becoming poorer.</br></br></br>  <br>OP is a jealous faggot<br><br>Muh freedom and standards of living really do exist</br></br></br>  <br>just because you're faggot ass in kindergarden doesn't like us doesn't mean you're entire country doesn't. Check google. Also, yes german americans are the biggest ethnic group in america. It tops 50 million and growing, surpassing english and other ethnic groups. <br>INB4 germans aren't faggot, 1/3 of all ethnic germans live in america.</br></br>  <br>You're entirely correct. <br><br>The only reason why America has the highest per-capita GDP is because of the petro-dollar and the dollar being the world reserve currency. <br><br>Their median GDP (the difference being inequality) is much worse than the Scandinavian countries who exercise relativly socialist means to expand their economies.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm willing to bet that if we do end up losing it'll be much later rather than sooner, and not in the dramatic and violent fashion you're hoping for. But hey, who am I to rain on your parade? If you wanna waste your time day dreaming about the day America falls be my guest.</br>  <br>At Least in america you could practice being a nazi, like you want to in germany.</br>    <br>I know it will not be violent and I know that I will not happen soon. But I don't have to be miserable, because we are already equal in that regard anyway plus I'm more than the common german citizen. So I feel good already and I know the future of my country is brighter than yours.<br>Cheers<br><br>Not a nazi, just despising americunts.</br></br></br></br>  Who gives a shit?<br>I mean, will it matter during the nuclear winter?</br>  <br> more wealthy than average* </br>  <br>Come on, this counts for every country. Each country has its "niggers" of whatever origin.</br>  America has more gold medals than any other country in the world http://www.olympic.it/english/medal<wbr></wbr>  Lost nearly 80% of my inventory to bets. <br>If you have any unwanted shitty trash skins pls send them to me if you want.<br>Everyone who does gets a rare pepe</br></br>  https://steamcommunity.com/tradeoff<wbr>er/new/?partner=90964426&amp;token=bEmT<wbr>3w1D<br> thats my trade url btw</br></wbr></wbr>  https://steamcommunity.com/tradeoff<wbr>er/new/?partner=25402737&amp;token=sWnA<wbr>3L-v</wbr></wbr>  And where our rare pepes OP?  <br>Noone send me skins, so no rare pepes for u my sir</br>  This kills the pussy  <br>Don't be jelly cause you can't stack up against a piece of plastic.</br>  But that's not my dick.

They can be tired, have anxiety, etc. Sometimes chicks can be so worried about not having an orgasm that they won't even try. So having a rockin' vibe right there is great, because it helps a chick know that even if she can't cum from fucking, she'll be able to cum anyway...and it kills her anxiety and helps her cum easier from fucking. <br><br>Also, gives her something to play with when you're not around. <br><br>protip - only tiny-cocked insecure betas are worried their dick will get replaced by a vibe. Don't be so easily threatened, kids.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>So you are a whore...the good kind. <br><br>I'll stay here and watch as long as you want. Show us your ass in panties, please. Or your tits cupped in your hands.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I cant begin to imagine how absolutely cock trained you are, holy cuck.</br>  <br> please <br> mfw </br></br>  <br>or get out</br>   tits now   <br>I hate it. Thing goes waaaaayyy too hard on the clit. <br>Nothing better than a good cock and a thorough, rythmic pounding for nice G-spot orgasms.</br></br>  <br> I cant begin to imagine <br><br>I'm sure there's an infinite variety of things you can't imagine now that will dawn on you when you start having sex with women.

So femanons, anyone try a sybian? Thoughts, feelings, general impressions?  <br>9/10<br>would bang</br></br>  <br>nice bum</br>  <br><br>Good fuckable booty that. I'd like to get a few pillows under your hips and grind down on that ass, feel it squish while I fucked ya. <br><br>Love that lower back curve too. <br><br>what potato are you using to take these?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not a woman's place to enjoy sex. If you weren't a cuckold pussy-whipped libtard, you'd understand that and not give your wife a hunk of vibrating plastic to cheat on you with every time you leave the house because you can't satisfy her on your own.</br>  <br>You totally have a chance<br> women don't enjoy sex the way men do <br> men give things for sex <br> women give sex for things <br> hitachi power wand cannot give money or comfort to women <br>Sure, it'll make her cum- but that's not why women have sexy. It's just a bonus for them</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just . . . . Get the fuck out</br>  <br>It's just for porn. No individual consumer can afford its pricetag when there are far cheaper and more convenient options out there.</br>  <br>All hot n juicy</br>  <br>That looks so uncomfortable, it isn't even pointed so you would need a lot of force to get it up there.</br>  <br> It's not a woman's place to enjoy sex. <br>12 year old wannabe-dom virgin confirmed. You couldn't advertise it any louder.</br></br>  <br>That makes me sad.</br>  <br>You don't insert that. Girls just press the end onto the clit while it vibrates.</br>  <br>Its been alright so far. Just awaiting those tits...</br>  <br>I don't think it goes inside.</br>  <br>Not a femanon, but just because it's starred in a bunch of porn doesn't mean it's good. Those ladies have been known to fake it occasionally.</br>  <br> . . . . <br>die in a fire</br></br>  <br>What women are you fucking because in my experience the majority of women I have slept with go nothing outta me and just wanted sex.</br>  <br>Machines taking over, right?<br><br>Meh, technology will never replace a good dicing from a man who knows what he's doing.<br><br>having said that, I want to leave my girl spent, a puddle still quivering with ecstacy five minutes after I roll off of her. I want her to want for ABSOLUTELY nothing when I'm done or away. So these massagers work pretty well in helping with this.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Also it vibrates against the pelvic bone making everything vibrate at the same time</br>  <br>Top lel. Muh sides in orbit.</br>  <br>It's probably really good.

There are betas, naturals, and made alphas. I'm between the first one and the third one, and soon I'll lose my virginity, I'm 20 and had no gf till some time ago.</br>  Social anxiety. Anger problems, etc.<br><br>Getting over it now.</br></br>  <br>Post pic, then we will help</br>  <br>kek gud one</br>  <br>Add really fat to that and you are me.</br>  <br> Not sexually attracted to anything idk why i even come on /b/ </br>  I have had acne since 16. I'm now 26 and it has just started to ease up. I basically isolated myself and that lead to social anxiety and other shit and that's why.  <br>You aren't 7-8/10 but who gives a fuck, it's easy as shit. Go to the cinema together, make your move in the darkness, if you succed GG if you don't then who cares, just watch the movie. She won't complaint or talk that much since you are in a public space.</br>  <br>Had cancer, fucked with my confidence. Lost it at 22, pussy is easy to get once you lose the v and grow some balls</br>  <br><br> me going to school <br> totally unmotivad <br> stuck on douchebag level <br> class totally filled with white trash assholes <br> sunk in a total depression because of family  <br> family being non existing <br> fukin hated my mother being a controlfreak cunt <br><br>Uni turned a new page for me. Now fucking consistently with hot chicks. Life's good.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   lost virginity at 23 <br>at least i got to pop a cherry on my first time with a gf I love and not a street hooker</br>  Lost mine at 22, still not outgoing enough to realize when a woman is making advances towards me and my gf is basically an ex slut who I'm too afraid to leave because I still have no self confidence even though I hate her.  <br>dont be such a pansy. get that pitty sex</br>  girls are drawn to me, i have no problem interacting at all but when it comes to actually do something i pussy out, couldn't imagine myself in a relationship and i dont know how to kiss or fuck either (kissless virgin)<br><br>also 5.5' dick lenght and 5.5' girth banna shape(insecure about it). could have been bigger if it was straight</br></br>  <br><br> Get a profile on OKCupid <br> Start messaging girls you like <br> Chat until you feel more comfortable <br> Start doing other stuff like guitar lessons <br> Go out, make new friends. <br> Don't focus to much on one girl <br> If she says no, move on <br> Win <br><br>How's that, anon?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kissing is definitely a roadblock. Once thats out of the way, physical intimacy becomes easy. Its that damn first step that holds you back. Find a kissing coach and sort that out then have fun getting some well earned muff</br>  <br> not having a 2D waifu </br>  <br> Find a kissing coach <br>i dont think i can find anything like that around here, also i dont wanna taste hundred of dicks and learn it with a hooker</br></br>  <br>quads say you find a kissing coach and not a hooker. Ideally not one near you geographically so thats covered</br>  <br>Checked</br>  <br><br>I would, but my phone literally just died, but 5'11, brown hair green eyes, 75KG workout 6 times a week, quite muscular build with 6pack etc, like i see girls interested in me but idk what to do</br></br>  <br>I've given up on 3D women.</br>  <br>Source?</br>  lost it when i was 15 with a solid 8/10 16-years-old.  <br><br>You sir, ar an idiot</br></br>  <br>Dont feel bad bro.<br>I was a virgin till i was 21</br></br>   virgins <br><br>lel</br></br>  <br> Use Cialis or viagra. <br> Win </br></br>  <br>4inches<br>In the bright side im fucking in a few weeks</br></br>  Manlet<br>Skeleton<br>Unattractive face</br></br>  <br><br>Ex jehovahs witness also but lost virginity at 14. <br><br> Literally no excuses involving Jehovahs witness </br></br></br></br>  <br>Make sure you stretch your asshole out a bit first so it doesn't hurt.</br>  <br>22 now. I had a lot of opportunities when i was younger and did get a lot of head in the past. however after high school i've pretty much been either working or at home, and never got the chance to meet anyone.</br>  <br><br><br>Kissing coach? Mate, why even bother with the convo. Just go to a club with some friends, try to have fun and dance with some drunk sluts who are up for some tongue escapades. <br><br>And your dick is fine mate.</br></br></br></br></br>  23 yo virgin. i'm autistic or something.  <br><br>You can solve all your problems by going to the gym.
