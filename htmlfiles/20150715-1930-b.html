When I had a job I would drive 500 miles everyone month to get to a Krystal's and buy about 200$ worth of stuff and drive home.

The bitch on the other end laughed at me.<br><br>I went out in some really tall grass one time to have a paintball war with a friend, and when I got back I was covered with hundreds of ticks so I decided to use flea and tick shampoo for dogs on by body. I lathered up in that shit. <br>While I was sitting in the tub letting it soak for 10 minutes I started to feel weird so I looked at the bottle and it said not for human use so I called the number and asked why and they said that none of their products are safe for humans and that it leaves chemical burns on your skin, she said rinsing off isn't good enough and I told her well it only tingled for now and she told me to wash off, (all the while laughing at me) get dressed and got to the hospital, she said there's nothing they can do for you but they'll make you feel better while it runs its course. I was pissed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't have one in my state either.. That's why I used to drive 500 miles to get to one.</br>  <br>is your skin messed up</br>    <br>You've got good taste.

Nothing is final unless you imagine it to be. Go puke that shit up and drink fuck loads of water because God forbid you go through the embarrassment of psych assessment and people feeling sorry for you. <br><br>It's just bs man. I want to kill my ass all the time but them I'm like oh yea, tomorrow is probably not going to suck nigledicks like today did. <br><br>Just don't do it. No bs explanation. Life sucks but your family probably give a shit you know?</br></br></br></br>  <br>As someone who just chemically stripped paint off of a motorcycle...

You beared the weight too long and it's become too much for you to handle. <br>It's okay OP, I understand. <br>You should also think about how many lives yours has touched. Without you even knowing it. <br>Maybe a cashier was having a really bad day one time and you said something nice and made her day, gave her hope. Made her decide to keep her dead end job so that she can continue to provide for her children. I don't know op. But I do know that you have touched lives and without you who knows where they'd be.<br>You're not a bad guy or a coward, you've just had enough, and it's understandable.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Rest in peace OP, see you in the next life.  <br>Agreed.</br>  if you kill yourself you are an idiot. there is so much to live for in this short life. so maybe alot of bad shit has happened to you or maybe not and you're being a pussy about it, but do you really want to give up? or live another day towards a life thats worth living in your own eyes. Just for today you should live. think about killing yourself another day  seems like you've made up your mind op, so goodbye, and good luck on your journey.

Shit always sucks man trust me I live it everyday, life has its bumps in the road and sometimes it lasts forever.

I tried killing myself at 17 by taking a bunch of Percocet and xanax and a bottle of vodka. I felt so close to death for about 12-16 hours (not exactly sure how long but around that amount of time) and afterwards I realized I did not want to die. Long story short three years later my life is so fucking much better and I am so glad that somehow I survived what I did. Life goes on and we all die evntually anyways so you might as well enjoy the ride while it lasts and just wait for your day to come like the rest of us. Don't take everything away from yourself. You're trying to end some kind of sorrow in your life but you're failing to realize that you'll also be simultaneously ending any possibility to feel the joys of life too.

People forget opiates are not poisonous to humans in the conventional sense of liver failure or renal failure. They literally have zero effect on your inner organs. Opiates depress your central nervous system. Taking mass quantities can depress your CNS to the point where you body literally forgets to breathe.

Here's to a better tomorrow, friend. I haven't attempted suicide, but contemplated many times. What I ended up falling back on was that I can just go fuck off by myself and I don't need to worry about anyone fuck. Fuck em all, I can find something to keep myself busy and keep my mind off shit until the next tomorrow. Proud of you, OP. Very proud. I hope you wake up tomorrow feeling okay. Keep puking. KEEP PUKING</br>  <br>Saw that as well, but didn't really factor it in because considering the LD50 is right around 425mg in mice and rats and the typical Flexeril dosage is 20mg, he's gonna need to eat a lot more than 10.</br>  So, if Hitler had won WWII, would I, being a brunette but still white, have survived? And lived on in the new world order or whatever? Was he only about the white race or was he super serious about the Aryan thing  <br>He wasn't Aryan himself so...</br>  They killed faggots, so no  <br>go watch the Hitler channel<br><br>I mean History channel</br></br></br>  <br>anon you're like 5 years too late. They don't play that shit on the history channel anymore</br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br>what about gay gypsies. is there like a double negative turning into a positive with that or what</br>  guys pls. this has been bugging me ever since I got drunk 20 minutes ago. How can I support Hitler if I (allegedly) would have been killed supporting the very regime I fought for?  <br>The blonde hair, blue eye thing was mostly propaganda against the Nazis. Heritage was the more important thing.<br>How far it would have gone is an unanswered question. The Nazis weren't interested in North America, and were already friendly with large parts of South America. If they completely got rid of Russia and beaten Britain and such the whole thing may have been over.<br>Then again, they may have worked with Japan to conquer Asia, just don't know.<br>Germanic/Aryan was the order of the day, basically it was by and for the natives of Europe. As for new world order, not even sure what that's supposed to be about to be honest.</br></br></br></br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br>so if I was predominantly a mix of German/Korean with a splash of Irish, would that mean I would be on the chopping block?</br>  Hitler had parkinson's before his death and the Nazi Party likely would have lost considerable steam, if not completely fallen, within 20 years. No way they could have actually held Russia. Ever. Ditto for Britain.<br><br>Any victory by Hitler would have been incredibly short-lived. He was too much of a land-hog. He could have probably gotten away with bringing the German Empire back to its former territory, but noooo</br></br>  <br>yes you would have survived. That whole master race thing is bullshit</br>  <br> it was by and for the natives of Europe <br>not sure about that. France, Poland, Italy, Romania... Hitler was not kind with these people, I think it was for Germans only, regardless of blonde hairs</br></br>  <br>great<br><br>I didn't know whether to post this on /pol/ or here. I think the /pol/lacks would have thought I wasn't looking for a real conversation. thanks bruh</br></br></br>  <br>Possibly, though it likely wouldn't have come to that in the first place.<br>The Nazis installed racial hygiene programs amongst others which educated against and forbade racial mixing. The goal of everyone was to find a Germanic partner to ensure a stronger and larger desirable population.<br>There were eugenics programs in place as well, especially in Norway at the time, Lebensborn programs, all German soldiers stationed in Norway were encouraged to take Norwegian wives etc. for the same purpose.</br></br></br>  <br>oh so I wouldn't have even had the parents I do now then? well that makes sense.</br>  <br>I'll clarify as "Western European natives". The French got into a lot of shit because of the resistance. It got to a policy of 'kill a German, lose an entire family' sort of thing.<br>In France it wasn't as much about the desire for cruelty, but to stop/discourage resistance fighters.<br>It was after all an open hole in fortress Europe, the French regularly aided the Brits in everything from information to smuggling agents in/out, capturing Germans and extracting info.<br>Italy was under Mussolini though.</br></br></br></br>  German/Korean/Irish? The fuck does that even look like?  <br>Not sure how your Koren ancestor would have fared, but that's more under Japan and how they did things than the Nazis. And I'm not 100% on their policies and acts.<br>Didn't find it as interesting so haven't looked far into it, more into 'local' history.</br></br>  <br> Gerrman/Korean/Irish </br>  <br>if Bruce Lee and Chuck Norris had a child.</br>  <br><br>I don't look like that at all. Fuck that nigga looks ugly</br></br>  <br>you Chuck Lee now.</br>    <br>it's shopped</br>  <br>nah, you probably look more like that Markiplier guy. He's obnoxious, but hey, he's pretty.</br>  <br>man I fucking hate markplier too. everything is awful</br>  hitler liked the Japanese. he also liked arabs so keep that in mind  <br>The Arabs were largely a convenience. They had oil, Germany needed oil. Best not fight the people who can get it for you and give it to you when there were bigger fish to fry.<br>Don't forget similar things took place with Russia under the non-aggression pact when the Nazis slowly remade/tested planes and heavy weapons in the days before the war.</br></br>  <br><br>hes also a faggot</br></br>  <br>Yeah, he's not tolerable in anything but small doses.</br>  <br>I just hate the whole youtube celebrity phenomenon. I don't give a shit about fucking reaction cams and overreacting about dumb shit.</br>  <br>any jackass with a gimmick and a webcam gets airtime. Thanks, Youtube.</br>  <br>That hitler was a racist is jewish lies, he hated the jews for the same reason we hate the jews now.... Hitler had muslims asians south americans on his side... He actually waced at jesse owens that scene of him getting up in anger and not applausing jesse owens win is jewish propaganda. Hitler was a good boy he din du nuffin he was trying to get his life together.</br>  Hitler couldn't have won because the US was geographically isolated enough to continue to supply arms to its enemies, enriching itself to become the puppetmaster.  Ok /b/tards, why don't girls like you? Spill the beans, be honest and let's try and work on ourselves.  Grills like me. What's not to like?  girls do like me, the thing is that they are expensive and im on a budget  Who says they don't? I just don't like to spend much time and money on them when I already have a boyfriend.  girls don't like me becase im a fatlard, 250 lbs at 5 foot 9 inches. Im actually great at making girls laugh and am pretty charming, but of course I only get in the friend zone. The tragedy of it is, that a few women have actually legitamitly fallen in love with me, but have never been attracted to me. Im living on /fit/ and working out, but mfw Im 27 years old and my best years are behind me.  <br>im an idiot and ugly</br>  <br>elaborate anon, get it off your chest.</br>  Because I call people out on their shit and don't laugh at jokes that aren't funny.  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>that is actually very attractive to many grills, confidence and sincerity is very valuable in a mate, maybe you need to just learn some restraint and tact, but that doesnt mean you have to stop being real.</br>  <br>They do like me. Im just gay and intimidating to them.<br><br>All in all? Pretty fuckin sweet.</br></br></br>  LEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEL<br>LET'S SABOTAGE ALL WOMEEINS<br><br><br>WE ALL GAAAAAAAAAAAAY NAWWWWWWWWWWWWW<br><br><br>THEY KNOW NOTIN, WE 'MRUICA NOW ;P<br><br>I'M NOT PAID FOR SHITPOST BTW I PROMISE ;D</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr>  <br>I ship out for boot camp in two months. No chicks wanting commitment want to deal with that. I don't have the uniform yet. The sluts don't wanna deal with no uniform.<br><br>Just biding my time.<br><br>On the bright side, I have two women who would marry me right now if I asked them. They'd both be super loyal, and one of them is even rich.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>its very possible to be gay and unfuckable anon, same rules apply, work on yaself yabish</br>  It's gotta be the 8 figure net worth and six pack  <br>I find myself just staring at women sometimes. I'm not afraid of an awkward silence, but I think women are. It's not my fault I asked you what kind of music you liked and you said, "rock" and then I said, "what bands?" and she said "i dunno". <br><br> blank stare </br></br></br>  i'm a weaboo piece of trash. i'm super condescending when talking about things because I act like I know more than I do. I'm super unaccepting of differing views. my vocabulary sucks  I'm 5'2. Not much I can work on there  <br> loyal <br> rich <br>sorry anon, you are verified to be undatable and unfuckable. I sound like a beta white knight but aristotle says you need a mate with which you can have mutual respect, and mutually better each other. You arent mature enough for that, after the military whips your bitch ass into shape maybe youll be a productive member of society and now a shallow ignorant fucktard.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=csI<wbr>W4W_DYX4</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah dude 20s are destined to be shit tier for us because we takin it up the butt from the gubmint and we born into debt doe. <br><br>On a serious note tho most ppls 20s suck I've accepted this about my own. Just focus on getting swole and making dosh for now you'll be successful enough if u work hard /b/ro. <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Eyh<wbr>OmBPtGNM</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>I think anyone who is posting on this thread can benefit from this vid. It's basically the ethos of a dad and of somebody who wishes to be productive.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>dick extension.</br></br>  <br>Because I don't socialize. I'm /fit/ and look pretty good but I'm socially autismo</br>  They like me but not in an attraction manner,<br>I asked a couple of my friends and they say it's cause I'm a 4/10.<br><br>Oh well. My gf loves me and we fuck nearly every time we see each other so whatever.</br></br></br>  <br>conversation skills are an integral part of a happy life, watch the Aristotle video above. And work on yourself, practice something, when you have some confidence and somethings to talk about with people, you will do much better.<br/></br>  <br>Im in the same boat, eventually your gf will leave for the better deal though if you don't start bettering yourself, or her.</br>  i think i'm just a pretty boring guy, apart from drinking and listening to music you can't really do much with me  I have great confidence in everything I do throughout the day. I feel that I can get by anything with my intellect and this gives off a strong sense of confidence to woman. You see the thing is I'm very confident in the things I do and say but I have a horrible sense of self worth due to being such a skinny mother fucker my whole life. So basically I feel as though woman find me repulsive because of my low weight and small body frame size despite the fact that many woman have tried to come into me.  <br><br>then you gotta offer something up. Conversation =/= interrogation. I have a feeling that the description you used for yourself was sugar coating it. Really you don't know how to socialize, and in fact laughing at other people's jokes that you dont find funny doesnt make you fake, it is just paving over the potholes on the road to friendship.</br></br>  Does it count if I've been so shy that I've never really interacted with girls to know if they would like me or not?<br><br>Like, how many guys in college have never been on a date... other than me.</br></br>  <br>Yeah I know this. 6 years going strong though however I had just decided to take a web development class and to work out a bit.<br><br>Still though. I wish I was attractive besides my ass in some pants.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Hey guys, look at this faggot. He thinks he can give life advice over the internet and make a meaningful impact on other people's lives!</br></br>  <br>most grills prefer small to bulky, start eating and lifting and when you reach ottermode you will have prime mating potential. Looks are the surface you are very lucky if that is all you have to work on.</br>  I come off as really pretentious and arrogant, even though I try my hardest not to. Not to mention the last girl I liked led me on for a month before hopping on the dick of her best friend's ex.  <br>because im autistic (not self diagnosed) <br>(no i dont ware a retarded hat or trench coat or like sonic the hedge hog) <br>i look normal 5,11 200 pounds but im not fat i work in a machine shop so its mostly beef not lard <br> looks aint the problem  <br><br>I come across as arrogant and self obsessed <br>because im autistic i dont notice when i make a mistake and it hurts <br><br>at least thats what i think the problem is<br><br>picture is me</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> undatable <br> unfuckable <br><br>So says the virgin who substitutes his lack of friends with quotes from Aristotle.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>so eat more and be active... It sounds like you are scared of actually becoming the person you want to be, because really if you are telling the truth it would be so damned easy for you. I went from 126 to 145 in a matter of months without taking the whole gym thing all too seriously. It's not very hard.</br></br>  <br>you dont get fruit fly's</br>  Why would girls not like me?  <br>not that anon but isn't that the point of this thread retard?</br>  <br>I'm confident and all, I do talk to girls, have fun with them, but I spent most of my life thinking I'm undateable. So I really don't know how to move forward and progress the relationship. I have the balls to ask women out to dates but it's the old mindset that prevents me from trying to be in a relationship.</br>  <br><br>get a haircut for the love of god.</br></br>  I'm a fat fuck  <br>I'm not sorry.<br>The feeling of a strong man's hands on my feminized body is just too amazing. <br>I love dick man...

I'm done with women and beating myself up on why they don't want me. Fuck women, I got space engineers now.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>that's how it works, women are vain and cruel, but in truth, you would do the same if you could. Try listening more than talking, and asking questions more then being control of the conversation. Work on cultivating the traits in yourself that you would find attractive in a girl, and then the right girl will come to you.</br>  <br>Bitches love me. They used to not, because I had no game.

Funny, you actually look like me a little bit too. Any Irish heritage?<br><br>It was the middle of my junior year of high school where I figured out that chilling and not talking unless absolutely necessary made me a lot of friends. They sensed the change, and I lost the "annoying kid" identity. It's been three years now, and I'm a very social person. It was a gradual change. So, it wasn't a eureka moment.<br><br>tl;dr Anon discovers how to chill. Suggests other Anon learn to chill.

Currently have an on/off again gf, who's as if not more batshit insane than I am, which is really hard to do. My life is fuckin broken after enduring everything I've gone through, and considering my mental state I'm lucky if I can remember what I ear for breakfast. Considering how unreal/impossible my life has become, heroin is nice when I can actually feel it.  <br>so basically you are a habitual liar that sits at home and masturbates...</br>  Girls do like me. Too much, seeing as I am bored of my relationship but still very attached to my lady and we go to the same school, and the girl to guy ratio there is roughly 2:1 Reading some of these posts, those are good problems to have, but still sucks.  I've never been able to trust that someone would actually want to be in a relationship with me until recently. I went through all of my teen years thinking people didnt want to spend time with me too often, so i always arranged my social life in a way that i would cycle through friend groups, leaving the ones i had just seen until enough time had passed until they would want to see me again. <br><br>Just recently i realized that this is not the case and i dont have to do that if i dont want to, so it's just a matter of time until i meet someone that i would want to get into a relationship with. Though i have been on dates and have been "seeing" girls in the past.</br></br>  <br>For some reason that made me smile.</br>  <br>wonder what his problem is</br>  <br> gospel of self improvement <br>O lawd! You actually went there!</br></br>  <br>Can't pick up on/act on signals. Can only be confident with girls I've known a while. Poor self image. Overly analytical and critical internally.

Don't be offended if people arent enthralled with whatever long arduous diatribe you are not doubt going on.

I've always ignored the woman that have come onto me in the past because I say to myself "she Would find me physically unattractive if We developed our relationship further, so why bother?" I feel as though I have many things to offer in a relationship but I can't seem to get past my own denial of self worth. Many friends are kinda perplexed that someone like me has a hard time getting laid/dating with all my good features. I can't get out of this damn hole Anon.</br>  <br>porn is free, your mother was too.</br>    <br>not being an ass and its good advice but iv been trying this for a while im just impulsive</br>  Seriously, though... what is it with Tesla?<br>I don't fucking get it.</br>  I dont let them know im interested ever cause im too scared, I just make them guess till they dont care anymore  honestly i dont know how to talk to them  <br>One time I met up a cute redhead by asking her about the book she was reading. After convo, I asked if she was a library nerd. We later went to the library so she could "help me find another book to read" since I had finished my current one. Ended up getting few blow jobs and a "goodbye fuck" when we went back to our respective universities. Still chat on occasion.</br>  <br>what is wrong with bettering yourself? Is that hitting a little too close to home? Is trolling your only catharsis? You can do this anon, you can be the person you want to be.</br>  Welp, no one responded to my post... back to silently sitting on the sideline of life it is.  <br>Do you talk to guys? Its the same thing, you are just overthinking it, just talk to them like they don't have vaginas and then you wont freak them out so much.</br>  <br>generally because I have a high sex drive, have my head in the clouds, and am a shut in.</br>  <br>That advice actually helped me</br>  <br>im listening, be specific.</br>  <br>also im 5'7</br>  <br><br><br>This a real conversation I had at a college bar;<br><br> im a lifeguard <br> oh really? if i pass out tonight will you give me mouth to mouth? <br> no <br> ...oh okay <br> *she stares in silence* <br> i tell her it was nice meeting her but i'm going to go meet back up with my friends <br> wait! anon no come back <br> oh sorry, what's up? <br> nothing I just wanted to talk to you <br> can I have your number? we could talk anytime if you wanted <br> no <br> *i stare blankly* <br> then i walk away without saying anything <br>"Flirted" for a solid 15 minutes before that and my game was on point.

Can't trust anyone.  <br>Don't you dare let anyone fucking dis your hobby bro! Fish are far better than ponyfag shit!<br><br>Dutch, that makes sense.<br><br>Make a goal of only answering people's questions as briefly as possible while still being thorough in your answers. That's what I did. It forced me to relearn how I interacted with people.<br><br>Post pics of fish.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>it's all about the right setting man, at least from my personal experience. In a bar? I have NO CHANCE. But in classes or more relaxed peer oriented settings i can talk to girls no problem. <br><br>Find the setting in which you are most comfortable (will come across in the way you act)<br><br>Like i said, it's not about questions. It's about communicating thoughts. There are two good ways to go about this. <br><br>The first is by asking a question, because that's what you need to do to find out about the person. When they give you a flat answer, it is your opportunity to open the floor. ex.:<br><br>  What music do you like? <br>  Rock. <br>  Oh yeah? who are your favourites? <br>  I dunno <br>  Well i've been getting really into [band] have you ever heard of them? <br>  No/Yes <br>  I really love their style of [communicate your though] <br><br>The other thing to do, and which works really well is an opener to a question. This part is a little bullshitty, but you can tell them what you really think in a way.<br><br>Girls/people want to be seen in a certain way. So if youre talking to a girl you can say<br><br>  Where do you go to school <br>  [School] <br>  Hmmm... let me guess [lean in a little] you're in photography <br>  No, why do you say that <br>  Because you give a really artistic vibe <br><br>Then they will correct you, and you will have a conversation.<br><br>Those were just quick examples but still</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can't tell who is who.</br>  <br>you are only attracting broken and unbearable people with that kind of game anon, but If you are enjoying yourself then whos to judge? I just can't imagine spending all my time with needy girls who constantly need validation. Fucking sluts is fun though.</br>  I honestly think they do like me, I'm ust fuck all scarred or .. maybe more apathetic. I feel lonely, but it's kinda a bit like how I "tried" to get a job, I don't put in any real hard effort even figuring out how to start<br><br>Appy polly eggy, I am ambien</br></br>  <br>There's nothing wrong with becoming a better person, faggot. You're just such a fedora fag. You use fancy words to try sounding smarter. That just shows how fucking ignorant you are.</br>  <br>Working on ourselves is the premise of this thread, whyd you click Asa's hot hole anon?</br>  <br>hope when you closed the casket, you didn't cut yourself on those edges</br>  <br>keep posting fedoras and anti-intellectualizing the conversation. it wont save you.</br>  <br>They do at first because they think muscles and a cute face are great.<br>Then they figure out my self-confidence sucks if I don't know them, and they move along.<br>I have a girl now though, so it's not too much of a problem.</br></br></br>  <br>i hate those pony tards <br><br>why does every one asume i like something made for 8 year old girls im 22 for fucks sake <br><br>and before any one asks i breed these https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danio<wbr>_margaritatus</wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>SOMEBODY HELP ME WORK ON MYSELF</br></br>  <br>No wonder you're such a bitter bitch, you lost your right to live in her basement when you lost her.</br>  <br> &gt;ass and Swiss cheese <br><br>Fucking lol'd</br></br></br>  <br>the fact that you have a girl means it is even more of a problem. You need to be strong for another human now, and if you have low selfesteem then Im sure you re a jealous unbearable mess.

Always have trouble interesting myself in anything or being motivated toward anything. Smart but can't get myself to put it to practical use. Go to college having never had a date or a girlfriend, not from having tried and failed, but from never having tried. At all. Completely skipped all social aspects of high school. Depression issues at college. Realize 2nd year that I'm lonely and wish i had some source of human interaction and affection. Treading water at a "party" difficulty college now after i couldn't get myself to succeed at the high end one i got into out of HS. College is 20 min drive from parents, live with them.</br>  <br><br><br>eat complex carbs only on weight lifting days, do daily cardio, even if it just just 20 mins of walking. learn healthy recipes and eat at home, make salads, drink a ton of lemon water with every meal, eat a big salad with every meal, read about the health benefits of healthy food, look at yourself in the mirror every morning, don't cheat the "man in the glass", look that up on google, put a picture of your goal body in your room, find people who have similiar goals and hang out with them, do low impact cardio if your are too fat, think about how good you will feel about yourself when you succeed, and if you cheat its ok, just keep going and love yourself.</br></br></br>  <br>She was a lifeguard.<br><br><br><br>I just want to fuck sluts on the nights I go out, but talking to women at a bar is literally the most unbearable thing.<br><br>Another conversation I had in line to get drinks at a concert;<br><br> oh anon I love [artist]!!! <br> no way, me too. what did you think about [this song]? <br> i haven't listened to that one <br> oh, how about [this song]? <br> nope havent heard that one either <br> [this song 1, 2, 3, and 4]? <br> nope none of those either <br> so what songs do you know? <br> [one song] <br> anything else? <br> no <br> are you even really a fan? hahaha <br> *she stares blankly* <br> are you going to the signing afterwards? <br> *blank stare* <br> then she turns around <br>Chicks are butthurt man.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Let's face it, most chicks are fucking sluts  <br>you are too, we are all human worry about yourself and not others.</br>  <br>Hey, at least Im honest, and not online lying to a bunch of strangers to make myself feel better</br>  Because I'm an asshole  <br><br>that's fucking painful conversation. stop. this has to be bait.</br></br>  <br>lift weights you large sack of shit</br>  <br>everyone is depressed its ok, just have small "practice" conversations to get over the initial fear, even if it is just asking someone the time or whatever. that will give you some momentom. Most people have to live with thier parents in this economy, its ok, just focus on staying out of the house and busy during the day, study hard, work out, eat right, learn about meditation and about labeling thoughts as "thoughts", then you have more power over your neurosis.</br>  <br>I always think girls think that I am trying to fuck them just for initiating a conversation with them. There have been times when I haven't said more than five words to a girl and they have said I seem like a "player" "cheater" "not trustworthy" (these chicks have balls). I'm getting a bad rap and I don't know why. There is no fucking way they can judge me that quick unless they are going off looks alone, which is bullshit in my book.</br>  Most girls like me. The problem is I hate myself, but I still think I'm better than most people. I'm a realist, and I'm highly critical of myself and everyone around me. I always go for perfection, and as a result I'm not functional in a relationship. The few times I've been in relationships, I've known from the start it wouldn't last, but kept at it, because the sex was good. Leading to her getting hurt. As for the one girl I fell completely in love with, she didn't share my emotion, and I ended depressed for a few months.<br><br>All I want is a girl that loves me as much as I love her, but it seems I'm not capable of loving anyone who loves me.</br></br>  <br>I guess I'm pretty average looking and I'm incredibly awkward, with no confidence. Foreveralone.jpg</br>  <br>honest about what? about how you don't like a person on the internet. powerful you are.</br>  I end up getting really into a girl. We hang out and it's obvious she likes me. What I then do is look at them physically and slowly nitpick at their appearance and personality. To a point where I no longer consider them attractive/fun. I've been trying to get out of the habit but ended up doing this twice. It's quite fucked me. Plus I can be a major cunt.  <br>most girls are immediately suspicious of men, just be cool and and witty and then keep a healthy distance, they will send you the signals if they want the d.</br>  <br>Just realize that with 6 billion people in the world, you're not unique and there are a lot of people "better" than you. Go see the world bro, it will put some things into perspective</br>  <br>just focus on the stuff you like about them instead of the bad, and be self aware and realize that they are doing the same exact thing with you, analyzing your flaws with a fine tooth comb.</br>  <br>you aren't entitled to have someone love you anon, you have to earn it.</br>  this is straight autism  <br>Sorry to disappoint, but it's not. That was in line to get into a Stone Sour concert... How am I just supposed to let that go!? Girl tells me she loves Corey Taylor and can only name one song. I just wanted to talk about an artist we both enjoyed...fuck me right?</br>  <br>forrow your dreamths anon</br>  <br>caring that much about new-metal is pretty fucking pathetic, <br><br>listen to swans and boards of Canada then a girl will fuck you.</br></br></br>  <br>But what if they only know 1 song?</br>  girls love me. only when were both drunk  <br>this.</br>  <br>I've traveled my fair share. There are a handful of people I've met I truely admire, and I don't think myself special in any way. I just haven't met someone I want to spend my life with. I don't necessarily need someone perfect, as a matter of fact I'd prefer someone slightly fucked up. That way I can project my own problems onto them, and by fixing them somehow fix my own shit.<br>I just want to connect you know. More than on a physical plain</br></br>  <br>then fuck them while listening to all of soundtracks for the blind, then she will join you in the world of patritiondom.</br>  <br>It's funny though, I'm only shy about meeting people, with people I know I'm quite animated. Have a part time retail job doing customer service and have no issues talking to coworkers / customers.</br>  <br>watch the aristotle video up in the middle of the thread, they talk about having a mate whom you can admire and mutually better each other.</br>  Well, I get a lot of stares. I know I could talk to any person whatsoever with confidence and authority if need be. I'm just too damn busy getting my shit together for when I want to pull in copious amounts of bitches. I used to be ultra beta fag until a few months ago when I flipped my shit around.I used to avoid eye contact and avoid being noticed in public. Now I walk into a room and I command attention...and I bask in the gazes of wondering women...I just don't have anything to do with it all because my money's tied up in savings for a car.  <br>just treat girls like you treat anyone else, try not to think about their hot juicy hole, just ask questions and listen with sincerity.</br>  There's nobody that I'm attracted to  <br>dont buy a car that is too expensive anon, dont waste your life for a stupid machine, just get one that gets you from a to b. I suspect you still have some beta tendancies, just do a little something everyday to better yourself, i know you are working alot, all you need is 20 mins a day, meditate and learn about controlling your mind.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=upN<wbr>ONoxskiw</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>Not what I was saying at all. It just seems I've had bad luck with love this far. The only girl I've fallen in love with, didn't love me back. But on the other hand I've had girls I didn't have feelings for fall in love with me. Even if I try I can't conjure up feelings I don't have.</br>  <br>yes there is, if not then you are brainwashed by media on what a girl is, or a homo.</br>  <br> 628054594 <br>im in the same boat, the only girls who ever loved me were my friend's girlfriends, very frusterating, I can never find a girl of my own. it all boils down to becoming the person that you would want to date.</br></br>  probably because I'm slightly over weight and make rude jokes too often becuase I spend too much damn time here  Western girls dont like me(most of em). it's because I'm south east Asianfag. Plus im a bit skinnyfat with and babyfat faced I have some muscles and want to have some more. However im cursed with gyno thus I'm reluctant to grow my chest out. SEA girls only like me because I apparently look like one of their celebrities. I already have a gf tho.  <br>Can't be arsed to look, but I've read a lot of greek literature--Aristotle included. In the Nicomachean Ethics he talks about how one should seek balance, basicly find someone who fulfills you, and that you should always strive to improve yourself.</br>  I'm too conceited. Also never notice when a girl likes me so by the time people tell me it's too late.<br><br>That's pretty much it.</br></br>  <br>I was doing that at the beginning when I flipped, I replaced meditation with fixie riding, and my work's my workout. I've never had a car, learning how to drive right now. Hoping to get my car before the end of next month so I don't have to finish off highschool riding a bike. Thinking of getting back into meditation because I want to start gearing up for my next goals after getting my car.</br>  <br>why do you need a western girl? strive for ottermode, be more of a dick.</br>  <br>girls like me but i prefer guys.</br>  <br>So your a faggot who likes to be confrontational and has a superiority complex?</br>  <br>I don't need one. I was talking from experience</br>  <br>getting laid when a homo is 88% easier, see this citation.<br><br>mydick.com</br></br></br>  <br> never notice <br>Oh you do, your just to much of a pussy to do anything till she loses interest and you're in denial.</br></br>  All of these "problems" could be so easily solved yet y'all are complaining on 4chan.  <br>well that sucks, racism is bad mmkay? at least you are statistically smarter than whitey.

This is where you're going to set yourself up for where you want to be in life. You're going to start making some goals and working on achieving them. I'm not talking just goals for next year, I'm talking 5-10 years out also. After you have your goals it's time to make a plan to achieve each and every one of them. Now I'm not going to say that your plans and goals can't change, they can, but only you can change them. Don't be afraid to fail, some of the goals should be big and audacious that you think you might not be able to accomplish. This is ok also, failure is a key to success. You will learn those lessons, adapt, change course and come out stronger. Just don't keep failing the same way over and over, change your thinking, come up with a new plan and reattack. Now to reiterate<br> Read 7 Habits <br> Make Goals for next 10yrs or more <br> make plans on achieving goals <br> start attacking your plan </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They like me until we have sex.<br>Then they say that I was "too rough"<br>But most girls still come back for more rough times.</br></br></br>  <br>99% of girls want rough sex, we decended from apes for gods sake.</br>  Probably they don't like me because most girls here where I live are heterosexuals and I'm a girl. <br><br>That or I should consider hide my face under a bag.</br></br>  Reprehensible facial aesthetics.<br><br>I'm as ugly to most women as the Batemans &amp; Scott Eastwoods are good-looking</br></br>  <br>..and i care that girls like me or not because?</br>  Why should I care why girls don't like me?<br> As long as they suck shit off my dick after anal sex.</br>  <br>work out and do squats, lesbians are notorious for being large.

Maybe I'm tired of getting pulled back in after I tried so hard to escape again and again.</br>  <br>you should be spending every waking moment working on your weight problem, other than working eating whole unprocessed food and doing some walking is your prime goal, your life depends on it.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=4Ce<wbr>PP0Bab5A&amp;index=24&amp;list=PL5D7D980F2F<wbr>55D674</wbr></wbr>  [ ]<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=pSC<wbr>b32OEc2o</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Stop you sniveling you little bitch.<br> I f you want to get laid work on it.<br> If not keep crying like a baby.<br>As a wise man said.<br> Losers always talk about "if only"<br>Winners go home and fuck the prom queen.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well I am 6 foot tall.
