[ have more pics like this one??  Bumping  white&gt;yellow&gt;black&gt;black abos  <br>Scandinavian, eastern Europeans, British, welsh, Irish and Irish were all living in fucking huts when the Romans found them. The middle east and Asia had developed much faster than Europeans in the earlier ages of modern man and the nubians had a fairly advanced society for their age in 5th century. Romans also drew heavily from other cultures to help build their own society. The most advanced societies in history usually grew because they took from others and added to themselves rather simply imposing their own views and technologies on other people's.</br>  <br>how the fuck did they take photo 2000 years ago?<br>im call bullshit my main man</br></br>    <br>Its from Gladiator</br>  <br>traveled 2000 lights years away instantly then took a picture of earth with an amazing camera. fucking summerfags</br>  <br>its called eclecticism, whats so wrong about it?<br>its just another trace of superiority over others</br></br>  <br><br>This is what the city of Trier in what is now Germany looked like during the Roman occupation 1900 years ago.<br><br>Meanwhile today approximately 60-63% of Sub saharan Africa still lives in mud huts, has never seen modern vehicles, never listened to music,never witnessed a photograph,an irrigation system or crafted a wheel. The parts of sub saharan Africa that have witnessed such things are white educated and repaid that education and foreign aid budget by brutally slaughtering the whites.</br></br></br></br>    <br> 2015 in the year of our lord <br> Not making use of the small rips in time thanks to the LHC in Switzerland. <br> being this pleb </br></br></br>  <br>Those you mentioned were still advanced though. They lived perfectly within the native environment of forests,grasslands and mountains. All of those peoples went on to topple Rome and create their own dynasties.</br>  <br>You're pretty fucking retarded if you don't understand that Europe developed later because of the cold climate. The earliest civilizations were in warmer climates because you got bigger harvests and longer farming seasons.<br>On the opposite side of the scale is Africa, where the continuously warm weather allowed people to survive without farming.</br></br>  <br>actually, that would not work, the light from earth would be distorted beyond recognition</br>  <br>Silly house in the center making the avenues narrower.</br>  <br> someone doesn't know about warm climates vs cold climates. <br><br>They may have started later but they went on to rule the world and shape its destiny to this day. <br><br>From ancient Greece and Rome to the British/French/German/Spanish Empires and even the once white united states which was descended from Europe.<br><br>Pic related the world in 500BC.<br><br>Europeans(whites) are the youngest race and a world racial minority yet surpassed everyone else by centuries. Guess there really is a master race.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Bismillah-ir-rahman-ir-raheem.<br><br>Dear brothers, Islam is a superior way of life and slowly but surely, more and more people are realizing <br><br>this and coming towards the righteous path.<br><br>According to some estimates, Islam will take over as Europe's most popular religion in the next 50 years. <br><br>Brothers and sisters from all walks of life are becoming Muslims in Europe. As many of our skills are <br><br>needed in your countries, we immigrate. After seeing how pure and humble the Muslim is, many westerners <br><br>are drawn to us and marry into Islam. Alhamdulillah, so many white women have been saved from being <br><br>sexualized objects and now lead a very happy and prosperous life as Muslims. Many western men have found <br><br>peace and humility in Islam and have even found themselves journeying to the middle east to help the <br><br>Ummah. Furthermore, the Muslim male may have multiple wives and produces far more children than a <br><br>westerner. 1.6 times more to be exact.<br><br>It is clear to see what will happen, yet some of you with hatred in your hearts still resist and spread <br><br>hate. You must come to terms with the fact that western culture is no more. It is unjust, bigoted, sexist, <br><br>oppressive and violent. Western culture will be dead within our lifetime.<br><br>All I ever hear you westerners complain about is how the "liberals" are to blame for this downfall. But <br><br>part of democracy is embracing liberals. So tell me, if democracy is so superior to Islam, how come it is <br><br>aiding and facilitating the demise of your culture and civilization?<br><br>Insha'allah, you will see the light and come to Islam soon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What is the best kind of lubrication to fuck goat?  no.    <br>Half the worlds population is starving and uneducated, try to guess which half most of the Muslims are in</br>  <br> rekt <br> trips </br></br>  <br>BTFO<br>T<br>F<br>O</br></br></br></br>  <br>Those are also the parts that have been devastated by western aggression, unjust financial policies and instigation by western powers. Coincidence?<br><br>But that's typical of the westerner, loot, murder , oppress then blame the victims for it.</br></br></br>  Why is everyone falling for it ?<br>Fucking summerfriends</br>    <br>Mashala /b/rother, absolutely halal speech.</br>  <br>Germany and Japan where ruined and looted after WW2.<br>Take them 40 years to be top of the world.<br>After 200years all muslim contries are still shitholes.</br></br></br>  <br>west is secularizing, where as the east is going fanatic.<br><br>Gona be a good ole religion war<br>cept the mussies are fighting with even worse odds than last time</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>this. the muslims had their brief moment in the sun as the ottoman empire, that was their high point. It went down from there and will soon fade</br></br>  <br>Now they're literally everywhere in europe</br>  <br> Brothers and sisters from all walks of life are becoming Muslims in Europe <br><br>Nope, you just breed in your shitholes and export yourselves.</br></br></br>  <br>Islam is a death cult that is quickly on its way out. The west shouldn't have to apologize that it doesn't send its less fortunate to the guillotine. You won't be singing the same tune when the the Western Hemisphere grows tired of your third-world antics and overrules your fatwas with about 30 nukes.</br>  <br> Islamic culture is unjust, bigoted, sexist, oppressive and violent.  <br><br>Fixed that for you.</br></br></br>  <br>They were never oppressed before WW2 and never oppressed after. They were able to simply return to their former glory and move on.<br><br>Iraq was in the process of doing that but look what you pigs go and do. It is now completely destroyed.<br>It will take another 50 years from now to build up again... and that's if you violent and oppressive pigs don't ravage the region again.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Furthermore, the Muslim male may have multiple wives and produces far more children than a westerner. 1.6 times more to be exact. <br><br>So do fucking cock roaches, but I'm not about to live in a dirt mound and eat garbage.</br></br></br>    <br>wat you guys got against generic music?<br><br>if what i have read is correct "music" is only allowed if [A] its a male voice singing (no women singers) and [B] only the drum ('duff') can be used (no string or wind instruments allowed).<br><br>if true thats really boring.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2<wbr>015/03/30/being-german-becoming-mus<wbr>lim-how-german-converts-to-islam-ba<wbr>lance-their-national-identity-and-t<wbr>heir-faith/<br><br>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/a<wbr>rticle-1324039/Like-Lauren-Booth-AR<wbr>E-modern-British-career-women-conve<wbr>rting-Islam.html<br><br>Maybe it's better I don't tell you about it.

Muslims invented the condom in 1272 using the lower intestines of the goat. It wasn't until 1860 that the British modified the muslim technique by removing the intestines from the goat first.<br><br> the more you know </br></br></br></br>  <br>nobody oppressed saudi arabia. They are filthy rich and have built the most luxurious city in the world. but the common saudi is still fucking camels like 1000 years ago</br>  <br>Music is not forbidden, brother. Neither the Quran or hadith has anything that forbids it. Rather, it is seen by some Muslims as part of lewd and Haram behaviour or at least music will lead to such behavior. It is only forbidden to use music as a form of worship, as worship to Allah need not become a "pleasure". One must pray with sincerity and because he wants to, not because they are drawn to it by the "beat" of a song.<br><br>In India/Pakistan, the Sunnis enjoy Qawali, which are songs praising Muhammad. Very beautiful. The Derek Trucks band did a cover of a very famous qawali song.</br></br></br>  <br>Lol. The Saudi Royal family are Salafists who are destroying Islam. They are kept in power by the United States and Britain.<br>That is oppression. If the people could break free of their rule, Saudi Arabia would be a very different place. But the US and UK won't allow it. They need that cheap oil, even if it means supporting a corrupt and oppressive regime.</br></br>  I googled "are europeans converting to islam"<br>apparently OP isn't 100% full of shit<br><br> http://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/<wbr>2790/europeans-converting-to-islam</wbr> <br> In Britain, the number of Muslim converts recently passed the 100,000 mark, according to a survey conducted by an inter-faith group called Faith Matters. The survey revealed that nearly two thirds of the converts were women, more than 70% were white and the average age at conversion was just 27. <br> In France, an estimated 70,000 French citizens have converted to Islam in recent years, according to a report by France 3 public television. As in Britain, the majority of converts to Islam in France are young women who say they are disenchanted with materialism. <br> Conversions to Islam are also rife in Austria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Holland, Hungary, Ireland, Luxembourg, Norway (and here and here), Poland, Portugal and Spain. <br> In Italy, Ambassador Alfredo Maiolese, an Italian MP, recently became a Muslim and now dedicates his time trying to improving the image of Islam in the West. In Sweden, there are now at least 5,000 converts to Islam. <br> In Germany, at least 20,000 people have converted to Islam in recent years, according to a report by RTL television. <br><br>still these look like tiny numbers<br>e.g. 100,000 out of Britain's 64 million is ~0.0016%</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>doing an excellent job of becoming a global enemy and having their rights taken away. This is how a faith fails, they make themselves out as bad guys.</br>  <br>What's this retarded shit about you can't have dogs as indoor 'pets', but only as outside work/guard dogs? And never ever a black dog for any use because something about black dogs being evil/the devil?<br><br>That crazy shit might have flown 1400 years ago, but is kinda retarded here in modern times.</br></br></br>  <br>It just goes to show how you westerners right off things early on simply because of your prejudices. Yet after gaining some knowledge, you see that I speak truth. <br>The same thing goes for Islam. Those people gained some knowledge and they have seen the light, brother. Why haven't you?</br></br>  <br>islam is becoming a bigger religion compared to the others, but most religions (i believe islam included) are becoming smaller, atheism is rapidly growing</br>  <br><br><br>Statistics from 2012 say Christfaggotry is the fastest growing religion.<br><br>Lots of Afircunts are becoming Christfags at an incredible rate.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dogs are filthy. Only dirty western living standards allow animals that poop anywhere without burying their faeces to live together with humans.<br><br> And never ever a black dog for any use because something about black dogs being evil/the devil? <br>No, there was a time when black dogs with white spots on the eyes were to be killed. No one is sure exactly which type of dog, it is unclear from the hadith.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>So muslims kill their fellow man AND mans best friend.<br><br>Noice.</br></br></br></br>    <br><br> kek </br></br>  <br>You do realize the "best friend" is an adage created by the West. Islam does not consider filthy animals "friends", unless we're talking about certain (kuffar) white males.</br>  It's funny how not a single person has answered the question in the OP. This proves the mental inferiority of the westerner. Always resorting to hate and ad hominem to delude himself into thinking he is right.  <br><br>Considering the west dominates the globe they obviously know their stuff.</br></br>  <br> they obviously know their stuff. <br>If by "stuff", you mean how to: wage war, destroy other countries, manipulate, deceive, impose crooked financial schemes, cheat, steal, commit genocide, stifle opposition and oppress others, then yes, they know their "stuff"</br></br>  <br><br>Islam is a religion stupid enough to gain complete acceptance from brown skinned people whose brains were genetically fucked up baking in the sun over the course of many thousands of years.<br><br>Most were slaves ate dirt so now the current generations with inherited dysfunctional brains hate every other race while pretending to be obedient.<br><br>Best service these people could offer to the universe is to kill themselves with no harm to anyone else.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> Western religious sexist <br> Islam pretty much makes women slaves <br>kek</br></br></br>  <br>If you're actually a muslim then this is the worst place for you to try and spread the religion as most people here don't like us muslims/arabs/sandniggers.</br>  <br>Who fucking cares though. It's full of muslims.</br>  <br> It just goes to show how you westerners right off things early on simply because of your prejudices. <br>how does what go to show that?<br> The same thing goes for Islam. Those people gained some knowledge and they have seen the light, brother. Why haven't you? <br>what if I asked you "why haven't you seen the truth of atheism"?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shitholestans are irrelevant.</br>  Most muslims walks around not giving a shit being assholes, I've seen so many try to tell me how to live my life, if you honestly think islam will take over you must have autism.  <br>Our women are happy to be modest and obedient, yours are obese and violent feminists constantly fighting for "rights".<br><br> Islam pretty much makes women slaves <br>Where did you read this? The woman has more rights in certain situations, and less rights in others. Allah has found balance which has proven perfect and just.</br></br></br></br>  Check em  <br> islam <br> earth is flat <br> sluts cause earthquakes <br><br>kek</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>tl;dr<br><br>now go troll someone else, fuckface</br></br></br></br>  <br>You don't get to blame the west for shit that happened half a century or more in the past. The west has done nothing but provide aid and money to Africa for the past 50 years, and it is still mostly a shithole. The west has pumped vast sums of money and aid into the middle east for the last 50 years, still a shithole. The middle east is spreading into Europe, which is becoming a shithole. Western culture isn't the problem.</br>  <br> how does what go to show that? <br>Anon said "apparently OP isn't 100% full of shit" implying he had assumed I was talking nonsense before researching it and discovering otherwise.<br><br>I have investigated atheism, but I see no concrete answers in it. Only Islam makes complete sense.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Tell that to the assholes that used nerve gas against the kurds. Iraq was a shithole when we arrived and isn't much worse. Oh, and people that respond to everything with violence and threats don't get to criticize the west for being violent. Why don't you tell the people at the Dutch embassy how peaceful you are...oh wait....you burned it down. Maybe you can talk to the American embassy....no....you massacred them too.</br>  <br>So what, muslims are filthy too.<br><br><br>And muslims only know how to behead defenseless people. Keep working at it, you might be able to kill people who fight back in 500 years.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I was thinking more about cars and mobile phones and computers etc.<br><br>But your certainly right that the west kicks ass in wars.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What would you call what ISIS is doing to non-Muslim people. People in glass houses dude.</br>  <br>all true tho</br>  <br> You don't get to blame the west for shit that happened half a century or more in the past. <br>Brother, you invaded the ME 12 years ago and only left 4 years ago, completely destroying the region. Get your head out of the sand.<br><br> The west has done nothing but provide aid and money to Africa for the past 50 years, and it is still mostly a shithole. <br> nothing but <br>you forgot to include imposing horribly devastating and unethical financial policies (designed by the west), funding/support/propping up of oppressive regimes, sale of arms to oppressive regimes, unethical business deals, looting of natural resources, corruption of local officals, invasion and waging war etc.. under "nothing"</br></br></br></br></br></br>      <br>I don't necessarily agree with the invasion, but it isn't like it wasn't provoked. Depending on which region you are talking about there was a damn good reason to attack.<br>As for Africa, one, citation needed. Two, do you have any concept of how much aid the west sends to Africa?</br></br>  <br>if muslim dress code says in public men &amp; women have to always be clothed/covered x amount. and that the clothes/covering must be loose fitting, how do you do simple shit like go to the beach (or swimming pool) and go swimming?<br><br>along the same thinking how can muslim men/women compete in other assorted sports activities if they must always be in heavy loose fitting clothing/covering?</br></br></br>    Anon was so kind to post these yesterday  remember...<br>never trust a muslim, they have no honor</br>  <br><br>Sometimes i wish the tension between different muslim tribes really heated up. Some nice purging would only help, and if you do it yourself for us, so much the better.</br></br>  Guys, not a doomsayer but if you, yes you, don't do something then islam WILL win. <br><br>I propose Socialism so we can curbstone all religion to the ground once and for all.</br></br>  <br> Our women are happy to be modest and obedient <br>Most of your women are terrified to do anything other than pretend to be happy being slaves because they know the consequences. The others have Stockholm Syndrome.</br></br>  <br>His brain is stuck in the 12th Century. He probably thinks that the money was cursed by a black dog or touched by a woman or some shit..</br>  I am into bestiality so I can join islam and fuck yo ugly ninja women  <br><br>It just led to muslims killing other muslims for the most part. Why would anyone give a flying fuck?</br></br>  <br>Islamic women are much more strong than muslim men, there are a lots of runaway young muslim girls who seek help from abusive fathers and brothers.<br>If you allow them to educate in our European schools, they have a good chances of abandoning Islam.</br></br>  <br> but it isn't like it wasn't provoked. <br>Name me one Iraqi that provoked America. Tell me the location of the WMDs that were gonna be launched at the US. Name me a single act of aggression by Iraq that prompted the US to invade.<br>Brother, you'll see it is your leaders who are the warmongers.</br></br></br>  not really, but it has been the 2nd major religion in the world for quite some time, idk how long buddhism was number 1, nor christianity, but ya the latter is number 1 and may end up staying number 1, it could stay number 1 by fighting back in the way were all expecting it to do once again!  <br> Name me one Iraqi that provoked America. <br><br>Saddam.<br><br>He triggered Amercan hipsters when he gassed the Kurds.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Iraqui that provoked America <br> Iraq invasion of Q8 <br> USA having defensive alliance with Q8 <br>try harder muslim</br></br></br></br>  <br>im pretty convinced that while islam may still be growing at this moment, its not going to last and it well deffinately dissapear. <br><br>cause its retarded. you dont need religion in any form we currently have on this planet to serve God. <br><br>You can serve "God" on your own way you dont need some old book to tell you how todo that. religion is a scam. and to be honest i thiink islam is the worst one of them all.<br><br>just my 2 cents</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  bal-ir-ashillah op, good to see more of us on the boards. how did your holy ramadan go?  <br>Forgot to answer part 2.<br> Two, do you have any concept of how much aid the west sends to Africa? <br>The aid sent to Africa is minuscule compared to the Trillions extorted out. That aid is merely to decieve the world into thinking the west is helping. Take Nigeria for example, the oil reserves that the west abuses. Not a single cent goes to the people. They need to rely on natural resources in order to start building the country.</br></br></br>  <br>It went great<br>we fucked goats and beat our wives</br></br>  <br><br>They are free to at any point stop selling that oil and use it however they see fit. If they are unable or unwilling to they have only themselves to blame.</br></br>  Anyone that kills Americunts is good in my books!<br><br>C'mon the fuck Allah!</br></br>  <br><br>Our food aid does hurt countries.<br><br>But why do you consider buying oil off someone as abuse?<br>Most countries want to sell resources. Its a good tihng.<br><br>The example you picked of Nigeria is a bad one to use.They have the strongest economy in Africa precisely because of their oil.<br>They have double the GDP of the second and third place countries, South Africa and Egypt.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The superior way of life is not giving a fuck about anything you paki</br>  <br>It's simple. Separate beach areas for men and women. In the same way you have seperate change rooms for men and women in the west to do a simple thing like change clothes. Many Muslim countries do this.<br><br>Sports may be carried out as usual. Look at the Iranian Women's national football team and how they dress.</br></br></br>  <br><br>That war had already ended. In 2003, Iraq had never been aggressive at the time of American invasion. <br><br> lrn2war </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>For a little contex: Iranian womens football team in 1974.</br></br>  <br>How about you stop being so insecure about your inability to keep your wife to yourself, let them go outside and drive and have fun without wearing these shit bedsheets<br><br>The iranian women's team look like a bunch of tampons btw</br></br></br>  <br> unjust, bigoted, sexist, oppressive and violent. Western culture will be dead within our lifetime <br><br>Das good, m8<br><br>But seriously though, muslims only stay TRUE muslims if they remain surrounded by the kind of oppressive society that forces them to follow the tenets of islam. Its like christians: first they believed, then they played along because the community believed, then most of them fucked off, some of them still believed but understood the metaphorical nature of the scripture, and a scant few stayed believers and became mocked by anyone with an ounce of sense.<br><br>Muslims do what jews did, creating close knit communities where they mostly don't have to deal with other cultures because other cultures corrupted their young by being decent and enjoyable and inviting. If islam spreads, it will be diluted by free-thinking society just like every other religion and the only places that will remain full old-fashioned islam will be pits of despair and poverty</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Look at the Iranian Women's national football team and how they dress. <br><br>that's ridiculous.</br></br></br>  <br><br>http://www.salon.com/2015/04/06/big<wbr>_oils_sleazy_africa_secrets_how_ame<wbr>rican_companies_and_super_rich_expl<wbr>oit_natural_resources/</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br><br>I was talking about the Anfal genocide not the invasion of Kuwait.</br></br>  <br><br>http://www.spiegel.de/international<wbr>/spiegel/spiegel-interview-with-afr<wbr>ican-economics-expert-for-god-s-sak<wbr>e-please-stop-the-aid-a-363663.html<wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br> already ended <br>so, if you invade a country in a hurry, fast, fast, fast, USA should not respect alliances?<br>But reverse is not true, wars of 200 years ago still is a valid reason to blame westerns<br>Now I see why ISIS is so keen to Israel. Same people, same mentality.</br></br></br></br>  <br> you accept concept of modesty and ask for pragmatic answer <br> I give you simple, pragmatic answer <br> you get mad at simple answer and now have problem with concept of modesty <br><br>ah, the westerner. never ceases to find reasons to be displeased.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  Theft of Africa's wealth <br><br>What fucking wealth</br></br></br>  <br><br>Like I said, feel free to stop trading at any point. See how they like eating crude oil instad of free rice.</br></br>  <br> islam <br> no tasty alcohol <br> no tasty bacon <br> no texas hold-em/gambling <br> no modern rock/rap/alternative/blues/etc/etc music <br><br>sounds really boring, reaaalllyyy damn boring. if i cant enjoy my self, or enjoy life &amp; have any fun i cant see where your sales pitch is going to change my mind. no thanks anon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So if you were thirsty, would you drink a glass of water that was 1% h2o and 99% bleach?<br><br>Religion only makes sense if you want to feel better about being ignorant. It was literally invented by people to explain away their complete lack of understanding of why the world is the way it is.</br></br></br>  <br>Clearly bait, islams don't know computer</br>  <br> ah, the westerner. never ceases to find reasons to be displeased. <br><br>Thats the key to why western countries are really nice now.<br><br>We recognized problems, and because we wanted to make things better we fixed them.<br><br><br>Muslims on the other hand employ the phrase Insha'allah.<br>Which basically means, sit around and do nothing and hopefully god will fix everything.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Anfal genocide <br> The Anfal campaign began in 1986 and lasted until 1989 <br>You invaded in 2003.<br><br> But reverse is not true, wars of 200 years ago still is a valid reason to blame westerns <br>Now I see why ISIS is so keen to Israel. Same people, same mentality.<br><br>Who attacked you based on a war from 200 years ago? Tell me, I'd like to know. Even ISIS is only at war with the west because of the 2003 invasion and occupation.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Splitting everything by gender is neither simple or pragmatic.</br></br>  <br>kek'd<br>You right, Africa have so many resources. But if you are too lazy and stupid to use these resources...<br>Instead of buying weapons, buy some books for your childrens, they may stop to worshiping muhammed and start using these resources.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Lets face it, Europe is still getting revenge on the Mudslimes for the Umayyad Caliphates invasion of Spain in the 7th century.<br><br>The muslims started this they only have themselves to blame for the west finishing it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I resort back to my OP question. If things are so much better why are your women being raped everyday, being sexualized everyday, being oppressed and turning to feminism? <br><br> So nice <br>No thanks, we do not enjoy obese, purple-haired women shouting at our scientist for wearing a shirt and making him cry. Our scientists are busy building nuclear energy plants which you are jealous of and trying to stifle by concocting another "WMD" story.</br></br></br></br>  <br>See Kuwait.<br>see the gassing of the kurds, which proved that wmds existed there at least at one point. Furthermore we found a mobile lab early on.<br>oh, and saddam tried to have at least two us presidents assassinated, which is an act of war.<br>try again there champ.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I do not know if my muslim neighbor eat beacon, but for sure is drunk all the time.</br>  <br>Tell that to your olympic comittee, all changerooms, catholic schools, public restrooms, insurance policies etc...</br>  <br>Literally all of that is bullshit. Nigeria is the strongest economy in the region because of oil sales. And explain how the free sale of oil is abuse. Oh, and the money doesn't go to the people because the people don't own the oil, a company does. Are you a Muslim or a communist?</br>  <br><br>I do agree that we give women too much power and not enough responsibilities in the west.<br>We let the notion of equality go too far.<br><br><br>But to really see what countries are 'nice' you need to take a look at those quality of life charts.<br><br>There are some Mudslime countries on there near the top. But they are the ones who just sell oil to the west and dont do much else.

No. Lift requires air to move over and under the wing at a certain speed.  <br>thanks for the bump</br>  No because there is no air flowing past the wings to create lift.  Now you're asking the real questions  <br>If you're a pilot you would know that it is the jet engines that create propulsion, not wheels. Otherwise the plane would start loosing speed as soon as it took off.</br>  <br>What if there was a really big fan that sped up with the belt to simulate actual air speed</br>  OP here.The actual question that I ask is if the plane could gain any speed because if the plane won't move at all the plane won't lift,that's a fact.<br>So can the plane gain any speed?</br>  <br>that would work</br>  idiots<br><br>the plane's wheel isn't giving thrust, so the treadmill won't do jack shit<br><br>the exhausts from the plane's engines will propel the plane forward, and the plane will crash into the treadmill</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's another problem for another thread.</br>  <br>relative to the belt - yes<br>relative to the ground - no</br></br>  <br>Yes<br><br>Jet engines create propulsion, not wheels. Even if the conveyor belt moved in the opposite direction, the wheels would only spin faster and the plane would still move forwards.<br><br>If the wheels moved the plane forward, then the plane would start losing speed as soon as it took off.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who would win: 1000 planes vs 100 giant treadmills</br>  <br>but if the treadmill has the same speed as the plane won't the wheels keep the plane one place?</br>  <br>the panes outman the treadmills 10 to 1 the planes would win</br>  <br>But planes can't cause rubber-burn.<br>checkmate.</br></br>  <br>no<br>the airplane has to gain friction with air to lift off, and as the total accelaration of the plane is canceled by the giant treadmill, it wont be able to lift</br></br>  <br>I see your point,but if the wheels start going faster the treadmill would go faster as well.In this situation how can the plane gain speed?</br>  <br>but planes can carry nukes missiles and heavy machine guns check m9</br>  <br>then there's no point of having a treadmill<br><br>think of it like you standing on a treadmill while being pulled by a rope. the treadmill becomes useless. you just slam into the treadmill because it isn't your feet that's making you walk</br></br></br>  <br>No the plane isnt moving so the belt isnt moving</br>  <br>But the planes can't get to the tredmills because the treadmills hold them in place no matter how fast they go<br><br>checkmate</br></br></br>  <br>How retarded are you</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br><br>The premise is flawed.</br></br>  <br>assuming we are basing these combatants off the OP pic, your planes don't have nukes, they are merely regular planes.</br>  <br>Again, the wheels do not make the plane move forward. Thrust from the jet engine does. The wheels do not go faster to match the speed of the conveyor belt, they goes faster to match the forward momentum of the plane.</br>  <br>nice quads</br>  The wheels aren't connected to anything, so they would just spin freely the plane wouldn't move anywhere if the treadmill started. When the planes engines generates force there is nothing pushing against it, even if there was it would have minimal effect. The plane would take of easy mythbusters covered it in an episode  <br>It's no b8.<br>I actually want to know the answer.<br>I have 2 days since i'm trying to find an answer.</br></br></br>  The thrust of the engines is pushing against the air not against the ground. The treadmill has no effect on the forward movement of the plane because the plane is not relying on the friction between the wheels and the ground to move forward. This is a stupid question. The plane will take off.  <br>Why?</br>  <br>Do you even elementary physics? The jet engines creates thrust moving the plane forwards. Conveyor belt or ground, the plane will move forward as long as there isn't a massive amount of friction.</br>  <br>Thank's for noticing.</br>  <br>The threadmill matches the speed of the plane,not vice-versa.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>/thread</br></br></br></br></br>  yes  The question is hotly debated because it is worded deceptively, probably on purpose, probably by an EPIC SHITLORD.<br><br>The question should have been:<br><br>A plane is chained to the ground and cannot move forward or backwards, but the chains would allow the plain to rise in the air. Nothing breaks. Does the plane rise?<br><br>To which, the answer is no. Unless the "plane" is a fighter jet capable of vertical liftoff, the plane will not magically rise into the air.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>http://blog.xkcd.com/2008/09/09/the<wbr>-goddamn-airplane-on-the-goddamn-tr<wbr>eadmill/</wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Nah. Wind speed needed for lift not a fucking treadmill. All responses to this are trolls.</br>  Arfcom and Mythbusters already did this, Faggot  <br>this</br>  <br>No, because jet fuel can't melt steal beams.</br>  <br>Nah, I think the troll is that people forget that the wheels spin freely.<br><br>We tend to think of a wheel with a tire as a method of propulsion, and it seems natural that:<br> wheels-spin-forward-equals-go-forw<wbr>ard</wbr> <br>and therefore<br> wheels-go-backward-equals-go-backw<wbr>ard</wbr> <br>(especially if we aren't mechanically inclined enough to understand how a differential works)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>so what about the other 900 planes<br><br><br>planes is planes even passenger planes could be modified for combat failing that sacrifice 100 planes and 9/11 the shit out of them</br></br></br></br>  <br>OP here<br><br>The only correct answer ITT</br></br></br>  <br>that's great, but the spirit of the question is why there is so much confusion.<br><br>Mythbusters did a video on this but they failed to address my version of the question in a way that would satisfy everyone.<br><br>The spirit of the question is "if the plane were locked in place horizontally, would it still fly?" to which the answer is no. All they would have to have done is say "of course it won't lift in that case, moving through the air is how the lift is generated, but the literal question is about the mechanics of a treadmill acting on a plane, which would have no effect."</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>See <br><br>tl;dr If the plane was locked horizontally (as in the conveyeor belt was programmed to match the actual speed of the airplane [not the speed of its wheels]), it would not fly, but it could never stay still either because infinity</br></br></br>  Mythbusters tested this and the aircraft successfully took off without any problems<br><br>They used a small recreational aircraft and pulled a giant plastic sheet</br></br>  OP here,I'm not convinced.  OP here<br><br>Disregard , I suck cocks</br></br>  <br>that's what I just said</br>  <br><br>yep. that post explains it very well.<br><br>If the treadmill is constantly speeding up to match the speed of the airplane, the thrust of the airplane's engines will never actually move it. <br><br>It's impossible for this to occur, in any practical sense. A mechanical failure would eventually allow either the plane or the treadmill to 'win' the battle.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>True OP has dubs.</br>  <br> as in the conveyeor belt was programmed to match the actual speed of the airplane [not the speed of its wheels]) <br>What part of "the treadmill matches the speed of the plane" you don't get?</br></br>  <br>see<br/></br>  <br>Not exactly,<br><br>What you're saying that if it is locked (as in chains allowing vertical movement bot not horizontal), then it won't fly because it needs air to flow under the wing in order to fly.<br><br>What I'm saying is that this magical conveyor belt that matches the actual speed of the airplane (and not the speed of the wheels) is nonsensical because you will have a problem because the conveyor belt would spin to infinity.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Under this scenario, no it cannot.<br><br>This scenario is also mechanically impossible.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>See </br></br>  <br> It's impossible for this to occur, in any practical sense. <br>It's impossible for this to occur even without mechanical problems, because a still-standing plane would mean a conveyor belt spinning infinitely fast.</br></br>  <br>no.</br>  <br>Those are the conditions,you faggot.You can't change or manipulate the conditions.</br>  <br> because a still-standing plane would mean a conveyor belt spinning infinitely fast <br><br>Explain this like i'm 5.</br></br></br>  <br>What conditions are you talking about and how am I changing them?<br><br>See </br></br></br>  Sure someone has already answered but the thing is velocity rather than speed; it the plane isn't moving forward, it won't get air under it's wings to achieve any lift.  <br>Aircraft engineer here, the answer is no</br>  https://<span>youtu.be/YORCk1BN7QY  [ ]  <br>He didn't say anything about how it was being propelled, he simply stated that in this situation, not airflow means no lift.</br>  <br>Jet engines create forward thrust which the conveyor belt needs to compensate for. This forward thrust accelerates, so the conveyor belt needs to accelerate as well in order to match this and keep the plane staying still. This means that very quickly will the conveyor belt need to accelerate to "infinitely fast" in order to keep the plane staying still .</br>  <br>No airplane ever is propelled by its wheels.</br>  Conveyor belt has almost no effect, because the wheels roll freely.  <br><br>Ah. <br><br>The acceleration is what is infinite. I think i understand that.</br></br></br></br>  <br> velocity rather than speed <br>They're the same thing<br><br> it the plane isn't moving forward, it won't get air under it's wings to achieve any lift. <br>If the wheels roll freely, nothing is stopping the plane from moving forward. Jet engines push air, thrusting the plane forward.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>This literally has nothing to do with anything. Nobody thinks the wheels propel it.</br></br>  There is a faggot OP on an image board.<br>He poses a question that nobody cares about<br>Will anons waste their time ITT?</br></br>  <br>Then nothing is hindering the plane from moving forward.</br>  <br>like this ?</br>  <br>you're a fucking idiot. he never said it's the wheels that cause it to move<br><br>christ</br></br></br>  <br><br>This is a retarded question though.</br></br>  <br>This man speaks the truth.<br><br>Also I think that the "velocity rather than speed" anon meant "magnitude", not "velocity" though</br></br></br>  Nigger why are you giving us summer school questions do you not have porn or youtube?  <br>how about the wheels?</br>  No, air needs to move past the wing generating lift, no air would move if the plain was stationary. Fucking faggot with your gay ass riddles.  <br>What about them? The axle moves forward relative to the ground, so the wheels just spin faster.</br>  Pilot here.<br><br><br>No. Long story short what makes planes fly is relative wind, It's not about how fast it goes but how fast wind goes through its wing. Therefore in this scenario, the plane would just keep moving forward like a car.<br><br>Picture sort of related.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The belt allways matches the speed of the plane. <br>What part don't you understand?</br></br>  <br><br>This is just gibberish.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Pilot and aircraft cable monkeys confirmed for not understanding physics.</br></br></br>  <br>the belt goes faster too then.</br>  <br>What if the conveyor belt is travelling in the same direction as the plane? </br>  <br>THis is correct. small planes such as Cessna's have gone airborn (and crashed) during heavy winds whilst just parked on the tarmac</br>  <br>Since when can planes go infinitely fast?</br>  <br><br>The conveyor belt is.</br></br>  <br>Then the belt needs spin infinitely fast.<br><br>See <br><br/></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's not the case here.</br>  <br>Duh.</br>  <br>see <br/></br>  <br><br>No it doesn't. It needs to match the speed the plane would be going. The plane doesn't go infinitely fast.</br></br>  New NZ thread<br><br>P A R T Y P A R T Y edition</br></br>  <br>chch fag reporting back in</br>  drew a duck  snapchat me godsgiven  <br>checked<br>Also I liek your duck</br></br>    <br>checked<br><br>hi friendz &lt;3</br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=pLj<wbr>xHHhcAGk</wbr>  [ ]  <br>best flag ever btw</br>  <br>Auckland says Hi</br>  <br>checking your check</br>  Warkworth here.  <br>checking right back</br>  Any southlanders here?  <br>thanks for checking</br>  Craig's mom here. is Molly around?
