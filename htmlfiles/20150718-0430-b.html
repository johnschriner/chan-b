Why don't you just get fucked ya cunt  <br>Stop leeching our hard earned tax money and earn a living you sadbrained fuck.</br>  Have a cry cunt  Because meth.  <br>I have a buddy who works for centrelink</br>  <br>Ahhh fuck em. Just let them work for the dole getting paid peanuts for doing the same job as as someone earning a real wage, see the look of despair in there eyes.</br>  Why get a job when the government pays you to stay home and smoke weed all day?  I like my free time to much  <br>And spending free cash that you provide for me</br>  <br>I got one, Kek I work for centrewank</br>  Too busy being champion of Australia and eating raw onions  <br>Because I'm studying and I can't find part time job, I have been sending applications to various places with no luck so far, hmm</br>  <br>Got one. Pay more in tax than many people earn too, you entitled mooching cunts.</br>  <br>FUKIN STRAAAAAYA FUCK YEAH BEST FUCKIN CUNTRY IN THE FUCKIN WORLD YOUSE FUCKIN POOFTERS!!!</br>  <br>Thought about training as helicopter pilot, apparently they are needed desperately to get politicians to their fundraising events</br>  <br>hey, can you set me up with the dole? i need to go on it</br>  Hi, I'm seeking work at the moment, I finished year 12 last year. Can somebody tell me how the fuck to actually get a job? i've been trying maccas, hungries, bunnings, mitre10, ikea, kmart, coles and not one of these fucking places have called me in for an interview. I am genuinely keen to work, I make up cover letters for most applications and everything. Why the fuck can't I get a job? should I go to TAFE or UNI instead? would that help me get a job? I feel hopeless...  <br>  i payed 49k tax last year <br>  mfw i payed for some nigger to sit at home and do fucking nothing for the whole year </br></br>  <br>quit projecting</br>  <br>For the lower, shitty jobs youre looking for you pretty much need to have an in. Ask your dad if his friends need workers or ask your friends to ask at their work.<br>Dont apply online if you have the option of going in person</br></br>  <br>kek<br>I was thinking of joining the AFP, apparently they need people to investigate Politicians mooching our tax.</br></br>  <br>Make up references and past work experience you dumb fuck, have your parents as references for fake jobs, make sure you change the last name on your resume...show up in person, nobody checks emailed resumes. What state you in? apply at labour hire jobs after you get a white card.</br>  just move to mosman you dumb cunts lmao  Faggot.  <br>Go to any local businesses, ask to see the manager and hand in a resume. Don't bother with shitty fast food or retail stores. Go for a workshop or tradesman assistant job. Dress decently but not fancy (no board shorts or hoodies) and try you best not to be a cockgobbling 18 year old. You'll get looked down upon by everyone else as a useless idiot who is an arrogant shit. Rather than getting pissy at that you just have to accept it because it's actually true.<br><br>From there you can decide if you like the trades or wanna try uni.</br></br></br>  <br>I have real references and I have 2 difference places for work experiences on my resume, fake jobs sounds like a bad idea, how do i prove anything? I live in South Australia, and I have a white card<br><br><br>I've tried to apply to a number of jobs irl cos I thought that would be a better approach, but they just say "sorry you need to apply online" so what the fuck hey</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hi mate, not the guy you replied to but I'm a current TAFE student looking for part time work, what sort of stuff do you think I should do to get part time work? I'm not sure where to go for like 2 days a week of work and maybe 1 day weekend work, any advice? thanks</br>  <br> be manager <br> people waste my time by forcing their resume onto me <br> at least I get to bounce their resume off the rim of the bin. <br><br>Suck a dick faggots. No regrets.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Baby boomers take many of the good jobs (they need to die/retire and make room for younger people), many jobs are outsourced to India and China (manufacturing, IT), and lots of immigrants compete with citizens for low wage scraps.</br>  <br>I can tell you from experience that 75% of places that you try hand a resume into will tell you to apply online. The ones that like you will still take your resume and tell you to also apply online to get into both pools.<br>Just keep trying anon. In the meantime have other sources of income. It's very easy in aus.</br></br>  <br>hi bro, cheers for the reply. Could you elaborate on what you meant by "other sources of income"</br>  <br>Part time work is crappy stuff. You're looking at either retail or labouring for a builder or something equally shit. In that case your option are walking through your local shopping centre handing out resumes or signing up at labour hire companies. Try and find something that your studies will complement.<br><br><br>How do you source employees?</br></br></br></br>  <br>If u desperately need money, u can always try selling panadol tablets to kids at underage raves as esctasy or some shit. Use a stencil and a hobby knife or something to make a cool mark on each one and say they are top shit. Easy money!</br>  I am 34 years old and never worked a day in my life. I just fucking laugh at the thought of trying to get a job now.  <br>this<br><br>shits fucked and its only going to get worse.</br></br></br>  <br>Cash in hand trade work. Hobby work (fixing pcs). Selling drugs etc. There's literally endless ideas for making money other than a literal job. <br>Try find one that'll work for you even when you finally get a job.</br></br>  <br>so you've been on the dole/disability pension your whole life?</br>  <br>do tell ya story man</br>  <br>I just survive off other people</br>  <br>seek.com.au<br><br>Only consider applicants with at least three years paid experience.</br></br></br>  Fuckin pissed off because I had to sign up to centrelink so my wife could get paid parental leave. Not sure why I had to hand my details over to these cunts, surely single women get paid parental leave aswell. I'm not getting any money from them, it's the missus taking the leave. <br><br>30yo and worked full time since leaving school managed to avoided these cunts up until now! <br><br>Their website is bloody terrible.</br></br></br></br>  <br>pathetic</br>  If anyone wants some work, mind you anyone who cant find anything else, apply for the green army. I think its $11 an hour and you still get some centrelink to help you out. I couldnt find a job anywhere so im doing this now while im waiting to move....  <br>Where do you work?</br>  <br>website? you should try their 'express' app kek.</br>  <br>I feel sorry for you people, must have no self worth what so ever. <br><br>Hope you never breed, kid will have no chance in life with you as an example</br></br></br>  educate yourselves, cunts<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=dda<wbr>SYKhXBdM</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Processing plant in Perth</br>  <br>He's probably the "manager" of a McDonalds or something shit.</br>  <br>Didn't know they had an app, but hoping I never have to use it.. <br><br>Hoping paid parental leave is pretty straight forward, surely they can't fuck that up.</br></br></br>  <br>why does it bother you if i have self worth or not?</br>  <br>go to a uni open day<br> look at degrees &gt;pick one <br> choose a science degree (cause arts degrees are for hipster faggots and have 0% job prospects) <br> anything engineering, chemistry, health or environmental science <br> study your dick off <br> get a graduate job before finishing uni <br> climb the ladder <br> be earning 100k by the time you're 30 <br> profit? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Entry Level Position, $18 an hour <br> Must have 3 years paid experience <br> Must have bachelor's degree <br> Baby boomer gets it anyway <br><br>Need a job to get experience, need experience to get a job!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What's your salary?</br>  <br> Type in 4 digit Login Code <br> "Processing" <br> 5 Mins Later <br> Select whatever option you need to do, view letters, report earnings,etc. <br> Repeat Processing EVERY SINGLE FUCKING OPTION. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh, "get a job?"

Yes it fucking sucks not working. Not that anyone enjoys work, it's having no money to do shit. But the best advice I can give you? Do whatever the fuck you want. Try to consider it a holiday. You want to sleep in? Do it. You want to have a tv marathon all night? Do it. Why the fuck not? You'll be working until you're 70 anyway, have a fucking blast now.  <br>Paid experience in general or the field you're working?<br><br>I'm assuming it's the latter.</br></br></br>  <br>eh, not bad for an office job I guess.</br>  <br> living rural, nothing going for me in life <br> feeling unhappy <br> call beyondblue <br> 5 minutes in I hang up because I'm shit at talking on the phone <br> 20 minutes later a police officer shows up at my place unannounced <br> sits down and talks to me about why he is here <br> [...] <br> "Why don't you just get your license and a job?" <br><br>True story. Kept trying to take me to a mental hospital but I was not doing that shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>not if you kill yourself. then you dont have to worry about anything anymore.</br>  <br>valid point</br>  <br>I couldn't give a fuck, still feel sorry for you though. <br><br>Every man needs self worth, somthing to be proud of. If you don't have that, what's the point in living?</br></br></br>  <br>That was kind of the officer tbh, didn't realise they visited people with depression.</br>  <br>I've got a buddy who is going to turn out like you... I feel sorry for him because people often have a hostile attitude towards him but he actually does have problems that prevent him from getting work.</br>  <br>That's pretty cool of the cops to show up and actually care. Thumbs up to them!</br>  <br> have experiance <br> years experiance <br> "oh sorry derp we're looking for someone we dont have to train " <br>What the fuck?
