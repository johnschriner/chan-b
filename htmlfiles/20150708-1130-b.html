It just started growing on my foot these past couple days. Im in Florida so no doc available for now.  <br>Fungus or wart</br>  plantar wart(s)  <br>Looks like you probably got bit by a spider or something man</br>  Likely plantar wart, partially beneath callus layer.  there are no doctors in florida?<br><br>kinda looks like a plantar's wart to me.</br></br>  <br><br>Thank you. Best way to remove it? I figured it was athletes foot since I was sweating more than a fat chicks under boob.</br></br>  That is a ball growing on your foot...how do you even walk?  <br>It wasnt a huge deal until today. It looked like a pimple at first and then today it started feeling uncomfortable</br>  <br>try the freeze stuff first, you can buy it in stores. thats fastest and easiest but doesn't always work</br>  <br><br>Looks like a plantar wart. I got rid of mine my scraping the dead skin of the top and plucking all the dead skin in it out.</br></br>  <br>What if I pop it? Looks like pus towards the right of it</br>  <br>you better stream that shit m8</br>  <br>i had one and i just used nail clippers to cut it out like 3 mm deep and it went away</br>  <br>you really need to see a doctor / podiatrist <br><br>assuming it is a wart and not say an advanced foot fungus might leave you with some very painful holes courtesy of consumer based solutions to plantar</br></br></br>  <br>its probably pushing against the skin and causing a blister. you need to get the root out of they just keep growing and coming back.</br>  <br>I dont think its that serious. I feel like it mightve been the florida water or some shit. I had a cut on my foot and i read the virus enters that way. I go to take a shower and the water is green lol last time i vacation here</br>  i just spent 10 minutes watching plantar wart removal on youtube<br><br>intredasting stuff</br></br>  Plantar wart. Had similiar once. Simple freezing procedure a few times and thats it.  <br>it's aids</br>  Ebola . Get quarantined  <br>thats how people get flesh eating bacteria</br>  <br>That my friend is a plantar wart. Looks like that one may need surgery to remove. It can be quite painful. (the wart, not the surgery.)</br>  <br>stigmata</br>  <br>Here's what you should do. Rub a ton of lotion on that, and a day later, use something to scrape the dead skin off. <br>Rub more lotion, then use tweezers to pull the dead skin out.</br></br>  <br>damn, now i want a wart</br>  <br><br>Seriously though it's melanoma. You might want to get a biopsy unless you're done living of course. Good luck.</br></br>  <br>You're a fucking idiot he's not going to get melanoma on the bottom of his foot. It looks more like an infection. You fuck.</br>  <br>Black salve ebay</br>  you stepped on a wad of gum. try washing your feet you nasty fuck.  <br>probably canceraids, cant say for sure until after the amputation. im a dcotor.</br>  <br>Dude that shit looks infected. o to a doctor or it will keep spreading. Would you rather <br><br>A: Pay to treat it.<br>B: Pay to have it cut off.<br>or<br>C: Die like a faggot.<br><br>Your game.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Im liking these dubs. Very subtle</br></br></br></br>  <br>did you see the episode of House where the fat nigger got skin cancer between his toes? it happens friend!</br>  <br>Possible from wearing sandals. But this shit is on the bottom of his foot where the sun doesnt shine unless he goes spread eagle on a beach erry der</br>  <br>Actually, though I agree that it is not melanoma, it's more like that he would get it on the bottom of his foot than anywhere else, especially if he's in Florida, chilling at the beach. <br>The bottom of the foot doesn't get as much sun as the rest of the body so it's more prone to getting melanoma after a large bought of exposure to the sun.. Just saying.. <br><br>It's a player wart though.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>does actually look like cancer.<br><br>if it keeps growing get your ass to a doctor<br><br> i'm only serious </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I have this right now and I'm treating it. I got it lasered twice but it always came back so now I'm using Guttaplast patches for 2 days, then remove and take a salt bath (on your foot), rub the dead tissue off with a pumice stone, apply duofilm, shower, put Guttaplast patches back on. Do this for 2 weeks.

You described yourself in such a wierd way I got curious</br>  <br>food place(not mcdonalds) while going to school, that's all i wanna say.</br>  <br>Afraid of your friends smoking you out?</br>    <br>how old are you? Surely you want to feel like my girls do, with the arse filled with warm cum rite?</br>  <br>It's not like an awakening or becoming someone different. You're still you. That said, I have noticed I've been happier lately and more "perky" I guess for the lack of a better term. I just feel like I have less emotional stress wearing me out and so I can be more friendly and outgoing.<br><br>But again I don't feel like my personality changed, it's more like I was always this way but my natural hormones were holding part of me back.</br></br></br>  are you kidding me you little piece of shit i’ll have you know i graduated top of my politics class and i’ve been involved in privilege checking with over 150 confirmed political demonstrations i’m trained in conflict resolution and i was the most oppressed person in my entire upper middle class high school you are nothing to me but another cultural appropriator i will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which have never been seen on this side of the 49th parallel mark my words you think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the internet think again fucker, as we speak i’m checking with my anarcho-communist analyst brigade for your location so you better be prepared to deal with some molotov cocktails and angry feminists flying through your window yOU’RE FUCKING DEAD CHERRY<br>i can be anywhere at any time and i can kill you in over seven hundred ways and that’s just with me boring you to death while i talk about privilege not only am i extensively trained in hotline management but i have access to an entire arsenal of sociological articles to prove my point and i will use them to wipe your fucking face off the earth you little shit if only you had known what oppressed retribution your cultural appropriation would unleash then maybe you would have held your fucking tongue but you couldn’t you’re fucking dead kiddo</br>  <br>not really, just dont want someone i know to coincidentally find a picture of me on the internet wearing panties and makeup showing my ass like a slut and post it on my mom's facebook or something.<br><br>ya never know...</br></br></br>  <br>Sorry, "transplant"</br>  <br>have you noticed any physical changes after just a month?</br>  <br>tumblr detected</br>  New YLYL thread since the other ones are garbage tier.  <br>source?</br>  <br>FUCKING 9GAG</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=oCe<wbr>Z7p0g5_A&amp;feature=youtu.be</wbr>  [ ]  Dubs decides    <br>winrar</br>  <br>winnarar</br>  H/D/fur thread        Hey /b/ros. I'm going to develop an indie horror game on UE4 and need plot of some sort. Not slender-like shit, more facts-based (or literature based eg. Lovecraft, Poe etc.). Do you have any ideas?  Whatever you do, don't put in TOTALLY SPOOKY BLOOD everywhere. That shit is fucking lame. You can have blood, but don't cover everything with it for no reason.<br>Also, sounds like this is a game that should focus on atmosphere, specifically a feeling of uneasiness, so make things weird. Maybe start it out with a guy going through his normal routine but strange things keep happening?</br>  <br>There isn't much to do thou. After a while of wander around the ocean without doing anything but running you'll be bored as hell. Trow some little objectives and a big one. Like sea buoys and an island at the end.</br>  The game starts with a plane commercial-plane crash in the amazon jungle. The character survives and climbs out of the wreckage into a stormy night surrounded by deep jungle. He then encounters a sort of stone-building which he seeks shelter in (because the weather is so bad). He is curious about this building and the markings on the wall, so he enters further... further and further into the depths of this building. <br><br><br>So the game is basically about all the crazy shit he discovers (fucked up creatures, bizzare paintings and strange noises etc). The game shouldn't contain too many jump scares, but be a real psychological horror game which builds on old Incan myths and shit. <br><br>That would be a cool game!</br></br></br></br></br>  SCOTLAND THREAD <br><br>WHERE ALL YE BAWBAGS FROM? <br><br>South Lanarkshire maself</br></br></br></br>  <br>Posh cunt.</br>  <br>Posh radge</br>  <br>Was I tripping or is there a restaurant in Clydebank that's on a boat near the cinema?</br>  Any Vets out there just wanna talk? I've been out for 4 months and getting used to my actual family instead of my military family. I felt like I was closer to those assholes than I ever was with anyone of blood relation. I miss those fuckers.  <br>Are you a radio operator? I don't want second hand knowledge, I want a guy who actually has been in there. If I don't care too much for it I'll hopefully be able to request a change into 68W</br>  <br>I'm on the ass end of my enlistment and it couldn't come sooner. I'm angry as fuck all day and a lonely faggot because all of my pals EAS'd or are deployed. Pretty much sit in my room all day and be a bitter faggot and pray that everything goes smoothly until then.</br>  Sounds like a good plan, special forces, politics, possibly President.
