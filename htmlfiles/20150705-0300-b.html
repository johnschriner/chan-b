Where were the horny teachers at when I was in skewl  <br><br>She fucked niggers. To hell with her.</br></br>  Should have gotten the death penalty.  <br>Fucking your mates bro</br>  <br><br>Agreed.</br></br>  Would of loved to see the 17 year olds in court, 'she had sex with me and it was awful and i will never forget it' what is america a country full of faggots or somthing jesus  LAKELAND POLICE-Commitment to Sexellence  <br><br>Good, hope she rots. Who knows what kind of mental harm this could cause in those kids later in life, some might not even know their sexuality at this stage and discover they're gay later in life.<br><br>No surprises a typical Britbong pedo would be in her defending her for preying on children. <br><br>Yeah, wait and America will follow YOUR fucking lead on tackling child abuse, you sick fucks.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I've seen a fucked up story where the court went after the male victim. The teacher later tried to get alimony cuz the kid got her pregnant. Maybe the judge saw that article.</br>  <br>What part of STUDENT-TEACHER don't you get?<br><br>This is abuse of power with those under your care. Keep focusing on age like a retard.</br></br></br>  <br><br>You are a bunch of pussies are you saying if your reasonably hot teacher fucked you at 17 she would deserve 22 years in jail for it?</br></br>  <br>Did she not violate her professional relationship with her student?<br><br>YOU DON'T FUCK YOUR STUDENTS.<br><br>IF it's not acceptable for men to do it it shouldn't be for females.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I understand that fag, I just think giving her the same sentence a murderer is fucking ridiculous, she deserves 2-3 years max.</br>  The fuck?? She's banging two other boys? She said we were going to get married.  <br>found the story read this.<br>http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/<wbr>nation/2014/09/02/statutory-rape-vi<wbr>ctim-child-support/14953965/</wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>BUT 22 YEARS IS WORSE THAN SOME ACTUAL PEDOS AND RAPISTS GET YOU IDIOT, I UNDERSTAND SHE DID WRONG BUT 22 YEARS IS A FUCKING JOKE<br><br>cruise control off</br></br></br>  <br> 22 years <br> Murder <br><br>You'd be lucky to get a life sentence here in the US. Chances are you'd be executed.<br><br>Only reason people get less than that for murder charges is because they made a plea bargain.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 17 <br> children <br>your point still stands but... really, nigga?</br></br></br>  <br> if this is was in England it would be totally legal <br><br>Actually, no, it wouldn't be at all, lol. It's illegal in England if you're in a position of authority (such as teacher) to bang people under 18. <br><br>Even though the age of consent is 16.</br></br></br></br></br>  I live in the UK and a teacher fucked a 17 year old at my school, you guys know what happened? She got fired and struck off the teacher register, a very fair punishment IMO.  <br><br>Actually in the UK the teacher would have still been prosecuted for abusing their position of power.<br><br>Of course if it was a man doing that he would rot for a long time where as a woman might not even receive a custodial sentence.</br></br></br></br>  shut up britbong if this was england she would be in jail for failing to renew her tv license  she also had an incident with an 8th grader (13-14 years old for non murricans) and she had to resign and move  <br> Chances are you'd be executed. <br>Nope.<br><br>If you include manslaughter, the average person convicted of killing someone in the U.S. gets less than a year in jail.</br></br></br></br>  <br> she would be in jail for failing to renew her tv license <br><br>Top fucking kek, and true. Britbongistan is a fucking joke.</br></br></br>  <br>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA</br>  <br><br> thinks his state is the entire US. <br><br>c'mon buddy try harder than that</br></br></br></br>  <br> falling for such obvious bait <br><br>Nigga is you retarded</br></br></br>    <br>that is so fucking untrue. You're not even throwing random statistics around, you are just making preposterous bullshit up.</br>   used up Stacy becomes a teacher <br> cucks her betabux for 17 year old Chads and Tyrones <br><br>She deserves to rot in prison.</br></br></br>  <br>That shits fucked up. I was living over there for 2 years. Had no tv or license. Watched shit on youtube at the library with headphones. Library security guy sitting behind me waiting for me to watch something live so he can get me in trouble with tv licensing...... <br><br>pretty fucked up.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe...</br>  <br>The only people who get done for not having a licence are people fucking stupid enough to let the person come into their house. The licence company has no rights whatsoever other than to send you letters and occasionally maybe a knock on the door.</br>  <br>What? What? What? She asked for it, and got it. Serves her good.</br>  Why are so many /b/ags of shit complaining...? <br><br>She did nothing wrong. <br><br><br>Unless the 17 yr olds were niggers then she Dunn fucked up.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm shocked honestly. Normally women in this situation get a slap on the wrist while a man would get the maximum. Its retarded that it's illegal for her to fuck 17 year olds but it's not to see her not getting punished different since she's a woman.</br>  If I was a 7 year old kid I would have jumped at the chance to get a blowjob off a hot female teacher and stick my dick in her wet pussy. <br><br>Don't see what all the fuss is about, if it's consensual there isn't a problem, to me.</br></br>  Ahhhh comoooon 22 years? That's pretty long for fucking 3 people who knew entirely what they were doing  <br>She should have been quicker and accuse the boys of rape</br>  <br>This. Holy fuck, so much THIS.</br>  <br> 22 <br>GOOD!</br></br>  <br><br>Meanwhile niggers in USA raping and murdering.</br></br>  <br>At least she got dubs.</br>  <br>7 year old? ;-;</br>  <br> you are just making preposterous bullshit up. <br>Nope<br> http://criminal.findlaw.com/crimin<wbr>al-charges/involuntary-manslaughter<wbr>-penalties-and-sentencing.html</wbr></wbr> <br> http://www.attorneys.com/homicide/<wbr>jail-time-for-types-of-manslaughter<wbr>/</wbr></wbr> </br></br></br></br>  She should lose her job, but this shouldn't be crime.  <br>/thread</br>  <br> f this is was in England it would be totally legal apart from her getting fired. <br><br>She was in a position of responsibility you fuck.<br><br>She would have got time.</br></br></br></br></br>  I converted a PC to linux and ran the numbers overnight.<br>Given 6 inches numerical average for erect.<br>She got 1.2 years for each inch of dick.</br></br>  <br>I call bullshit. Age of consent is 17</br>  <br>if anything fucked me they should get 22 years</br>  <br>kek'd<br><br> they wanted alpha's not neckbeards like yourself </br></br></br>  Merica is lame AF and i live here. PLEASe kill me I'm a faggot.  <br>prisons in america are privatized so the more prisoners they have, the more money they make.<br><br>This is why there are so many jailable drug offences.</br></br></br>  <br>For statutory rape is can be 16 or 17 but the other person has to be a certain number of years older and if it passes that number, they get dubs and go to prison for 22 years.</br>  <br><br>22 years dipshit... its longer than the time you have been on this planet. Murica is fucking retarded religious cunts....</br></br>  The USA is soooo fucking fucked up  <br>KEK</br>  <br>I googled this thinking it was a joke.. The UK is fucking retarded.</br>  <br> 22 YEARS for that I mean are you fucking kidding me?? <br><br>men have got similar sentences. take your fake outrage and disbelief back to tumblr, whore.</br></br></br>  <br>Underated post.</br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br><br>Kek. So they can KINDA consent, but not to person at this arbitrary cut-off line. <br><br>Makes total sense.<br><br>5-8yo for sexual activity, 12-15yo for full intercourse. Let's see some fucking sense people regarding age of consent. Humans are sexual creatures, it's an important part of growing up.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Doesn't change the fuck that your country is fucking retarded for requiring a tv license.</br>  <br><br>its legal to have sex with someone the age of 16 where i live... even if you are 50 years old. <br><br>22 years for a 30 year old fucking a 17 year is fucking insane.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah but women are dumb as fuck and easy to manipulate so it's different you fucking fag</br>  <br><br>Yeah, it totally fucks up their TV market as well, with commercials struggling to even compete with the BBC, which apparently s pretty lackluster considering the kind of stable funding it's guaranteed year-in, year-out.</br></br>  <br>Doesn't change the fact that you are retarded</br>  <br><br>Look at the text on that police logo, ''Commitment to Excellence'' lmao.</br></br>  <br>U get less for murder</br>  You can fuck 14 years old in my country if they want it.<br><br>You are pathetic,murrikans,poor teacher</br></br>  <br>Go drink your tea and suck the queens cock britbong.</br>  <br><br>Its becuase of all the religious fags sucking jesus his cock all day. They are jealous.</br></br>  <br><br>Murder can be justifiable, rape cannot.</br></br>  <br><br>Equality<br><br>Same thing a man would have gotten but he would get shanked in prison</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Only, it was not rape... dumb cunt.</br></br>  <br> Would of <br> run-on sentence <br> incoming excuse about how he doesn't give a fuck about 'grammer' </br></br></br>  <br>Except it wasn't rape.<br>They're 17 they are most 12 months away from being allowed to star in porn. How can you still class them as children...I'd they were 12 then yeah, arrest the bitch. But come on.</br></br>  <br><br>nobody gives a damn.</br></br>  <br>says the country with a massive violence problem, racial problems, equality problems, fast food problems. <br><br>Lead away, we are sure as hell not going to follow you.</br></br></br>  <br>Yep you fucking liar, you said<br>"If you include manslaughter" and then you cite cases ONLY involving manslaughter, including involuntary, which is a pretty fucking far cry from Murder 1, you lying ass cunt.</br></br>  <br>So 22 years in prison is a suitable punishment for sleeping with 2 students just shy of 18.<br>America doesn't treat criminals<br>It creates them</br></br></br>  <br>lol</br>  <br> sees someone who gives a damn <br> gives a damn about that person giving a damn <br> feels compelled to point out that no one gives a damn </br></br></br>  Yes, but was the student white?  <br>It's like you've came straight from the 1700's<br>22 years in prison for this. Brilliant, now when she comes out she's gonna be a programmed criminal.<br>Backwards America at it again.</br></br></br>  <br>lol rekt</br>  <br>and your a nigger!</br>  <br><br>And why do you give a damn? Do you always complain about grammar on the internet? You must be a very busy man. Get over it faggot.</br></br>  <br>Kek I live in Jew York where the age of consent is 17</br>  <br>At least one was a nig nog.</br>  <br> implying she'll serve even half of that <br>She'll be out in 5. No bullshit.</br></br>  <br><br>At least shes a woman so she wont have such a hard time in prison.<br><br>A man found guilty of the same crime is essentially being sentenced to 22 years of being raped.</br></br></br></br>  <br> who knows what kind of mental harm this could cause <br>Add 1 year on<br> oh well, they're two consenting adults </br></br></br>  <br> implies educating kids on grammar is a waste of time <br> wastes time trying to stop people from educating others <br>How delightfully vulgar.</br></br></br>  americas prison system is fucked up. This crime should give 2-5 years or so, max.    <br>kek'd hard</br>  <br>Oh nice, you're starting to get it. Laws can be confusing, I know.</br>  <br>Source, please.<br><br>And if so, guess it's better she rot than be allowed to give other teachers the wrong idea.<br><br>Teachers, do not fuck your black students. For your safety and the safety of the non-black students you fuck.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He knows what's up</br>  <br>equality, its what women wants, now they got it</br>  <br><br>What if this was a 7 year old girl, anon, and this woman had licked her little pussy and made her lick hers?! Would you be so qucik to defend her then?! What if it was your 7 year old little brother? <br><br>You fucking piece of shit, you disgust me.</br></br></br></br>  <br>THIS YOU STUPID AMERICUNTSSSSSSS</br>  <br>That's the stupidest thing I've read all morning. <br><br>Hey, want to know what will reduce crime to zero? Repeal the entire criminal code.<br><br>Hey, you know what supports the rule of law? Making special exceptions for women because they're young and pretty.<br><br>And you think you're fair. Imbecile.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So it can cause serious mental harm at 17 but not 18....OK, I think I'm starting to get it</br>  <br> mmm that lady around my mother's age is so sexy <br> she reminds me of my mom <br> mmm shes so nurturing, in her motherly role as a teacher <br><br>Yeah you guys have mommy issues. And I can't wait to hear what mental gymnastics you'll use to justify fucking your mother and why I'm sick for not wanting to.</br></br></br></br></br>    This is actually pretty evil. A big time mafia (government) takes away a woman consentially having sex with young men who CONSENTED, then completely ruining her life, calling her a pedofile, even though there's no difference between a 17 year old and 23 year old, not even in looks really, and sending her off to a place to be tortured, bashed, treated like an animal for 22 years, and severally fucking her up so badly. THIS IS EVIL!!!!!!! There's no justification for this, it's so fucking evil to do this to her. If you disagree, then you have been brainwashed by an evil mafia corporationalist government.  <br>Source: some guy in an earlier thread<br><br>But it was Florida, lots of nogs there.</br></br></br>  <br>The argument was because the "kids" were 17<br>Hey, lock the bitch up if theyre 7 but some kind of leniency should not been shown considering they're months away from 18 and clearly not children</br></br>  <br>Do you even know where you are? Fresh off the reddit canoe?<br><br>I've beaten off to beastiality manga before. This shit is small time.</br></br></br>  <br>nigger</br>  <br>that is the stupidest thing I've read all morning.</br>  Bear in mind boys mature slower than girls.<br><br>So a girl of 13 can easily handle sex with a guy in his twenties or thirties and that would be fine.<br><br>For a Boy they would have to be much much older to be able to handle it with the same maturity.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not because she's a woman but because they're fucking 17!<br>I'm done, stone her. I give in</br></br>  <br><br>What if this woman had showered naked with three 7 year old girls, washing their smooth, wet little bodies all over, honing in on their pubic area before slowly beginning to stimulate their little clitorises.

Because apparently it's fine to show women leniency in the justice system because "they can be mothers" but it's not okay to discriminate against them in employment because "they can be mothers".<br><br>In parts of Europe they already have really clamped down on incarcerating women for these very reasons, Nordic countries and shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br> are you fucking kidding me <br>No but she kidfucking you.</br></br>  <br> From age 15 on it's normal for human beings to have sex <br><br>Based on what?</br></br></br>  When l was in preschool there was this one teacher that would kiss me on the cheek when nobody else was around and I'd draw her pictures  <br>Nature. Fertility. Development of breasts / pubic hair / periods / etc.</br>  <br>If this is true, she is worse than scum.</br>  <br><br>I masturbated from 5 and fooled around with other kids.

So I'm cutting off this discussion. Let's say you win. Congrats!</br>  <br>fuck off you pedo</br>  <br><br>Every argment you use for justifying fucking 17yo can be used for having sex with 5yo you fucking imbecile. <br><br>How can you not see that and accept you're in the wrong?</br></br></br></br>  <br>This<br><br>You're dumb. Bitch men like you are why feminists think they're entitled to respect.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Hahahaa. dude really? you should start considering to pull your head out of your arse.</br></br>  <br><br>Eurofag here, I always wondered to what extent this "prison rape" thing was real. I mean, do prisoners in the US rape eachother (and especially sex offenders) all the time or is this more like an urban myth to scare people from committing crimes?</br></br>  <br>You are afraid of woman, l bet your fantasy is to get bashed and raped by a woman, so insecure haha</br>  Roll  <br><br>Clumping up Involuntary Manslaughter with other forms of Homicide is a little retarded. Of course you aren't going to serve 25 to life for basically accidental homicide. Involuntary lacks any sort of mens rea other than negligence.</br></br>  <br>Congrats Nigel on knowing your own laws.</br>  <br><br>Yeah, and you should try looking for mature girls actually capable of consent you creepy fuck.</br></br>  <br> Every argment you use for justifying fucking 17yo can be used for having sex with 5yo </br>  <br>Actually in the uk we have laws regarding authority figures sleeping with people they have control over. Thats why if a teacher WAS to shag a 16 year old they would probably get snatched.</br>  <br>Yes. Your attitude confirms you're a faggot</br>  <br>And if the boys were 15 in England it would be the same fucking thing. Well, no, I suppose she probably would have been let off with a warning because you're all a bunch of limey cucks.</br>  <br>She is an actual pedo anon....</br>  She deserved to be sacked for violating professional ethics but that's all. Cliiming a 17 year old is a child sexually is fucking ludicrous. 22 years in jail, fuck. <br><br>America genuinely is a repressive fucking shithole in many ways. The "justice" system and cops are terrifying.</br></br>  <br>the biggest bait in world of baits and you stupid fags all fall for it</br>  <br>What part of teacher student are you not understanding?</br>  <br><br>Its very real in muslim countrties.<br><br>Over there, they look at homosexuality differently.<br><br>If you enjoy bumming men that doesnt necessarily make you gay.<br><br>Its the guy who gets bummed who is considered gay even if he doesnt consent to it.<br><br>The term rape culture came from prisons where it was accepted that inmates would have 'wives' who they raped pretty much every night.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  She was probably some nerd in highschool who got no attention and liked the attention the students were giving her now.  <br> Cliiming a 17 year old is a child sexually is fucking ludicrous <br><br>Why is that ludicrous when they're not fully developed physically or emotionally? Oh, right, because you're attracted to them like a total fucking creep. Gotcha!</br></br></br>  <br><br>Murder cannot be justifiable...the definition implies unlawful taking of a life.<br><br>Homicide can be...justified (i.e. self defense).<br><br>I hope you are baiting.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Some friends l got are straight when they out but when they in they fuck guys, it's not big deal, a lot of jail birds do it.</br>  <br>Shut up you dumb nigger. She got a fair sentence that's equal to what a man would get.</br>  <br><br>So like Vikings, then.</br></br>  <br><br>If your waiting for them to fully develop emotionally, you would only be fucking 50 year olds.<br><br>Physically it varies a lot.<br><br>The girl in my pic is underage. Shes the high class prostitute who fucked sylvio berlusconi.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Funny, 17 is legal in many places. Then in some you're immediately branded a pedophile. Fucking backwards ass justice system.</br>  <br>Well, America is a lot more prude than Europe because it's history isn't that old.</br>  Wow, has /b/ becomed SJW? I hope someone would nuke America, it its the land of fucking faggots  <br>A man or a woman, it's too long</br>  <br>Obvious bait.</br>  <br> If your waiting for them to fully develop emotionally, you would only be fucking 50 year olds. <br><br>So what are you basing your 17 age on then? It's certainly not science, so what exactly?<br><br>Just the fact that people around you say that's okay? You're a fucking genius, anon!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's a shame. She should get bonuses for 1 on 1 sex ed instruction.</br>  The thing here is its obvious the law is wrong. This chick is one of thousands of people that get fucked by stupid US law.  One mother told the court: "It hurts. I saw myself losing my son before my very eyes and there was nothing I could do to reach him."<br><br>RAAAAAAYPE!<br><br>USA - home of the criminally stupid, religious, brainwashed assholes</br></br></br></br>  <br>Can somebody pls tell the whole story? Did any of the three boys actually complain or press charges?</br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br><br>Science would show that mentally, humans are capable of understanding and consenting to sexual activity much, much sooner than your claimed age. <br><br>Physically it's irrelevant unless talking about full intercourse, obviously that would be better being set at a time when the vast majority of humans have fully developed physically. <br><br>But as for mentally, you're way off with 17, and waiting until 50 is obviously ridiculous.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>in Virginia, the prison I was at it usually only happened if someone fucked up really bad but if you stay on everyone's good side it won't happen once. It was actually a lot more like a high school than a rape facility. We had jobs and programs (like school classes) to teach us vocational skills. I actually got my HVAC cert. Don't get me wrong though, there were a few gay inmates that would just fuck in the shower stalls (the stalls had 2 sides but no door so you had to see it when you walked past)</br>  <br>quads and noone say shit. checked ma nigga</br>  <br> So what are you basing your 17 age on then? It's certainly not science, so what exactly? <br><br>I dont agree with the 17 year age limit.</br></br></br>  You also go to prison for making jokes in England. <br><br>Top fucking kek.</br></br>  <br>So it's a step forward in finally leveling the playing field.</br>  <br>females mature at age 16</br>  <br><br>Not just quads, my friend.. Dub-quads!</br></br>  <br><br>Mentally, no they don't, at all.</br></br>  <br>i wish my hot teachers fucked me when i was 17.<br><br> some might not even know their sexuality <br>yeah they could have ended up doing completely legal things like fapping to traps on 4chan instead of manning the fuck up and screwing their teacher.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Far from it.<br><br>I choke my gf while I fuck her and I call her a bitch.</br></br></br>  Who cares she's hot.. the guy got laid, if this was a man who seduced a teenage girl then they would deserve the time.. this kid got lucky and lived the dream.  The harsh sentence is obviously coming from right-wing religious conservatives. I can tell.<br><br>Great damage, death and destruction come from religious groups. That's why I avoid them as much as possible.</br></br>  <br><br>No in the UK this would be illegal. As the teachers have duty of care and are in a position of trust the age of consent must be 18.<br><br>The idea behind this is due to them being important figures in a child's development. So they have a greater influence and could effectively groom a child for several years and use "age of consent" as a loophole</br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;some might not even know their sexuality <br> yeah they could have ended up doing completely legal things like fapping to traps on 4chan instead of manning the fuck up and screwing their teacher. <br><br>good point m8</br></br></br></br>  Glad I live in a normal country.  <br>mentally they can mature around 10-12</br>  <br>also nice dub dub dubs</br>  <br><br>Id say females can mature between the ages of 8 and 55.<br><br>It varies for each person on a case by case basis.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Females mature at the age of 3, anybody who says otherwise is brainwashed</br>  <br>Nah its fair. She abused her position of power.</br>  <br>Heard of the USSR?</br>  <br>Jesus, she looks like shit.</br>  The reality is that mentally, an 8yo is totally capable of understanding and consenting to sexual activity. It's not a difficult concept to understand, once you're informed you can make a decision.<br><br>That decision may be poor, but it's likely to be poor all the way up until your mid-20s, if you think there's a drastic difference in the decision making ability of an 8yo and a 15yo you're really pretty wrong.<br><br>The hormonal imbalances during puberty totally fuck up a kids mind, to the point where despite their brain developing slightly more over those years, it's handicapped by the hormones overriding decision making.<br><br>You "just feeling" like a 15yo can consent doesn't make it any more so than an 8yo being able to consent because someone "just feels" they can.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  She just needed some young BUCK.  <br>Top of the Pops...fucks corpses<br> we know how you brits roll </br></br>  <br> It varies for each person on a case by case basis. <br><br>That is another pretty important factor in development, environment. <br><br>Like an 8yo Chinese is likely to be way smarter and more mature than a 17yo American girl, that's just a fact.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>thats true but I did say "can" meaning some do, some dont</br>  In TX your considered an adult. Soooooo....  <br>It is a child... that type of thing can cause serious PTSD and other psychological disorders, they shouldn't be opened up to the sick fucking world you live in and most other 4chaners, keep convincing yourself that you aren't a deranged freak.</br>  Post pics you shoudn't share  <br>What's it like being a virgin?</br>    What would you guys do?

Fail troll is fail.  <br>This</br>  <br>And slavery.</br>  <br>Q: A right to what?<br><br>A: Own slaves</br></br></br>  <br>the flag is a flag of raitors to the United States of America. None of the other shit is relevant. <br><br>Putting it on your shirt though is fine. So it painting it on your garage or having it on the wall in your trailer.<br><br>But no enemy flag should fly on US land.</br></br></br></br></br>  Not sure if your trolling or serious but that flag in and of itself isnt wholly rasict in nature. It was the flag of the people in the south that means everyone rasict not racist slaver non slaver. So many of the southerners still see it as a source of pride. Wile the flag itself isnt racist the majority of people who fly it seem to be.     Its like if someone publicly went around with a nazi flag on their shirt they would get shit from everyone. <br><br>No, they get compliments, gifts, support and applause</br></br>  “It’s a victory for gay and lesbian couples who have fought so long for their basic civil rights. It’s a victory for their children, whose families will now be recognized as equal to any other. It’s a victory for the allies and friends and supporters who spent years, even decades, working and praying for change to come.<br><br>“And this ruling is a victory for America. This decision affirms what millions of Americans already believe in their hearts: when all Americans are treated as equal we are all more free.”</br></br>  <br>People in the south only started having pride in this total failure of a country that only lasted 4 years back in the 1950s when black people were fighting to vote. <br><br>Before that southerners were ashamed of this period, as they should be.</br></br></br>  <br>i have an american flag in my window<br><br>it represents the supremacy clause<br><br>the supremacy clause that says you can have that flag<br><br>so yeah i guess we got that going for us eh patriot???</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>and just so you know I'm gay and still have this flag up in my house</br></br>  <br>Opie, this is your daily reminder that Delware was a slave state, but not a confederate state.<br>That's right, there were slaves (not many) in the north during the civil war.</br></br>  <br>Internet vs reality, faggot. Walk around with a swastika and see where that shits get you. <br><br>I will gladly kill a nazi fucker.</br></br></br>  <br>TRUTH</br>  <br>i think most people that have this flag are actually gay.</br>  <br><br>yeah or the ISIS flag. nazi, ISIS, confederate - all the same shit. enemies of the US</br></br>  <br>Hey, look at the Internet tough guy who played too much Call of Duty.</br>  <br>Welcome to america.</br>  I dont care about the confederate flag either way. I dont care about butt hurt blacks. The flag issue means nothing to me and blacks can go pound sand.  <br>It's free speech. It doesn't matter if other people don't like it, it's speech protected by our First Amendment. <br><br>And, for the record, it does not represent slavery. Our Civil War was not over slavery. That's a myth that's been perpetuated for 150 years. The thing is, before the war started, we had a Constitutional amendment in the works... the "Corwin amendment". Look it up. It would have allowed the southern states to keep slavery in place FOREVER. The south seceded anyway. Let's look at that again- they were offered a plan that would have protected slavery FOREVER. They seceded anyway.</br></br></br>  It's a symbol of inbreeding and freedom to wear a mullet  <br><br>I'm a brit fag i have that flag in my house because it looks cool.<br><br>I would guess that's why most people have one.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't care about it either. I'm black, but from the Caribbean.<br><br>Don't see where all the fuss is about, but Americans have been so butthurt lately.</br></br></br>    <br>It doesn't represent slavery, it never had represented slavery, andas hard as the people have been trying this past week, it never will represent slavery</br>  There were slaves under the union jack and american flag too  <br>Not in the slightest. That's like saying the American flag represents the moon because there's a flag on the moon</br>    <br>You ask that on the 4th of July? imagine if the US had lost it's war of independence to you nancies. how long do you think the UK would have allowed the failed rebels to fly their loser flag? <br><br>That's why we shouldn't allow the confederate flag. The difference is the US won both wars.</br></br></br>  <br>It actually has to do with the banking system. The rich south vs the rich north. North wanted union and taxes. The rich of the south did not. Here in florida, only 4% actually owned slaves yet we fought for the separation. It was a war only for manipulation for profits. Slavery was a tool to rally the cause of the north and bolster it's ranks. Those who served were allowed 'freedom' . We all know how America treats veterans of course though.</br>  <br>If you want to live in a past of the Confederacy, then shut up. The Confederate Constitution didn't even have a bill of rights</br>  It's a symbol of douchery  The South is mostly shit.<br><br>South = shit<br>Flag = south<br>So by the transitive property of rednecks<br>Flag = shit</br></br></br></br></br>  They should not get shit for it. We should be able to represent ourselves in any way we want and anyone says otherwise can go fuck themselves. This is america, where we should be allowed to represent ourselves and fuck anyone who tries to censor other people just cause they don't like what something represents no matter what it actually does represent.  <br> The Confederate Constitution didn't even have a bill of rights <br>Who cares about rights other than owning slaves, though? That's the only right that matters.</br></br>  <br>The moment you begin limiting free speech, you start down that "slippery slope". Personally, I think the confederate flag represents a kind of dull stupidity. But, I recognize the rights of the yokels that display that flag. Once you allow the censoring of things, you cannot stop it. First, they ban a flag. Next, they demand ALL war memorials to be taken down. Then they want to ban YOUR flag. <br><br> Anon, that's not going to happen <br><br>But, it did happen. Just in the past week.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the flag will be removed from all government land. which makes sense since it shuold never have been allowed to fly on it anyway.</br>  It represent the freedom to marry an homo or a cousin or to fuck a sister but only in the butt.  <br>But it probably shouldn't be flown over a government building.</br>  <br>it's not being banned faggot. stop being so fucking dramatic.</br>  <br>The flag was never an official flag of the confederacy.The real reason behind the war that the north wanted to impose high taxation on the south. The south rejected it by peacefully seceding, which was well within their rights. It was the northern aggressive response that triggered the bloody civil war, and blacks fought alongside their confederate comrades, defeding their home. <br><br>Keep in mind that the emancipation proclamation only freed those slaves that the North had no jurisdiction over.</br></br></br>  <br>Fun fact, both Bill and Hillary Clinton used the confederate flag in their past campaigning.</br>  <br>Don't listen to this guy the muricans keep slaves in the white house</br>  <br>fun fact, no they didn't. anyone can print buttons up genius. learn to spot urban legend bullshit.</br>  <br>Why do you even begin to give a shit? Packs of pakis are gang raping your children with the blessings of the police. Go find something else to whine about.</br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br>i've seen butler</br>  It's the flag of dem people of the hills  <br>I love this shoop</br>  <br><br> That's fine and perfectly reasonable seeing as no government building should represent it's own beliefs and stay impartial, but to change the subject if the confederate flag can't fly over any government building should have Obama put rainbow lights up on the white house in support of his own agenda?</br></br>  <br>there were 3 flags of the confederacy and this symbol appeared on 2 of the 3.<br><br>nice try faggot</br></br></br>  That's Ted Nugent's flag  <br>You know that the Confederacy attacked Fort Sumter right? They fired the first shots.<br><br>Also, the war was about slavery. The North was messing with stuff, but it was setting up to unbalance the slave states and the non-slave states in Congress.<br><br>Also, just read the Confederate Constitution. The country was founded on white supremacy.<br><br>I can't believe there is a debate about this.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>heh, fair enough</br>  Ignorance.<br>Most of them don't even know that it's not the flag of the CSA, but Robert E Lee's battle flag.<br>THIS is the flag of the CSA.<br><br>Basically they're being the 19th century equivalent of edgemasters and displaying a symbol not for what it represents, but because it pisses people off. Ask them about it and they'll give you this long speech about states rights and southern heritage but it's undermined by the fact that they don't even know it's the wrong flag.</br></br></br></br>  <br>yes because the rainbow is not a flag of an enemy of the USA. there is no country known as Gay, composed of dumb gay people.<br><br>the closest to this is the UK but they're our friends.</br></br></br>  <br> Also, the war was about slavery <br><br><br>Ah no. It wasn't.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Gays were never at war with the US. You can't say that about the CSA.</br>  <br>this</br>  <br>Called Michelle?</br>  <br> Keep in mind that the emancipation proclamation only freed those slaves that the North had no jurisdiction over. <br>People wheel this factoid out like it's a gotcha. Like the 13th Amendment doesn't exist.<br><br>It's like saying Game of Thrones only had one season because that's as far as you watched.</br></br></br></br>  <br>this is just ONE of the flags dumb ass. i love when stupid rednecks try to educate people and then end of proving how uneducated they are themselves.</br>  Nobody wants to ban the flag. It just shouldn't be flown over a government building, where blacks are also paying for it to be there. If somebody wants to put a Confederate flag on their car, go ahead. It shows me who's going to be an asshole. That way I know to avoid them, and I don't need to converse with them for the two minutes it would've took to discover they're an asshole  <br>So then the flag everyone is debating about has so significant meaning or implication and shouldn't even be considered offensive?<br><br>Glad we could settle that</br></br></br>  <br>When I grow up I want to go to Bovine University</br>  <br> Ah no. It wasn't. <br>It was lol.<br><br>"Our new Government is founded upon exactly the opposite ideas; its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal condition." -Alexander Stephens</br></br></br></br>  <br>It was a battle flag</br>  <br>The flag OP posted is the rebel flag. It was infrequently used in warfare. Never the offi<br>cial flag of the confederay however.</br></br>  <br> So then the flag everyone is debating about has so significant meaning or implication and shouldn't even be considered offensive? <br>Just because someone's too stupid to draw a swastika correctly doesn't mean they aren't a neo-nazi.<br><br>Besides, the Army of Northern Virginia was objectionable enough on its own.</br></br></br></br>  <br>if you look at the constitution of the CSA and the ammendments it is ALL about protecting the rights to slavery and keeping the white race superior. <br><br>learn your fucking history faggot</br></br></br>  <br>nazi is love nazi is life, except for kikes</br>  <br><br>I'm not involving it with the CSA, but was curious on others opinions on that subject. I supported the passing of gay marriage always, but shouldn't the whit house not have anyone one's beliefs put on it except the view of the american people. Not everyone agreed with this bill, but Obama just put the lights up like he was saying "Fuck you guys, this is happening and no one is stopping it." You as president should never instill your own agendas on the capital of our country.</br></br>  Flag represents southern pride, As a southerner i see the confederate flag all the time, I even see black people flying it on their cars. The flag doesnt mean racism.  <br>Well, the Confederacy didn't think it's citizens needed freedom of speech, so those who use the flag to represent their undying alliegence to the Confederacy should live by their Constitution, waving their right to freedom of speech. Also never secede again because that was illegal under the C.C. Really shows you the types of intelligent (southern) people running this government</br>  <br>Well sorry to break it to you, but in the United States things like Nazism, Homosexuality, Religion, and even the Confederacy are all ideals freely practiced because they are all protected under the First Amendment<br><br>Get fucked commie</br></br></br>  <br>So you're a traitor from Northern Virginia?</br>  <br>The truth is that the confederate flag represents a large group of people that did not agree with the Union.<br><br>Yes, the South wanted to keep a slavery system and the North didn't, and the right to keep it was what the Civil War was about.<br><br>The flag is more about a way of life than just about keeping slavery.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> but shouldn't the whit house not have anyone one's beliefs put on it except the view of the american people. <br>Sorry, I only speak English.<br><br>PS: The White House doesn't house the US Supreme Court.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It did represent racism, but now , with time, it has changed to a symbol of southern pride. Any symbol can change with time with new use, but people will always represent something with its worst form.</br>  <br>a: a right to have different laws from the federal government. It's happening again with gay marriage. Obama is purposefully seeding the next civil war so he can say "well look at this! we NEED a strong central government and a federal police force to control these people."</br>  <br>there were three flags. <br><br>from 1861-1863 was the first flag. from 1863-1865 were the flags with that symbol on it. <br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flags<wbr>_of_the_Confederate_States_of_Ameri<wbr>ca<br><br>learn</br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> being this retarded </br>  <br>lol no.<br>The Battle Flag was NEVER the flag of the CSA. It's true that more than one flag was made, primarily because backwoods hicks in 1860 didn't know that two other people had already made a flag, but that doesn't alter the fact that the flag in OP's post belongs to a particular military group, not the confederate government.<br><br>It's tantamount to claiming that this is the US Flag</br></br></br></br>  <br> Well sorry to break it to you, but in the United States things like Nazism, Homosexuality, Religion, and even the Confederacy are all ideals freely practiced because they are all protected under the First Amendment <br>Do you support flying the swastika from the seat of state government?</br></br>  <br>The president supported and maybe even championed the cause, but he didn't even make the call. It was the Supreme Court, who are the final arbiters on the Constitution. I double dog dare you to go and argue the Constitution with anyone who sits on that bench.<br><br>The President is allowed to have an agenda. Probably even encouraged, but since he cant write laws, none of that really matters.<br><br>You can be pissed, but be pissed at the Supreme Court. They're the ones who made the call on gay marriage.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>wrong. here;s one version with it clearly on it.</br>  <br> mfw you cant be a nazi communist because nazi already means national socialist </br>  <br>No because the Swastika has nothing to do with our heritage as a country.</br>  <br>Because down there most everyone lives in a double wide, fucks their family and is just dumber than shit.</br>   britfag <br><br>we're kind of celebrating you today in a way</br></br>  <br>You DO know that there were over two years of civil war BEFORE the Emancipation Proclamation, right?<br>No, really, look up the dates.<br><br>No war has ever been fought for humanitarian reasons, wars are fought over money. Excuses are made via humanitarian reasons, but they're never what start a war.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Well i'm wrong I guess then, but I don't think there should have been Gay pride colors on the white house and it was a disgrace to the building</br></br></br>    You know, for Europeans who usually talk about how American needs to educate themselves about this or that, you could do the same in return. This is probably just bait, but the flag isn't about any of that shit you said, OP. Educate yourself, you willfully ignorant tool.  <br>the great thing about this national flag of the CSA is that they had to change it because it looked like a surrender flag when there was no wind. <br><br>ha ha dumb bastards then and now.</br></br></br>  <br>If people were displaying the Stainless Banner that might be a valid point.</br>  <br>There is no historical connection between Nazism and any state.<br><br>Also, Nazis =/= Confederates. Tool.</br></br></br>  <br>this</br>  <br>its a joke...</br>  <br>/Thread</br>   muh state rights! We're not racist! <br> burns down black churches </br>  Resident Evil 4 when you find the Merchant!  <br>really</br>  <br>and then here's the final version, that they changed so that it didn't look like a surrender flag.<br><br>again you can clearly see the symbol in the upper left corner.</br></br></br>  <br>Again, that is NOT the flag posted in OP.<br>Do you think the british and australian flags are the same flag?<br>The aussie one has the british one on it.</br></br></br>  <br>this</br>   mfw people still think the civil war was about slavery <br>FUCKING SIGH. I'm not even a southerner and everyone knows it was purely to keep the states together. The end of slavery was fairly welcome in the south and racism was a construct of culture. <br>If you want to be pissed about slavery and the idea of racism; blame the dutch and Portuguese for inventing it as we knew it. Fuck sake. England as I recall you guys had a huge empire that 'employed' slaves all around the fucking globe so stop being such fags about it.</br></br>  <br>/thread.</br>  <br>Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra</br>  <br>I love how shitty the actual confederate flag was.<br><br>Someone said "Hey, everyone likes this battle flag. Why don't we make a larger version of the battle flag and make it the national flag?"<br><br>Like, hey, maybe you could stretch it out so it has rectangular proportions!<br><br>Haha no. Instead, the flag maker just plops it down on a big white canvas, like Grandma trying to use MS Paint for the first time. No attempt was actually made to enlarge the actual flag part. It's just the battle standard sitting on a goddamn empty field.<br><br>They loved it anyway, because they decided the white flag represented the white race.<br><br>Right up until they noticed it looks just like a flag of surrender if the wind isn't blowing.<br><br>What a bunch of fucking retards.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah the rest isn't completely white so no. <br><br>but it is stupidly close, i'll agree</br></br></br>  <br><br>Saying the confederate flag should be banned is like saying gay marriage should be illegal.</br></br>  <br>It was white because white people are better than anyone else. Im not kidding. That was the thought process.</br>    <br>yeah exactly. the only reason the didn't use the original is because it was the flag of one state and didn't want to imply that state was the most important. <br><br>dumb asses all around. they have not gotten any smarter down there.</br></br></br>  <br>Pretty much. <br><br>It's like being that one asshole that wears a Superbowl shirt that was sent to a 3rd world country because it was of the team that lost. <br><br>The CSA lost. Fucking deal with it. No, it won't fucking rise again. No, it's not about fucking states' rights because states' rights are already fucking observed and have been observed by every state in the fucking US in some form or another. All it means when someone says "states' rights durrh, muh flag" is, "I hope to use states' rights to do hateful shit."<br><br>Hell, Lee Atwater summed it up in his lines about the Southern Strategy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Temba, his arms wide!</br>    <br>The South left because slavery was on its way to being outlawed. The South attacked the US government.<br><br>Slaves were already free in the North, smart guy.</br></br></br>  <br>then i guess they added the red stripe because they were getting their asses kicked by the United States of America by that point.</br>  <br><br>A right to not be unwillingly conglomerated into a central government...and to own slaves, if you're into that.</br></br>  <br> but I don't think there should have been Gay pride colors on the white house and it was a disgrace to the building <br>Who gives a shit what you think?</br></br>  <br>slaves were already freed in the United States of America. there was no "north". it was the southern confederacy versus the United States of America. The USA.</br>  The civil war was in it's third year when Lincoln gave the emancipation proclamation.<br><br>At that time, Britian and France were considering giving support to the Confederates. Lincoln knew that slavery was unpopular in Europe so he threw that out there to discourage any support. <br><br>Smart move.</br></br></br></br>  <br>gay marriage isn't the flag of an enemy of the USA.</br>  <br>*some parts of the north.</br>  <br>*some parts of the USA. <br><br>fixed it for you.</br></br></br>  you're right. they called it a blood banner  <br>How about flying the Union Jack from the seat of government then?</br>  I swear you fuckboys cant go a day without talking about my great country. Honestly nobody gives a fuck about the confederate flag, just a very small percentage of left wing liberals. The media has blown this whole situation up and as you can see all of you faggots are just swallowing this shit up, like the Jews wanted you to.  <br>they are our friends now. no one is trying to sow sedition and rebellion around the union jack any more. nice try though</br>  <br>are you even american or just another brit. Thanks for perpetuating the slave trade until 'merica could get everything unpacked.</br>  <br>Alright then, libernazi.</br>  Shoot up a church.<br>We must get rid of confederate flag!!!<br>Flag gone replaced by rainbows.<br>Racism gone<br>Hate gone.<br>World finds peace<br>Wars end<br><br><br>Yup I'm sure this is what is going to happen.<br><br>Getting rid of a flag won't stop anything. It's just a flag.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You obviously have never been to the South. There are Robert E. Lee statues and highschools everywhere. Most of this was done between 1870 and 1920. <br><br><br>To answer your question, Yankees are very indoctrinated. They are taught in history classes that there are always 'good goys' and 'bad goys' and that the US government is always the good goys. In the South they teach Southern History which, while not perfect, is a more balanced view on US history.</br></br></br></br>  <br>ha ha i love /b. idiots go on to complain about people gullible about a flag and then put on their tin foil hat for the final point. ha ha ha.</br>  <br>There is a reason why they have to designate it a Civil War to distinguish it from a normal war</br>  <br>I am not sure I understand the point you are trying to make. I am afraid you misunderstood me. I meant it was never a national flag. <br><br>Understand that I am talking about the rebel flag. I realise there were three flags in total, but this issue is pertaining the rebel flag, not the 2/3 national flags of the Confederacy that shared its motive.</br></br></br>  <br>building statues is not flying hte flag. two different things there cletus</br>    <br> implying the president controls the decisions of SCOTUS </br>  <br>That image is gold</br>  <br> being this much of a conspirtard </br>  <br>So you'd be okay with that? I'm not trying anything I'm actually a different person. But theoretically if the confederate flag is alright by you because it represents the history of your country then the Union flag should be even more important.</br>  <br>Just because they are made out of different materials doesn't change the fact they are both pieces of symbolism.</br>  <br>This is revisionist. Britain and France were NEVER going to support the Confederacy, because the Civil War was about the right of the Confederacy to own slaves.<br><br>You can tell a lie a million times and it won't make it true.</br></br></br>  <br> muh emotions <br>Only in your head Alexei</br></br>  <br><br>To many fags in this thread to understand that simple concept. If anything it makes it worse, it's like people are purposely trying to start a fight over this dumb shit</br></br>  <br>Sure thing, Gramps.<br><br>Any day now.</br></br></br>  <br>the confederate flag should not be flying at all. period. it's an internal insidious enemy. the union jack doesn't present as much of a problem. but still, yeah, probably shouldn't be flying.</br>  <br>Southern revisionist wishful thinking by a southern dumbfuck. How often do you fuck your sister?</br>  <br>Just because you're an idiot Christian bigot doesn't mean the white house shouldn't be able to support the rights of gays</br>  <br>Funny, thats not what the flags designer William Thompson reckons, quote from Our Flag by George Preble</br>  <br>10/10 argument. Would reply again.</br>  <br>It's /b/. They are.</br>  <br>planting a flag in the ground symbolizes a specific thing. it means the country on that flag is what the land its flying on owes its allegiance to. <br><br>a statue is just a memorial.</br></br></br>  <br>South Carolina was the first state to officially succeed.<br><br>And a poll in South Carolina showed that the biggest reasons for doing so had nothing to do with slavery.<br><br>However as more states joined the Confederacy, their concern gravitated more towards slavery more than anything. Originally the Confederacy was in the name of state rights, but as time went on it took on the face of slavery.<br><br>The Confederacy was never intended to be about slavery, it just kind of happened as it recruited more states.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Reason is a breath of fresh air.</br>  <br> No because the Swastika has nothing to do with our heritage as a country. <br>The US fought the Nazis. The US fought the Confederates. Both regimes were about as evil as nations get IRL.<br><br>From a US perspective, the main difference is that the Confederates stood a chance of destroying the Union, while the Nazis had no realistic way of doing so.</br></br></br></br>  <br>the president was indirectly responsible in two ways: one his support makes people think differently. and 2, more importantly, he seeded the supreme court with a couple judges.</br>  Approximately 60% of the US is racist. The other 40 are minorities.  <br>? I'm a atheist and supported Gay marriage all the way up till it passed, I just don't think anything should be on the White House other then the American flag. Is that ridiculous to believe in?</br>  <br>see</br>  <br>[citation needed]</br>  <br>If thats the case then the Mexican flag should not fly in the US since we were at war with them...nice logic there</br>  <br>look up joke on google</br>  <br>You're obviously not American then.</br>  <br>I don't understand how you get crushed in a failed rebellion and still get to fly your racist shit-rag flag.</br>  <br><br>Please go read about the Trent Affair you stupid faggot.</br></br>  <br>well, yeah, i agree. but at this point they are our allies. so it's no big deal.<br><br>if the CSA had taken over mexico and now 100+ years later they were our friends, flyingthe flag would be no big deal either. but they're not. they lost, were put down like dogs and so people against the USA should not be allowed to support it as an enemy.</br></br></br>  States rights my ass. I grew up in the south. The flag is a not so subversive fuck you dating back to reconstruction. Some raise the flag because they embrace their family heritage in the post reconstruction era - northern fags forget how bleak the south was up till the 20th century when more manufacturing starting moving south. It's not just the local rednecks raising it, the middle class still holds a lot of animosity and celebrates the southern hatred of northern aggression. the average southerner doesn't equate the flag with the slavery - call it a mass delusion.  <br>They were celebrating the Supreme Court ruling and displaying their approval of it</br>  <br> The british empire <br>Nuff said.</br></br>  <br>"With the election in 1860 of Abraham Lincoln, who ran on a message of containing slavery to where it currently existed, and the success of the Republican Party to which he belonged – the first entirely regional party in US history – in that election, South Carolina seceded on December 20, 1860, the first state to ever officially secede from the United States."</br>  <br> source; funnyjunk <br>Dude are you even fucking serious. There is no source for that.<br>Here's an actual william thomas quote<br> Anyone who thinks they're important is usually just a pompous moron who can't deal with his or her own pathetic insignificance and the fact that what they do is meaningless and inconsequential. <br>He was a fedora.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not about logic. It's about pretending to be superior. These fuckers were the hypocritical bible thumpers of 100 years ago. It isn't about wisdom, truth, or kindness. It's about feeling superior.</br>  <br>It is highly relevant. Lincoln used his genius to wage war, the abolition of slavery was his casus belli. To my knowledge, the south seceded peacefully, am I misinformed?</br>  <br>And I guess america only fought in ww2 because their boats got shot at. You're so right anon!<br>fucking /sarcasm</br></br>  <br>It means "Hey we lost the civil war, and we're too fucking stupid to realize it so let's fly our loser flag and just pretend we're awesome because if we don't believe it, it never happened.".</br>  <br>This.<br>/thread.</br></br>  <br>You are.

I'm not here to convince you otherwise.</br>  <br>This is probably one of the stupidest things I have ever read. Not even sourthern.</br>  "Good morning. In less than an hour, aircraft from here will join others from around the world, and you will be launching the largest aerial battle in the history of mankind. Mankind, that word should have new meaning for all of us today. We can't be consumed by our petty differences any more. We will be united in our common interest. Perhaps it's fate that today is the 4th of July, and you will once again be fighting for our freedom. Not from tyranny, oppression, or persecution, but from annihilation. We're fighting for our right to live, to exist. <br>And should we win the day, the 4th of July will no longer be known as an American holiday, but as the day when the world declared in one voice, 'We will not go quietly into the night!

Today we celebrate our independence day!" <br><br>President Thomas Whitmore<br>July 4th, 1996</br></br></br></br>  <br>In this argument, one side is posting facts, and the other is going "No see it was about states rights but I'm not going to tell you what rights they were you'll just have to trust me."</br>  <br>That flag is even more racist than just the battle flag.<br><br>The designer clearly said the pure white field was supposed to represent white race supremacy.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah. You're misinformed. <br><br>Half the Confederacy didn't secede until Lincoln picked a fight with the Star of the West. And his cassus belli was wxplicitly NOT abolition of slavery. There were slaves working in the freaking White House and in several northern states.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, but is it not true that Lincoln knew he could provoke this reaction by stationing relief focers there?</br>  <br>Lies</br>  <br>exactly. the USA was a little too kind after the war, let too much shit go on. and now we have this whole group of useless fucking white trash worse in many ways than the descendants of the slaves the USA freed. it's just sad.</br>  <br>Christ dude, why is it so hard to understand that completely ending someones economy would cause problems.

It's called stacking the bench.</br>  <br>yes! and that's what should have happened here. but the USA was compassionate.<br><br>something we've grown out of.</br></br></br>  <br>Nigger lover detected.</br>  <br>Slavery IE their work force. At the time it was an accepted practice that america didnt even start. <br>God damn you're smug as fuck. Must be euro.</br></br>  <br><br>Nice cropping job. Oh wait--</br></br>  <br> There were slaves working in the freaking White House and in several northern states. <br>Trolling this much.<br><br>A FREED EX SLAVE was working in the white house.</br></br></br></br>  <br>what? source on the confederate states of america? which part don't you believe?<br><br>here';s the currency.</br></br></br>  New American flag  <br>...well actually no, they still required a work force to continue doing all normal things and upkeep and preparation of meals and that kind of shit...</br>  <br> an insidious rebellious enemy from the inside, the worst of all enemies. remember how people were so worried about communists from the inside back in the 40s and 50s? same type of thing. <br>This part. <br> brothers fighting brothers, neighbors fighting neighbors <br>yeah just like the communists! TOTALLY<br> /sarcasm</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>you don't believe that the Confederate States of America were originally a part of the United States of America drummed up sedition and rebellion and broke away from the USA?<br><br>you're dumb</br></br></br>  <br> Slavery IE their work force. At the time it was an accepted practice <br>It wasn't accepted, lol. It was outlawed in the entire civilized world, except for the South's backward-ass economy.<br> implying the South was civilized </br></br></br>  <br>Because we're rebels that do what we want. Just like when we "seceded" from the British Empire. Most Americans also associate/identify "American culture" with Southern culture. After all, we've produced virtually all of the great American writers, musicians and leaders. Every Yankee wishes he was Southern deep down inside, as there really is no such thing as "Northern culture" in the US. Just wave after wave of immigrants, but nothing timeless, or endemic.<br><br>Then there's the fact that the "US" flag has flown 50 times longer and is responsible for 1000 times more carnage and misery. Just ask an "Indian", ours not yours. Of course, there's that too. The good ol' Union Jack isn't exactly a symbol of peace &amp; love either. Again, ask an Indian.</br></br></br>  <br>The State's right.......to take away other peoples' rights, that is.</br>  <br>Can you even read? I dont think they were treated anything like the fear of communists. Shit man, go to bed.</br>  You're damn right this is an enemy flag.<br><br>I had at least a half-dozen ancestors fighting under it. None of them owned slaves.<br><br>Rich slaveowning class suckered the poor, illiterate peasants into fighting to protect their wealth.<br><br>Set this part of the country back 50 years or more.<br><br>The North surely had their own interests, but this was vile treason against their own southern brothers.<br><br>Burn that flag at every opportunity.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The reason why South Carolina was sieging Fort Sumpter was because<br><br>*Buchanan made an agreement with the Government of South Carolina that the Federals could keep Fort Sumpter as long as it was not Reinforced.<br><br>*Major Robert Anderson, in charge of the Union forces in Charleston, secretly moved all his forces into fort Sumter, unknowingly violating the agreement<br><br>*South Carolina protested this to Buchanan, since secretly moving troops into South Carolina was an act of war<br><br>*Buchanan responded by sending the Star of The West troop transporter to reinforce Fort Sumter<br><br>*South Carolina responded by Sieging the Fort<br><br>Fort Sumter was a Gulf of Tonkin type incident. The Federal Government wanted war and was going to keep sending troops until either it conquered South Carolina or they were fired on. It wasn't even a very good Gulf of Tonkin incident since half the Southern States joined the Confederacy in response to this incident</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> ...well actually no, they still required a work force to continue doing all normal things and upkeep and preparation of meals and that kind of shit... <br>They used this newfangled thing called employees.</br></br>  <br>it wasn't like it was a thousand years later. only a few years before it was totally accepted. <br><br>anyway, the confederacy was nothing to be proud of. but being the last civilized area to rid itself of slavery? someone had to be the last right?</br></br></br>  <br>What, did you see that on a power point :^)?<br>Man it's not like history is written by the victor. And I'm not even southern hue</br></br>  <br>who was treating it? i'm saying today its just like that, not that anyone treated like that in the past you dumb fuck.<br><br>we should not encourage anyone to use that flag as a way to drum up sedition and traitorous activity against the USA TODAY just like we wouldn't allow communists back then.<br><br>dumb fuck</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, only the land staling, Indiain-murdering Stars and Bars is permissible and appropriate :/</br>    <br>Surely it was a seamless transition. ... wait</br>  <br>You make a good point.<br><br>The only time a sitting US President led troops on the field of battle (besides President Thomas Whitmore, of course).</br></br></br>  <br>see this is fine to me. painting your house like this is fine.<br><br>but planting a flag in the ground has a different meaning.</br></br></br>  <br>Even your summary is contradictory. The North moved troops from parts of South Carolina into Fort Sumter so they could protect themselves. They weren't moving troops into South Carolina.<br><br>Also, secession is already an act of war. The entire concept of a nation is built on sovereignty.</br></br></br>  <br> Surely it was a seamless transition. ... wait <br>This is some really weak damage control, dude.<br><br>There were no slaves working at the white house. Your claim was false.<br><br><br>Slaves didn't build the pyramids.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>We kicked you limeys out so you could whine on our website</br></br>  <br>... But it's their right to choose to not support and be under the care of the federal government. If a large % of the population feels that way; then people feel that way. I'm not saying lets use the flag to blah blah blah, im saying you cant just forget about something that shaped this nation into what it is today. Just like if there was a revolt against the government I would hope it wouldnt just be pushed under the rug like what happened like 5 years ago when those people peacefully took over an armory and were then never seen again.</br>  <br><br>This so much. Sir I salute you.</br></br>  It's a flag that represents the south of the United States.. People are losing their fucking minds these days about anything...  <br> slaves didn't build the pyramids. <br>... wat</br></br>  <br>The people who built the pyramids were paid craftsmen.</br>  Im 38, lived my whole life as a white man in nashville tn. As a child i saw the flag as simply a symbol of southern pride. i related it to dukes of hazzard and it can have a nostalgic effect on me reminding me of my childhood (like mcdonalds fries do lol) but by age 7-10 I knew what it was really supposed to mean was "dont lets the sun set on you here nigger" and I can atleast find something respectable in people who will openly tell you that. anyone who tells you its not overtly racist is a liar or a moron.  The message I'm getting from this thread is that there's a lot of people who think slavery was the way all economies worked until a few years ago. That simply isn't true. Slavery is an unnatural institution. Most people, at all stages of history, got by without it.  <br>The pyramids or Giza are inactive star gates.. there are numerous in South Americas</br>  <br>The economy was focused on the growth and sale of cotton to the industrial north, and Europe (primarily Britain).<br><br>Instead of paying sums for the purchase and sale of black slaves, the agrarian south could have taken advantage of the MILLIONS OF IMMIGRANTS coming into the country by the boatload as a massive workforce. The north did, the west did, but the southern planters were a bunch of fucking greedy idiots.</br></br></br>  <br>i'm not for banning it. you should be able to buy and sell that shitty flag. just don't fly it.<br><br>btw slaves were on the money ha ha ha</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah dude; the south totally had major trading hubs that encouraged immigrants to come to!<br>/sarcasm a-fucking-gain</br></br>  <br><br>no. the right to lawfully export your crops without the North throwing massive tariffs on your goods for doing absolutely fuckall<br><br>to be a slave owner you had to have so much fucking money, they were definitely in the minority. The Civil War for the 6 gorillionth time was not started over slavery.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>No "slaves" worked on the pyramids. Those were well-compensated craftsmen/religious adherents. Now, the folks that made your phone/computer, they really are slaves ;) Happy texting!</br></br>  <br>Recent evidence seems to suggest that the labor force used in the great pyramids may not have been entirely slave based ( good homes, diet etc). It's not a settled academic point but it makes you rethink the nature of ancient Egyptian workforce and the claims made by certain ethic groups</br>  <br>slavery is about as natural as it gets, it has been happening since the beginning of mankind, and happens in many other animal species.</br>  <br>Literally jewish slaves built the pyramids.</br>    <br>If the cotton industry was so important and valuable, surely they could pay workers a fair wage and still be profitable.<br><br>It's funny to me, because when the South tried withholding their own cotton in an effort to gain foreign help, the British Empire shrugged and started growing cotton in India instead.<br><br>Even if the South won, their economy would've been permanently wrecked. They ruined it themselves.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because I'm sure they didnt take generations to complete.<br>Oh fucking wait, /sarcasm again</br></br>  Q: Why is the Nazi flag illegal in Germany, but the confederate flag is 'constitutional' in America?<br><br>A: Germany is ashamed, America is not.</br></br>  <br>if i recall it was part of the Egyptian welfare policy, where farmers during the off seasons were called upon to preform organized labor in exchange for food from the pharaoh's granaries. The workers weren't given a choice in the matter. Forced labor with only enough food for basic sustenance could be considered slave labor or a welfare system, depending upon the circumstances of the time and how you choose look at it.</br>  <br>It was already being ruined; just, do you swing at the guy who just stole your wallet just watch him walk off with it.</br>  <br>So yes, the flag has a very negative history, but it is an interesting one.<br><br>First, the flag people fly isn't the actual confederate flag, but instead a flag used by the confederate military. Now according to the Vice President of the confederacy and many of the declarations of independence written by confederate states slavery was the primary cause of succession. <br><br>For many Americans the confederate flag, though it is deeply rooted in racial division and oppression, represents resistance to the federal government. This is particularly true with regards to state-level interference.<br><br>The United States constitution has an important clause in it, essentially it states that the federal government is uniquely seperate from the state governments, and a further clause (10th amendment) says that States pretty much have all powers not given explicitly to the American national legislature, meaning that states are to decide for themselves what works best. This is why different states have wildly different social nets, tax rates, etc.<br><br>Ever since the civil war we have seen an explosive growth in the federal government, and many fly the flag as a resistance to that federal expansion.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> confederate flag is just like the nazi flag <br>I can't believe there are people who are this stupid.</br></br>  <br>I wish Germany would learn not to be ashamed, they are such cucks because of that.<br><br> Greece: GERMANI GIB MONI PLES <br> Germany: No Greece, learn to make your own god damn money <br> Greece: DO YOU REMEMBER HITLER? HUH GERMANY? <br> Germany: ...O-Okay.. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  Would anyone fuck my mom?  totally  <br>Yep</br>  <br>Yeah no problem.
