Edition.</br></br>     erp <br><br>Every rape possible?</br></br>     Ein here replying to Brownie and Sir <br>"Mnh... I-I think it'd be better to just follow what Sir says, Brownie," Ein replied to the sissy currently getting fucked. Or fucking himself with Sir's dick, rather. "I-I just want Sir to make sure it won't hurt for me...", he added, as he kept on slowly playing with his penis.</br>  Sir here    <br>I smack Brownie's ass and pull back and thrust in really roughly. "Are you arguing with me Brownie?" I grab a handful of his hair pulling back some "It is okay Ein I will make sure it doesn't."</br>  fuk  Is Mr. Stick-in-the-ass here?  <br>"I want you to fuck me too, Sir" said Aroha as she slipped her panties off revealing her self as a trap "I even shaved for you" she says as she bites her lip</br>  (assuming this is found by the right person)<br><br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;626169472 <br><br>"Well no, no wife and definitely no kids. I can hardly handle you let aloe some other brats." he said chuckling a bit trying to keep his eyes off her if for no other reason than he didn't want her to catch him peeking. She bothered him enough when he showed no interest, who knows how bad it would get if she found out how often he was actually looking when she was flirting like this. <br><br>To get his mind of off her he continued the conversation. "You know part of my share goes into repairs for when you get bored and put a new hole in my vehicle." he decided not to mention where the rest went, that was his business.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I walk into the club like 'Wut up, I got a big cock.'  Hay bby want sum fuk?  <br>lol Mr. Stick-in-the-ass reporting</br>  <br>I'd prefer that cock stuffed down my throat</br>  <br>"You want to join the fun eh? Well you and Ein can keep each other entertained while I plow Brownie here. Would you like that Ein?"</br>    <br>"S-sir, I respectfully ask, please don't hurt Brownie too much," Ein said to Sir, who seemed kinda upset at Brownie.<br><br><br>"W-well... I wouldn't exactly mind," Ein said as he wrapped his arms around Aroha. "Am I good enough for you...?", Ein said, staring into Aroha's eyes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh really now?</br>  Y'all niggas need to get some new pictures.<br>Same shit, different thread.</br>  <br>"Yes Sir" I looked at Ein <br><br><br>"You're perfect" Aroha whispered before she softly kissed Ein and pulled Ein closer</br></br></br></br>  <br>That final potshot was too much for her, and a frustrated growl tore from her throat. She drew her far knee up, swinging her leg up and over as her torso twisted, her arms coming up off the dashboard. The heavy, metal limb struck the seat next to his head, while her human hand grasped at her collar, pulling him up as her face drew close. What a stretch this position was, it tugged her groin tight as she nearly straddled him.<br><br>“You know what, fuck you,” she snarled, her lids drooping to mere slits, “that was one time, and I didn't do it on purpose – so drop it.”<br><br>She was panting now, the rotor in her shoulder whirring in a quiet buzz as she gripped the head of his seat. Feeling her leg tremble, the woman dragged her other knee up, planting it just outside of his leg. It was a touchy subject, made clear by the fact that she didn't even notice that their hips were now crushed together. A breath pushed from her nostrils, blowing hot over his face, as she tilted her head forward, resting forehead against forehead.<br><br>“Sorry,” she murmured, chewing at her bottom lip as her gaze shifted to the corner.<br><br><br>(There we go. Knew that would pay off.)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>*nods shyly* yes ma'am I-if you would allow me</br>  <br><br><br>(I think Brownie bailed.)</br></br></br>  Is sir asscheeks going to be here again lol?  <br>"Mnh... T-that's really nice to hear~", Ein cut the kiss off for a second, then resumed it again, rubbing his cock against Aroha's, whose member was a bit bigger than his.<br><br>(Too bad, it was fun.)</br></br></br>  i need a loli  <br>LMAO SIR ASSCHEEKS IS HERE ALREADY</br>  <br>"Well now, if you want your tasty treat, you'll have to earn it."<br>She says as she pulls her panties down.<br>"Get on your knees."</br></br></br>  <br>"Ein" *gasps* "it feels so good when you" *presses them together* *gasps* "do that" Aroha feels the excitement pulse through her as she holds Ein close</br>  <br>*she drops to her knees hand on her hips biting her lip and lightly licking her lips in anticipation*</br>  <br><br>(I guess he passed out from pleasure in the RP??) I pull out slowly "Well that was disappointing..." I look at you two my erection growing even more strained from the unsatisfactory moment I had with Brownie. "I promised Ein dibs next but I think he may need to prepare a little. I thought this would last longer." I sit for a little bit to let you two have some fun.</br></br>  <br>"Ah... I-it truly does...", Ein said as he leaned down for a sec and let his saliva drip onto the two cocks rubbing together, which caused Ein to shudder and moan softly.</br>  Hmm, is my baby boy in here anywhere?  <br>(Possibly; poor him)</br>  spank my ass and call me purple  <br>"Good girl."<br>She says, smiling. As she approaches, she grabs her thick flaccid meat in one hand, and puts her other hand on your head, stroking your hair.<br>"First things first. Why don't you show me what you can do with those lips and tongue of yours, hmm~?"</br></br></br>  <br>Nah I'm just psyched to buy some shit from the thrift shop!</br>  <br>Aroha whimpered and moaned as Eins saliva dripped onto their cocks "a-ahh, it's even better now" said Aroha as she began to kiss Ein more, thrusting her hips a little faster</br>  <br>*spanks ur ass* heloo purple :3 wanna fuk?</br>  <br>Aww I'm always too late.</br>  <br><br>"Y-yeah... S-so good...", Ein replied before he was kissed by Aroha, who was moving her hips even more. She seemed so into it... which was so adorable. Ein blushed and kept on rubbing his cock against Aroha's, but this time cups both dicks in his hand, jerking them off like they're both using an onahole as they rub more.</br></br>  <br><br>"Don't apologize to me, I pushed you too far this time, I'm the one who should be sorry." He placed a hand on her trembling leg trying to calm her. Oddly enough he wasn't afraid he had a feeling that at this point if she wanted him hurt she would've done it way before now. But regardless he didn't mean to make her this angry. He looked into her eyes even though they were looking in another direction.<br><br>"Hmm, you know you're just not cute wen you're mad." He said brushing a loose bit of her hair from in front of her face, he moved it to the back and let that hand rest at the back of her neck.<br><br>Maybe it was because she was so close or maybe he had just gotten tired of his own game he decided to make a move back on the girl. "Sorry if this is the wrong time." apologizing in advance. He put pressure on the back of her neck puling her closer to him until their lips pressed together.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>*She blushed shyly and her eyes widened when you approched closer to her, the smell of your cock filling her nose, she sat up and reached up gripping the base of her big flaccid cock and began slowly stroking it, doing slow long strokes before she leant up pulling some of her long black hair behind her ear and would drag her hot slimy tongue and drag it all the way up the back of her big cock til she reached the head giving it a wet flick*</br>  <br><br>I just wait patiently letting you rile each other soon one of you would break and want my cock inside of you.</br></br>  <br>"A-aaahh" Aroha moaned as she draped herself round Ein shoulders shivering with pleasure "p-please don't stop Ein, p-please" she said before she let out a string of moans nearly digging her nails into Eins back</br>  <br><br>"Ah... I-I won't stop... So long as you cum for me~", Ein said as he rubbed their dicks together even faster, while stroking both of them more and more. While doing so, he licked and softly bit Aroha's neck, coaxing her even more to orgasm.</br></br>  <br>Better luck next time~!<br><br><br>She would shiver ever-so slightly at the long wet appendage slowly dragging itself along the entire length of her member, making it twitch as a result.<br>"Ooh, that's a good start. I can tell you know what you're doing, hmm~"<br>She would then let go of her cock since it was now in your care, to undo her top and idly massage one of her large breast, as if to show them off to the girl.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sure, it was a sore spot, and whenever he brought it up she grew right pissed: but it wasn't anything serious, and she figured they both knew that in some way. Malfunctions happened – he'd said that before, hadn't he? – , and so the woman's brow furrowed when her partner applied such a gentle touch to her. Even more than that, she gave a muffled yelp against his lips as he took her for that kiss. Her eyes widened, and the servos in her fingers whined as she gripped the seat tight enough for it to buckle, deforming into a subtle dent.<br><br>Her grip on his collar fell slack, and she straightened her hand out to press against his chest with a gentle pressure. The shock was dying down, and she began to melt her lips to his, letting them move with a fluid grace for a long, held breath. Just as her eyelids began to flutter shut, she pulled back, with her mouth still held slack. It was hard for her to swallow now, and she was frightened by how aware of her own heartbeat she became.<br><br>“I,” she started, pausing awkwardly with a sheepish chuckle, “I didn't think I'd catch you quite like this. . .”</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>"Do it Aroha you know you want to." I have yet to touch myself but my cock twitches and bobs as I watch,</br></br>  <br>"A-a-aaahhhh, I'm so close Ein. I can feel our cocks throbbing with pleasure" Aroha moaned more, then Ein kissed her neck "A-AAAAH Ein don't stop now I'm going to cum for you!!" Aroha dug her nails in as Ein licked sucked and bit her neck</br>  <br><br><br>Um, excuse me but do you think you could use one more boy?</br></br></br>  <br>*she would bring her warm tongue up to the tip of your cock and bring her head back down replanting her tongue against the side of her cock doing a new line of saliva behind where her tongue drug, she would do this again to the other side until you felt your entire cock coated in her gooey saliva, she would pull her lips and tongue away when she finished and a thick string of slobber connected her lips to your cock head, she would look up at you with her bright green eyes and speak*<br><br>I've had a lot of practice <br><br>*she would then curl her fingers firmly around the base of your cock as her saliva would make a wet squish and she would begin pumping up and down on her cock smearing and using her drool as lube and would pump that cock making loud wet sounds*</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not him But I could be :3</br>  <br>"Nh.. .Y-yes... Cum for me, Aroha! L-let's cum together!", Ein moaned as he thrust his hips even faster while jerking both their dicks off. "Ah... T-together, Aroha!", Ein moaned softly into Aroha's ear, thus causing him to breathe warm air into Aroha's ear.<br><br><br>"P-please wait... W-we're just about do- ahh...", Ein cut himself off.</br></br></br></br>  <br>(Wow maybe I should consider trying to want boys more.) "I think the more the merrier. I am not sure if they even know anyone else is here right now."</br>  <br>Oh really? Hm let's see here. *she paces around you* And what is it that you want from me?</br>  <br><br>"I am in some need of attention as those two have fun." I stroke my cock slowly. "What is your name?"</br></br>  <br>Aroha's ear twitched as Ein's hot breath rolled over it, sending shivers down her back and neck "y-yess, E-Ein, I'm gonna cum for you!!" Aroha moaned as she blew her load all over both Ein and herself. "O-ooh Ein, t-that was amazing" Aroha gasped trying to catch her breath watching as both their cum dripped and slid down their bodies.</br>  <br><br>Well I've never done anything with another boy either. I'm just curious to see how it feels.</br></br>  <br>-He looked down a bit red face rubbing his hands together nervously- W-well I've always wanted a-a pretty mommy</br>  <br>She would nod as she watched the girl happily covering her shaft with her hot saliva. She seemed very satisfied of her performance so far, and expected it to get only better from there.<br>"And it shows. Keep it up, you're doing wonderfully."<br>As she began pumping, she could feel the many large veins getting to work. Doing their own share of pumping, the entire member would seem to come to life, pulsating and throbbing under her touch. With every burst of blood filling the large, demanding organ, it would grow longer, thicker, and harder, stiffening upward.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh uh I guess you can call me Mal.</br>  <br>"Ngh... Ha... A-Aroha...!", Ein softly moaned and whimpered as he came, making a mess out of both his and Aroha's semen. "Ah... Y-yeah... It felt wonderful...", Ein softly replied, seemingly tired from just the frottage they did. And he felt there was still a lot more that will happen.<br><br>"I-I'm sorry that took so long, Sir... I left you alone for too long," Ein said, with his head shamefully lowered.<br><br><br>"S-sorry that took quite a while... Mal, right?. I-I think we got carried away, w-we're sorry," Ein said and then laughed nervously.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Aww, well aren't you cute. *she gives you a hug from behind* You really think I'm pretty?</br>  <br>*A tremble would run through her body, her hands feeling every pulse and every throb that cock mustered, her grip on that wet cock would tighten when it reached full arousal, still doing a fluid stroking motion with her hands but with how hard she was it would glide quickly*<br><br>Thank you ma'am I aim to please<br><br>*she would blush and hold your cock with both hands at the base and bend it down lightly towards her, she would sit up and swirl her tongue allover the head flicking the tip while both hands would slide up and down. her thumbs rubbing the back of the shaft as she did*</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>-He smiled putting his hands on her arms when she hugged him- O-of course! my mommy is the prettiest in the world!</br>  <br>"Oh then Ein or Aroha would be better for you Mal. I am a little more... Rough" I smirk a little. <br><br> I laugh a little. "That is okay Brownie is what caused me to have no one to please me when he comes back he will get his punishment.You two enjoy yourselves?"</br></br></br>  <br>He wasn't entirely sure what to think, he had figured she would pull away from the kiss and she would tell him that she was joking around with him on the job, but she didn't she embraced his kiss. His heart raced, with how close the two were he could tell hers was beating just as hard. "If it makes you feel better I didn't think so either." the hand on her leg gripped slightly as he attempted to catch his breath. He released the grip shortly after, and he gazed into her eyes, for as long as she has tried to get to him now it was time to see what she would do now that she had him.</br>  <br>Oh no, it was nice watching the two of you do that. I'm still new to this hehe.</br>  <br><br>"Ah, I'm glad it's fine... B-but in return... I must please you, Sir, since Brownie suddenly disappeared...", Ein said, then he got on all fours and presented himself to Sir, spreading his butt cheeks as much as he can, revealing the pink hole. "Why don't you and Aroha get cozy, Mal~?", he added. "T-that's if he's still here,"</br></br>  <br>By now she was starting to bite her own lower lip and letting out a few low moans of pleasure.<br>"Mmmm~ That's right, just like that~"<br>The oversized organ would be indeed quite difficult to manage single-handedly, and using both hands was practically a necessity at this point. On it's mere girth, it would require formidable jaw muscles to be able to open wide enough to fit in the head alone, let alone swallow it down.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh uh okay then, I look towards Ein and Ahora. Would you like to help me?</br></br>  <br>It was the sort of moment that pressed on and on, as if time had suddenly been squeezed. A long point, one where she was overwhelmed by her own awareness of his heat against hers, her nerves tingling where their bodies met, the sudden tension in the pit of her stomach. She met his gaze, stunned, grasping in her mind with wild strokes to recover. 'Say something, do something, anything is better than waiting,' that little voice echoed in the corner of her mind.<br><br>She pressed forward, her entire upper body mashing against his, an almost instant reaction to any outside observer. Again, their lips found each others, except she had guided her mouth to his with a forceful push, her hand snapping up to cup his neck. Her hips squirmed, pressed firmly against his, while her knees squeezed into his thighs. Anchoring, that's how she could understand it: she was anchoring herself to him in that moment, trying to drive out uncertainty by acting on base desire.</br></br></br>  <br>"Don't pretend that you are doing this just for me." I walk to you and stand behind you grabbing your hips and prodding your hole with the tip of my cock but not pushing in. "You want my cock in your ass don't you?"</br>  Brownie here. Took a while to find this new thread, but I'm glad to see nearly everyone enjoying themselves. I have severe anxiety, and this was mostly an experiment for me. One which I'm afraid ended in failure as evidenced by my poor writing and consistently late replies in the other threads. So with that said, take care everyone! I doubt I'll be coming back.  <br>Oh you're so sweet. *still hugging you she kisses your cheek* I think I would like you to be my new baby boy. Would you like that?</br>  <br>*she pumped it a few more times before flipping her hair back and leaning in opening her mouth as wide as it would go and would wrap those puffy soft pink lips around the head of her big cock and would curl them tightly suckling on the head, her hot tongue pressing and prodding the tips hole as her hands continued their work of pumping, she would drool allover the head moaning into it sending a deep heavy vibration down the whole shaft as she moaned into it*</br>  <br>-His face lit up as she kissed his cheek and asked him that- Y-yes! Of course I would love it so much!</br>  <br>"Oh brownie you are more than welcome to join in again." (not being able to find the thread is understandable and you are a fine writer for what we require in this ERP but if you want to leave that is up to you.)</br>  <br>(by the way this is sir)</br>  <br>(Ah... That's really sad to hear. It was actually really nice to ERP with you though. My replies weren't exactly fast either, and my writing isn't any better. Although, I know I can't stop you from... stopping. And it's understandable enough that you couldn't find it, no worries. You take care too, Brownie!)</br>  <br>*she hugs you tighter and laughs a little* Good, now what does my baby boy want from mommy hmm?</br>    <br>I wanna get tucked in by mommy!!! and have a special good night kiss!!</br>  <br><br>"Ah... O-of course, Sir...", Ein softly whimpered as he felt the tip of Sir's huge dick rubbing against his butthole. He wants to push back against it so badly, letting it enter his hole. But he wants to help Mal too. "M-Mal, come here... Take a seat in front of me," Ein said, with pure lust in his eyes.</br></br>  <br>The feeling of her soft lips suckling on the tip of her large throbbing cock added to the vibrations was enough to make it start leaking some precum. Even if it wasn't the real deal yet, there was quite a bit of it already.<br>"Aahh~ Amazing~"<br>She took a moment to inspect the girl, before adding:<br>"... How far down your throat will you be able to take me, I wonder~?"</br></br></br></br>  <br>"I didn't hear you say that you wanted it." I push just the tip into your tight ass but don't go any further since you didn't get to prepare yourself like Brownie did. "You know I can be much more rough if you don't listen to me."</br>  <br>*as soon as she tasted that precum dribble out of her cock head you felt her lips and tongue begin wildly licking the tip and her fingers focused on stroking the underside of her big cock to coax more, she heard your question and blushed as her green eyes looked up at you and she kept her gaze up at her while she lowered her jaw as low as it could go and she began pushing your cock deeper into her hot wet mouth, her lips pushing as deep as they would go until about 3-4 inches were stuffed deep into her little tight mouth*</br>  <br>Oh, okay then. Mal steps quickly over to Sir and Ein and sits down in front of them not entirely sure what's going on. What do you need Ein?</br>  <br><br>Ein moaned... the thick tip barely making it in his ass. "Mnh... I-I'm sorry, Sir... I want it... I want your thick cock in my tight, little ass! I want you to fill me up with your semen... I want you to mess my insides up!", Ein lustfully said. "B-but...", Ein weakly said. "P-please, d-don't hurt me too much," Ein whimpered as he drooled on himself. "H-here, Mal...", Ein said, then suddenly pulled down Mal's pants and his boxers, letting out his dick, then strokes it with his right hand afterwards. "I-I'll help you too~", Ein said.</br></br>  Does anyone here play Final Fantasy 14?  <br>"Oh you are such a good team player Ein but I think you kind of want me to hurt you some." I smirk as I grip your hips and push into you at steady pace not going slow but not pounding into you either.</br>  <br>Hm well I think I can do that for my boy. *she stops hugging you and takes your hand* Then lead the honey.</br>  <br>She chuckled a little at that sight, feeling both amused and aroused by it.<br>"My my, you're really thirsty for my cum, huh~?"<br>However as she started swallowing her overgrown appendage down, she grew only very slightly concerned.<br>"Mmm~ Careful not to choke, now. It's quite a big piece to take in, after all."<br>Despite that, it was clear she enjoying it immensely, as she periodically let out slow and passionate moans.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>-He smiled and took her hand firmly gripping it and pulling her into his room jumping up on the bed crawling up to the head of it peeling the blankets back and laying in it in his two piece pj set of pants with a small button at the fly and a white striped t shirt-</br>  <br>I do. Balmung.</br>  <br>When their lips met the second time he was able to match her movements better, though he was surprised when her hand came to his neck. But it was the rest of her movements that threw him off. He felt her lock herself in place, he couldn't help but grind against her hips. The hand on her thigh moved up to her back he slid it under her shirt but kept his hand to her lower back.<br><br>He felt like this was what he wanted forever, occasionally he would break away from her lips only to catch his breath, then move back in indulging himself in every moment.</br></br></br>  <br>*she heard her queens pleasure and concern and decided to show her what she could really do, she stuck her tongue out under her cock and pushed as much of it as she could into her mouth and you felt your cock head press against the back of her throat, you expected a gag or cough but the girl remained calm, she looked up at you with that huge cock stuffed in her mouth and throat and begun doing a heavy swallowing motion causing her hot throat muscles to tightly squeeze and massage into your cock head and part of your shaft rubbing it so tightly while in her throat*</br>  <br>"Ah... S-sir... Aah...!", Ein moaned as Sir started to move in his ass. The cock he's been craving for for long... He's finally taking it in the ass. Ein seemed to be in great ecstasy, Sir's huge member grinding along his prostate every time he thrusts, causing Ein to moan even more and drool.</br>  <br>(And since I have impeccable timing, this is where the scene gets put on hold. I have to go now: but, these threads happen pretty regularly.<br><br>If you find yourself in one again, put out a message that 'Mr. Stick-in-the-ass' is here. I'll find you.)</br></br></br>  <br> Want to meet somewhere on level ones? I find ERP so much more engaging with actual characters present. We can work out a scenario in this thread, then go create characters.</br>  <br><br>Mal was surprised Ein's actions but slowly relaxed into it. That feels r-really good Ein. Mal's cock begins to grow from this new sensation of being stroked by another boy.</br></br>  <br>You should definately post pics with more of your replies.<br><br>maybe even dump in another thread</br></br></br>  <br>Alright, I hope I'm keeping up decently enough. If I see one f these later I'll totally look for for ya.</br>  How long have these ERP threads been a thing? I've been using 4chan for like 5 years and only noticed them about a week ago. First time I ever posted in one was today.  <br>I push deeper and deeper with each thrust until all of my cock is inside of you and I stop for a moment loving the tight walls of your ass squeezing my cock as if it was trying to get out every drop of cum inside of me already.</br>  <br>Hail Satan.<br><br>And they've been more and more popular for maybe a month and a half or so</br></br></br>  <br>the ones I had seen before the last few days usually just advertise f-list or whatever it was.</br>  <br>To be honest, I've never done ERP in game before, so I'm very nervous about starting</br>  <br><br>Ein moaned even harder as Sir pumped his member even deeper in his ass. "I-I shouldn't leave you alone, Mal...", Ein said, as he gently grasped Mal's dick and put it in his mouth, stroking it with his hand while sucking on the tip.</br></br>  <br>(maybe I will)</br>  <br>Hmm hehe good boy. *she says running her hand over your chest* Now what do you mean by a special good night kiss? *she leans in and kisses your cheek but then keeps her face close to yours*</br>  <br>I pull almost all the way out slowly and then thrust all the way into you again abruptly and continue doing that getting faster and faster but also not pulling out as far before I thrust back into you.</br>  <br>Thats of course why I suggested level ones and not our actual mains. I wouldn't want to compromise my identity either!</br>  <br>If there's sauce or more of this set that'd be greatly appreciated.<br><br>just...wow! where do you find this stuff?</br></br></br>  <br>-he blushed when she pecked his cheek and would look down shyly- I-I mean th-the one they do on the videos, the mommy kisses the son with her tongue -He blushed again- A-although I've never done one before..</br>  <br>Her initial surprise will quickly get washed away by the overwhelming pleasure she's feeling. The small girl's every muscle above her shoulder line being fully put to use to thoroughly massage her inflated member from all sides all at once.<br>"O-Ooh wow~! I could just-..."<br>She'll put her other hand on the girl's head, now both hands resting on top. She'll instinctively slowly start moving her hips back, pulling out about halfway in order to feel every inch of her small throat and tongue under her shaft, before moving forward again, pushing herself slightly further back down than before, to further drown herself in the amazing feeling.</br></br></br>  <br>I thought Purple was Ariamis or Terumi.</br>  <br>Ein moaned loud, which reverberated into Mal's dick, which was still in his mouth. He tried his best to keep it inside, since he wanted to moan so much more from Sir's thick cock. Ein drove Mal's dick deeper into his mouth as he let Sir take control of his ass, which was twitching in pleasure already.<br><br><br>(artist is Hinamizawa, look it up in sankaku channel)</br></br></br></br>  <br>(artist of the last pic*)</br>  <br>heyyy. One more for my collection!</br>  <br>Ein you don't have to- Mal was cut off as Ein pulled his Dick into his mouth. Wow Ein you are really good at that. Mal started to fall back but without thinking grabbed Ein's shoulders to pull himself up but also unintentionally pulling Ein further onto Mal's Dick.</br>  <br>Let it be written that once, on the sixth day of the seventh month in the year 2015 of our Lord, an ERP thread actually contributed to one person's life in a positive way.</br>  <br>I moan loudly as I get lost in pleasure and start thrusting much fast squeezing your hips tightly</br>  <br>(damn *faster)</br>  <br>*she could feel and hear her queens excitement and enjoyment loving her little mouth and throat, she kept her jaw hung and her lips tightly around her shaft not letting any air escape, as she drug her cock back she would slurp around it as it was pulled out and would let it slide all the way back into her throat, after a few thrust she would wiggle in closer and tilt her head back, now almost completely under your legs and gave your cock more access to her throat to go deeper down with her head tilted all the way back*</br>  <br>(mmm, delicious! I like you a lot, thanks!)</br>  <br>to destroy /hga/ and become the only kingdom of autism</br>  <br><br>"Ahn...", Ein moaned into Mal's dick once more, which was driven even deeper, into his throat, as he was sucking on it and accidentally got pulled closer. "F-fhr... Hnn..."(S-sir... Aah...), Ein moaned even louder as Sir drove his cock deeper and faster into Ein's ass. The pleasure was so intense that Ein was tearing up a little, still drooling on himself.</br></br>  <br>Hm you're not supposed to watch those videos. *she keeps her hand on your chest holding you down* But it'll have to be our little secret okay?</br>  fug  <br>-He looked a little sad and down when she told him he shouldn't watch those videos but his eyes widened when she placed her hand on his chest pushing him back gently* Y-you will!? I-I promise I won't tell anyone!</br>  <br>I move my legs to where they are on either side of you and I start hammering into you shoving all of my cock into you with each thrust.</br>  <br>Sponty was now near her limit, no longer able to contain herself, she would burst any second now. She was moaning louder and more frequently, no longer grinning cockily but fully reveling in the pleasure she was feeling.<br>"F-Fuck that's good! I-... I'm gonna-... Nnnggh~!"<br>While still remaining very careful in handling the girl not to hurt her, she started moving both her small frame and herself in unison, rocking- almost ramming herself in and out of the girl repeatedly, gaining in speed and thrust each time.</br></br></br>  I'm just going to sit here and stalk you guys again.  <br>Ein...that feels amazing! Mal could see that was surprised by suddenly taking his Dick deeper than he intended. Are..are you okay Ein? Mal asked while attempting to pull out.</br>  <br><br>"Kh... A-ah... I-I'm fine, b-but... Aah! Y-you don't need to pull it o-aah!", Ein kept getting cut off by Sir's cock, throbbing like crazy in his ass. The pleasure was simply too much. "I-I'm about to cum, S-Sir...", Ein said. "P-please make me cum with your huge cock!", Ein begged, as he took Mal's dick into his mouth once more.</br></br>  <br>*she could keep herself fine in normal situations but that cock was so thick and being so brutally pushed down her throat, as you went deep it got tighter and snugger, her hot throat and mouth all wrapped so tightly around your cock, her eyes would roll back. she had plenty of air but the feeling of that cock violating her throat was pushing her very close to her own internal limit*</br>  <br>"Fuck I am about to cum Ein!" I start pounding into you at a much more brutal pace losing some of my rhythm as side effect. "You can cum Ein. Let it all out!"</br>  Are there any good archives for /b/ or no? Found plenty for other boards...wish I had copy and pasted some of the RPs I'd seen here  Eat<br>Sleep<br>ERP</br></br>  <br>Hehe, that's my boy. *she leans in to kiss your forehead then your cheek then she stops and looks at you for a bit* I love you baby boy. *then she presses her lips against yours and she stays like that for a couple seconds and then you feel her tongue push its way into your mouth and lick your tongue up and down and then she pulls away* Are you okay sweetie?</br>  <br>Going faster and deeper still, she was now almost rocking the girl like a ragdoll, as if she were no longer anything more than a mere receptacle for her immense cock.<br>"I-I'm gonna cum right into your stomach, okay~!?"<br>More of an unfair warning than a request, she would almost immediately shove herself completely down into the girl, as far as her body would physically allow, before screaming:<br>"Nnnnggahh~! I'm cummiiing~~!!"<br>Right on cue, a powerful and plentiful stream of semen would shoot out of her member and start filling the girl's stomach to the brim at an alarming rate, bloating it until it bulged slightly.</br></br></br></br></br>        <br>"Ngh... S-Sir!", Ein suddenly pulled away from Mal's cock, despite still stroking it with his hand. "S-Sir, I'm cumming... Aah...!", Ein said, as Sir pounded his dick into his ass, he moved along with Sir's rhythm, letting him pound his ass deeper and harder. "Ah... Ha...!", Ein let out one more moan, as his hips shook like crazy and his little dick let out many spurts of semen, in a large amount per throb. "Aah..." Ein gasped for air, his face seemingly melting in pleasure.</br>              In this thread we describe video games poorly and attempt to guess the title. <br><br>I'll start<br> reporting <br> acknowledged <br> reporting <br> acknowledged <br> reporting <br> acknowledged <br> base is under attack <br><br>Pic not related</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Red alert</br>  <br>is pic related?</br>  Ruse?  <br><br>No</br></br>  Starcraft  <br>No <br>adding hints<br> too much God damn same <br> red, green, blue <br> cash comes from orange shit </br></br></br></br></br>  League of faggots  <br>*sand..

Come on guys, the free mason's are more open about who's a member and who's not.</br>  <br>With the way a lot of third world girls look like the goat I would have to trade for her would probably be a better lay</br>  <br>Same with me<br>There are arguments and whatever but nothing major</br></br>  <br>Actually have her as your waifu, I dream about being with this girl every night.<br>If i did find a 3D girl like her I'd want to marry her</br></br>  <br>We don't even really argue, if we have a problem we talk it out and fix it. Luckily she isn't one of those irritating bitches who won't tell you what you have done wrong and will keep it to themselves for a week till you get so pissed off you yell at them, then they cry while telling you and even though she was pissed off for a stupid reason you end up feeling bad.</br>  <br> Because a 2D girl can never embrace you after a long hard day, you will never feel her skin, her warmth as she hugs you. she will never ask you how was your day. she will never calm and reassure you. <br> but mostly because you cant have sex with 2D girls. <br><br><br>Wrong on all accounts.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What a fucking normie answer.<br><br> calm and reassure you. <br>see pic</br></br></br></br>  <br>i feel you man<br><br> chat up girl in club, but in the bar area of it. <br> easy 10/10, she was really fucking gorgeous, named madeleine <br> going fine, she has about 6 orbiters and i get most attention. we're having nice convo, small talk, get along well. make her compliment <br> tell her i would lick her armpits bcz think her sweat tastes like honey <br> she immediately loses interest <br> i go back dancing <br> half an hour later see how shes leaving <br> ask her why she isnt interested anymore <br> tells me it was nice with me but the armpit thing was disgusting and just too much <br> WHATS FUCKING WRONG WITH ARMPITS? <br><br>Lacanian analysis of it: there is not only physical space to be left between persons but also mental space. it can be very frightening to realize that one is an actor of the dream of the other. it is intimidating and can even be an embarassing experience.<br>thanks Zizek</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> talks sci-fi <br> I mention anime <br> admit its a Japanese cartoon <br> books <br> admit browsing 4chin <br> make a joke about pedos.  <br>Jesus fuck dude. You're fucking weird, stay off this toxic site for a few weeks and try again. You're no older than 15 years old so your mind is still susceptible to this bullshit. Normies don't spend hours upon hours browsing a Korean Japanese pediphile get board. They have real friends.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>totally seconded<br>took me five years, now shes most interesting convo partner, best sex, politically same<br>fucking amazing</br></br></br>  <br> Wanting to be a boring normie </br>  <br> Jesus fuck dude. You're fucking weird, stay off this toxic site for a few weeks and try again. </br>  <br> tell her i would lick her armpits bcz think her sweat tastes like honey <br>What the fuck dude</br></br>  <br>I don't trust you, mr Skeltal, and it's not just because you're spooky.</br>  It's the same for me. Even though I don't want to believe womens are inferior, why can't I just find a nice one ?  <br> tell her i would lick her armpits bcz think her sweat tastes like honey <br>Save the fucked up fetishes for sex</br></br>  <br>seriously, why is admitting to browse 4chan akin to telling you're a leper? and what wrong with Sci-Fi and anime?<br><br>and the pedo joke was harmelss and semi flirtatious.<br><br>the chick I was dating was 29, So I asked her "Do you know whats the best thing about twenty-nine year olds?"<br><br>Oh, and you're a decade off. I'm 25. been here since I was 15, so atleast partially right. I do have friends and I do not have any interest in being a normie.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What was the pedo joke?<br>You may not understand from your sheltered point of view, but the topic raping children to death is usually in bad taste.</br></br>  <br>because most people dont sit in front of their computers watching anime and jerking off to kids all day. most people are normal functioning people with out autism OP</br>  <br> vagina <br> knowledge <br><br>Pick one<br><br> broad social recognition <br> self-awareness <br>Pick one<br><br> popularity <br> honesty <br>Pick one<br><br>Don't dis other people just cause they're rolling with a different class build, especially if it's not even op</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You dont tell them about anime or other nerddoms until you've already got with her you retarrrrrrrrrrrd</br>  let me guess OP, your one of those people who thinks they are so much better than everyone else that you wouldnt even consider changing literally anything about yourself to attract women. relationships are about give and take if you want someone exactly like you then buy a fucking blow up doll and pretend its a women with your exact tastes in everything  <br> Its like you can read OP's mind over the internet <br>Are you a wizard?</br></br>  <br> but the topic raping children to death is usually in bad taste. <br>Fuck off</br></br>  She's a delusional talentless cunt and her parents wasted all that money on private school just so she could blow and fuck her way to shitty projects. The number one thing she always uses to insult people is her parents' status because she doesn't have any.  <br> changing literally anything about yourself to attract women <br><br>If by this you mean dressing up nicely and not talking about the interests you clearly do not have in common then it's not "changing yourself" it's just basic social skills.<br><br>But "changing yourself" in the literal meaning- as in changing your interests- would be fucking retarded. I mean, sure, if you like smashing genitals more than you like watching guys kick around a ball on TV and your gf tells you to stop watching football- then you stop watching football- it's your call.<br><br>But basically you're being cucked.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> because most people dont sit in front of their computers watching anime <br>I actually spend less than an hour a day on anime.<br>  jerking off to kids all day. <br>Just because I joke about pedophile doesn't make me one<br><br><br>so lie or limit myself to just talking about uni and work? I'm a nerd, through and through.<br><br><br> let me guess OP, your one of those people who thinks they are so much better than everyone else  <br>nope.<br>  you wouldnt even consider changing literally anything about yourself to attract women. <br>a little yeah, but come on, I'll give up on pedo humor. maybe anime but I'm not giving up on my nerd.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   i want a girl to like exactly what i like but i would never consider even attempting to enjoy what she like <br><br>gee idk op you are probably not the problem at all, it must be the girls</br></br>  <br>Fuck you fucking retard.<br><br>That's exactly what I think and I know I'm right. So if everyone around me is a retarded bland piece of shit, I have to be one ? What a loser's wway of thinking, no wonder you're so worthless.<br><br>This is the worst argument I've ever heard and yet I hear it so much. I don't even want to fake being a lambda ( and not a fucking normie, who the fuck says I am anormal ? ).</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>girls dont reach god tier very often.</br>    <br>I don't admit browsing 4chan because it's something I'm on maybe 30 minutes a day. I have real hobbies. That's like saying "well I do my laundry and was my dishes". No one gives a fuck. They wanna know if your rock climb, skydive, cool shit. But what do I know. I'm just a fgt anon on 4cheen.</br>  i know what you mean no nerdy girls around probably in basement playing video games  <br>Fucking neeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrd!</br>  <br> I'll give up on pedo humor <br>Classy as fuck, you'll be slaying pussy soon.</br></br>  <br>Settle for that fat girl who's crazy and obsessive. <br>I wish I would've done it instead of feeling embarrassed to be around it. <br>They would give mean blow jobs and slurp down every drop of cum. It was sexy and disgusting to watch that pig do it. But all in all it felt amazing and the pleasure of my hand can never win when compared.</br></br></br>  <br>Except we weren't discussing hobbies, we were specifically on the topic of what websites do you browse for fun. and the only sites I browse are uni related, torrents, and 4chan.</br>  <br>That doesn't mean she no longer has a cookie cutter personality</br>  <br><br><br>well you guys keep thinking that, im sure one day it will all magically change and all your dream will come true</br></br></br>  <br>  I answer 4chan <br>Thats why we have rule 1 and 2. Now she is going to search 4chan, come here and start a YLYL thread or some other cancer shit.</br></br>  <br> broad social recognition <br> self awareness <br> popularity <br> honesty <br>I have all these. I'm not an autist which is why I don't have to pick. Only advantage I have over others are decent facial genetics. Other than that I work out, I'm nice and joke with everyone, I'm not loud or obnoxious, I think before I speak so I seem 'wise'. I act like an adult, not a man child. Don't limit yourself to those choices buddy.<br>Also, you ever get smart with me again I'll fucking rek you, pussy.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nappy fetishes are wrong.</br>  <br>Keep enjoying your retarded life.<br><br>I'm social and I have no problems whatsoever I can't resolve myself. I have no reason to change, simply to be pleased by womens around me, and I'd much rather be alone than suffer with some bitch for sex.<br><br>Your way of thinking is utterly shit. You don't even know people yet you believe yourself fit to spit bullshit.<br><br>Though, unlike OP, I don't show off my marginality and I'd much rather have people not know shit about me and think I'm like them, which is what they do when they don't get information about you. That's why things like " I wash dishes and do my laundry " can actually be useful.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>have you never been in a relationship before? people pretty much never come out of them the same as they were when they went into them. people change, they age, they shift intrests. my GF hated video games when we first started dating and now we play games a lot. i mean its not super hard core lets go play 6k mmr dota but we play games together still. and guess what some of those things i thought was retarded when i first met her like dancing actually turn out to be alright as well.<br><br>if you cant understand that you will probably die alone. you want her to change but you dont want to even think about changing. thats fucking retarded and you are an idiot</br></br></br>  <br>Should have been honest and told her xnxx or lolitaville</br>      <br>Have you seen first page? there is a shitload of racist/trap/gore and other disgusting shit. Rule 1 and 2 its not to protect "my /b/" from other people, its to protect you, you autistic fuck, from other people, so they wont find out how much of a weirdo you are.</br>  <br>Why bother with close minded people ? They should change themselves, and you're the faggot who did say that, so why'd you bother to help out someone change.</br>  <br>Do that to my face and not over the internet and see what happens you beta fuck.</br>  <br>/b/ is not somewhere you go unless you heard of /b/. Most casuals go on /v/ or similar boards.</br>  <br>if I would've been honest I couldn't. only know of xnxx by name and dont know lolitaville at all.<br><br><br>this is only /b/. I said 4chan in general. could've easily meant /lit// /tv/ /v/ /vg/ and other safe for work boards.</br></br></br></br>  <br>oops i meant less kek ;)<br>My boyfriend was shoving his dick up my butt while tickling my balls and i didn't proofread my post lol Ͼ ◞Ͼ</br></br>  <br>You are asking the wrong questions. It is not "why is everyone so goddamn normie?"<br>It is "why is everyone left so goddamn normie?"<br>And there in the question lies the answer. You are looking for normie girls to date hoping that they turn out to be the normal looking freaky /b/tard. <br>Sorry homie chances are that you are only gonna find ones out there in the singles pool that are damaged goods/leftovers. Something so wrong with them that they are not in a relationship because the other side couldn't tolerate them.<br> inb4 wymens choice <br> Tell us how freeing it is to be lonely, depressed and more likely than not ugly as fuck, or with some fucked up mindset that ensures that people will and can only hate about you which inturn makes you hate yourself further. <br>Back to the point. If dating spread your net wide and only pick the best fish. Remember they currently outnumber us 53-47/100. Plenty to choose from, simply cast the line.<br> Eyes on one that is taken? <br> Don't waste too much time getting roped into a Popeye situation <br> Keep your eye peeled for an opening of unhappiness where you might be able to slip in and fill her void. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh i'm supposed to watch mtv and listen to what ever shit music she listens to, no thanks. You found a girl you could mold I didn't. her whole personality was just based on whats trendy no hobnies nothing of interest came from her, so you can go right ahead fuck off, fucking retard.</br>  <br>we dont need your kind around here</br>  <br>I go on /fit/ because I'm a filthy ripped casual.</br>  <br>QFT</br>  <br>how do I send memes irl?</br>  <br> implying I would ever leave my room </br>  <br>then try again you fucking idoit holy shit how the fuck are you so dense? all women are not the fucking same. jesus christ you are retarded. new flash you dont just find the love of your life on the first try, shocker i know.<br><br><br>ya i know right why to logical thinking, thats fucking stupid</br></br></br></br>  I would love a normie girlfriend, I don't get why you guys all want to fuck yourself. generally you don't have everything in common with someone you're fucking.  <br><br><br>yeah i know, however my gf loves me talking dirty and she could have laughed and not be totally disgusted. it was just a weirdo compliment</br></br></br>  <br>that's total bullshit, people find out about 4chan through all the shitty memes about /b/ being an awful place, /b/ is literally 4chan's newfag filter</br>  <br>they are all pretty much just complaining because they are stupid and refuse to change. seriously read the thread its full of idiots<br><br> she should be perfect <br> i should be allowed to be a physical manifestation of autism </br></br></br></br>  <br>Where do you see a single person here saying the girl needs to be perfect?</br>  <br>damn girl<br> would let benchpress my body while sucking my dick/10 <br> bet you give the best handjobs/10 </br></br></br>  <br>You're wrong. We are normal people. Why should someone be anormal because of different interests only ? As far as I know, OP has no social or mental disorder.<br><br>The problem is how the majority is full of shit, has always been crap and will remain so, because we are fucking animals and a real "human" as we call ourselves, only show itself out of a hundred livestocks.<br><br>It's even rarer for women, as being beautiful means you're more likely to interact with other and end up on the wrong way, since solitary people are the ones most likely to reach a state of intelligence.<br><br>And yet even you guys think of yourselves as anormal, just like the faggots telling you that you have to change ? I don't understand this point of view and I'll always be called an angsty teenager because I'd much rather accept myself than fit in society.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>they are implying it pretty hard</br>  <br> im sure one day it will all magically change and all your dream will come true <br><br>If I was truly feeble-minded enough to embrace such a mythological creed on human interaction then I'd just start having normie interests right now.<br><br>I hope for nothing, expect nothing and feel entitled to nothing (when it comes to romantic relationships)</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>lold at your comment, tripsmeister</br>  <br><br>Ur 1 cheeky cunt m8</br></br>  <br>This<br><br>All people said was that they wanted someone fucking acceptable while themselves have nothing wrong and ARE acceptable.

History proves that nation with a football tradition are bound to win, and there are no exceptions in this rule: proof is that Brazil, a wide land of poverty where football is the only escape from the misery of most lives, is the first country who managed to pull up 5 world cup. Immediately after comes tradition and know-how: Italy and Germany collected 4 WC and several european tournaments, quite similar to the WC in terms of value because europe is the mecca when it comes to talk about football. <br>England, where football was created, lacks tradition and development of strategy: barely managed to pull off a single victory in the WC, and that tournament is still remembered by the fans as one of the most poor in history.
