Its a solid game and definitely one of the best of its time. But it does not hold up by todays standards. Too many random battles. Many side quests have to be known of off the bat or you will miss them completely. Lots of grinding will be done for the final boss unless you have a guide. It isn't very noob friendly. But its worth the experience. Its a great journey that is worth the time. And it is fun to replay. Not the greatest. Over rated. But still nothing to sneeze at.  <br>lol, ff8.</br>  I mean, FFVII is fine, but I'm about to think that nowadays it is really overrated.  FF9 is the best, no angsty characters, immersive magical world, cute are style great music, awesome gameplay. Many side quests are just a hassle to complete.  <br>So it is a normal jrpg</br>  <br>FF7 is a masterpiece, however, you have to look at it within it's timeframe.<br><br>Even Charlie Chaplin's work looks bad if you compare it to modern cinema. It's appreciating it within it's time that makes the difference.</br></br></br>  <br>It had a time and a place. Anyone still holding it high is either clouded by nostalgia or they're too young to have even played it and just wanna be part of the circlejerk.</br>  <br>I don't really do "best ever" but it was entertaining as a mother fucker<br> &gt;Can you tell me that Chocobo racing and breeding was not a welcome from grinding all your materia up </br></br>  <br>oh no you fucking didn't <br><br><br>FF9 was absolute trash. Go yiff in hell, faggot fuck.</br></br></br></br>  <br>fkn ryt m8, ff9 shits on all</br>  pokemon is overrated as fuck  <br>FF5 is the best, it's not overly long unlike every game after 6 and it also has the best villain(Exdeath) and best overall FF character(Gilgamesh)</br>  Final Fantasy X-2 was the best game ever created. Who the fuck do you think you are, op?  <br>YOU FUCKING FAGGOT RETARD!!! Stop pretending you actually know shit about anything. You are such a fucking idiot. I love it when stupid faggot little dipshits with tiny dicks like you spew worthless shit from that asshole you call a mouth and are totally wrong. Suck my big hairy cock you pathetic know-nothing little queer bait. I'll make you wear a fucking dress. I'll invite a pack of prison niggers to rape your ass in front of your family so they can see what a pussy faggot you are, then I'll piss on you. What a stupid fag you are. hard to believe. Fag.</br>  <br>FFVII isn't that great circa 2015, but it was the best game of its era, no other game of the 90's could stack up</br>  <br>The fact that this game is overpopular pisses me because commercial shits are the death of any form of art.<br><br>BUT, this game was really excellent. I was one of my favourite games back then when it was released and I had no idea it was popular (because no internet, etc).<br><br>You can't say a game is "the best" because it's too subjective, but this game is among the bests, yeah.<br><br>Talking about FF. To me, story-wise, FF6 was the best. And just after FF7.<br>For the rest, FF7 was the best. <br><br>These good games are collector, if we can call it like that, because Square now only do full shit and won't do anything good.<br><br>The "remastered version" of FF7 didn't make me happy anymore actually.<br>I was so happy when I learned there would be a new version at the announce of the PS3 a few years ago.<br>But they fuck with people, they troll, and they only release commercial shit, so it they do anything about it now, they will just ruin it so they can just put it in their ass.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this<br>1997 you got your moneys worth that's for sure</br></br>  <br>Are you retarded? <br> too many random battles <br>No<br> many side quests <br>No<br> lots of grinding <br>It takes 2 or 3 hours to max lvl up 3 characters and their materias and its solid waste of time, since emerald and ruby are gone is second round of fight...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>NO. Nothing atlus, enix, sony, or capcom ever came close to what this game is. Its great, but only Bethesda, bioware and Squaresoft have made rpgs of this caliber.</br>  Anyone got the roll/fap chart for the ff3 job classes?  FFVII is definately over rated. It's a fucking great game, but kinda over rated. <br>But not even close to the most over rated game ever, that would be God of War, generic hack and slash with nothing really great about it.</br>  I didn't own a console when this came out, so I never got to play it. I tried playing it around the time I got a ps3, but the graphics are so bad that I just can't do it.<br><br>To me, it seems extremely overrated. Might have been amazing during its time, but doesn't hold up to anything today. Even it there is a remake, the gameplay is tired and played out.</br></br>  I remember my mother buying it fot me from eb games. The timeframe was sometime in maybe 2001-or 2. I was in 7th grade. I played it all day and all night. Didn't sleep until daylight. That was my first time staying up all night. I then passed out and woke up at 11 pm when my mom got home from working get shift at waffle house. It was the best birthday present I ever received. I'm not in touch with either of my parents anymore because they have too much poor drama. Thank you /b/ for reminding me that my sorry excuse for a mother actually once did something that will stay with me forever.  <br>Rikku made my dick hard.</br>  <br>This. But<br> Many side quests are just a hassle to complete. <br>That's FF in general for you.</br></br></br>  <br><br>God of War is THE hack and slash. It's the definitive hack and slash game. All other games are generic copies of this one.</br></br>  <br>nice</br>  <br>It was pretty good. Nothing beats Legend of the Dragoon though.</br>  <br>volition made The Summoner which is one of the greatest rpgs in my opinion, it has an authentic D&amp;D feel<br><br>if you didn't play it you might as well not though just because it came out in 2001 and it's 2001+14</br></br></br>  <br>Guess you never played onimusha series or devil may cry</br>  <br>Trolling the dmc fans. Nice b8</br>  <br>Except for 4 6 and 8. Trigger, cross and xenogears</br>  <br>Final Fantasy is a trash series.<br><br>outside of FF7 and FF Tactics, the series caters to faggot neckbears who have no taste and who shop at hot topic.<br><br>people say FF7 is 'dated'. It's not. They're just faggots who only care about graphics.<br><br>people say FFx is better. It's not. <br><br>FF fans are seriously fucking retarded. I know plenty of them in person, and they're horrid. They're always mall goth weeabos who have shit taste on movies, music, games, etc. If you ever hear anyone say another Final Fantasy game is good, you should probably consider never trusting their opinion on anything. <br><br> Don't watch advent children - it's shit. Any of the FF7 revival stuff from years ago is shit, the remake will probably be shit.<br><br>That being said - ff7, parasite eve, and fft are the high water mark of late 90's RPGs, games, and, I'd argue, commercial art in general. <br><br><br>tl;dr - play it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I liked FF-X the most. I had a Nintendo 64 when people had ps1 so I didn't play 7 for a while  <br><br><br>Hate to agree with feminists but ffx-2 and pretty much all other FF are testaments to how sexiest the video game world is</br></br></br>  <br>lel yeah right. There's not one single aspect of the game that's memorable. Everything about it is generic</br>  <br> THE hack and slash <br><br>what do you know about dynasty warriors</br></br></br>  <br>You know you just wanted to get teabagged by Zidane.<br><br>nigga u gay</br></br></br>  <br>as a FF fan I have to say that a lot of what you said is true sadly. especially about the graphics</br>  Snatcher on Sega CD this fucken game rocked my world and really set off my love of video games. My brother and I played this over and over again. Stupidly I think I traded it in for some other games and got like $5.00 for it!  <br>FFx would have been amazing without faggots like Tidus and Wakka.. replace them plus a better ending it could have been one of the best games ever made.</br>  <br>Seriously anyone got this? Or any ff fap roll chart?</br>  <br><br><br>DMC and Onimusha aren't true hack and slash like God of War. Onimusha and DMC controls are limited and have other gimmicks that don't make it pure hack and slash.</br></br></br>  <br>12 year old me had the strategy guide and I beat my fuckin' dick to Rikku every god damn night</br>  I'm I the only one who thinks this game is WAY overrated?<br><br>  Definitely the worst of the series </br></br>  <br>It really is one of the greats. You can't deny it. <br><br><br>FF8 is like watching gay emo porn with no nudity for 30 hours.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Best in the series and my personal favorite game</br>  <br>i've been playing this the last couple of days.. i gotta agree. i'm up to the part where you rescue aeris from the building and holy FUCK is it boring. ff8 never bored me like this and it's supposed to be worse? i don't get it</br>  <br>I think this is bait</br>  <br>Woah now. Those are all great games but Xenogears is over rated as fuck. Yes it has a cool combat system, awesome sprites, epic soundtrack. But that story is too nug of a mind fuck. And the fans of that game usually can't explain what the fuck is going on without revisiting a wiki. Now I'm not calling you out at all, but the fans of the game do it no service recommending it to casuals.</br>  <br>all of what you listed are in just about every jrpg. That's what makes them jrpgs.</br>    <br><br> I tried playing a ps1 game on a ps3, an old as fuck ps1 game mind you, one of the first 3d games on the platform <br><br> I didn't like it because the graphics were bad for some reason, its clearly overrated despite me never finishing disk 1, understanding the story or really getting into the meat of the game <br><br>Sometimes I wish people would at least attempt to understand the subject of an opinion they are forming</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Best game of the time. It has great story elements that allow sequel developments to be nice. I played it to death for about 3 years... now I never want to see it again. I like the CGI movies and later developments. Best game ever? At the time, yep. Now? Debatable. Gameplay is so-so.</br>  <br><br>tfw I had a semi-crush on eiko</br></br>  This abortion  Not best. But I'd say zeppelin or floyd level for gamers 25 to 35  It's really easy to spot the haters from the dissenters in this thread<br><br><br>don't tell me how to live my life faggot</br></br></br>  <br>Faggot</br>  <br>Fucking this. I couldn't even get my schmeckle hard by tying rubber bands around my scrotum. I couldn't even flick them to get aroused. I wanted to see some serious butt sex but it was like another shoah, nobody delivered.</br>  <br>Rikku had that effect on everyone.</br>  <br>Its a pretty good game not the best of all time though</br>  Final Fantasy was good for its time but I just dont think young people today really give a shit about these games.<br>They were great time sinks when you were like 12 but that's only because kids back then didn't the options kids today have.<br>Kids will just think it's "okay" and older people will be filled with lamentation and self-loathing that they're still playing video games at fucking 30.</br></br>  <br>FF7 is a good game. Not the best game ever made, certainly not the best FF game, but not the worst or most over rated game either.</br>  <br>succinct and correct.</br>  <br>Honestly I hate nothing about still playing video games and hope to do so til I die</br>  <br>name a better final fantasy game and explain why it's better. <br><br>protip, you're fucking wrong.</br></br></br>  <br>Now hold on there faggot. Thats like saying jack Nicholson is just a person.</br>  <br> no angsty characters <br> command failed, Dagger can't concentrate <br> bitch doesn't talk for half the game <br>right..</br></br></br></br>  <br>This is true. You had to be back when it first came out, sitting there without a viable internet to obtain it from, no emulator just the PS1 and all the time in the world. This is the only way you could ever appreciate a game like this or Super Mario RPG. Today's kids would never, ever get it because they have so many options available to them they aren't actually real gamers. lol</br>  <br>FFXI</br>  <br>Wakka was still "okay". His design and weapon sucked but he had a personality.<br>Tidus was shit though. But he's not really worse than Zidane...<br><br>And when you see all the shit they released after, like FF12 and the worst "hero" of history that made you just want to kill it instead of controlling it (to only talk about one thing, because everything about this game was shit), you understand that FFX was still in the "good game era". <br><br> Every FF released after FFX was pure shit and don't even deserve to be called "Final Fantasy". <br> Squaresoft died long ago and now they're just a bunch of fucking niggers trying to make money by all means, even if they ruin everything nice and piss all their fans. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>probably true. it was paced for a pre-internet/smart phone world. <br><br>does that make it dated? yeah, if you have weapon's grade ADD.</br></br></br>  <br><br>you've dressed like this at some point in your life, haven't you?</br></br>  <br> no u.</br>    <br>I like FF5 better because it has the god teir job system that lets me roll with any party I want. FF5 gameplay blows FF7 gameplay out of the water. Custom materia is no match for the ability to out white mage archers on back row and black mage monks in front.</br>  <br>Kek no I didn't. I just liked the game.. I'd fuck her</br>  <br>Has anyone ever seen people wear pants like this in real life ?<br>I just refuse to believe people would wear that.</br></br>  <br>I do not trust you, you crusty bastard</br>  <br>God forbid a company wants to make money right?<br><br>You ever think that faggot gamers are the problem?<br><br>gamers want something new and fresh so a studio tries to deliver, game comes out and the gamers bitch "hurr durr, why didn't they keep this and that the same?"<br><br>the "good game era" is what you get a nostalgia boner over, the kids now will say that the games now are the "good game area"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shut the fuck up you stupid fucking crab. We can see through your amphibious lies.</br>  <br>My boss wears this shit in his off time</br>  <br>this Rikku is not the true Rikku.<br>It's the fucking deformity they released in X-2 when they already gave up on making nice things and only focused to make money.<br><br>I finished that game at 100% to have an objective vision, and this game shouldn't have existed.<br>The story is pure shit.<br>The characters are pure shit.<br>The musics are shitty (Uematsu already left when this game was made).<br>The gameplay was shit.<br><br>And the "relooking" of Yuna and Rikku just raped the first original characters and look like pure shit. <br><br>Fuck, it's like taking good food some clients finished to eat, shit on the remainings and re-serve it to the others, saying "the shit is hot so it's something new you can eat".</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>My ex girlfriend had a pair of bondage pants.<br>Of course she always wore little boys underwear.</br></br>  <br>And you make less money than him. How does that feel?</br>  <br>12 is better than all</br>  <br>Fuck out of this thread you crab!!</br>  <br>Ill regret buying X-2 the rest of my life</br>  <br><br>Did you even read what I wrote?<br><br>OP is asking if FFVII is the best game EVER. It clearly isn't.<br><br>I've played enough of it and enough of other FF games to know what its about without wasting anymore time on it. I give it props for being the one of best games of its time. But its gameplay was only good for that time. FFXII gameplay is played out now. Like I said, even with a remake that brings it into today's time, it still won't be that good.<br><br>There are gameplay that do past the test of time. Counter-Strike and Star Craft come to mind. Yes, I'm counting their upgraded versions too.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You are trying to tie the story into the fact that grinding, side missions, and prior knowledge can be the difference between 14 or 20 hours of gameplay. It isn't, of course it is a different little snowflake in a blinding snowstorm of jrpgs. That's why people still play them, different combat systems and stories. Not taking away from the game in any way.</br>  <br>I absolutely trust you because you are a crab. You seem like an oppressed minority that needs representation against discrimination of crustaceans. Anti-crustaceaites.</br>  the only reason ff7 is so fucking popular is because the story was about life and death and that shit was legit as fuck, yall fukkas took the b8 way 2 hard in this thread. ffx was shit because tidus and wakka and shitzball go fuk ur self and whiney cunt yuna god fuck off ya twat fuckin bitch and lulu that fukn tit lezbin ass emo cunt fuck, anima was the real hero of fukin ffx, ps get fukt  <br>you know what had a better job system than ff5? FFT.<br><br><br>Look, FF 4-6 are OKAY. they're not great. they're typical bullshit RPG games. you go from town to town, do quests, collect shit, get in some fights, yadda yadda.<br><br><br>You do all these things in FF7 too. And sure, most 14-year-olds would probably be bored with the random battles or wouldn't be impressed with the graphics. <br><br>FF7 has a special "x-factor" that makes it special compared to other games for people who aren't fans of FF in general.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>FFX was a lot more overrated.<br>Not stating FFVII was the best game ever either, it was my first game I ever personally owned. It was a great game.<br>FFX was utter shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Mah Niggggggaaaaaaaaa!</br>  If any game deserves a remake or sequel/prequel its this one.  <br>overrated imo</br>  <br>It was only popular since PS fags got excited about their first off game.</br>  <br>FFX-2 Rikku looks way better than FFX Rikku.<br><br>Although that's the only thing good about FFX-2.</br></br></br>  <br>Well pretty crappy at the moment pic of my legs in my current career uniform</br>  <br>Actually, Super Mario Land 3 is the best game ever, and the best RPG ever is Lunar SSSC. FFVII is 2nd best, followed by Breath of Fire 3 and legend of Dragoon</br>  <br><br>holy shit i forgot about 12. 12 is actually kind of a cool game. Lots of people hated on it for a lot of dumb reasons, but you know what, 12 was solid. kind of unremarkable, but solid.</br></br>  <br>Also, Galuf goes out like a badass by standing up after a party wipe, tough talking the final boss then proceeding to kick his ass single handedly all while never giving in to hate. <br><br>FF7 has Aeris dying like a bitch and Cloud spending to much time crying about Zack to notice that Tifa wants the d.</br></br></br>  <br><br>The most overrated game/brand is Zelda.<br><br>FFVII is a very good game.</br></br></br></br>  I liked the storyline of Chrono Trigger better, but going back and playing it the story seemed a bit lame.<br><br>Probably the same would happen to FF7, but the biggest issue was the random battles when all I wanted to do was travel.<br><br>It was a great game for its time, but it aged worse than the sprite-based games like FF5 or CT imo.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Queers like that are defending our country? Shit we might as well surrender. They can't protect shit with their stupid fucking katanas</br>  <br><br>This, got stuck at one part when I was a kid and stopped playing. Would love to try it again though.</br></br>  <br><br>The materia system is just like the job system with more customisation, it allowed you to target the materia depending in the strengths / weaknesses / abilities you wanted that character to have</br></br>   You don't get to talk shit about XII unless you've killed this monstrosity. <br>I've been playing these since i was like 8, started with VII and this bastard takes the cake as hardest fucker there is. <br> Ultima weapon from VII is a close second </br></br>  FFXIV ARR BEST FF AMIRITE THO  <br>You fucking nigger, this is because of faggots like you that we see so much shit nowadays.<br>Because now that videogames are overpopular, you see underage faggots with no taste that will buy every shit released because they don't know what is cool and what is shit.<br><br>Square RAPED their license, and everyone agrees with it.<br><br>They killed all their old fans just to make "popular games" that has nothing to do with the other FF to make money.<br><br>They should have called it another name than Final Fantasy since it has nothing to do with any FF, but they chose to keep the name just because they'll use the reputation and the license to sell more.<br><br>They only sit on their reputation and they release fucking shit and try to sell by all means.<br><br>It's not a question of nostalgia. I don't think "things were only better before".<br>But for the Final Fantasy, Squaresoft went full retard and killed it.<br><br>I was one of the biggest fans back then, the FF games were my fav games. Now enough is enough, they did shit SO many times they prove they're not able to make anything decent.<br><br>They're just good to do COD-shit-tier games.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I like it when girls wear no bras.</br>  <br>i loved ff7<br><br>its one of my favorites in the genre<br><br>star ocean until the end of time had a just as good story line if not better.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>12 was my favorite so far. If a remake comes out on ps4 only, I will buy a ps4 just to relive that game in next gen graphics.</br>  <br> Ultima weapon from VII is a close second <br>He's the easiest optional weapon anon come on.</br></br>  <br>Plus it was one of the first mainstream polygonal RPGs which added to the 'wonder' of it all, but look like smudges today.</br>  <br>I don't have a katana. I do however possess a set of skills. Skills I have acquired thru a long career. Skills that make me a nightmare to people like you. If u take that back. That will be the end of it. I will not pursue you I will not hunt you. However if u keep acting like a fag I will continue to post dank names and insult you.</br>  <br>12 gets a lot of hate, but I actually think it was in the top 3 FF</br>  <br>fk u and fk ur katana. dont even BRING dank memes into this scenario</br>  <br>12 is definitely in my top 3</br>  <br>Yeah but I meant VIII<br>Ruby as a pain in VII and emerald with his underwater bs</br></br>  <br>Same here.<br><br>When I saw the cover I was like "wtf man. They're serious?" <br>But then I still bought it, thinking it would probably be good since it's square and I shouldn't judge a book by its cover.<br><br>And then I understood the meaning of "regret".</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not to mention the insane combos possible.<br><br>http://www.icybrian.com/games/ff7/m<wbr>ateriacombos.php</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>wasnt 12 the one with that stupid cat girl thing and the judge</br>  <br>Moron from GameFAQs detected!</br>  <br>I do wish I had a katana tho. I do appreciate how they were really good for cutting down un armored civilians.</br>  <br>The materia system was the best augmentation system in any FF game ever.<br>added effect hades ftw</br></br>  <br>And i assume you meant omega weapon because even in VIII he's not too tough.</br>  <br>Yes but it also puts you in a position where the main character is basically a nobody and in the grand scheme of things, you're not really important.</br>  Playing 12 right now. Classic.  In high school when FFVII came out played the shit out of it the first few weeks<br><br>star ocean second story<br>xenogears<br>final fantasy tactics<br>tales of destiny<br><br>all must play PS1 games of the 90's</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The main questline is longer than that of most games. There's a ton of replayability. Bosses are consistently challenging and the game throws curveballs and sidequests all the time.<br><br>These days, though, I couldn't be fucked to play it again. It's got those resident evil camera angles and super low polygon count. It had a time and place, as people are saying. It certainly had a huge effect on my childhood!</br></br></br>  <br>Its not a classic</br>  <br>4X cut <br>Knights of the round<br>Copycat<br> I wins the game </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>And fuck you Fran was dope</br></br>  looks like the game industry is fallen prey to hollywooditis. instead of creating a new concept that blows away anything that came prior, let's just rehash a bunch of nostalgia shit thus destroying our affection for the original and making us feel lukewarm towards the new. nostalgia must die and we must move forward. sage star trek sage ff7 sage jurassic park sage sage sage  I'd like to see a FF9 remake. Even if it won't ever beat the nostalgia of the original, it would still be something new and depict the world in FF9 in full HD glory<br><br>I've seen a difficultry mod of FF9 to make it more challenging but does anyone know of a FF9 that focusses on makin it more fun by reworking the side quests and/or making the rewards less dull to obtain?</br></br>  <br>To me faggot</br>  <br>Probably it's been a while since i went through that one just cause I can't stand the load times on any of the old games anymore, but I know this bastard was in Ultimecias castle at the end and had something to do with a bell and an organ.</br>  <br>She made everyone's dick hard. Even little clitties got hard, I'm sure of it.</br>  <br>You don't decide what is classic.</br>  <br>i mean, if you took the time to get a gold chocobo you probably deserve to 'win the game' you autistic faggot.</br>  <br>I only want faster combat. That's all, really. I love the game, but I can't force myself to play it again (cos, you know, combat)</br>  <br><br>If you care about graphics to that extent, then yes, to you it probably isn't the best game in the world. It's subjective, however there are plenty or reasons beyond its graphical issues for why people view it as the best game ever made.<br><br>Really? you played the game and other final fantasies enough to get what the story is about despite being completely unrelated to any other game in the series, in every single way and the main arch of the story not developing untill the second disk? Fuck off.<br><br>Neither of which were released on ps1 at the very beginning of the 3d era, the test of time has not been nearly as long, its like calling star fox shit because of the Polygons</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It wasn't that hard...</br></br>  <br>try to comprehend fag. It's a classic to me.</br>  <br>Microsoft decides what's classic.</br>  <br> Implying People didn't gameshark the fuck out of that game. </br>  <br>You are not the deciding factor of what makes anything classic</br>  <br>Get out kid</br>  <br>Yeah that's the one.</br>  <br>Go play Final Fantasy XIII and fap to lightning you fucking faggot</br>  <br><br>Samefag?</br></br>  <br> implying we didn't actually enjoy video games and weren't desensitized by the instant gratification mentality of todays vidya. </br>  <br>LOL then what the fuck is the point. If you're arguing that the materia system was simple because KotR and Mime broke the game, you can't ignore that KotR and Mime are <br><br>REALLY FUCKING HARD TO GET AND ONLY POSSIBLE ON DISC 4. <br><br>to come back and say <br> hurr durr gameshark <br><br>what are you even trying to argue? that the game was easy if you gamesharked it?
