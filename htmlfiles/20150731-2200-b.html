[ Has anyone over 18 ever successfully enlarged their dick?<br><br>I've been looking at some info online and it seems like with pe exercises it might actually work. Can anyone say whether it's true or total b.s. And if it's b.s. why do non profit sites exist?</br></br>    <br>OP, you can try the enlargement and report if it works. Because I surely know it doesn't work. Unless you're only looking to extend it with very weak erections. Then you will get a long hose that no girl will like to touch it.</br>  <br>Bathmate makes my shit fat af. The thing in the picture will make it longer<br>Legit</br></br>  <br>Just be happy with yo dick bro, there's like 5000 bitches out there waitin for that specific dick, just gotta go find em.</br>    its b.s and its dangerous to use it might stop your dick from working  <br>what age were you when you started and how long did it take for what kind of gains? is the bath mate just temporary?</br>    <br>i was 19 when I bought bm and sizegenetics or whatever and I use them just a few times a week and its permenantly bigger. Although the temporary gains from bathmate will always make it even bigger than your base. I'm 22 and it was 5 inches girth and now it's 5.5. I don't use either enough to get length significantly longer but when I did, for like month, I went from 6.8 inches to 7.4</br>  <br>Meant for u</br>    This better be a ruse. <br>There is nothing in the world that will enlarge your penis. If there was every man in the world would be using it and everyone would know about it. <br>even if there was a method that only worked with 1% of men. EVERYONE WOULD USE IT.</br></br>  <br>:-----DDDDDD best post</br>  <br> sizegenetics <br>thanks man i never really believed in this stuff before but it seems like it could work and i have a friend who did it a long time ago and he said it worked for him so i figured i'd try it out<br><br>any tips on using an extender.. and is there any chance the extender would make it more narrow? or does it increase both?</br></br></br></br>  <br>thats like saying everyone in the world should have a gymnasts body because they can work out</br>  They do surgeries for it in Korea, but I can imagine there are numerous short and long term medical complications like circulation problems, infections, having a creepy looking dick, etc. <br>You'd be better off learning how to eat pussy really good tbh. You need to learn to accept this as a who you are and try to better yourself as opposed to trying to be something your not.</br>  <br>I really barely use it but I hate how it slips out after a while if you go too much past your limit so maybe get one that prevents it from slipping or google it</br>  <br>This post, holy shit hahahah. God I love summer.</br>  <br>No its not, working out takes time and effort, and thats why most people don't have a gymnasts body because they don't have the time/motivation to put the work in. A quick way to get a bigger dick without time, effort, or other health complications would be incredibly popular.</br>  Is there any cream that works  <br>im alright with what i have it would just be nice to be a little more secure or go slightly above average</br>  <br>these do take time and effort</br>  <br>Penis size only matters slightly and only in the mind of guys in their head about themselves. If it wasn't so frowned upon and women actually needed bigger penises and encoursged it then yea everyone would buy it immediately for every kid on their 12th birthday</br>  <br>Yeah and they don't even work, thats why nobody actually believes you can make your dick bigger by stretching the skin.</br>  <br><br>Hate to break it down for you, it doesn't work. Extending != actual penis size. The blood that will be needed to keep the penis in full erection won't be enough because it's extended and the extended part will most likely have low to none amount of capillaries and blood vessels. On top of that there will be a lot of tearing and damaged nerves.<br>Best regards, someone who extended the dick and now sad about the damage...</br></br></br>    I've added 1" in length and 0.5" girth using the bath mate. I rarely use the stretcher because it makes the tip of my dick numb.  <br>yeah i go to gym and take food supplements: creatine and tst. my dick got longer since then. but i think the workout only could enlarge your dick 'cause your level of testosteron gets higher during it</br>  <br>lol shrimpdick</br>  They don't work OP. There is no current way to make your dick bigger without causing damage that would make it unusable or aesthetically pleasing. There are ways to make your dick "appear" bigger; like losing weight or having a six figure paying job.  <br>If you're stupid and insecure enough to believe that you can make a successful, positive change in the length of your penis, then please go ahead and try.<br><br>For those of you who are just curious, the penis is a tissue that stops growing with you. It is the size that it is and any attempt to make your dick bigger will either injure you, go unsuccessful, or even both. Don't be stupid.</br></br></br>  Seriously though why is there no way to make your dick bigger? I mean we can put a man on the moon but we can't make a little floppy piece of tissue bigger? You'd think scientists would be hounding on this shit cause you know the person who discovers it is going to be the richest person alive.<br><br> inb4 it's not important <br>It's literally the most important thing.</br></br></br>  <br>Theoretically, what if you did it and did blood doping while doing it to increase blood volume of the body?</br>    <br>This. Increasing blood volume on it's own would probably increase dick size and erections wouldn't it?</br>  <br>Let me tell you about a secret technique.<br>if you don't care about the size of your dick you are perfectly fine. Why would you need a bigger one.<br>(Ofc only if your sick has a normal size, if it's really tiny, so 10cm or less, than you are fucked)</br></br></br>  it works just take long time to get it big we talking about years  <br>Mine is big but I want it huge. Same thing as girls with huge boobs wanting implants just for the fuck of it.</br>  <br>But girls show their boobs everyone in public, your dick can only impress girls after you got them already to the point they open your pants. So this is like cheating in a game after you already won it.<br><br>So I don't really see a point in enlarging the penis</br></br></br>  google pegym<br>takes years but, possible.</br>  <br>I'm fine with my dick anon but i'm talking about the micro penis guys out there. They take off their pants and the women laugh in their face and basically tell them to fuck off. No man should have to deal with that shit.</br>  Yes it works <br>simple no bullshit breakdown<br><br> Jelq and stretch  <br> order a pump and clamp and while youre waiting for them to arrive research your fucking shit <br> less is more DO NOT OVER DO IT YOU WILL MAKE NOGAINZ AND HURT YOUR DICK <br> form is better than force if youre properly doing something it will not hurt <br> EQ (erection quality) is everything, if youre getting harder, staying harder and getting more erections at night youre probably doing it right <br> heat is important, the dick becoms elastic at about 107 degrees that why you have better flaccid hang after hot showers and hot tubs <br><br>it works but it might take months to find a routine that gets you gains and a lot of people get impatient and do stupid shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>its all bullshit,\the only way you can enlarge your peen is through surgery and that gets you like an .5-1 inch tops<br>faggot op for believing this shit</br></br>  <br>Got an email with penis enlargment pills. Buy them for 100$. Now I got 3 inches of washington monument.</br>  <br>they are fucked. simple as that. err, they are NOT fucked i mean.</br>  <br>Since it isn't permanent, how often do you have to use bm?</br>  Jelqed intermittently from the age of 16 to 21. Went form 6x5 to 8.5x6 and stopped jelqing cause of "turtling". Now at a permanent 7.5x6. My curved peyronies banana cock is less of an issue too. <br><br>Just warm up, go slow, don't force it or you're looking at permanent nerve and tissue damage.</br></br>  <br>Kek</br>  <br>Lol look at Shane Diesel and Jack napier the porn stars. THey have a huge fat cocks and never go fully horizontal erect and still make girls squirt with their huge soft meat Cocks.</br>  Lets have an God-tier albums thread.
