It was initially a mystery free demo that came out on PS4, which when beat had a trailer for the now cancelled Silent Hill sequel by Hideo Kojima and Guillermo Del Toro, with Norman Reedus playing the main character. It's not really known how much the demo really had to do with the final game as far as the story/themes/gameplay go, since it was intentionally misleading.<br><br>It was a dream come true for horror fans. But thanks to Konami, it is never to be.

However, when I grew up and it comes to taste, this is some good shit.</br>  <br>I was just kidding buddy. What hot sauces do you have up there? You said THREE? That's weak. Pics?</br>  I work for a food distributor, and sell many of these to grocery stores. Sriracha crushes the others in normal stores. Tapatio sells well in Hispanic markets as well as Valentina sauce. I also handle Louisiana. Its bigger in southern usa  <br><br> &lt;--- Not me.<br><br>The hot sauces in my supermarket are Tobasco, Frank's, and President's Choice Aged Cayenne.</br></br></br></br>  <br> /b/ - Random <br> The stories and information posted here are artistic works of fiction and falsehood. <br> Only a fool would take anything posted here as fact. <br><br>I was going to post this. Tabasco just has an over powering vinegar flavor if you ask me. Crystal, while not as hot, has a much better 'flavor'. <br><br>New Orleans fag</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What about Cholula. It's pretty big here in Houston. I went to Austin recently and they had a drink that used it that was actually good.</br>  <br>I don't care for it, as it's a sauce for chicks who can't handle heat. However, it has a very significant portion of the US market share. You, therefore, are an asshole and a faggot.<br><br>Here's an RB market study for proof:<br>https://www.rb.com/documentdownload<wbr>.axd?documentresourceid=217<br><br> thIs is a mans sauce. Delicious and dose accordingly for heat. </br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wow. Sick burn, dude.</br>  <br>This. Delicious as a dip mixed with miracle whip too.</br>  <br>I totally agree and the same reason I don't care for most LA sauce... too much vinegar.</br>  Tabasco for solid food, Sriracha for soups, stews, dumplings and noodles.  <br> Tabasco just has an over powering vinegar flavor if you ask me <br>Anyone that can taste would say the same.</br></br>  <br>What's your favorite that you've tried</br>  I am so glad no one has said Cholula!  <br>You're right. This is amazing. I like the green one</br>  <br><br><br>Whoops thought you meant this one. This and the green salsa are superior to many hot sauces I've tried.</br></br></br>  <br>Frank's. We only recently got access to it. It wasn't available in Canada. Mostly it's Sriracha and Tabasco here. Hot sauce isn't really big. Or at least, didn't used to be. I remember twenty or thirty years ago, Tabasco was the ONLY one you could find.</br>  A challenger appears  <br>Another ontariofag Here. Peri peri sauce is the best you can get up here. So good!</br>  <br>Cholula sux!! Tapatio is similar but better and cheaper.</br>  Ausfag here<br>this sounds nasty but by far the best spicy steak sauce there is, try it in a hogsbreath they all have it on there 24h slow cooked steaks</br>  texas pete on bojangles wings. frank's on home made wings  <br>depends on what I'm putting it on. All 3 taste very different and have different purposes. <br><br>In general though<br>Sriracha &gt; tobasco &gt; franks<br><br>I do like buffalo stuff, but franks by itself doesn't taste that great.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This, or pic related</br>  franks. put a lot or a little and it's the same hotness  <br> I remember twenty or thirty years ago, Tabasco was the ONLY one you could find. <br>Dark days</br></br>  <br>Frank's is good, but I mainly use it for dipping (fries, chicken, w/e).<br><br> ^ That shit on your food though is killer. Good flavor but a hell of a kick. <br>Does hot sauce even go well with traditional food up there? Here, Frank's is strictly for wings and chicken tenders.</br></br></br></br>  <br>nice meme</br>  <br>Ah see that one I haven't heard of, and it's got my name (Fernando). Would you say it's hotter than Frank's?</br>  <br>Franks for wings, Tabasco on eggs and Bloody marys, and Siracha on pretty much everything else.</br>  <br>Even today, you're lucky if you can find jalapenos in your supermarket. Upscale supermarkets might also stock dried habaneros and Thai finger peppers, but nothing else.</br>  <br>Not spicy at all, bull shit sauce.</br>  <br>Naw its not hot at all. It just tastes amazing! Best flavor of any sauce I've ever tried. I keep a bottle of maddogs 357 in my glovebox if I want something truly spicy.</br>  <br>This guy's gets it</br>  <br>I don't like either THAT MUCH honestly but the drink was fantastic. gin, cholula, honey, lemon.</br>  <br>All of my this</br>  Frank's only on my morning eggs, but sriracha for everything else.<br><br>Anyone who thinks Tobasco is a decent hot sauce should kill themselves. (Tobasco to other hot sauces is like french's mustard to dijon)</br></br>  <br>New orleans fag here too, work on decatur</br>  <br>franks!<br>sriracha is way too thick for me and when its cold the texture is horrible<br>franks is hot, but not super hot and has a nice taste that isnt overpowered<br>tabasco i can take or leave but franks is always &gt;</br></br></br></br>    <br>I need to keep an eye out for it. I think a hot sauce store may have opened up around here</br>  <br>Texas Pete fan reporting and condoning this message.</br>  Guy who said Tabasco is shit is totally right..siracha, franks, chalula, and lousianna on errything  this shit makes my anus sting for weeks  <br>you have no idea what you're talking about, you semen chugging disease breeding homosexual.</br>  Or make you're own tomatillo or ranchero sauce..siracha is amazinnngg though guys a dank genius  <br>Secret Aardvark is GOAT</br>  <br>this is the only hot sauce to eat with oysters.</br>  <br>Tobasco is pure heat with little flavor<br>Frank's makes everything taste like hot wings<br>Sriracha is sweet as fuck for a hot sauce.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br> spelling Tabasco "Tobasco" <br> expecting anyone to take you seriously <br> mfw </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Crystal is the dirtiest hot sauce I've had. Dirty in a way that catfish is, deliciously dirty.</br>  <br>i like it, but i can barely taste it. i dunno why</br>  <br>After trying this stuff, i never want to go back to store bought hot sauce</br>  <br>tobasco</br>  <br>maybe you have paralyzed taste buds</br>  <br>There's thousands of types of hot sauce which, I agree, are all better than any of the three in the OP, but I think this is about which of the major, easily-available brands is the least unpleasant.</br>  <br>do you only steal your hot sauces from the stores? <br><br>You must be a nigger, this is nigger hot sauce</br></br></br>  <br>toebasco</br>  <br>Good shit right here motherfucker. i'll shove your tobasco shit-sauce so far up your ass you'll be tasting each individual chemical they produce it with motherfucker.</br>  As been said already, different sauces go best on different things.<br><br><br>Love this on Thai food.<br><br><br><br>Awesome stuff. Great if you want some legit heat with flavor that's not chemical tasting.<br><br><br>Truth<br><br><br>Never cared for it.<br><br><br>Yup, Tobasco is nasty, even without the 90% vinegar taste. Not on board with the Crystal though.<br><br><br>Cholula isn't the best, but ok on breakfast sandwiches/home fries.<br><br><br>Yesss numero uno on the Mexican food. Fuck Tijuana Flats and their hot sauce bar. Go to a real beaner restaurant and they'll have this. Fantastic.<br><br><br>Smart man on all counts.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Franks chili &amp; lime</br>  <br>You're the kind of faggot who shoves their petite baton rouge up their ass at the end of the day so you can suck the chocolate off the chilies.</br>  <br>chooses his sauce by how cool the label looks....</br>  <br>This.<br>Fucking casuals.</br></br>  It all depends on what you're eating<br><br>I'll eat Sriracha, Valentina, Louisiana, Tapatio, wasabi, hot sauce from taco bell.. etc. <br><br>Different sauces for different meals really. There is no one winner.</br></br></br></br>  This is faggot's sauces !<br><br>Try one of the naga sauce, this one (on the picture) is my favorite, tasty and realy spicy.<br><br>Tabasco taste like vinegar, it's to soft. Sriracha is a good one for the tast but it is not hot at all. I dont know the Frank's sauce.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Sriracha and Tabasco. Texas Pete is for those who want to pretend that they actually enjoy a little bit of heat on their food but in reality: They don't</br></br>  <br> Go to a real beaner restaurant and they'll have this. <br><br>I live in Phoenix. I know beaner restaurants. I have never seen this shit anywhere.</br></br></br>  <br>Forgot to mention, a long time ago I "let" my ex's daughter (prob 7 or 8 at the time) taste a tiny bit of this. She screamed and cried for 40 min. And not her overboard dramatic crap... she was in some legit pain. I've done some effed up shit, but not sure I've ever felt worse in my whole life than after that.</br>  <br>no, i chose it because it tastes good and i'd recommend it. hell, sometimes, i only eat the sauce. nothing else. it's perfectly chunky yet like a sauce.</br>  I make my own hot sauce.<br><br>Ingredients.<br>10 chillis (I use serrano, but you can choose your preferred one)<br>10 jalapeno peppers<br>2 cloves of garlic<br>12 fluid oz blood from a prepubescent virgin<br>1 finely chopped onion<br>1 tbsp of salt<br>1 tbsp of pepper<br>1 whole goat horn<br>1 goat horn ground into a fine powder<br>2 cups water<br>1 cup holy water<br>1 blessed crucifix<br>1 cup vinegar<br>1 tspn olive oil<br>1 set of enchanted black robes<br><br>Combine chillis, peppers, garlic, onions, salt and oil in a saucepan, put stove on medium, saute for six minutes. Add the water, stirring ocassionally for sixty-six minutes. Between stirring use the virgin's blood to draw a pentagram on the kitchen floor. in each corner of the pentagram add a dash of ground goats horn with the whole goats horn placed firmly in the middle (make sure the pointy end is facing toward the saucepan). Continue stirring until most of the liquid has evaporated afterwhich point put the heat on low. Place the blessed crucifix in the center of the saucepan, put on your black robes (if you haven't already), make sure you have the holy water nearby, open your arms up to the sky and sing:<br>"Confutatis maledictis,<br>flammis acribus addictis,<br>voca me cum benedictus."<br><br>A portal to the Chamber of Guf should open in front of you and lucifer himself will step out to defend it. Quickly splash holy water in its face and while it is disabled shove it out of the way (caution: may cause severe burning on the palms of your hands). MOVE OUT OF THE WAY as souls are drawn out from the portal and toward the blessed crucifix, it is VERY IMPORTANT that you are not between the portal to the Chamber of Guf and crucifix as this can lead to severe cases of posession. After about seventeen ethereal oz of souls have been drawn into the mixture close the portal by singing (with closed body language)<br>"Domine Jesu Christe, Rex gloriae,<br>libera animas omnium fidelium"<br><br>Add the vinegar and then stir.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're the kind of faggot who sucks 10 nigger dicks and doesn't say "No homo" Before and after sucking dicks and kissing your partners.</br>  <br>Me again, <br><br>This is a naga jolokia sauce (the famous ghost pepper), it is not so hot than you can think, but do not eat this stuff before going to sleep. Because if it is ok for your mouth, it is not the same for the stomach (to much oil I think).<br><br>The perfect sauce for a perfect BBQ at noon, but not after :D</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It depends on what kind of food I'm making.<br>The sriracha has a good hint of garlic, wich I like on my turkish/arabic inspired cooking.<br>But when making a chili con carne, I love adding tabasco, because of that vinegar sourness it has. Never tried "franks"</br></br></br>  <br> I know beaner restaurants. <br><br>I am not the other guy. I AM a beaner and I know beaner restaurants. Can confirm they wouldn't have that shit. Real beaner restaurants make their own fucking sauce.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh fuck man tell me about it. I can find jalapenos in maybe 1 of the 3 places near me, and I cant even get proper curry fixings or habaneros or canned Chipotles. But bow down before the 40 different types of bbq sauce and a whole isle of the most generic canned soups.</br>  <br>Around here, when I go to a new place, I leave if I don't see this on the tables. Figured this stuff was universal, but guess it's more regional than I thought.</br>  <br>Crystal hot sauce only son</br>  this shit is good.  <br>seconding this</br>  <br>I'm the other guy. I want to go to where you go. Unfortunately even though I'm in this shithole of a state FL, I'm in too nice of an area for authentic restaurants... but not nice enough to support "gourmet authentic". fml</br>  <br>Loblaws stocks an entire fucking aisle of mustards, but can't be fucked to carry more than two or three types of mushrooms.</br>    <br>Cholula. Mmmmm thats the winner for me.</br>  <br><br>Carolina Reaper is the hottest pepper, not sure why people are so obsessed over naga still. That said.<br><br> :D <br><br>Kill yourself</br></br></br></br></br></br>  sriracha in her chacha  <br>Love this shit in my pho</br>  <br>None of them. there all spik fluid. only hispsters use hawt sauce. god damn faggots. <br><br>should call it FAGGOT JUICE.</br></br></br>  Dragon Cum  <br>YES.</br>  <br> hot sauce is stealing jobs from "Murican spices </br>  <br> suburban pleb tenderfoot detected </br>  franks and louisiana are just pussy tabasco<br><br>sriracha isnt even in the same category, why the fuck are you trying to compare them?<br><br>In fact, this entire fucking thread is filled with idiots trying to compare hot sauces that have nothing in common, like the doublenigger that posted cholula, that shit goes on eggs at breakfast and nothing else, get the fuck out of the thread<br><br>I don't get the craze about sriracha, everywhere I fucking go people talk about it and mix it with shit and put it on everything, personally I think it tastes like shit, I put tabasco on anything I put hot sauce on</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I came here to say thi.</br>  <br>@ the risk of looking like a fag, Sriracha has the best flavor as it's made from fresh ingredients and not from dryed/powdered chilis. Long after the fad is over, it'll still be the best just for this. Also to the fags who eat hot sauce just for the heat, go fuck yourselves, I grew up eating peoples as a toddler. Real good hot sauce has fresh ingredients and a good flavor above the amount of heat it presents.</br>  <br>I'm not looking for the hotter one faggot !<br>I eat only the tastier things. It do not want to eat caustic soda moron, it's not a fucking game.<br><br>MR NAGA is a realy pleasant sauce with just the good amount of spice.<br><br>The soft sauces like tabasco have a strong tast of vinegar, excepted if you are very sensitive.<br><br>So kill yourself, with fuel, acid, or with pure Capsaicin if you want !</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Go to a real beaner restaurant and they'll have this <br><br>I've lived in South Texas all my life. You have absolutely no fucking clue what you're talking about. Real mexican places make their own salsa. You just invalidated all of your other opinions by spewing this shit.</br></br></br>  <br> I grew up eating peoples as a toddler </br>  <br><br>New Orleans as well. Tabasco is too hot. Crystal is the way to go. Where do you work on Decatur?</br></br>  <br> Piri Piri </br>  <br>I was gonna post this. Damn you. Mix this with some sweet chili sauce and you have a great combo. Good for rice.</br>  <br> Tabasco is too hot <br><br>Tabasco is one of the mildest sauces on the market, you legit need to have the tongue of a newborn to find it too hot.</br></br></br>  <br>Frank's for white people food cholula for colored people food</br>  My favorite is chipotle tabasco  <br>Least hot "hot sauce" I've ever had was at Taco Bell. When they finally brought a Taco Bell to the city where I lived, I went down to try it out, expecting it to be awesome after everything I'd heard from Amerifats raving about it. Instead, everything tasted like cardboard. Nothing had any flavours. In a desperate attempt to give it some flavour, I squirted everything with a whole handful of "hot sauce" packets and all it did was make everything wet. It tasted exactly the same before as after.</br>  <br><br>9,7/10,32 for me pesonally. And it has been a while when I last gave something even close to a solid 8.<br><br> Read it <br> Thought about it <br> Reviewed it for the sake of personal interest <br> Loved it </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ya, taco bell is piss weak in general though. There are so many better places for Mexican food.</br>  I use all these for different things. The wimp retardant is wicked hot but has immense flavor  <br>Thanks.<br><br>I don't do it for the praise, but it's still nice to be recognised.<br><br>Now I gotta go make Lucifer some chilli. It's not a necesarry part of the method, it's just the polite thing to do after you take souls from someone else's treasury.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Australian?</br>  niggas por favor.  <br>Taco Bell sucks donkey dicks.<br><br>As to OP's question, Sriracha is probably my favorite because it's hot but practical, and has a taste beyond just heat and salt.</br></br></br>  <br>o man ur so hardcore! even has skull keychain wow! must be sooper hot holy F!</br>  <br>Almost done with the ghost pepper one. The scorpion pepper is vastly superior though.</br>  <br>I don't get people who just want hotness. If all you want is to make shit hot, why not just blast your food with bear spray? I like hot, yes, but I want flavour too.</br>  <br> Go to a real beaner restaurant <br>There's no such thing in the US, unfortunately.</br></br>  <br>Sriracha Isn't a brand you fucking spanner. Neither is Tabasco technically.</br>  <br>Oh no a skull; that clearly was the deciding factor, definitely has nothing to do with the fact I actually want to give a kick to large amount of food instead of having it swim in hot sauce.</br>  <br>The scorpion pepper sauce, at least this brand is delicious, perfect blend of spicy with a bit of sweet, you can actually taste it, the ghost pepper is just a never ending sting and tastes way too much like black pepper. I've had spicy food all my life and I just feel that a lot of food tastes better with a bit of spicyness. Some fruits and vegetables like cuccumbers, carrots and mangos all go great with it.</br>  Flashbang.  <br>does that matter here?</br>  <br>what's Franks?</br>  <br>this<br>or Louisiana.</br></br>  <br>Tobasco</br>  <br>this thread is dildos, Cholula or nothing.</br>    If you guys can get your hands on this, try it with most sweet fruits, it's delicious. Just barely spicy but sweet.  Sriracha is god tier.  Please destroy this guy. He likes to bang unconscious girls at parties. Alex Owens.
