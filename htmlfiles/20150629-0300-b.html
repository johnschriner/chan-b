I wanted to post a pic of the clinic from Flatline, but couldn't find a decent one. <br><br>The mansion from Absolution was nice too, though.

I mean, if I can go to any video game, I could technically go to a Star Trek video game, and just live in the Star Trek universe, which seems like a pretty good deal.  <br>damm i wish i playd oblivion whats the name of the city?</br>  Y'all niggas retarded for not posting this.  <br>you obviously don't know italians</br>    <br>Saria would definitely get it</br>  <br>The Pokemon universe would be awesome to live in</br>  <br>this looks so comfy</br>  this would be alright. explore the stars and clone my body whenever i want  <br>That's Anvil, you muppet.</br>   not choosing this   ME3's Normandy, the whole thing.

There is nothing to do here, there is nothing to eat. I've spent days in the observatory imagining constellations with sexual themes, and I regret to say that I've mangled a few of the books from the library in an awkward attempt to stitch together some kind of human form that I could talk to, at least. But when you are addressing something that has words for eyes and syllables for lips, something precious inside you breaks. What the hell am I doing here? There's nowhere to go. I'm literally trapped here.  <br><br> day 513 <br>I've decided I'm going to end it by falling from a great height. Not sure if I'll use the hydraulic tree of the central tower. But somehow. I'm going to kill myself. <br><br> day 514  <br>Leg broken. Pain immense. Death is coming. But slowly. <br><br> day 516 <br>a pernious full wash. Ever draining from the wallws. Theres the black again</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Read the OP man. One game location for the rest of your life. So one location. The Star Trek universe isn't one location. Vulcan or earth or blue alien girl planet #6, those are locations.</br>  <br>"chicken chaser...he chases chickens"</br>  <br>All for the glory of ALMSIVI</br>  <br> my nigga </br>  <br>I think you mean ash.<br><br>But also enjoy having nubile Khajiit and Argonian slaves. At least, that is if you don't get shanked in an alley by xenophobic Dunmer.</br></br></br>  <br>Actually decided to buy the game on steam, probably more than 5 years since I last played it.<br><br>I hope the nostalgia will counterweigh the old gameplay.</br></br></br>   walking by a pond <br> attacked by a group of frog girls <br> never heard from again <br><br>so sad<br>so tragic</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's kind of bullshit, though. You can walk out of Anvil and visit the Imperial City, for instance. The logic of the universe even demands it. NPC's do that shit in Oblivion. So the caveat is that you have less power than the basest commoner in the setting?<br><br>No thanks, then. I'll just stay here and pass up on this Wishmaster bullshit.</br></br></br>  <br>I like the fact that probably no one here know that game.<br> oldfags are old </br></br>  None of them, i like the sad reality for what it is.  <br>mod it up. <br><br>Modded Oblivion is probably the best in the series and still a fantastic experience.<br><br> OOO <br> MMM <br> live another life <br> no psychic guards <br> travellers &amp; adventurers (and other NPC mods) </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You will never have a girl that will be so much inlove with you that she would go and kill any girls that tries to win you away from her.<br><br>You will never have a girl that is so much inlove with you that she would be obsessed to no end about you and would only think about you and love you and dream about you and do anything and everything with you and for you.<br><br>You will never have a girl that is covered with the blood of her rival and as well drag her dead rival and paint a big red bloody heart to show you how much she loves you.<br><br>You will never have a girl that looks so adorable and cute while holding sharp knife and smiling to you while she is sliding the tip of the blade playfully across your neck making sure to not cut it open and speaking into your ears telling you how much she loves you and that no one will take you away but her only.<br><br>You will never have a girl that will forever stay by your side and love you and make lots of love with you and will fix you food and clean your clothes and help you in everything and anything without question asked whatsoever.<br><br>You will never have a girl that would make sure you are happy and satisfied to no end and as well make sure that no one tries to flirt on you or anything because she would kill them brutally with a cute girly smile on her face and then she would love you more than anything in the world even love you more then her own life.<br><br>You will never have the perfect yandere girl in your entire life.<br><br>Why even live?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Gensokyo.<br>That's all.</br>  <br>this nigga</br>  <br>Second</br>  Solitude or even Falkreath  <br>thanks that made a Nice wallpaper</br>    <br>Geez.

Or, I guess "despise" is probably a better word.  Why would you shack up with someone you're embarrassed to be seen with?  <br>That u dave?</br>  <br>She didn't look as bad 3 years ago as she does now. She was a solid 8 now a solid 0. (To me)</br>  why are you going out with this person if you never liked them in the first place? that just sounds fucking stupid, but not as stupid as wanting to kill yourself over it like holy shit man up and go out there and meet someone you actually find decent<br>you'd think it'd be simple but still people don't get it</br>  is that a trap OP?  <br> Move to Barcelona <br><br>What an adventure! OP was some no life british faggot who never saw a naked woman.</br></br></br>  <br>Has she piled on the pounds? Fuck her off. She is lazy, doesn't love herself and will only get worse</br>  <br>Post pics.</br>  <br> for god knows why. <br><br>look at those eyes man - her life will be more important than anyone elses, she got what she wanted out of you then found something more interesting to her because its something she doesnt understand. She will follow the same cycle of investing in it then moving on, always acting like "no one understands her"</br></br></br>  <br>Couldn't be more right.</br>  <br>then why not be single until you find someone you want to be with and just admit to other girls youre happy to offer NSA sex but nothing serious as opposed to causing more issues for yourself. You know youre gonna end up friendless because youre a huge asshole right? What youre doing is fine, how youre doing it is retarded.</br>  Post pic of said landwhale for comparison. You can omit face if desired. Want to see how bad it is...  <br>i second this</br>  Be a good boy OP and give as a pic of the landwhale  You are a massive faggot, if the only reason you want to commit suicide is a relationship.  You want to kill yourself because of some shitty landwhale?<br>Dumb her bro or if you are too weak to do that just wait till she dies of an heart attack in her late 30s</br>  <br>There's more to it, I'm just not going to spout off about my entire life and issues.<br><br>Just this shit.</br></br></br>  Girls almost always date 'down' atyour age.

A good anti-religion thread will put me in a better mood. Posting what I have. (old shit)                  <br>We've found writings dating back to the Roman empire, Ancient Greece, Early Chinese empire, even predating the Egyptian empire.<br>They all complained about the 'moral decay' destroying civilization.<br>You would think that after 7000+ years of 'moral decay', civilization would be finished.<br>Except it's not.<br><br>Doomsayers just love predicting apocalypse.

Anybody got pictures?      <br>also keep up.. its muslims and white guys now, blacks are back in.</br>  Ask a Greekfag anything.  PAY DEBT, YOU LAZY GREASY GREEK  <br>Well mr.faggot, it all seems that the debt will not be paid. <br>The question is, if the eurozone will stand still.</br></br>  They are definitely not Lannisters, if you know what I mean...  <br><br>bank holiday? atm's closed? do you expect to leave the EU / euro? what do you think your country should do? have you withdrawn your cash from the banks yet? ( i hope you've got your cash and have prepared, food, water, etc.. )</br></br>  <br>Why are you such a debt dodging faggot?</br>  Why don't you lazy faggots pay your taxes. Look what you've done.  <br>Why are you welching on your legally binding deal fucktard.<br><br>Pay up you greasy, hairy, fat fucks.</br></br></br>  <br>whats the general expecations of you greeks in regards to the referendum? Will you vote for or against the offer of the euro-zone?</br>  <br>Why does Greeks does not want to work and does not want emigrants working?</br>  Why is your country so lazy and corrupted?  <br>are you planning on leaving?<br><br>if not what weapons will you carry in the riots/civil war of the next week?</br></br></br>  <br>Wheres our 240 billion?</br>  being lazy for the winnnnn  What's it like to live in a country that used to rule the world and now is a quaint, rather insignificant backwater? I guess we could ask any European that as well.  why do you people look like Turks  <br>By joining the Euro your country got low interest rates and used it to borrow like fucking crazy until they were bankrupt. Is this a widespread cultural stupidity. Like, If you have massive credit card debt and your retired fixed income parents agreed to payoff your loans if you promised to pay them back interest free, would you begin to act responsibly or would you go get two more credit cards and max those fucker out again? Just how entitled are the Greek people?</br>  What will happen if this deal falls through and you can't pay debts?<br>I'm being serious here, what will happen to your country and what has your government said?</br>  <br>This greasy greek is so lazy that he wont even answer our questions.</br>  <br><br>Aren't you ashamed to have stolen money from people? From french people, german people and many others?<br>Did you know that your debt is held by people?<br>Those people asked for nothing, you just took their money and won't repay them.<br>You guys should be ashamed and of course, it also means no countries will ever help you again</br></br></br></br></br>  Do you find it manipulative that people blame banks and the financial crisis for Greeks problems rather than the Greek government for irresponsible borrowing to finance gold plated pension and luxury wage increases while allowing the wealthy to evade taxes?  We've been trolled by op  <br>I love 4chan for posts like this...<br><br>But seriously you wet back greek fat fucks. Answer the question.</br></br></br>  <br>why you don't pay debts?</br>  <br>lol<br>How does it feel to successfully troll the entire world, Greece?</br></br>  <br>Opinion on the GD?</br>  <br>Kek. All my this.</br>  Do you think greece will leave EU / abandon the Euro?  <br>There is right now a bank run.<br>O don't know yet if I should vote YES (to the EU austerity measures) or NO. <br>If we vote for YES, the new austerity measures will make the economy collapse. The taxation will be at extremely high rates, but troika will keep on lending money, so we'll be paying our debts. So, typically, no bankrupcy. <br>If we vote for NO, well, sudden death. Grexit, ank no one knows what's next.<br><br><br>No no plans right now. Many firens have left, many will leave, but I have no plans right now.<br><br><br>The debt can't be paid. Greece is producing nothing, and the austerity has made a lot of bussinesses leave the country. So no, a debt of 320billion cant be paid.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I got extra Milo and more weed and time off work to watch the next few days like a movie. Please don't let your guv pay up, I really want to watch the world laziest riot.  <br> Implying <br>Imp. Lying.<br><br>lol</br></br></br></br>   implying the greek people had anything to do with this <br> implying /b/ have any idea why this debt crisis is. <br>uneducated merucans</br></br>  <br>Why doesn't Greece stamp out it's corruption and widespread tax dodging? Why do Greek people think they can be in a wider European community and enjoy the benefits but are too lazy to pay their taxes to stay in it? Are Greeks special somehow? Why do get get everything they want and throw their toys out of their pram when the taxman comes?</br>  <br>Kek</br>  Will you let the Orthodox Church continue to dip its hands in your government?    just saiyan'  should people who're on holiday there right now be worried?  <br>THEY FUCKING PAID PENSION TO DEAD PEOPLE.<br><br>THEY SPEND MOST OF THEIR TIME TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO NOT PAY TAXES.</br></br></br>  <br>Why do Greeks still think it's ok to retire 10 years earlier than every other country in the EU. You lazy, tax dodging corrupt greasy irresponsible fucks.</br>  HAHAHAH GREECE Y NO U WORK XDDDDD  <br><br>from us here. prob be best if greece voted against further austerity, and told the eu central banks / IMF to go fuck themselves. IMF / central european banks are all a bunch of criminals and fraudsters anyhow. greece is not the only country with insane debt they can never pay back, nearly every major country in the world is near bankruptcy with it's debt.. including the us with 18 trillion in debt, and CHINA... greece may be the canary in the coal mine so to speak, but other eu countries are also in peril.. spain comes to mind. the way forward is to get rid of the global central banks, and for each individual country to re assert it's sovereignty.. let the euro die, establish solid currencies backed by gold for your country... don't let foreign banks enslave your people and run them into deeper poverty with austerity.</br></br>  <br>Russia will come after you.</br>  <br> The debt can't be paid. Greece is producing nothing, and the austerity has made a lot of bussinesses leave the country. So no, a debt of 320billion cant be paid. <br>That wasn't the question. The question was - is this inbred, cultural stupidity? Why the fuck did you borrow what you couldn't pay back? You know, like not reading questions before you answer.</br></br>    <br>there wasn't any question you dumbfuck</br>  The next five years will be bad man.<br><br>But then we'll all be coming over to holiday, because you have history, great food, lovely climate and it'll also be cheap.</br></br>  <br> be Greece <br> fuck up economy <br> promise to fix for 300 billion loan <br> kek only joking <br> fixing economy is hard work and we all just bought new boats on credit, time for a party </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Greek bankers and politicians are crooked as fuck. The people fester in poverty getting paid in IOU's and are owed years of back pay, reducing circulation to disastrous levels and creating a shadow economy, economically destroying the entire country. Greece borrows cash to fix it, but pockets the fucking money without paying the people, putting the cash back in circulation, or winding back up the legitimate economy &amp; generating the tax revenue it needs to survive.<br><br>Same fucking shit Spain, Italy, Ireland, and USA did, only Greece has been at it far longer. This is your future, the rest of you.</br></br></br>  <br> they <br>not the people, the politicians did you neckbeard, calm down before you sprain an ankle</br></br>  The problem is the Greek mindset. They barely work, they have way too many holidays, they have zero ambition, and everything was given to them with no realistic way of getting payment returned.<br><br>In best long term solution is for them to leave the EU and the Euro. Sure, it'll screw with the rest of the EU a bit, but Germany and France are sure to cover everyone and recover quickly.<br>But the real treat comes from Greece going down the shitter. The country will get so fucked and destroyed that as soon as the dust settles they can start rebuilding from scratch, and hopefully the firey passion from thousands of years ago will be ignited once more.<br><br>tl;dr<br>throw Greece out of the EU to let them crash and burn so that they can rebuild from scratch</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>eu give money to banks not to greeks</br>  <br>ummmmm one big NO</br>  <br>Church has a great power here. Both politically and economically. I hope that the crisis will make this power fade out...

Rich ass pensions and wage increases, no taxes for the wealthy, and borrow like a motherfucker to fund it all. And don't blame the government.

If we leave EU, you should prepare for a couple of millions of immigrants to arrive to the rest of EU.

Cry me a river. The system is what it is. You can sit in your Occupy camp and complain, or own bank stocks and laugh at the camps while you live your life. Also, I'm not an American, and Greece shouldn't have borrowed so much since joining the EU to allow a financial crisis to put them here.

You might as well do a frog post because that's what you're on about.</br></br>  <br>Can you read Ancient Greek?<br>How about Koine?</br></br>  Going to Greece next spring cuz fuck it I spent the money so why not?<br>What should I bring?</br>  <br>Here goes, this is true, after khadaffi in libya in the 80s I think bombed a bar in Germany we flew an SR-71 over libya and found out where he was, flew that from England, the cool dudes. We knew exactly where he was and launched some bombers to take him out, launched from England ...</br>  ... however to acheive that target they'd have to fly over France, our SR-71 was already orbiting and was giving information, but the French our so called allies, the frenchistanis denied us permission to fly over their terriroty. <br>...</br>  FUCK THE GREEKS! you malakas have made my job a living hell.<br><br>have fun being broke and homeless, you fuckers deserve it.</br></br>  <br>Why haven't you payed debnits?</br>  So our bombers had to fly all around the place and the french told Khadaffi that we were going in. We nailed one of his degenerate sons but didn't nail him. <br><br>Now fast forward to about 2013 or so and France all of a sudden wants Khadaffi out of office and out of sight, now it's OK. <br><br>That's hypocracy and that's the fucking scumbag frenchistanis.<br><br>So fuck you if you hate the USA, we don't want war, but if some asshole is blowing us up and some eurofag get's in our way, then fuck them both.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Europe cannot be united into one homogenous mega state. It will never happen.<br><br>The ultimate irony is that the EU project will cause the next war in europe. <br><br>It will be Greece today to leave<br>the UK to leave in 2017/18<br><br>The collapse soon after</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  The point of what I wrote is that Greece should shed a tear over some whiney panzy bitches like France or Germany becase they're so full of shit we can smell them from here in the USA.  <br>How could you fuckers allow the Turks to hold Constantinople and for them to set rules on who can be the Patriarch? <br><br>Seriously, shouldn't you guys just have invaded during the end of WWI?</br></br></br>  <br>nice attempt at a deflecton, fagot</br>  How does it feel that Albanians are superior to you?  <br>Super nations a shit. If Europe became a mega homogenous state you'd lose the regional identities and cultures. <br><br>And when one country drank the Jewaid and open the doors to the third world you get what's going on now.</br></br></br>  Just ignore france and germany, if you want to get into it, bill them for being axis during ww ii.<br>Bill them for the lives of those lost.</br>  <br>This chart is bullshit.<br>Netherlands and Germany ranking at 1380 hours per year would mean:<br>34.5 weeks per year at 40h/wk<br>38.3 weeks per year at 36h/wk<br>43.1 weeks per year at 32h/wk<br><br>the average workweek here would be about 38h/wk.... so why do i work about 45 per year if i should only about 36.3 weeks per year?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just remember that it's LIZARD PEOPLE that p0wn u! The USA ignores the UN all the time, that's because their corrupt and full of shit, they have no legal authority over us.</br>  <br>So what? You're bitches work more and goosestep more, does that really matter to anyone except bean counters?</br>  FUCK THE EU<br><br>keep on course my friends<br><br>It's time for Greece to get it's freedom back<br><br>down with the soviet socialist states of Europe, and good riddance!</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>According to the cart I have entitlements that I am not getting right now.<br>I appear to be working 6 weeks extra per year that I shouldn't be working.</br></br>  Greekgfag here also. I just wanted to say that a big percentage of the debt is fake or illegal. (We still pay for loans given more than 100 years ago, and we have payed these debts a hundredfold). Also Europe is fake, never in our history have the Europeans (or anyone else for that matter ) been our ally or friend. Feel free to hit us while we are down, we wouldnt have it any other way. Eleven million middle fingers to all you bitches. Empires rise and fall, wheels keep turning and a thousand years from now ( or 70 years ago ) when the Germans will be suckin nigger cock for a quarter of a Euromark, we will be sitting on the same golden beachers, drinking the same tasty wines, munching on the same delicious salads and laughing with you fuckers for thinking that you are bigger than life. Loosers.    <br> muh nigger entitilements <br> gimmie gimmie gimme <br><br>Here ya go</br></br></br></br>  I bet Grece manages to scrape together just enough for IMF payment on Tuesday, surprising everyone, then we have to wait and see how the vote turns out next Sunday. Never ending story. GTFO Greece, you barely completed any of your obligations attached to previous bailouts, there is no reason to trust you with yet another one.  <br>That's you're fuckin problem, you agreed to that contract. Didn't you read your contract before you signed it are you a moron? <br><br>To me you sound like a fuckin' moron.</br></br></br>  <br>America wont hit ya when you're down. We remember our friends.</br>  <br>I didn't have the OECD backing me up during the talks.<br>But at least I am an employed moron.</br></br>  <br> they stink like gypsys... <br>or maybe the racism disease has taken over your curved nose you jew</br></br>  <br>The problem is that you now are de facto a police state and the U.S of the past only live in old movies. And I fear that when we start digging for oil you will bomb us too.</br>  TURKISH ANON HERE<br><br>BTFO FAGS!<br><br>SELL YOUR (OURS) ISLANDS TO US SO WE WILL PAY YOUR DEBTS!!!<br><br>AHAHAHA<br><br>For all the fuckers claimin Turks are "sandniggers" you don't know wtf are you talking about.

They're the original Buy N' Large.</br>  <br>Nice, what are you working on?</br>  <br>finally a nice one<br><br>i used to drink loads of that shit when i was out all day skateboarding and i spent all my money on weed and my mate covered the booze so we had like.. random change left for other stuff<br>good times</br></br></br></br>  <br>You should have just went to a community college. Mine payed for all of my schooling and I even had extra left over each quarter after buying books and supplies to just fuck around with.</br>  <br>This si bullshit i bet you talk to it too</br>  <br>Random girl thingie</br>  <br>Thanks.<br>Here's the inside view</br></br>  <br>never heard of a community college in Australia?</br>  <br>Nice spelling and punctuation. You only had 9 words and a single letter.</br>  <br>i like<br>although i would hard tube it or atleast make the tubes neater<br>idk they look kinda thin and swirly to me</br></br></br>  <br>Your community college is probably just going on a walkabout with some aborigines.</br>  <br>Drinking honey blue moon, senior trips?</br>  <br>Sounds about right. Btw you barely ever see Aboriginals here, they all just hide in the slums of town. People who say they do are poor as fuck and live with them.</br>    <br><br>I've been changing the tubes yesterday, leak testing today. The previous tubes (Tygon) sucked balls, I've got some Primochill tubing now.</br></br>  <br>looks pretty good</br>  <br>still nice and clean. need to do a loop on my build but im gonna get another gpu and shit first. among other things. will probably be a while since im pretty happy with it as it is. although when there are two cards in here i'll probably want them to run cooler</br>  <br><br>Under-aged<br><br>When ya gonna move out of parents?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't drink it anymore, I water down 100% pure orange juice and stuff like that. But yeah I don't like to trust value range products, but sometimes you need to buy them out of necessity. It gives me bad feelings to not buy middle or upper tier food stuffs though. Like I'd buy value mozzerella and value chicken breasts and not notice much difference between them and the finest range, but it'd still feel off to me<br><br>I don't really trust Asda or Tesco anymore because Asda has gritty, grisly meat and Tescos food smells quite bad, also</br></br></br>  <br>Dude, can I get that duck wallpaper?<br><br><br>I've heard that younger Aborigines, when initiating a walkabout, would just walk off of their job for 3-6 months without saying a word, and come back expecting their job to still be there for them. Funny enough, some employers respect their heritage and allow this.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Jobs are given to them cos we stole their land and now they have privileges, they get their jobs back for the same reason. Most don't work though cos they get a ridiculous amount of centrelink money for being an abo.</br>  <br>At least you don't have to pay off that debt until you earn over 21k a year, right?<br><br>I didn't get into University sadly. All my headstrong friends who thought they were hot shit (especially the rich prick who's Dad bought a house for them all to stay in for the three years they were there) can't get any jobs with their degrees, which was in Computer Science.<br><br>I've considered looking into bodyguard/bouncer/security stuff. Cousin I used to work with quit the family job to become one and he makes like ¬£120 a nightshift in some warehouse place, and makes huge moolah on weekends doing doors.<br><br>Knowing my luck though I'd get stabbed if I tried.<br><br>But yeah he's dumb as a fucking rock and he still passed all his tests and shit. Seemed like it only took like four months to go from nothing to a "career" too.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Abbo sounds like a slang term for a useless downy to me. Probably suits them. I've heard they're ugly as fuck and can't adapt to civilization. This true?</br>  it's ok to be jealous  <br>I think it's 40k a year but i'm assuming i'd be paying it more per month than you. I wanted to become a police officer but I'm a pretty skinny guy and have an eating disorder so can't build up muscle until that's over. Just trying to find something like coles or woolies till i can find a course/job i might actually like doing.</br>  <br>Razer mouse appreciation. I used to have the same one but it died, swapped for Corsair Vengeance and I hate it. Need excess funds so I can buy a wireless Chroma.<br><br>Razer make comfy mouse.</br></br></br>  <br>They are pretty ugly. Dude the only time they come out of their homes is to smoke or ask for smokes, they aren't part of civilization.</br>  I know, i like alcohol  <br>That describes the Native Americans here fucking perfectly.<br><br>We stole their land, so they get special privaleges. They get benefits for living in the tribal areas, such as their own personal police forces, free medical and dental, with their very own facilities, and they don't have to work because they get fuck loads of money every year from the government, but they live in shitty ass beat up houses and trailers, and the tribe lands look like what's left over from a natural disaster, because they blow their money on booze and the casinos. They also have permission to build as many casinos as they want on their land and the tribe members get all sorts of bonuses from it too.</br></br></br>  <br>I imagine this to be like, going over ruins in Civ5 and getting +1 population to your capital city, considering the unhappiness it provides.</br>  <br>Pretty nice piece of work you got there.</br>  <br>You need more White Russians in your life.</br>  <br><br>why do you have gift wrap on your walls?</br></br>  <br>you're paedophile billy, seek help</br>  <br>The average Aboriginal female.</br>  I use a TV for my computer screen this is all the shit I need to tidy up    <br>wish they'd stay in their fucking shithole suburbs instead of coming to the city and fucking things up for the rest of us.</br>  <br><br>I love you guys</br></br>  <br>Looks like an aftershot of one of those vietnam napalm strike victims holy shit<br><br>There's an abbo you can play as in Tony Hawks Underground 2 with the tagline "I'll show you what a REAL Aussie can do"<br><br>I've never felt more ashamed for liking him</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Like, I don't know a single person who has nude anime girls for wallpapers. Like they might have lewd stuff, but nothing actually showing breasts or puss, and I know a lot of perverted weebs.</br>  <br>Dude i was just about to fap and now i cant get it up. Thanks</br>    I moved in like less than month ago things have been really hectic. Its not finished and I am fucking lazy.  <br>Showing off some color</br>  <br>What in the fuck is that?<br><br>Also, I wish emos hadn't fucked with Invader Zim. Now all I can think about is every emo kid ever singing the doom song and posting those shitty depressing images on Myspace.</br></br></br>  <br>yare yare daze</br>  <br>The build itself</br>  I must say, I have cleaned up recently.    <br>Here's mine</br>  <br>i recognize chitoge, hanekawa, lisara, but who is the 4rd girl with brown hair?</br>  home boring home  <br>Langmaid</br>  <br> christmas lights <br> smoking inside <br><br>why</br></br></br></br>  <br>That is a tiny I MEAN TINY Studio apartment You make the space work though.</br>  <br>Lang what?</br>  <br>nice place, great to see people make their small room as cozy and welcoming as possible<br><br>except for the fucking ashtray on the desk jesus christ do you not have a window</br></br></br>  Will rate in my next post  As is  <br><br>really nice. I'd like to see more. do you have some online profile/portfolio?</br></br>  <br>If I could make some suggestions. Take down those christmas lights and line edges of the ceiling with tube lighting.<br><br>Buy matching furnature/shelves, remove the clutter, and buy a dresser for those clothes.</br></br></br>  <br>Sure, here you go man</br>  <br>I have that exact set of logitech speakers, never use it though since I just mainly use headphones</br>  <br>College student, likes raves, British<br><br><br> That screen set up <br>Shit nigger, whatcha doing?<br><br><br>Looks sweet<br><br><br>Them swords, nigga, you larpin or sumthing?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  yeah i got a window but so what  <br>Why can't stoners learn to clean.</br>  <br>like the water bottle and vault boy bobble head, did you buy them off ebay or official sites?</br>  <br>it's because every time they rip a hemp "spliff", their brains slowly turn to mush<br><br>typical weed junkies</br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck is even with that wallpaper? I am massive pervert and I find that mad crazy.</br>  <br> 4rd <br>It's Harrison... Harrison 4rd</br></br>  <br>you have the same exact keyboard as me</br>  u mad crazy? i personally enjoy the best parts of both sanity and insanity. only way to go  <br>No I don't larp. <br>The hand and half is a display sword that I need to mount. The Rapier is basically a prop that I bought for Rennfaire. The axe is a well an axe that no one wanted when I moved. <br>I have other weapons somewhere.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>What's with the transparent computer cases? It's fucking retarded and it looks fucking ugly. <br><br>You remind me of those niggers who modify their cars with lights and shit and think it looks "cool". Grow the fuck up.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>well mine has no side panel on <br>because im showing someone the internals. you fucking nigger</br></br>  <br>so much this</br>      <br>Thinks he is some music producer because he downloaded fruit loops free trial</br>    <br>What are you watching?
