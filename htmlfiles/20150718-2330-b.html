[ Fictionfags, know of any book series like the discworld novels, but scifi?  You don't have to even leave the realm of Pratchett for Sci-Fi.<br>'The Long Earth' with Pratchett and Baxter.<br>It's heavy Sci-Fi.</br></br>  <br>Ah, cool. I'll check it out. Is it like a series or just one book. Cause i'm ideally looking for a series about one main character. Like Rincewind, but scifi?</br>  Stainless steel rat<br>Bill the galactic hero<br>Kris longknife<br>Janetta Carver. <br>Miles Vorkosigan</br></br></br></br>  <br>holy shit it is a series! <br><br>Only 3 or 4 books, but still that's awesome!!!!!<br><br>Thanks anon.</br></br></br></br></br>  Honor Harrington <br>Anything by Daveid Drake. <br>Third world products<br>Conrad starguard<br>In service to a goddess.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It will have a total of 5 books I think, based on my readings of the first 3. I did see that figure somewhere online too a while back.</br>  <br>Wow. He's a fucking con man. That's cool. Never read about about one of them.</br>  Lazarus Long books by RA Heinlein.  <br><br><br>You guys..... You guys, you guys, you guys. <br><br>Ur awesome. I wish i could share a pizza with you. Amazing.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No one remembers the Si Fi from the 80's</br>  <br>Sites like Goodreads can recommend books for you based on what you have read and like.</br>  Also it might be helpful to tell you that the Discworld story does revisit Rincewind after the first two books. He appears many times throughout the whole series (erring on the side of 40 something books I think).<br><br>I think I know you're after 'one' specific character though. I imagine you've already read the Patrick Rothfuss series, if you haven't though, read the before anything else. (disclaimer: it isn't sci-fi, but I'm more of a fantasy guy anyhow)</br></br>  <br>Yea, but u can't trust reviews and search engines dude. Gotta talk to someone who's read the thing. Know what i mean?</br>  <br>So which novels feature him as the primary character? <br><br>I'm reading Pyramids right now. I have to admit, i've only read the colour of magic. My Dad bought it for me in highschool. I've watched the hogfather though, and bits of the Colour of magic. Also listened to an audiobook on youtube about Carrot, the guard in Ankhmorpork.<br><br>Love the universe. But yea, Rincewind in particular. I miss him.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>True. <br><br>But at least they are not part of Amazon. <br>The Amazon recommendations will just take what ever you ave ever looked at while logged in and try to get you to buy books that they have in stock.</br></br></br></br>  weeeeee  Wtf no way      Poor kitty :(  Fucking Ninjas                  <br>holy fucking shit</br>      <br>it was probably hurt, animals have a primary reward function or reflex programmed into their lymphic system that makes them run automatically at that point, like a chicken with it's head cut off. internal bleeding, possible jaw or leg fractures, potentially a concussion.</br>      <br>Depends on the height of the fall. Studies have shown (and I'm being serious about this look it up) that if a cat calls less than 5 stories or more 8 up to 10 it will probably be ok. 6-7 and it will probably not be. It has to do with the way that they relax their body.</br>  <br>god modercyclists are stupid as fuck</br>    <br>Jump, cunt.</br>  <br>God, just imagine if the guy in the front fucks up and the bike falls over.</br>    <br>Sauce?

Am I a reptile god or is this species friendly? I have no reptile pet experience</br></br>    That one is commonly bought as a pet, I forgot the species tho<br>some kind of salamander</br>  <br>a gecko ?</br>  it looks like a common house gecko<br>and yeah, they are pretty friendly</br>  <br>that's a leopard gecko, it's tails fallen off though but it will grow back. they are usually kept as exotic pets,</br>  It's a gecko, or something very similar.<br>You in Aus by any chance?</br>  it's an Eublepharis macularius  I have a turtle too, would he eat him?  Yes a Gecko  <br><br>It's a leopard gecko, what are you 13 years old?</br></br>  <br>Its so damn cute!</br>  I have two of these at home, my female one is pretty shy but the male one let's me hold him too. (I have them like two years now)<br><br>NAME HIM GEX BRUH</br></br>  <br>yeah, the turtle will munch him down</br>  <br>If it's used to eating meat, yeah it would<br>but don't, keep it and name it Gex instead.</br></br>  <br>Thats correct. <br>But this one doesnt seem that Healthy, you should give feed it daylie for 2 weeks, and make sure it gains some weight, then go for feeding every 2 days etc. till its grown up, if its at max. Vol you can go and feed every 3 days.</br></br>  Okay I'm digging this little guy. What should I put him in? A medium tank like I have for my snapper?  <br>it's looking pretty smug</br>  what eat a gecko ?  <br>1metrex0,5x,05 should be fine at first.<br>These Animals normally dont live alone, find out what gender it is, and get 2 more.<br>If you cant find out the Gender, just buy Females. Females matches with everything, but males dont.<br>If you have 2 males they´ll try to kill themselfes.<br>If you have 3 of em, you gotta go to 1,2 or better 1,5mx06 or 0,8 x 0,8</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>thats pretty fuckin dope. he needs you anon! dont let him down</br>  <br> Alright, what should I do for the night? I don't have much</br>  <br>That "like I give a fuck" face on this lizard man</br>  <br>"look at this faggot, dont put me in the same place that thing is."<br><br>op is now a lizard daddy congrats op</br></br></br>  <br>They normally life with higher Temperature, like 28 degrees to 45 under the sun spot.<br>But they will last long enough on lower temperature, they are used to know this for winter sleep. If you can, go to a Store where they sell animals etc. youll get Crickets etc there, take Acheta Domestica if they have them, or meelworms, sorry if i spelled anything wrong, im from germany.</br></br>  He's so done  it's a leopard gecko. they're dumb as fucking hell, iq of a fucking fly, i don't think they 'do' attacking, it's too complicated.  <br>Ups, i linked wrong, nvm.<br>Btw, for the night you dont need to do much, one night wont change that much.<br>If you get to a animal store, get some Desert Sand, and maybe a Heatstone or Mat, if you got some money laying around, otherwise wait until you got money, and buy a whole terrarium. If you need help with finding the correct one, i´ll help you ofc</br></br></br>    <br>Desert sand won't be a problem as I'm in Southern California desert</br>  Leopard gecko it is.  <br>I cant take anymore cute, hes so sleepy! :(</br>  <br>Oh, maybe you can find crickets etc outside too?<br>You could try to get some by urself to feed this little guy, just make sure the size matches with his mouthsize</br></br>  <br>I might have something from a previous thread.</br>  op you must give update on this little guy same time tomorrow!  <br>Opps not this one</br>  Found this and filled it with sand for the night. Unless I find some baby crickets, the ones around this area are too big for him. I'll have to run to pet co and grab some stuff tomorrow.  <br>Wat teh fak m8, are you only getting outside to get some more pets? xD</br>  <br>Its not a leopard gecko dude. I can promise you that.<br>It looks like some hybrid.<br>If its not its own species then its probably a leopard gecko mixed with a common house gecko.<br>Leopard geckos dont have smooth skin like that.<br>I owned 3 leos back in the day</br></br></br></br></br>  I guess he will climb out... It's a gecko you know.. :)  give it something to hide underneath or it'll freak. also gonna need some water.<br>hanging a light bulb over the top would make it the envy of all it's mates</br>  <br>leopard geckos are too gay to climb up glossy surfaces. all they have is retarded little fingernails which cling to things like some kinda flailing spastic.</br>  Only feed the leopard gecko crickets that are no bigger than the width between his eyes. Otherwise it can cause severe discomfort and damage to the animal. 19 year old reptile weirdo with 2 leopard geckos, a crested gecko, a bearded dragon and a corn snake.  <br>what this guy said. geckos will eat meal worms. You can buy meal worms at pets stores if you are going to keep it</br>  <br>Yep, normally they´re not that little, but look at his tail, how small this fucker is, normally they use their tail to save food etc. noobish said.<br>And this ones definitly not fed enough.<br>Its a leopardgekko, dunno the exact morph, but its one. You´ll see when it grows a bit bigger</br></br></br>  Its just a morph of a leo.    <br>Its skin is super soft and the skin between its eyes is green<br><br><br><br>Yeah hes been trying. He can't get out<br><br><br>Noted</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I laughed.</br>  <br>Leopard gekkos dont have this "wand climb" abilties like other Gekkos.<br>They have Fingernails etc, and not this other stuff, dunno how to call it in ur languague</br></br>  it's the Ass Destroyer lizard    <br>No its not one. All geckos store food in its tail.<br>I owned 3 of them. seriously. look at leopard geckos on google images and then look at this one.<br>the only thing common is the patern.<br>leopard geckos do not and never have smooth skin.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's controlled by a parasite that it is passing on to you as its next host.<br><br>Rats and cats have a similar union. Rats get infected and suddenly they seek out cats. They get eaten and the cat gets infected. From the cat's feces, new hosts are found. Usually rats, but this parasite can quite easily grab a human too. This parasite is pretty common to the americas and is often the reason why people are obsessed with cats.<br><br>The more you know!</br></br></br></br></br></br>    Yeah grab a heating pad for the under side of the tank. You can use calcium sand for substrate but I wouldn't advise regular. Get him some small crickets and a day basking light as well.  <br>my best googling skills came up with western banded geckos? you should throw it against something hard to be sure</br>  Grabbed a light and a make do thing for him to hide in for the night. I think he's gonna like it once I set some shit up for him.  <br>Juvenile leopard gecko, feed it small mealworms dusted in calcium+vitamin powder, as much as it will eat, but don't leave any mealworms in the cage. A 10 gallon tank would be more than big enough for now.</br>  <br>What's going to stop him from climbing out?</br>  <br>also, go back to reddit</br>  <br>Sand has caused impaction in geckos. They like to lick things. Never feed a gecko in sand, take it out first.<br><br>Don't stick with wild caught food though, you risk giving it parasites. Food size should be smaller than the space between the gecko's eyes.</br></br></br>  <br>aids</br>  op is gonna be a good lizard daddy  <br>Well I've been watching him since  and he hasn't gotten close to getting out.</br>  <br>Idk how cool your house is, but leaving him on the floor might be too cold for him. On top of the fridge would be warmer.</br>  <br>Its a <br>Western Banded Gecko<br>or<br>Peninsula Banded Gecko <br><br>google search those. I can promise you its one of those two.<br><br>lmao ,Its not a leopard gecko</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That parasite only infects mammals</br>  <br><br>Guaranteed its a juvenile leopard gecko. The tail is partially missing. Its maybe a couple months old.</br></br>  inb4 next pic is this gecko inside OP's ass or something similar  <br>Thanks for the info<br><br><br>It's 77°F in my house and 80°F outside at night rn. I have it in a ceramic dish with sand on top of a wood surface under a light.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Peninsula Banded Gecko <br>Western Banded Gecko<br><br>lmao ,Its not. I owned 3 of them. leopard geckos will have bumps on skin.</br></br></br></br>  Literally nobody has suggested killing the fucking lizard, or putting it in someone's drink.<br><br>Op put it in your mouth</br></br>  build him an awesome aquarium and post add ons here weekly.  <br>I had all three from juvenile form. I had them last year. i sold them on the pet section of cl because they suck as pets.<br>They dont like to be held.</br></br>  <br> putting it in someone's drink <br>what are you? 12?<br><br>and why just killing it? do you even know about our space programs?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I've had two that would crawl right into your hand.</br>  <br>Oh fuck of back to facebook you boring normie scum</br>  <br>fuck off</br>  Okay so, another one found me. I'm thinking I might be a god. Wtf  <br>Mine sucked dude.</br>  <br> &gt;our space programs <br> &gt;normie scum <br><br>Frogs and lizards in space!</br></br></br></br>  <br> suggests /b/'s space program <br> normie scum <br><br>fucking summerfags</br></br></br></br>    <br><br>hivemind</br></br>  <br><br>careful you dont cut yourself with all that edge over at edgevill mr.edge</br></br>  <br>are you pulling lizards out of your asshole or something what the fuck</br>  <br>I put them together, they are just chillin</br>  <br>OP confirmed for lizard wizard or God of lizards</br>  <br>that's because we're not all edgelord faggots desperate for attention.</br>  <br>Thats just simply wrong. <br>Not all Gekkos store food in their tails.<br>But thats just the first thing, its a leopardgekko morph for sure. You can say whatever you want, but ive got my knowledge. Btw, i breed some Gekkos, not the Leopard ones yet, but others. And you might only know some Leopardgekko species, just let me tell you about the "Cat ba Leopard Gekko" <br>This one has nearly same skin etc, but its not the one OP has. So now you see at least, Leopardgeckos can have Smooth skin etc.<br>Pic related.<br><br>Op can you make some more pictures? I´ll try to find out which species exactly this little fucker is. :)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Gecko</br></br>  <br><br>oh shit</br></br>  <br>Dude are you just trolling? You probably bought them and don't know how to keep them so you ask /b/. That explains the box filled with sand and stones and stuff too.</br>  <br>does it matter?<br>Nope. It doesnt.<br>At least he asks us, and is not one of these bitchez who just let them die.</br></br></br>  <br>like this?</br>    <br>I'm just saying this is the tamest thread I've ever read here, and it's because of the influx of normie facebook dwelling meme spouting social marxist pond life. When I first posted on bee there is no way anyone would be urging op to look after these fucking disease ridden freaks.</br>  <br>I swear I'm not. Found them both on my back porch while I was smoking a joint. I'm just really high and trippin that these damn lizards are coming to me</br>  <br>dude, if thats they regular habitat, you could just let them life outside. Please make some pictures of them, from every side and the belly, so i can check which gekko this is.</br>  <br><br> I have no reptile pet experience <br> I have a turtle </br></br></br>  <br>That's a heavily malnourished leopard gecko<br><br>Get that fucker some crickets man, his/her tail should be plump.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Remember this is 4chan you faggots</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you're a lizard wizard anon</br>  <br>no, what are you doing nigger</br>    <br>Fuck off faggot. Why don't you just an hero already? You're life obviously sucks major cock if you get mad over some people saying NOT to murder some fucking lizard. If you're life is THAT pathetic that you get mad over people not being faggot edge lords like you then you should legit consider suicide and get off this planet.</br>  <br>HOLY FUCK</br>  <br>Your point?</br>  <br> Muh oldfagness </br>  <br><br>check'd</br></br>  <br><br>And also false</br></br>  <br>NOT REMEMBERING SALMONELLA</br>  <br>This is not correct aswell, please check the picture i posted before.<br>It doesnt seem like a "regular" leopardgekko.</br></br>  <br>That is no oldfag, I can assure you, he doesn't even knows about our space programs</br>  <br> this is the tamest thread I've read here </br>  <br>Don't worry, I took a shot after. Alcohol kills it right?</br>  <br>No, you are going to die</br>  <br>Damnit, I just got a new job.</br>  <br> 757575 </br>  <br> 757575 <br>nyoh my god.<br>also yes. alcohol immediately renders all disease completely harmless. <br> Studies have shown that 85% of all turtles, 77% of lizards, and 92% of snakes carry one of the 500 serotypes of Salmonella. </br></br></br></br>  <br> Alcohol kills it right? <br>Too late for that<br>have fun being infested by parasites</br></br></br>  <br>have fun with the disease OP</br>  You guys are all being surprisingly nice and helpful when it comes to lizards. Totally expected half of the posts here to be something along the lines of: "Have it hung, drawn and quartered!" "Put in a class of bleach, add cyanide to the glass, microwave the glass while lighting the microwave on fire!" "Flay it alive as a sacrifice to Baal!"  Yeah not sure if it's a Leopard Gecko but definitely a gecko. Here's one of mine and you can tell the skin is definitely not very smooth rather bumpy but soft.  <br>OP here<br><br>You're a faggot</br></br></br>  <br>Check my previous post pls.<br>there are more than 1 leopard gekko species.</br></br>  <br>Op is an pretty cool guy</br>  They seem to be getting along, even though that other dude still trying to get out  <br>Apparently I am, though of course you are too, if you actually made a meal out of that thing. How about we both go over to the lgbt board and have a nasty gay ol'time?</br>  Skinwalker general! If you have any questions about skinwalkers or lore in general, ask them here and they'll - for the most part - be answered.  bumping away  Question: why is this not on /x/?  <br>because its /b/<br>/b/ accepts all</br></br>  How exactly do they function and What are the best ways to avoid them  Who do they generally target and why?  <br>Other native here. I'll watch for the most part and occasionally give my tribes 2 cents when and where i can.</br>  <br>they attack people far from civilization normally, groups in woods, hiking ect. if you are the type to do that, theres no trick or talisman or anything like that to avoid them</br>  Sup from last thread. just hanging out i suppose.  <br>Yeah I do, how full of shit do you have to be to believe in them?<br><br>Because I'm pretty gullible, and also full of shit..<br>I could really do with some nonsense in my life because this whole "witch" thing is really falling out of fashion these days</br></br></br></br>  How do you become one?  <br>I second this. I'm sure some /b/tards have a better imagination than I do, so they'll ask questions I've never even thought about.</br>  <br>Why is talking about skin walkers taboo?</br>  <br>What are these "skinwalkers" you speak of, and should I expect to sleep tonight after reading your response?</br>  What do skinwalkers actually want to do to you? Why do they want to do that to you? How can you avoid them, and what is best to do when encountering one? Is it possible to make peace with them? Is being with other people safer? Is being in daylight or any light safer?  <br>all i have to say is you dont have to believe in something for it to hurt you.</br>  <br>/x/ has a completely and backwards ass view of what skinwalkers are and its complete saturation of that view makes it hard to have actual decent conversations on it.</br>  <br>If you manage to skin 2 victims in a day, would you call your tribe to check the dubs ?</br>  How do they breed? Do the live/hunt in packs? Also if they do breed, what is their life expectancy?  what do they want?<br>why do they do stuff?<br>what do you do to attract their attention?<br>what do you do to NOT attract their attention?<br>what do you do to get them to go the fuck away?<br>how do you kill it?<br>how do you eat it?<br>How do you do, sir?<br>how do stop yourself from eating it?<br>How can you tell what is what about them?<br>What exactly do they do and how are they menacing?<br>What are their general actions against people?<br>Can they be stopped? <br>Can they be killed?<br>Can I go to the bathroom?<br>May I go to the bathroom?<br>What should one do if face to face with one?<br>What should one do if they know about them(who they really are)<br>Can you at least depower them?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>if you talk about them to outsiders, it can anger them, they may attack you, the outside you spoke too, or even your familly</br>  <br>Not the guys answering questions, but this is what convinced me. Not to mention it's a huge staple of Native American lore and lore the world over - just different names.</br>  <br>And im assuming theyre also browsing 4chan and tracing my ip address as we speak?</br>  <br>Propriety tribal knowledge and talking in depth makes you a target.</br>  Can they mimic human speech? Can they somehow be tamed? What can a person or a group pf people do to fight them? Also how do they hide their tracks/existence/shit?  <br>so are you malevolent? Seeing as you are talking about them over the internet which is seen by not only posters but just plane old noncontributing lurkers as well? Or is internet ok and you are a pretty cool guy?<br>also this </br></br>  <br>Also, I'm going up to geogia with my family to a cabin we rented for a week. Shouldnt really be here lol. Luckily we are visiting family afterwards so if we go missing they will look.<br><br><br>talking about it can make you shunned by your friends and family on native American land. Because by speaking about it, especially with outsiders, its believed you can bring the wrath of the skin walker on yourself, the one you talked about it with, and even sometimes your close family. Talking about it with an outsider is like talking about the Jewish family hiding in your basement to an SS officer...<br><br>What a anon in last thread said.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you /navajo/?</br>  <br>this!</br>  <br>they are magic.</br>  <br>Now I'm not OP or one of the Lore Experts, but I believe in the last thread they said they were humans and became them by practicing evil or something, think of " a witch doctor gone bad" ( or if you are old enough, the "bad medicine" episode from kolchak)</br>  <br>honestly i doubt any of you are in danger, i may be, but honestly i dont care anymore<br><br><br>thanks for copy pasting it for me, saves me the trouble haha</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>falling out of fashion...<br>"...Maps used to say there'd be dragons here..."<br><br>not everything that sounds like a fairytail is bullshit, and now you need to look for the dragons yourself</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do they just know or are they lurking this thread?</br>  <br>thx for response.</br>  <br>skin walkers are evil beings, they kill because the can, or they take over your body. avoiding them is as simple as not straying too far from large amounts of people, if you encounter one then leave, they normally dont go far from there chosen homes. daytime they are normally less active, but be wary of animals who attack without warning, it may be a skinwalker</br>  <br>Fair enough<br>Can you answer me this?<br>Who was the first skin walker?</br></br></br>  I'm going to try my hand at a simple greentext here.<br><br> be me in 2004 <br> Going to boarding school for various reasons <br> behind my dorm there's a creepy ass forest that goes on for a long while <br> at least 70 miles of trees and shit <br> No one owns the land but the Appalachian trail is nearby so there's plenty of small foot trails <br> boring saturday afternoon <br> tired of sitting around in my room all day <br> don't feel like trying to make friends with the faggoty rich kids that also go to school <br> decide in my naivety to go for a walk in the woods <br> Whatcouldpossiblygowrong.png <br> Put on boots and coat, grab a water bottle and a cliff bar <br> There's a small gravel road that I follow for some time before diverging on one of the trails <br> just keep going for some time and enjoy the mood <br> Hike for what feels like half an hour <br> Suddenly getting a little foggy. nothing serious but enough to be a little spooky <br> twenty minutes later I hear the weirdest sound ever <br> Like silent hill or some shit a siren in the distance goes off <br> very faint and hard to hear <br> Sets me on edge <br> decide that I've gone deep enough and turn back </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>well, I can see you've clearly done your research anon</br>  <br> sun it getting blocked by clouds and setting at the same time <br> didn't bring a flashlight, wasn't thinking that I would be out that long <br> take a while to trace my steps backward <br> getting pretty dark and everything is getting grey <br> I guess I'm about ten minutes of hiking away from my dorms <br> finally stop daydreaming about shit to notice that everything is very quiet <br> just the leaves crunching under my boots and my breathing <br> start to pick up my pace, fear clenching at my stomach <br> its farily dark around this time combination of fog and clouds has made it hard to see <br> On the gravel road back to the dorms <br> Some part of me just seems to know that something is behind me <br>  its matching my footsteps or some shit so I can't hear it but I know its there <br> Don't turn around because that when the pounce atleast to my knowledge <br> See the dorms through the trees <br> Nearly piss my pants in growing terror <br> Instincts take over and I bolt <br>  I can hear something behind me <br>  I sprint all the way to the dorms and throw myself inside <br>  Look outside and see a faint shadow of something outside running away <br><br>Thats all I got.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> What do skinwalkers actually want to do to you? <br>Kill you. <br> Why do they want to do that to you? <br>Why does a serial killer kill?<br> How can you avoid them, and what is best to do when encountering one? <br>Stay away from areas that aren't populated heavily. When encountering one run away as fast as possible and shout something like "i know who you are"<br> Is it possible to make peace with them? <br>No. <br> Is being with other people safer? <br>Might make you less likely to be targeted but other than that no. <br> Is being in daylight or any light safer? <br>No.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the first skin walkers were witches who preformed a twisted evil "sing". "sings" are a way medicine men used to heal, the twisted "sing" is a way to curse and harm</br>  <br>You don't gotta believe in knives for them to cut you.</br>  <br>This made me decide to post my shit from last thread. cause why not. for new ppl. Not too scary</br>  <br>i wasn't the expert either, but i read his last post stating they were once healers turned corrupted. Sounds like Naguals or Mexican Brujerías whos counter parts are called Curanderos.</br>      <br>They are solitary humans with possibly someone who taught them the bad ways or they were taught the right way and pervered it.</br>    <br>They tend to just know. Like it marks you somehow.</br>  What the fuck is a skinwalker??  <br>Does reading this information make us prone to their attacks? Are we in danger for merely knowing?</br>  why is taking a shit so enjoyable?  Can anyone post more spooky greentext?  <br>Because toilets are wizardry</br>  According to you guys shouting "I know who you are" at them, which is implying you know they are a skinwaker, is a possible way to be safeish. But wouldn't it make the, want to hunt you more since you know their secret?  <br> what do they want? <br>Your death. <br> why do they do stuff? <br>Because they can. <br> what do you do to attract their attention? <br>Be vulnerable, talk about them.<br> what do you do to NOT attract their attention? <br>Stay near civilization. <br> what do you do to get them to go the fuck away? <br>You don't. <br> how do you kill it? <br>Proprietary. <br> How can you tell what is what about them? <br>Proprietary. <br> What exactly do they do and how are they menacing? <br>Shape changing and murder along with dark rituals.<br> What are their general actions against people? <br>Murder. <br> Can they be stopped? <br>Yes. <br> Can they be killed? <br>Yes. <br> What should one do if face to face with one? <br>Run and alert others.<br> What should one do if they know about them(who they really are) <br>Can't tell you how important this is. Proprietary. <br> Can you at least depower them? <br>No.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you can catch it before it dies, there's a thread here. I would advise opening all images in a new tab quickly before it 404s<br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;628720232 </br></br>  <br>In depth talks on it are bad. Saying what they do is fine. Its like the difference between someone telling someone else your name and someone else shouting your social and credit card numbers.</br>  <br>I migrated over from that thread. I already read that stuff, thanks.</br>  <br>call me a retard but what do you mean by proprietary?</br>  <br>yeah, thats the thread we more or less abandoned and made this one from<br>im one of the two native americans whos been answering questions in them</br></br>  <br>i think he means "information i can't share"</br>  Can skinwalkers use the internet?<br><br>Can they replace people and act like nothing is different?</br></br>  <br>I salute you anon i was too big of a bitch to ask myself.<br>What the hell do you mean by that anon?</br></br>  <br><br>Ah, alright then. Disregard.</br></br>  <br>It means he doesn't really know what proprietary means.</br>  <br>See<br/></br>  How can they be killed? Like a regular human?<br>Do they kill you for sport, or do they eat you?</br>  <br>I'm not one of the experts, but I think they don't use tech. They might replace someone who lives alone in the woods, but not people in a big city.</br>  <br> Can skinwalkers use the internet? <br>no<br> Can they replace people and act like nothing is different? <br>they cant act perfectly like a human, they twitch, are unable to speak normally, act generally creepy, you can tell that someone is not acting normally</br></br></br></br>  <br>Information that is essentially sacred or strictly not to be shared other than hushed one on one talks in a safe area with a family member or medicine man. You don't know if who you're talking to is one or connected to one.</br>  <br><br>yeah the best anology I can come up with is like being an actor of someone and actually being someone. Outside of a few lines the actor doesn't know much about the person.</br></br>  <br>exactly, they can imitate voices perfectly, but they dont know WHAT to say most of the time</br>  <br>They're people like you and me. Just evil and twisted. In that they can do what you and i do. Eventually the outside matches the inside however.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;628749805 <br>ah thx. Man that sucks. So a basic bullet might send one to Broadway but not another, huh? That blows.</br>  <br>What is a medicine man?</br>  Do they eat people or do they just kill them for dark arts/ritual purposes/pleasure, etc.?  I guess the old thread died. I hope anyone interested in this stuff migrated before that.<br><br><br>Tribal spiritual leader(?)</br></br></br>  <br>Because knives exist</br>  <br>they are spiritual healers who use a number of practices to heal you physically and spiritually. They are some of the highest ranked members of a tribe, and the most respected</br>  <br>Traditional healers. They have skinchanger magics but don't use them for evil - instead, to exorcise evil spirits etc.</br>  MORE GREENTEXTS  Ojibway here, all u need is a strong will, and they become powerless..plain and simple, why do u think white people took over? science is strong stuff. it's all programming, and logic is the strongest program. don't believe the hype. skinwalker are shit.  Are we in any more danger than usual from knowing and talking about the topics in this thread?  <br>so do they. Knives are just common.</br>  <br>Tribal leader in the sacred ways. Usually familial in nature or essentially adopted member because you basically get trained as your raised. If you got a spiritual problem you talk to him. If your life is suddenly shit you can have him investigate. He holds the stories and songs. If your sick he can help.</br>  Anyone else interested in talking about other creepy things? I feel we're making the thread a little too specific.<br><br><br>I second this.</br></br></br>  <br>They kill you because they can mostly or because you're in their territory and they don't want someone finding them and starting a witch hunt. They can take any skin for form and power even yours.</br>  im out for the night. See ya.  <br><br><br>These.</br></br></br>  I'm looking for some spooky stuff.<br><br><br>bye anon</br></br></br>  <br>I've been keeping it lowkey because of this. In depth secret telling will make me and you a target. Telling you the very basics won't.</br>  <br>According to the world wide web<br>Skinwalkers have a distinct weakness against silver when in their animal form<br>Is this true?</br></br></br>  so why not just hunt the little niggers  <br>It was made for this purpose in mind.</br>  <br><br>well originally...there was no medicine men, because the knowledge they teach was meant to be given to everybody. today though, theres only "medicine men" because people are too stupid to read history books or learn basic horticulture.</br></br>  <br> prove they are real <br> if so how can I kill them <br> if so where can I find them <br> if so how can i attract them <br><br>do this and i will timestamp a dead one</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We're 4chaners. We don't have much to live for.<br><br>Also I'm in the tropics so I could care less about American things.</br></br></br>  I need to sleep. My kitty is beside me. He'll protect me, right?  <br>This is related to this<br><br>Can't say anymore. Just know that shouting out that general statement is your best bet and running far far away.</br></br></br>  Got some but not a skinwalker type of story tho<br><br> be me 2 years ago <br> parents are divorced, my mother has custody of my brother and i live with my father <br> from time to time i go for a sleepover at my mom's place <br> literally in the midle of the woods, only her house and neighbours house, a very old lady died about 6 months ago or something <br> my brother has a dog but the cannel is open, the dog is not locked, just has a leash, and there are no walls seperating the house property from the woods <br> we play bunch of games into the night <br> get tired and go to bed <br> dog starts to bark, louder and louder <br> im sleeping in the same bed as my brother, i can see him with eyes wide open, he is afraid <br> i start hearing wierd sunds, very wierd actually like some kind of scrapping and people running around in the distance <br> "what the hell?" and my brother replys " just keep quiet, whoever they are they will go away" <br> dog suddently makes a noise like it was hurt and shut ups <br> "shit man they hit you're dog!" <br> my brother is terrified, but gets up and grabs a bb gun he has <br> we put on some pants and shoes, i grab a broom. . . yeah a broom, and we exit trough the garage door that leads to the place were he has the dog <br> dark as shit but whe have been turning on every single light possible, but were the dog is there is no light <br> i go and illuminate the path with my selphone and we see the dog just in the corner, all fucked up <br> for real the dog was shivvering and humming in the corner, terrifeid  <br> shit we keep hearing sounds in the distance, then a scream <br> a fucking scream, and comotion in the distance <br> we pick up the dog, bring her in the house and lock the doors <br> later i find tha this had happened at least 4 times before <br> my mother heard it too but she ignores it, they have no were else to go </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It will make ME a target.</br>  <br>Do they eat humans?</br>  real indian, writing green text skinwalker story:<br><br> &gt;they don't exist. </br></br>  <br>See<br/></br>  <br>Skinwalkers are like the NSA of the woods<br><br>theyre monitoring your communications in their tree forts<br><br> yo gary! this fag told some fag about us on 4chan, lets get him! <br><br>but then they gotta wait for you to be in the woods<br><br>just dont go in there <br><br>boom<br><br>problemo solved</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He is the skinwalker</br>  <br>No. Almost none of that statement is related</br>  <br>Our culture and history is vocal. our ways are complex. It takes complete saturation to learn it flawlessly. If every man tried to learn it no one would have hunted, fought, or did anything to help the tribe. So we made a designated person for it.</br>  Got some greentext  <br> your cat is actually a naked 30 yr old man wearing your cats skin like a hoodie </br>  <br>They are easily noticeable in all but the rarest cases so being in the woods means you're away from civilization and usually alone or a small group</br>  <br>so basically they are an advanced for of furry?</br>  <br>See, this is the thing I don't get.<br>We've found uncommon animals before. And not to mention, virtually everyone on the planet has a video camera sitting in their pocket nowadays.<br>So how can you just say something exists and we haven't seen it? I could understand if it was an undersea creature and was thusly unreachable, but these things are apparently just sitting out in the woods for people to stumble upon and be killed by. Doesn't it seem a little farfetched that there are all these stories about these things and not a single ounce of indisputable proof?</br></br></br>  <br>Because the asshole is the pressure relief valve of the digestive tract</br>  <br> I am the doge </br>  <br>this</br>  <br>They exist on tribal land as they come from the tribe itself. We deal with our problems by ourselves. Photos are forbidden for reasons.</br>  <br>Well the stories usually boil down to people fleeing for their lives or shooting at them and booking it. Those who waste time to try and get a picture probably aren't able to post it anywhere anymore.</br>  <br>"indisputable proof"? iv seen videos of ufos in 1080P that can easilly be disputed, so how would a bunch of scared people in the woods being chased or cornerd my a shapeshifting monster get "indisputable proof" also you have to remember we are not talking about a normal creature, but a spirit of evil, that shapshifts among other things, maybe you end up killing one, but it turns into a dear as it dies....how could you know?</br>  <br>dubs confirms<br> skinwalkers just need manjuice </br></br>  <br>this guy knows whats up</br>  <br> talking about spirits and shape-shifting <br>yeah there's literally no way anyone is gonna convince you</br></br>  <br> refusing to acknowledge the possibility of things that cant be explained <br>yeah there's literally no way anyone is gonna convince you either</br></br>  <br>A skinwalker will die in three days if there name is spoke so most likely they'll back off in fear of you knowing their name. (this is from a wiki page so take it with a grain of salt).</br>  <br>I answered that on the other thread so here it goes again.<br>1. most believe because they saw it for themselves. The thing is, you didn't see it though, and in today's society, everyone is a liar, everything is Photoshopped, everything is faked, nothing is real.<br>2. Nobody is outright actively looking for them when they are seen. Those who do have a huge fucking noisy ass clumsy as fuck film crew with them basically make it known that they are coming and or already there. Even basic animals run the fuck out when this occurs so why not humans with extra abilities who do not want to get found out? Those who do run across them are like you and me. If we got a camera on us do to nature walk or phone we might take a picture or mini vid. In that case refer yourself to number one because as soon as you try and tell somebody what you saw, you are automatically called nuts, crazy, stupid, hippy, high on shit, delusional, liar, fake, fraud, attention whore and your vids and pictures are all from mspaint or Photoshop.</br></br></br>  <br>yup...perfectly said</br>  <br>lol okay because your mystical talk of magic and superhuman abilities (which have absolutely no hard evidence at all) is a strong argument. you really convinced me etc etc</br>  <br>ty based anon.<br><br>others, take after this guy.</br></br></br>  <br>99% of stories are fake, but say out of the people who go camping 1% of them see a skinwalker, maybe 1% of those people would go on to share the story and about 1% of them know about 4chan so it boils down to if it was real only like one person 1-5 people on 4chan would have seen it and maybe 20-40 people in america have seen it</br>  <br>proving my point <br>Go out and actively find one. Bring suntan lotion because you probably haven't been out in ages, the moonlight would burn you to a crisp, you're so pale.</br></br>  <br><br>How do you reconcile your belief in the supernatural with the fact that it is absolute bullshit?</br></br>  <br>I don't know if someone asked this yet but where do they come from exactly? I mean how are they created? Are they just born, do they start out as human, can they be peaceful?</br>  <br>What does the original form of a skinwalker look like? Must they always be in the shape of something natural? Are they more physical or metaphysical?</br>  <br>attention whoring ain't easy, is it anon?</br>    <br>Experience. See something again and again and its hard not to believe in it.</br>  <br>they were human once, there original form is most likely there human-like selves, but they dont look fully human anymore, there eyes are animalistic, and shine in odd ways</br>    Logging out guys. Talk about the skinwalkers so they don't try to kill me.  <br>Just because it's on tribal land doesn't mean someone can't get in and take a picture or video. And that's assuming that every single tribe member doesn't take a single picture.<br><br>But we have pictures of tigers, lions, bears, etc. while they're out in the wild. Assuming no one knows what this is upon an encounter, someone would more than likely want to document it so they don't sound insane.<br><br>This is likely the only answer that makes any sense, and even then, that's assuming that we just disregard every single piece of evidence there is. Something can be proven when you can go to its location and see it for yourself, meaning it can be recreated, like a scientific experiment.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They're humans. They wear the skins of animals to gain the strength and shape of them. They can and tend to wear many skins.</br>  <br>No. You are the one who is so obsessed with their existence that you're trying to convince us that they are real. That should be your job to find the proof.<br><br>My proof is your absence of proof. And seriously, I am open to having my mind changed, but you gotta show me something worthwhile, not this flimsy "because i said so" bullshit</br></br></br>  <br>son-of-a-bitch O_O</br>  <br>Hey /b/, russian here. On 2ch I once read a story very similiar to skinwalker tales<br>It goes like this<br> be a guy working in an armoured safe warehouse protected by a thick steel dood <br> just one guy because whoever the fuck tears through steel and concrete aint gonna be stopped by several guys <br> so the guy chills there with an alarm  <br> see a person through surveillance camera out there <br> jerking spasmatic movement is if this creature was mocking the way people walk <br> it starts banging on the door and talking <br> no words just glutteral vowels mimicking human speech <br> the guy is fucking hystericall looking at this circus <br> couldnt let people into the warehouse for an hour in the morning <br>Also can post several fucked up stories not related to the topic or related</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   2000+15 <br> still believing in scawy monsters </br>  <br>I didn't want to say it out loud cause it seems bad. Skin walkers are usually known pretty quick to a tribe and we deal with it decisively and quickly. Photos are FORBIDDEN. You wouldn't do it or be able to during this time as you would be stopped or the camera taken away. If you mean actively hunting them they don't want to be known for reasons above so they will stop you in any way possible. Plenty of people have probably tried givdn how widely known the knowledge of them has spread but how many have actually given a report on it?</br>  What types of specific areas do I need to avoid in order to not get Silenced of the Lambs?  <br>im from <br>You are asking to recreate something as if though the other living, thinking, cunning individual is some routine like an animal making its rounds. How many murders do we actually catch? Regular ones with no more knowledge then the average person? How many with some advanced training? Now tell me how the hell are you gonna catch with a recreated scene somebody that not only has higher learning, higher training in skills, and then on top of it has supernatural capabilities?</br></br>  <br>If you take a picture, does the skinwalker lose its soul?</br>  <br>Anywhere away from a lot of people.</br>  <br>kek</br>  <br>No. Being known is bad for them in several ways.</br>  <br>aboriginal skinwalkers do</br>  Can someone here help me? I've been reading some stuff like this for a while and I've got this crazy feeling of uneasiness. Like something is right behind me ready to pounce. Any tips for settle my tension?  <br>drink, watch comedy, listen to mellow music</br>  <br>Alcohol.</br>  <br>How the fuck am I obsessed basement dweller? People who know or believe don't really need to obsess over something they think is out there. They know it is and that's that. <br>You on the other hand say it is not real with no attempt at any footwork. That is lazy as fuck and we are supposed to believe a guy locked in a cellar just "he said so?" Nobody is really asking you to believe and we are talking to others with an open mind saying it might be or it is. We have no reason to call them a liar like you. You prove my first post. All evidence shown is dismissed because you don't want to believe. You can't disprove somebodies experience. We can't disprove your lack of experience in the woods. Then again, you never went out there.<br>You say they don't then go out there and do some filming. What I or anyone else saw is proof enough for ourselves and we have nothing to gain by saying we saw some shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Get wasted and hang around people. Take a holiday and travel somewhere warm and far away</br>  <br>But there are around 7 billion people in the world, and these are supposed to be an actual species, so that means there must be a population of these things that ranges at least somewhere over 1000, considering how wide the stories range.<br>Considering how many of those 7 billion have devices that could be used to document this creature, it just gets more and more farfetched.<br>I'd like to believe in it, because it's interesting, but it just doesn't really seem like a real thing unless you start believing in magic n shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Are they known to rape? If so, both genders?</br>  <br>shove a moderately sized dildo up your ass. that should get rid of it</br>  <br>This is not that chronic. I just have things to do and I can't sleep.<br><br><br><br>Trying not to get drunk but I'll watch to some stupid youtube stuff.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Why do they want to do that to you? <br> Why does a serial killer kill? <br><br>Serial killers kill people for a variety of reasons, ranging from delusional attempts at realizing some sort of world vision to experiencing something hedonistic. Here:<br><br>https://sites.google.com/site/psych<wbr>ologyofpsychopaths2a/what-is-the-pr<wbr>ofile-of-a-serial-killer-1/what-are<wbr>-the-different-types-of-serial-kill<wbr>ers<br><br>Go down to Motives. They range from "Visionary," "Mission oriented," "Hedonistic," "Comfort," and for "power/control." <br><br>In short, they don't just do it for no reason.</br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> all this basement, cellar talk <br>okay you can stop all the projecting, seriously.<br><br> they know it is and that's that <br>oh man well why didn't you say you are a stubborn ignorant asshole to begin with so i didn't have to waste my time<br><br> talks about evidence <br> posts absolutely no evidence <br>i told you i'm open to changing what i think. this post is really not helping you anon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They're humans that practice dark ways. Humans rape sometimes.</br>  <br>It would be extremely painful</br>  <br>Dude, you don't really understand the amount of land out there. They discover new species of animals all the time, and there literally hundreds of square kilometres of empty lands in US, Russia or Canada. I know for a fact that every year in my country (Russia) estimated 100 000 people go missing. Half of them are found in the next years - suicides, murders, simply people running away or changing identietis. What happens to the other half and their bodies though? And there are plenty of well documented creepy stories like this https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dya<wbr>tlov_Pass_incident</wbr></br>  <br> Serial killers kill people for a variety of reasons, ranging from delusional attempts at realizing some sort of world vision to experiencing something hedonistic <br>Exactly.</br></br>    <br>its not a specific race man, pay closer attention. They are Humans who picked up on some extra skills above normal understanding. They can be anyone to include you or me or our next door neighbor or even the fucking dog outside looking in our direction. (mainly at my house cuz I own cats and they get into my garbage cans) You also add the entire earth population to this despite this being in a SPECIFIC location which is North America, so there goes most of America's populaton as well. You are left with a small number, mostly tribe members living there, and tourists. The chances of seeing something is rare because they are dealing with a human like you and me who simply doesn't want to be seen. They might have been caught off guard but then again, they look human so could you really tell? Even if you caught them in their skin, do you know enough about Native American culture to differentiate between their regular clothing for daily use, tourist use, and ritual use much less malevolent ritual use?</br>    <br> calls people stubbern ignorant ass hole <br> to uneducated and lazy to go do some fucking research. <br><br> demands evidence <br> ignores rarity and chances of getting the HD quality he wants <br> assumes all people are liars when they experience some shit. <br><br>You're argument is circular. You say you want to believe but don't see proof. Proof is rare but shit quality and or just by what people saw. All of it is lies and does not believe. Wants to see proof.<br>BTW Im not op nor am I the expert talking to us.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Cause as it comes out it tickles your prostate just how your daddy used to, faggot.</br>  <br>lol you really want me to google skinwalker? haha alright i'll get back to you in a little<br><br>also,<br>you really think someone would do that? go on the internet and tell lies?<br><br>i'm also saying that if you are so confident about the existence of these creatures you would easily be able to bring up some proof for me <br><br>tell me anon why the fuck i would believe something that has no actual backing than word of mouth</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  How do you tell a skin walker from a regular animal or person? And thoughts on wendigoes?  anyway everyone, im the first native american who was answering questions in the first thread, but i need to pass out, i hope myself and the other expert has helped explain and educate a little bit to those who are willing and wanted to understand a bit more. Sorry we couldn't provide all the answers, we did as much as we could. Im assuming the other native will be staying on, but i dont know him.  What would be a safe conversation to have with someone, if I were to inform them about Skinwalkers?  <br>start off by telling them you're crazy</br>  <br>I'll be on for a bit thanks for covering what i wouldn't.</br>  <br>In a way that I'm batshit insane, or crazy for daring to do this?</br>  <br>also, this is wikipedia, so you have to take the information with a grain of salt, but here<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin-<wbr>walker<br>it may explain a bit more then we have</br></wbr></br></br>  <br>They are evil and twisted inside. What they do tends to turn the inside outwards.</br>  <br>Quiet place alone somewhere that you didn't tell them before hand. A quiet hushed short conversation.</br>  <br><br><br>So Im kinda getting mixed views of Skinwalkers.<br>Are they like people who were cursed to become savage beings?<br>Are they sentient?<br>If they are sentient are they killing people with malicious intent or are they just primitive instinct-driven predators that have a high capacity to emulate their prey (Humans).</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the former</br>  I'm not getting something here, you can't talk about them, but you can write about them without consequences?  <br>If you didnt you would have checked your self into a padded room do to paranoia a long ass time ago. People tell you lots of shit without even backing it up but you assume its ok or it wont kill you when you eat food drive your car after its out of the shop when you girl says thats not the smell of another man etc. You think everyone just goes directly over there with a fucking camera and a crew? No. The majority of these sightings are by random individuals on a random chance. Once again your circular logic running around, how the fuck can I, or anyone else for that matter, give you the images in my head or personal experience? Seriously, grow up man. That is the main issue with new atheists, everyone is a fucking liar to your eyes. You're the kind that would pick a bar of chocolate over a bar of silver because you think the silver might be something else or has a horrible gimmick attached to it. You pick the bar of metal it may or may not be silver, you pick the chocolate, you don't need any more fat foods anyways so you lose even if you pick it. You may even be so paranoid as to not choose ether and lose out completely because of your lack of trust. You say you want to believe, it is interesting, so then go out and make a day or so of it and see if that shit is real. Reminder: the thing you are looking for is a human and its a psycho murderer with years of experience hiding in those woods.</br>  <br>They are human. Humans who learn the waysand pervert them for power. The problems start when the evil inside bleeds outside which effects them mentally and physically. They usually kill those that wander to close to prevent being killed.</br>  <br>haha you seem awfully rustled there. <br><br>yeah so i googled it and basically stories, a movie and a wikipedia entry that began with "In some Navajo legends." nice.<br><br>fucking lol dude if my argument is circular, your shit is a straight up sphere. you are choosing to believe from nothing while im choosing not to believe from nothing. who's more susceptible to error in this situation? <br><br> telling me to grow up <br> believes in shapeshifting evil creatures <br><br>and no not everyone is a liar to me. like i said if they give formidable evidence on the issue i'm extremely amendable.<br><br>so, still besides these flimsy stories there is absolutely nothing for me to use as a starting point to believe. thanks for absolutely nothing</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Is this the work of a skinwalker(s)?<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyatl<wbr>ov_Pass_incident</wbr></br>  <br>You're a big guy.</br>  <br>Yeah, the idiot who tries to judge others yet cant grasp basic logic tries to judge another persons experience based on no other counter argument then, "i didn't see it so it must not exist"<br><br>If all stories are from personal experience then you should go and get a personal experience from the specific location yourself. That is how you can learn or see if it is real or not. Then again you are too big of a pussy to even try. That is like judging a movie you haven't even seen a trailer for whether it is good or bad based on the title alone. So yeah, you are using circular logic with a retards perspective.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Nope, that's the work of experimental traveling heater made from radiation. They were cooked from the inside like a microwave. Russia has lots of these heaters.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, as other anon said, most likely military testing radiation weapons / ayyee lmaos doing ayyee lmao things, not necessarily skinwalkers.</br>   say that you do not want to be in a Giantess grip kneeling on Her palm... <br> say that you do not want to feel small, obedient and dependent on Her... <br> say that you do not want to belong to Her and be Her toy and property... <br> say that you do not want to worship Her for the mercy of sparing your life... <br> say that you do not want to kneel before Her and become more and more broken as you look into Her powerful eyes... <br> say that you do not want to be in Her vagina when She orgasms aroused by how powerless you are compared to Her... <br> say that you do not want to be shrunken into nothingness inside Her vagina and have both your body and soul absorbed... <br> say this all if you really mean it </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    THANK YOU GIANTESS  I don't?  that you do not want to be in a Giantess grip kneeling on Her palm...<br>that you do not want to feel small, obedient and dependent on Her...<br>that you do not want to belong to Her and be Her toy and property...<br>that you do not want to worship Her for the mercy of sparing your life...<br>that you do not want to kneel before Her and become more and more broken as you look into Her powerful eyes...<br>that you do not want to be in Her vagina when She orgasms aroused by how powerless you are compared to Her...<br>that you do not want to be shrunken into nothingness inside Her vagina and have both your body and soul absorbed...<br>this all if you really mean it<br><br>Can I go now?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>THANK YOU GIANTESS</br>  <br>sure, go a be the faggot you are for the rest of your life</br>  THANK YOU BASED GIANTESS    <br>I want to be eaten by her.</br>    <br>god please more<br>please please please more<br>please more!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>Where do I find similar stuff like this?</br></br></br></br>  nhentai.net/search/?q=microne+magaz<wbr>ine<br><br>g.e-hentai.org/g/572598/f9aa4fe347/<wbr></wbr></br></br></wbr>    http://g.e-hentai.org/s/3da88652af/<wbr>778043-18<br><br>http://g.e-hentai.org/s/73a78c512c/<wbr>783207-1<br><br>http://g.e-hentai.org/g/743742/7e4e<wbr>81af02/<br><br>http://g.e-hentai.org/g/526173/86c3<wbr>ecddcf/<br><br>http://g.e-hentai.org/g/515912/8686<wbr>75759e/</wbr></br></br></wbr></br></br></wbr></br></br></wbr></br></br></wbr>    http://g.e-hentai.org/g/714421/9822<wbr>82cfa3/</wbr>  I am erect.  best hentai ever:<br>http://g.e-hentai.org/g/484233/f9a4<wbr>810580/</wbr></br>  <br><br>I beg to differ.<br><br>http://g.e-hentai.org/g/241579/9a65<wbr>b0bab3/</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>THANK YOU GIANTESS</br>  <br>because you are a healthy straight man</br>  <br>too long, although surely a great series as well</br>    SERIOUS QUESTION:<br>what is the origin of this fetish?<br>has science got any explanation?<br>why is it so tempting and arousing?</br></br></br>  <br/>  <br><br>That's...one the great mysteries...</br></br>  <br><br>That's...one of the great mysteries...</br></br>      <br><br>anymore like this or from the artist?</br></br>  <br>the perfect size</br>  <br>the artist is Ochiko<br>I think these are the only two like that (micro, in pubes, pretty much pov)</br></br>  I'm curious what typical girls think about this.<br>Would they find dominating a guy like this arousing?<br>Is such absolute submission what they truly want?</br></br>            <br>THANK YOU GIANTESS</br>  how do I girl like this?  anybody role-playing this in bedroom?<br>your experiences? advice?</br>              imagine her shrinking you<br>just like this</br>          <br>thank you giantess</br>          <br>I'll say all of that.
