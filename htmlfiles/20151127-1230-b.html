It's induced by not only copious amounts of alcohol, but i'm also quite sensitive to it, as fuckloads of different foods cause it with me.<br><br>Anyways, i went to the shitter this morning, and i pooped out black water. I called the doctor, he told me to come in, gave me a prescription for this shit that creates a protective layer in my stomach. He said that if i came up with the flu over the weekend i should go to the hospital, and that i should ''drink less''. Told him i was willing to, and ask me to prescribe valium to me to avoid going into delerium or and epeleptic episode. He refused to do this. <br><br>So now i'm paranoid as fuck. Shitting out blood is a pretty good wake up call. I've already applied for rehab (before this), but i still have to go to 2 intake meetings (the last of which is december 17), and after that i'll probably have to wait another 2 weeks before i can actually go (is gonna be a good new years eve). I've already started taking less alcohol (less than half of what i usually drink), but what if it still kills me before i get to rehab?<br><br>So i was wondering if there are any medfags who could tell me what my best course of action is.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  trap sissy thread.<br>yes we are faggots</br>  is there an archive of lola pics/webms?  <br>what? kekd its from hot fuzz</br>  <br><br>what a slut</br></br>  You have 60 seconds to identify a flaw in this gorgeous woman's perfect beauty.
