Only if you suck at sex bro, lots of other areas to stimulate other than just fucking her in the pussy. Id say i have an average dick, real small when soft and no girl has even hinted it was small after we fucked  When she has a huge pussy, yeah.  <br>It matters.<br>Any female or faggot telling you otherwise is lying.<br><br>Then again </br></br></br></br>  <br>yes, but it don't have to 10inches</br>  <br>I'd rather have a big burger than one of those Spanish tapas ones. But then again sometimes those come with foi gras and some custom pickeled shit.</br>  <br>it does if you give a shit what she thinks.</br>  If you're as small as the guy on the right, then YES, SIZE MATTERS. if you are any where near average, then no it doesn't. size only matters when it is way too big, or way too small.  <br>Yeah it does, women don't just want to have sensual sex, sometimes they just want to be bent over and fucked like a dirty little whore</br>  If it didn't matter, why is the chick with the all dick in hand censured?  There's this girl at work who has a lot of tattoos and has that "I've had a rough life" trailer park look to her. She's skinny and always short shorts and tanktops.<br><br>How do I convince her to put me in a rear naked choke hold or to straddle me and choke me? Have you ever walked up to a random girl and asked her to wrestle? What was the outcome?<br><br>I'm tired of jerking off to her halter top pictures on Facebook, I want to wrestle with her.</br></br></br></br>  This is why I like living in the South away from city and suburb girls.<br><br>Seriously, walk up to any cute southern girl and challenge her to wrestle. It's seriously not uncommon for girls to love to wrestle and try to actually win. <br><br>City girls<br> OMG THATS SO WEIRD LIKE I DONT EVEN KNOW YOU AND OMG LIKE MY HAIR WILL GET LIKE SO MESSED UP <br><br>Southern Girls<br> Fuck yeah I'm gonna kick your ass <br><br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/625983205#p625987911">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Learn jiu jitsu and rek her</br>    Greetings /b/tards, I'm in Lyon attending a conference and have some free time. What do?  Bemping  What is the conference for?  <br>is it the climate conference?</br>  <br><br>It's called EQUADIFF, it's mathematics</br></br>  <br>Wait in silence until the conference begins</br>  <br>Are you presenting a paper or just there to enjoy the conference? What kind of maths are you into?<br><br>Never been to Lyon or a conference of any consequence, so I'm not much help.</br></br></br>  Take and post pictures of that lovely town.  <br>I'll be presenting a poster which sumarizes some results I have with two coworkers. As they sre little botches and didn't want to come, herme I am</br>  I've lived there all my life, this town is pretty chill.<br>Too bad it's sunday since most if not all shops, bars and restaurants are closed.<br>Where are you exactly? Still a ton of cool shit to do and see.<br>Also drink lots of water.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh my, the typos are strong with this one. Sorry</br>  <br>Are you iron?<br>Like a Zion?<br>In Lyon?</br></br></br>  How long are you staying?  <br>I'm at the residence of the Lyon 1 university. Was thinking of going to the Parc la tête d'or, I don't know how to spell it</br>  Take lots of pics weather you post them or not.  <br>Until friday, the off to Dijon. I guess I'll have to attend some lectures, but I want to go arpund tpwn as well</br>  <br>Dayum, you're pretty far from the cool places.<br>Sure, go to the parc (which you spelled correctly), it's pretty huge.<br>Don't get lost in Lyon 1 though, the campus is pretty fucking big.</br></br></br>  <br>No worries. Still curious about your results though, if you care to share - even though it will go over most of our heads it would be interesting to some of us</br>  <br>Yes, got lost already at the arrival. The little bitches had no preparation for a 550 person conference. So Parc it is? I can get a tram or bus, they gabe me tickets</br>  Can you post pics of your immediate area?  <br>It's Parc de la Tête d'Or. You spelled it right.</br>  I want to hear about your math stuff.  <br>Sure! It's about neuronal networks. We try to classify the ones that reach what we call "grand coalition" which means that all neurons fire at the same time. I've heard that if that happens in ypur brain you have a seizure. Good thing our brain does not meet the hypothesis.<br>  pic related, poster I'll be presenting on tuesday </br></br>  <br>The inmedita area sucks, it's the university's campus</br>  <br>*immediate. Fucking tablet</br>  <br>Try this :<br> &gt;tcl.fr/en/ <br>You are currently at "Université Lyon 1 Cl.Bernard (La Doua), Villeurbanne", try "Quartier Saint Jean, Lyon 5eme" as your destination.</br></br></br>  eat cheese bitch and drink wine, fuck do what the french do , be arrogant as hell to everyone tambien.  <br>Cool, vieux lyon is one of the musts on my list. Thanks!</br>  <br>You are welcome, enjoy the place!</br>  <br><br>dégage sale bougnoule</br></br>  <br>The park has a zoo, lots of exotic plants and a small lake in the middle.<br>If you have some free time this week, be sure to check out:<br> Vieux lyon: historic old town, lots of good restaurants and bars (I recommend the Cactus Café, might even see you there), a fancy gothic cathedral and generally a maze of beautiful of paved narrow streets <br> Fourvière hill: shit ton of Gallo-Roman ruins, two entire theatres, though there's currently a huge festival there, nice basilica at the top of the hill with breathtaking view over the entire city <br> If you have the munchies, Rue Mercière, you'll find the best restaurants in the country <br> Place des Terreaux: Large plaza in the heart of town, huge ass Bartholdi fountain and fancy as fuck Town Hall <br>If you have other questions ask away.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Awesome! I'm in neuro myself, did machine learning in undergrad; hoped it would be something like this being NN and machine learning stuff is so hot right now.<br><br>Work looks interesting, but question: if your using some kind of spiking or leaky integrator neurons, how is it possible that they all fire at once? It stands to reason that in a strongly connected graph stimulating one could set off all the others simultaneously, but isn't there some time lag before the initiator neuron becomes active again? Or is that sort of the point, you set off activity and then wait for the network to settle into this "grand coalition" synchronized firing state?<br><br>Sorry for the thousand questions</br></br></br></br></br>   So how long until humanity falls /b/? <br><br>The end of the world as we know it. Most especially due to diminishing resources, the decline of civilizations, empires &amp; societies. But not necessarily The Apocalypse.</br></br>  <br>Hopefully very fucking soon.</br>  <br>I'm with you, I'm ready for it. If we're going to die I'd rather go out with a fucking bang.</br>  <br>He fucking stole that cart ...</br>  in 45 years earth is going back on to mars and closing out humanity  <br>not until after you are long dead so just forget about it</br>  <br>What resources are diminishing OP?</br>  <br>I doubt the apocalypse will happen in out life time next WW will be over drinking water</br>  What's going to cause the next mass extinction?   So how long until humanity falls /b/? <br><br>Election day 2016</br></br>  <br>Oil to power every thing<br>Drinking water to sustain every thing</br></br>  <br>everything comes to an end what makes you so special.</br>  It was a better book.  <br>We've got pretty much unlimited nuclear power when the oil and natural gas runs out in a century or so.<br>We just need to raise the price of water so it doesn't get used on superfluous stuff like growing activated almond milk and stuff. Plus desalination is going to keep getting cheaper and eventually we'll be able to get water from comets.<br>There's plenty to worry about man but I don't think resources is it.</br></br></br>  Nations are unsustainable. Society will splinter into a economic dark age and tiny warlord nations will spring up all over. Cos who the fuck else is going to take control of the local area. <br><br>Basically we'll fall back as far as Africa.</br></br>  Everyone should watch the documentary Four Horsemen. It's mostly about the causes of the 2008 economic collapse, but has a lot more on how screwed up our systems of government are and how it got that way.  <br>Pretty much this. Once large nations can no longer sustain and maintain power/control, we'll probably fall back into local tribes.</br>  <br>Nuclear power will not power <br>Earthworks machinery<br>Trucks personal transport etc<br><br>And it is not renewable once it is gone thats it</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> cast: Gnome Chomsky <br> into the trash it goes </br></br>  Kim will press the red button just before dying and bam! WWIII in 2024  <br>Not for at least 100 years, natural resources have still got some life in them yet, when they run out, who knows</br>  <br>Plus, it's not just that desalination is expensive.<br><br>It's that there are very few sites suitable for a plant.<br><br>Desal is great, but it isn't going to be enough.<br><br>California is already starting to learn this the hard way</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Renewability is overrated</br>  <br>Uh California is running out of water right Fucking now.</br>  <br>Like I said, California just needs to start selling water instead of allocating it to random uses based on what the politicians think is important.</br>  <br>You really think so <br>we have consumed the majority of minerals used in less than 100 year of production</br></br>  Well now that the gays can marry I'm sure it won't be long  <br>They've already outlawed landscaping uses of water. ... But you know what?<br><br>Our pussy liberal pc state doesn't want to oppress anybody.<br><br>So instead of just telling people "turn your Fucking water off" we're offering faggots rebates and financial incentives to obey the law.<br><br>WERE PAYING PEOPLE TO SAVE THEMSELVES<br><br>Not only is our response not enough, but we're gonna bankrupt the state even more, while we fail.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You don't get it, California is already burning through its water reserves.<br><br>Even if they cut ALL superfluous water usage, we would still not have the bare minimum to maintain calis population for more than a few years at best.</br></br></br>  <br>It's not like deserts don't exist.<br><br>The faggots are also bringing it on themselves.<br> waah water treatment plants are ugly, we don't want them built! </br></br></br></br>  <br>Actually the citizens have done amazing in terms of water control, it's unregulated agricultural water usage that is the real problem.</br>  <br>Bankrupt <br>isnt all the revenue from legalizing pot <br>put california into profit ?</br></br></br>  Annd we have hoe towns already running out of water, places where they just sent going to bother piping it in anymore cause it's just too damned wasteful/expensive.  <br><br><br>Repeat after me. Raise the price of water.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuuuuck no<br><br>It's not legal, is medicinal.<br><br>State can't take as much from it as Colorado can.<br><br>Different tax codes once it's made recreational</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Repeat after me...<br><br>Mass exodus from California cause most people here couldn't Fucking afford it.<br><br>How Fucking stupid are you?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yup, you're right</br>  <br>Water is everywhere. We have an extra ocean's worth in the mantle of the planet. Global droughts will drive us to exploit local icy bodies in space. We could have esr and purify Europe or hydro mine frozen lakes on the moon or mars. I'm an optimist so i see only opportunities. As for the fall of humanity, I don't believe in it unless we are talking a gamma ray burst or something</br>  <br>The constantly increasing population of niggers.</br>  You know there is trouble when a first world country cannot sustain a state with water  <br>So California has a lower population? How is that the end of the world?</br>  <br>Bullshit.<br><br>The nearest state university still has emerald green grounds.<br><br>And it doesn't matter, they child cut usage by 75% and it still would not be enough</br></br></br></br></br>  Atleast when the rapture happens I can say "this is just like one of my chinese cartoons" because of pic related  <br> kek  <br><br>Cost/logistics of moon mining <br><br>and then on top of that ever having anyone able to afford to pay for moon water</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Little shit like this, all over the world + however much man can fuck it up too in the meanwhile = end times in my opinion</br>  <br>I partially agree. I think agribusiness should pay more but I don't think citizens should. Also shut down the fucking water bottling plants in the state. The cost of increase water price on agricultural products will be passed on to consumers and then they can decide if they want to support the costs or not. 0 individual water usage has shown tremendous improvement over 20 years but industry hasn't been forced to meet the standards of the average citizens</br>  <br>Imagine a roving band of vagrants, the size of a whole Fucking state, with no where to go, no jobs, etc.<br><br>You think all the people in cash could relocate so easily<br><br>And for the ones who stay, it's gonna get ugly, because living in California is gonna get allot Fucking harder here soon.</br></br></br></br></br>  itt: Optimists vs pessimists round 40203038993  <br>Hahaha well there is a cost to progress. But it's an economy of scale. Enough of a demand for extra terrestrial water and costs would cone down. Plus you have created a new impetus for near earth exploration. I agree it will have to come after we are near exhausting local supplies or the cost of rocketeering drops significantly</br>  <br> , because living in California is gonna get allot Fucking harder here soon. <br><br><br>We need to build a fence around you. <br><br>So you don't spread your commie cancer elsewhere.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Less poor ghetto dumb niggas, I like the idea of a lower population already.</br></br></br>  <br>Where are you getting your info?<br><br>The citizens, of California, are doing a shifty job at conservation.<br><br>Maybe the big cities, the ones in the media spotlight, but come to one of the inland counties, line riverside or San Bernardino, and you'll see.<br><br>California is dumping it's water in the desert.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  stupid amerifags will eventually make a virus that they cant control and it'll wipe out everyone.  <br>Yeah but allot wouldn't have the ability to leave, and only crime as a means to survive.<br><br>California is gonna be like a mad max movie in a few years, just watch.<br><br>Or like that one episode of futurama</br></br></br></br></br>  So is this basically a "Is California doomed thread?" because I think we all know the answer is yes.  <br> 2008 economic collapse <br><br>Get a load of this guy calling what happened in 2008 a 'collapse'. <br><br>Greedy goyim idiots got fleeced by smart Eskimo bankers once again, is all.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>O<br>Get a load of these edge lords. <br>You faggots will be dead and gone before anything happens.</br></br></br>  <br>This I don't doubt has already been done, and we're just waiting for some dumbass intern to kill us all.</br>  <br> stupid amerifags will eventually make a virus that they cant control and it'll wipe out everyone. <br><br><br>PLEASE GOD PLEASE THIS<br><br>WIPE OUT AFRICA FIRST PLEASE</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, let's get onto other areas of the world.<br><br>India is pretty boned, let's talk that.</br></br></br>  <br>I was looking at the Economist, but to be fair it didn't look at the inland areas just major metropolitan regions. The desert does seem a questionable for a golf course, so yes I agree their water costs should be extraordinarily higher. In the same way almond farmers should be paying out the ass</br>  <br>Faggots like you are even worse. You can't predict the future with such certainty like that you absolute fucking cuntmelon. <br><br>You have no idea what could happen in the next 100 years.</br></br></br>  <br>Europe ain't coming back<br><br>It's now New Africa</br></br></br>  Humanity is not going to fall anytime soon. You all have been scared by media too much, negative information overload.<br><br>Our economic system has been inflating and deflating in the same pattern for over a decade now.<br><br>So shut the fuck up, get out your basement, get your degree and stop bitching.</br></br></br></br>  <br>My impression was is that India was slowly becoming a non-shithole country.</br>  <br>I second this</br>  <br>Thank you.<br><br>Yeah palm springs, the whole Fucking city, should just get one giant fine.</br></br></br>  <br>We better, I don't want to live in a world ruled by feminists policing language and fatties called healthy. Also fuck the TPP it's going to get passed since no one gives a shit about it.</br>  <br>You think I'm worried about imaginary values in a computer somewhere?<br><br>Pisaant lil shit.<br><br>I'm worried about more tangible things.</br></br></br></br></br>  faggots thinking world will end, it will not.<br><br>most of the things we could do 10 years ago without oil are now easy to do with sunpower or wind or just fucking something, also there are a lot of green energies coming like algae oil and shit like that.<br>also for the war thing most of the countries are safe, only eurofags like germans russians and americans are kind of in harm cause they are the big guy, the rest of countries are just dogs.<br><br>i rather think about a big united world because of a big war where technology is beyond we expect today, and soon maybe in 50 years living on mars and having our own perfect breed animals as source of food, and dont know maybe cities reduce their size but increase their height having more places to build sources of power.<br><br>World has already reached a level of stability, its stupid to think about human being like if we were some retarded chimps when we outsmart every animal we found, we are smart enough to keep growing, and the same shitty people that exist today is the shitty people that lived in the french suburbs but with mobile phones</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Over crowded<br><br>Heat wave killing hundreds, same in Pakistan too.<br><br>Climate change is what's gonna fuck India.</br></br></br></br></br>  Gama ray bursts or running out of water. It will be one of those 2, or a mudslime will get their hands on a nuke and start ww3.  <br>India is growing rich, soon they'll be able to afford air conditioners.</br>  <br>How old are you?<br><br>Someone thus naive can't be over 20.<br><br>We're no where near shirking our dependence on oil. No. Where. Close.<br><br>So what's your logic? When most leading climatologists are already saying the damage is done, even if we ceased all our carbon emissions right now, we're still fucked.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>also the amount of smart people (people who contribute to humanity by creating or discovering) is fucking huge compared to 100 years ago where only 2 scientist did soemthing that changed the world.<br><br>The only reason you faggots keep dreaming about a world where we all die is because u are too weak to live but too strong to suicide, just go and get drunk while world evolves.<br>The humans are growing and religion is dying, all the dogmas from 200BC are now gone or slowly getting to despair.<br><br>You faggots only want to see the world burn because u dont know how to live with your pain inside you.<br>its like when a chimp breaks something cause he is mad</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Really.<br><br>Meanwhile, one of the most aggressive Islamic caliphates is takin over the middle east.<br><br>Oh and they absolutely hate the western world..<br><br>And allot of our western youngsters are joining them</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Religions are not dying, they are condensing, the fringe cults are disappearing. But Christianity and Islam are bigger than they've ever been.</br>  <br>19yo but i rather fight for a good future than complain about a bad one doing nothing.<br><br>Damage is done and i know it, but we can grow plants in everyplace of the world, thing that we couldnt do 25 years ago, we created 400 different breeds of dogs, and we are currently creating cows bigger than cars.<br><br>Our world is just like it was 500 years ago, ever since the human kind started walking on earth we started fucking things up and dealing with their consequences, we evolved froma fucking ratlike creature.<br>We are bigger, live longer, and are smarter than 50 years ago.<br>Our world is not dying, is just on another phase where we go from one stage to another</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 100 years ago <br> only 2 scientists did anything to change the world <br><br>Don't go full retard, it's bad for your health.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>While nobody believes this shit literally anymore, those in power still use it and the common people 'believe' it for political purposes.</br></br>  It doesn't matter you retards, if one religion dies a new one will rise or something similar.<br><br>Humanity is just cancer, deal with it, if we won't cause our destruction in the coming 100y, it will happen eventually.</br></br>  <br>We're only so dependent on oil because the oil companies spend money to shit on better energy sources.<br><br>Just look at how well electric cars are doing, yet it's illegal to buy them in some states.</br></br></br>  <br>food shortage due to population. guess lots of asian and african folks will die and we will need 60% of our income for food and water</br>  <br>Discussing the future, and the ways it could go wrong, planning for those eventualities, that's how we make it. Develop a plan, etc.<br><br>You, you come here and project your negativity on me.<br><br>I haven't been complaining at all.<br><br>I'm excited for shit like this, cause I know it's coming.<br><br>And this feeling like we're just waiting for something to break is killing me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're a stupid fucking nigger. <br><br>Fuck, I can tell you're a black just by your complete idiocy and grammar<br><br>I want you all to die</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Do you know how much energy it costs to produce batteries that run your electric wondermachine?<br><br>Where do you think that energy comes from? <br><br>Electric cars are still ineffective and nothing can compete with the energy efficiency of oil. <br><br>And it will stay that way for the forseeable future becausew we've hit a technological wall for now. <br><br>tl,dr: don't wait for cheap electric cars in your lifetime</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>i already met more christians who didnt believe in god than atheists.<br><br>Muslims are just chimps, and i say this as a sandnigger who live in one of their "sacred islamic territories", thats why ill join the army if they ever reach north africa, also most countries they are taking have contrary beliefs than those isis faggots.<br><br>They already conquered spain once, and they fucking killed eachother when they got big, as soon as a islamic leader dies those guys will start fucking with eachother till they are too weak to defend themselves</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Like any of the shit you mentioned means we can save ourselves from ourselves/earth.<br><br>This planet will go through changes whether we like it or not.<br><br>And there is nothing we can do to stop it right now.<br><br>Wishful thinking doesn't save lives.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Because ISIS totally won't diminish or get bombed to nothingness in the next few years </br></br>  <br>I would agree with you, except, we've never faced a terrorist group like Isis.<br><br>We can't base out predictions on their campaign on interactions with other extremist groups because even they think Isis is too hardcore.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Neither do you, but you still act like you know the end of the world is near.<br><br>Fucknut. Kill yourself.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>ISIS is created and run by the Mossad, you idiots. <br><br>Notice how they only take action against Israels enemies?<br><br>Notice how the West is doing nothing about them?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tl,dr: don't wait for cheap electric cars in your lifetime <br><br><br>I guess you haven't seen the new Tesla line.<br><br>Oil is not efficient because its source cannot be replenished. There are plenty of other good energy sources, but people pay to keep them from being popular.<br><br>Modern nuclear technology can create a reactor that runs off the nuclear waste we have huge stockpiles of, yet we can't take advantage of that because <br> nukkleor iz bade giyz </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not acting like that at all, all I said was that I want to go out with a bang.<br><br>Chill mang.</br></br></br>  <br>you are really saying that we survived fighting with animals that were the size of cars and survived the cold weather with just pelts, and now that we are smart enough to reach other planets we cant stand a fucking ice age or a desert era?</br>  <br> Because we totally have never tried that on any other extremist group/nation and completely and utterly fucked it up. </br>  <br> 2015 <br><br> People still thinking oil takes millions of years to form <br><br>I bet you think the earth is billions of years old, too</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It won`t happen in our lifetime, just enjoy the ride.</br>  <br>Uh... Yeah, pretty much.<br><br>Oh were better off than we were, for sure. Well parts of the world are anyways.<br><br>But our planet is capable of such cataclysmic change, we just couldn't defend ourselves.<br><br>If yellow stone erupts, Jesus, like the whole north west hemisphere is gonna feel the impact of that shit for years to come<br><br>And it could blow any time now.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A Tyrannosaur is awesome also.</br>  ITT: A bunch of Bill Murray-dicked faggots.  <br>Interesting propaganda, I wonder who posted it.</br>  <br>Or how about krakatoa? Or pompei? And all the consequential effects events like those have.<br><br>Our planet is a friggin human murder machine, and it's good at it too.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't say that damn it!</br>  <br><br>Just want to get laid before it's happening!</br></br>  <br>You're a fucking retard dude. There's tons on energy being produced by wind and solar but stupid people are hindering the process because "I don't want a wind or solar farm in my town because it's ugly." It's those people and oil lobbyist that are hindering alternative energy production. And to say we've hit a technological wall is absolutely stupid, we're more technologically driven than ever.</br>  <br><br>Just want to get laid before its happening!</br></br>  <br>I am looking forward to some end of the world orgies.</br>  <br>And yet it is still not enough.<br><br>Even if all those pepper you mentioned stopped fussing, it still would not be enough.<br><br>Don't have the infrastructure for widespread total electric vehicles, don't have efficient electric vehicles that aren't prohibitively expensive to produce, don't have alternatives for mass commercial transport yet.<br><br>There is allot that still needs to be done, you're arguing for what could be, while the other guy is arguing for what is.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> we're more technologically driven than ever. <br><br>Not in the area of energy. <br><br>Which is why your car still runs on dead dinos and your smartphone needs charging twice a day.<br><br>We have awesome new tech in chemistry, electronics and other branches, but our energy processing is still 'primitive'. <br><br>Wind farms and solar panels take up insane amounts of space for the amount of energy they produce. <br><br>But yeah, if anyone is going to come up with a complete replacement for oil, it's going to be the oil companies themselves. Just not in our lifetimes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Of corse we don't because there's tons of things holding it back. If we took all those things away we'd have efficient non oil cars and &gt;50% renewable energy within 5 years. But instead we have stuck up cunts and lobbyist that'll make sure it never happens. What could take us 5 years could well take us 25 or even 50 years. But go ahead and tell me whay you're saying is 'truth'</br>  <br>Yeah because why would oil companies, who have trillions of dollars at their disposal, allow new tech to be created if it means their demise?</br>  <br>Jews I think.</br>  <br> ill give it 80 years till the last resort of civilisation falls and all people start killin each other for the goods</br>  <br>it's already fallen, it's just a fekkin long way to the big thump at the bottom</br>  <br><br>To own and control the new technology and its patents, and to move on from oil when it finally runs out sometime. <br><br>Duh.</br></br></br></br>  <br>There's been several scientists who have already developed alternatives to oil worldwide.<br>Jews keep assassinating them, though.<br>In any case, replacements do exist. We just have to wait until they allow us to use it.</br></br></br>  <br>i dont believe jews did dis<br>but it breaks more or less down to this<br><br> europe soon new africa </br></br></br></br>  <br> There's been several scientists who have already developed alternatives to oil worldwide. <br><br>Dont get your hopes up.<br>It will be shit.<br><br>Margarine is supposedly an alternative to butter.<br>But its a shitty alternative.<br><br>They always are.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>when it runs out the co2 emmissions will alrdy be so high we will burn to death walking out of our doors</br>  <br><br>Look on the bright side, a volcano or metor would have probably wiped out human life by then.</br></br>  We're all fucked guys. The next mass extinction has basically begun because we've been fucking with the ecosystem since we've been around. <br><br>There's too many people on the planet. I really doubt it was meant to hold 7 goddamn billion medium to large mammals like us. To feed us all agriculture is fucking shit up.<br><br>Climate change isn't going to be stopped because people are too worried about muh economy and not the bigger picture. I give us 200 years max until the whole system collapses.</br></br></br></br>  <br>within 25 years<br><br>the critical mass of human stupidity was passed 10 years ago<br><br>humanity is now approaching meltdown mode.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>im guessin more for war as people will loose their livestandards and a lot of anger will rise<br><br>but id like mor a natural catastrophe</br></br></br>  <br>Do you actually believe that?

And they offer the solution. We need a global civil movement forcing governments to heavily invest into renewables, redistribute wealth on a massive scale, nationalise key infrastructure like energy and water supply and drastically reduce lobby influence. <br><br>You say it is impossible? Well, maybe just now, but wait a few years. Capitalism is tearing itself apart. When more and more countries that used to benefit from capitalism see it's ugly face (Spain, Portugal, Greece to name a few recent ones) a global movement can gain momentum.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We revolt. We stop putting up with the shit from the ruling class as they gobble up our future, and instead we bayonet them in the back. It's harsh, it's cruel, and some good people will die, but our alternative is for us all to die.</br>  <br>ill be on mars before we finally fucking finish this plac off, and when that happens ill be on the guns shooting down the earthling refugee ships laughing as I enjoy my mars burgers made of 100% soy protein and fat substitutes.</br>  <br><br>In what way was Margarine halted before they could develop it?</br></br>  <br><br>fuck off back to /leftypol/<br><br>notice no one but me responded to your propaganda?? <br><br>it's because no one cares about your pinko bullshit</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This anon's on the right track. Capitalism is tearing itself apart, but trying to fix it is like trying to fix an old lemon. It's a whole lot better to just upgrade to a better model.<br><br>We can build a new world from the reconstituted ashes of the old, but it is up to us to light that fire.<br><br>Now who's with me?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>so you tellin me to wait till we can poison the animal that is growing on us because we didnt come up with a better system earlier in time<br><br>i strongly doubt that it will work<br>it will look more like destroying and rebuild the same shit dis time with the revolutionists as the pike in destroying the planet<br><br>waiting isnt actually an option.<br>earth heated up alrdy 1.2 C since 1950 and scientist say we could manage a total of 2C before shit starts to collapse<br>i doubt it is true but even if we manage more than 10C we are already too late for getting a valuable solution<br><br>it is really difficult....</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Actually a global movement is most likely the beginning of the end. I'm not certain, but it's possible the United Nations will be that force to try and unite as a world power and then it all goes south. Keep an eye on them.  <br>I'm not from /pol/. I've been on /b/ for many years now. In fact, /b/ has if anything shown to me the power of people united as one. It has not made me lose faith in humanity, but has actually strengthened it.</br>  <br><br>Im worried the lefties and their mad lefty schemes to 'save' the planet might end up destroying it.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, except look at what happened to OWS<br><br>And now, out of no-where, these faggots suddenly invented this 'white privilege' bullshit to shift the blame to white people to distract everyone from the real problem, which is the ultra rich</br></br></br>  <br>People settled on shitty butter scented plastic froth before they made it taste better.</br>  <br>Well I hope the ruling class isn't suicidally mad, but if they are, that just means we'll have to work quickly once the ball is rolling.</br>  <br>Can't you read: I said redistribution of wealth on a massive scale. What do you think I meant by that?</br>  well afterall it would be the exact irony that god placed in all our asses, if /b/ manages to give out the solution to the main problem of humankind  <br>No, but batteries, powered by electricity coming from nuclear powerplants will.</br>  <br>What the fuck is wrong with you.<br>Its water ffs<br>Why must everything have a price.<br>People that sell water to other people for a profit are no better than people who sell there own family to slavery</br></br></br></br>  <br>Omg people ice from comets really? Our planet is like 75 percent or more water.<br>We are not running out of water, we are running out of good people.</br></br>  <br>White privledge is a thing, but I do belive, to the chagrin of much of my comrades, that it needs to take a back seat to the issue of overthrowing the rich ruling class. We can deal with racism and sexism and all such other -isms and -phobias later.</br>  <br>Are you retarded? I pointed out the abject failure of the only social movement since the Bolshevik revolution to stand up to the ruling class. <br><br>You think that you can get another one started? <br><br>You never will with your commie 'wealth distribution' either. <br><br>We need to do away with fiat currency and the current economic order entirely, and usher in an age of resource-based economies and energy accounting. A ruling class of the most intelligent people alive, the scientists. <br><br>Technocracy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> resource based economies and energy accounting <br>Otherwise known as market socialism. It's a valid possibility, but know what it is.</br></br>  <br>Gtfo commie.</br>  <br>I truly believe we have to act today. And I do think we shouldn't wait. But: As long as the dominant ideology prevents major steps into the right direction, we will only get minor improvements.<br><br>The US power is dwindling, China experiences the limits of growth, industrialized nations are now experiencing major evconomic diffculties and a rise in poverty and unemployment.<br><br>I just say we are at the brink of game changing events. And this will have very dire consequences but can also be a purifying thunderstorm that can open up new possibilites.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>"Technocracy" means "central planning". That worked SO well for the Soviet Union!</br>  <br>White privilege is not real. <br><br>If it were there would not be any poor whites..<br><br>Jewish privilege is real. Upper class privilege is real. But you can't convince me that my family in the mountains of North Carolina are privileged in any way. They are poor as fuck. <br><br><br>Technocracy is not socialism. Socialism is based in fiat currencies. <br><br>In a truly technocratic society, energy is equivalent to currency. <br><br>But if you lefties want to think that is socialism, go right ahead. <br><br>We can agree that the rich have to go. <br><br>Off with their heads!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Agreed. If the whole world rose up tomorrow, our current system of abusive economics would be over by Tuesday. We must act quickly to spread the message that the status quo is going to kill us, but that there is a way out.</br>  <br> White privledge is a thing <br><br>How do I get mine?<br>Do I have to fill in a form?</br></br></br></br>  When oil becomes low enough to be a problem then actual investment in fusion energy will advance dramatically. Right now there is no real push for it because there is tons more money to be made in oil production. There is already a working demo of fusion energy at room temperature made by an aircraft manufacturer. But substantial investment needs to be made to upscale it to the demands of industry and domestic use. Those with power hold all the strings to make it happen. Right now they don't want anything that will undercut their lifestyle.  <br>Then all new oppressive regimes will rise. History repeats itself. At the moment I am waiting to see if Greece goes full tilt.</br>  <br>OWS was a spark too early. The tinder was not dry enough. But the fire is smoldering away happily until it really catches on.<br><br>By the way: Sadly, you, like many Americans, have a reflex to just disqualify many ideas as "Communist" without actually thinking about it.<br><br>The rich can stay rich, but not obscenely rich.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>dis is seriously a matter of concern (english went full retard)</br></br></br>  <br>It was obviously invented by the rich so that the common pleb can direct his vitriol upon innocent people and not on the rich fucking criminals.</br>  <br>Yes, it's called a job application. You get the job while Jamal here doesn't.<br><br>The reason there is white privledge is *because* there are poor whites. It's a bone thrown at them to make them think, "well, at least I'm not a negro" instead of thinking, "I deserve more than this"<br><br>But let's start with the things we can agree on, and we'll work from there. I'll go get the blades sharpened!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Agreed. If the whole world rose up tomorrow, our current system of abusive economics would be over by Tuesday. <br><br>And the lights would go out on Wednesday.<br>People would be rioting over whats left of the food supplies by Friday.<br>Society breaks down completely by the following monday.<br><br><br>Pic related.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yes, it's called a job application. You get the job while Jamal here doesn't. <br><br>Im self employed. They never even asked my race when I filled out the forms.</br></br></br>  <br>This anon just hit the nail on the head right here. It keeps people looking down on others instead of looking up at the fuckers sipping martinis from their balconies.</br>  <br> my feelings dictate the economic outcomes of millions of people. <br><br>Socialist pls go</br></br></br>  <br>I hope it does. It would be a breath of fresh air.</br>  <br>lel. You have no idea what socialism is, do you?</br>  <br>You people are fucking delusional. <br><br>I'll never be on the same side as you. <br><br>If I were, and I found out that you think shit like white privilege was real or mattered in any way, I would slit your fucking throat in your sleep</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ha. And why should the feelings of a few ultra-rich dictate the economic outcome of millions of people be the better solution?<br><br>And believe me: I will not go away.</br></br></br>  <br>They usually don't: they look for traditionally Black or White names. But congratulations on wiggling your way out of wage slavery for now.</br>  <br>Like minded, good shit.</br>  <br> le you dont understand socialism maymay xD </br>  <br>Fine, don't be on our side. We don't need you. But try to slit our throats, and we won't hesitate to shoot you first.</br>  FAGGOTS<br><br>comin up with stupid privileges and whos fault it is and whos the actuall problem on this earth<br><br>u shittier bastards live all(and i mean every single fuckin one) from this system<br><br>what we need is a solution not a scape goat</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  Fucking up the planet for decades with "technology and progress". <br>  Let's throw some technology and progress at it and see how we fare <br><br>mfw</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because their "feelings" don't dictate the economic outcomes of millions. <br><br>You want to use the power of the state to steal from others based on your subjective opinions. <br><br>You are human scum.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> what we need is a solution not a scape goat <br><br>And the solution is to get rid of the rich</br></br></br>  <br> they look for traditionally Black or White names. <br><br>Lol that reminds me of my friend.<br><br>He always researches the companies he buys things off if possible and makes sure they arent owned by pakis.<br><br>But he doesnt mind chinks or blacks so I guess its not white privilege in this case its paki handicap.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, the scum is you for having already stolen from others for no other reason than unrefined greed, and now want that theft to be inviolable as you make others dance for you like marionettes. You are truly the worst of the human species.</br>  This is possibly the most intelligent conversation I've seen on /b/ in a while.<br><br>Can anyone really make a solid case for any solution, as a turn towards ______ism can be shot down and glorified in the same breath? <br>Don't like global warming? How do we fix it? <br>Hate the "1 percenters?" How do we all agree how to change it?<br>As humans we are polarizing, that's why America's system is fucked. You're either a Democrat, a Republican, or hated by both as an independent. <br>There's never going to be a clean-cut solution to any problems nowadays, thanks in part to the spread of misinformation/blind trust, lack of power in the lower classes, and a fear that we make the situation worse than it already is. <br>Pic very related</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>and start an actual war?<br><br>u think earth can take another war?</br></br></br>  <br>Just because you define it at theft does not make it so.<br><br>Please explain to me how the CEO of Nvidia is "stealing" from people by running a company that i purchase goods from?</br></br></br>  <br>Amen brother<br><br>Yeah, meaningful conversations like this are quite rare on /b/, but it is said that the most delicious fruits come not from a tended garden, but the unkempt jungle.</br></br></br>  <br>The problem is not a water shortage, but the policies to manage said water. Also, technology exists that would make current nuclear plants obsolete and it's called Thorium reactors. It's from the 1960s, it's clean, it burns nuclear waste, risk of meltdown is low, can't be used for weapons. Highly efficient,can be used to purify sea water, create Hydrogen,from water, and or power electric cars. The fact of the matter the greed from the few that just want more money and watch the world burn,think that as long as they're wealthy they won't be affected by it and they'll always find a way.<br><br>A few wealthy people have social consciousness, or are driven for survival, cus they know if shit hits the fan all the social structure that protects them will falter and they and their kind will have their heads on a a pike.<br><br>Meaning if these fuckers don't relent we're gonna get fucked.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You actually believe the ultra-rich became ultra-rich not by exploiting others? Are you so naive?<br><br>You want to use the power of corporations to continue stealing from others out of their financial interests.</br></br></br>  <br> u think earth can take another war? <br><br>I think we need a war to make ww2 look like a bar fight. <br><br>And we need to do it in Africa to kill of a few hundred million niggers.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes. Capitalism has made it possible to become wealthy by serving other people by mutually beneficial gain. <br><br>Its called comparative advantage.<br><br>If you ever took a class in economics, you would understand this.<br><br>Again, you need to explain how exactly the rich are stealing from others. You have yet to explain why.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt; Fucking up the planet for decades with "technology and progress". <br><br>We introduced medical science to Africa.<br><br>It was their decision to keep breeding at the same rate even though we increased their infant survivability rates by 10000%.<br><br>Thats what ended up fucking things up.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The fall of one civilization does not mean the end of humanity. It never has no matter how many civilizations have fallen in the past.</br>  <br>Sadly, that's what most people in America and Europe believe. Our task is to show to them what complete and utter elephantshit that is.</br>  <br>Well, inside your ideology your argument is vaild. <br><br>But: Nvidia can only produce its products (made in China I believe) because they have access to cheap raw materials, cheap labour and because they are not held responsible for their ecological impact. <br><br>So they are stealing from poeple around the world and you are taking part in it.<br><br>Simple as that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Except for what we shot into space, every atom that was here when mankind started is still here. We just moved stuff around. Junkyards and landfills will be the mines of the future.</br>  <br>dis guy has it figuered out, or atleast it will give us some more time</br>  <br>Yeah, the white race just loves to keep fucking itself over. <br><br>Then when nature invents ways to keep the African population under control with diseases, white people have to go back there with their medical science and help them stay alive. <br><br>I'm sick of white people doing this shit</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>full metal alchemist came tru or what</br>  <br> implying the freedom fighters in the Middle East are going to make an Islamic utopia </br>  <br>How will that make more water when its already gone? They'll be out of water within a year or so.</br>  <br>So providing jobs and income for people in third world countries is bad? <br><br>Every nation had to go through their own industrial revolution. China is going through theirs now. After it has exploited its environment to build its infastructure, it will focus on cleaning up and regulating businesses. <br><br>The same thing happened in every developed country in every part of the world.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>he just wants to kill of the poor who live in inhabitable zones</br>  <br>WHAT I WAS THINKING</br>  <br>The "comparative advantage" of the rich is that they own capital (money, land, machinery). How did they come to own capital? By either forcibly taking it from others (as in land), paying people minimal wages to build it but using the state and property laws to keep them from running off with it (as in machinery), or using financial churning and govermnent debt (as in money). All those are ways of taking the work of others for yourself with the force of the state. Therefore, buisiness is really state-supported organized theivery.</br>  1000 years  <br>You really don't know what comparative advantage is, do you?<br><br>You know, a 2 second google search would help you to not look like an edgy 15 year old highschooler on summer break.</br></br></br>  <br>Well the problem is, that capitalism has derailed long ago. It has fallen prey to its own success. Now we see ever increasing wealth in a very small part of the population. The rest has to live with less and less. <br><br>Sadly, economy classes teach you that this is the way it should. <br><br>This situation is unbearable for any society. It will lead to chaos.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> business is really sttate-supported organized thievery <br><br>which is needed in a sorta way, else well still be sitting in caves and fucking sheeps or some shit</br></br></br>  Granted the cost would be prohibitive, but what about a cannal from the ocean with a glass domed cover running miles into the land. Condensation on the dome can be collected and some desalinization would occur from the distance traveled.  <br>No matter how you feel about the blacks, you have to at least acknowledge MLK was on point.</br>  <br>I know what it is. I'm saying it's a myth to cover up what is really systematic theft.<br><br>I know fully well what you mean, I'm just calling bullshit on it.</br></br></br>  Smart folks are already moving to rural areas, stocking up food and supplies,and preparing for the soon to come collapse.<br><br>The average mook and the willfully blind will deny any and all problems right up until the day the collapse happens. Then they'll be shocked and wonder what went wrong as they starve and freeze to death.<br><br>If you're in the first group, don't try to convince or sway anyone. Its too late for that, just get somewhere safe and prep as much as you can while you still can. The initial economic collapse is likely to happen within the next two years. After that it'll be 6months of hell as millions die off and kill each other for the last scraps. Once the initial die-off is complete people will start again, though it'll be anything goes/MadMax style for quite a while.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This is actually not true. IT is true that the rich are getting richer, but the poor are not getting poorer.<br><br>Economics is not a zero-sum game. <br><br>By increasing the figurative pie, each slice becomes bigger, even if their "slice" is comparatively smaller.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the amount of workers u need to get away the salt which will be left behind would be massive and higher the cost of water immense<br><br>or in other words. ud need slaves to be able to keep the water affordable for everyone</br></br></br>  <br>I'm so glad a college freshman has the intellectual clout to disregard the last 200 years of economic theory.</br>  <br>illuminati faggot bullshitter<br><br>get off ur eivorytower and try to think pragmatic<br>the world cant be and isnt controlled by a few as it is impossible to keep control up for more than a few hirarchic steps.</br></br></br></br>  <br>As before, you are talking out of your ideology. You claim that you are providing jobs and income for people in third wold countries. But the industrialized countries always made sure that the former colonies and pretty much every country in the world had to pick up trade with them. The fact that there are people in third world countries labouring hard for our consumer market is not an act of kindness. It is hardline economic self-interest. Don't turn it into a gift. It is not.<br><br>And: No! No country "had" to go through their industrialization. See above. The Western world dragged the world behind it to exploit it.<br><br>This probably would have happened anyway in many countries, But you are wrong when you say this is a kind of "natural" progress. It is not. It is the result of decisions, wars and money.<br><br>And it can be changed.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Cringe thread<br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/y_u1Hsh9uJE  [ ]</br></br>  https://<span>youtu.be/04rKoWe8Iek  [ ]  ▲<br>▲▲</br>  https://<span>youtu.be/YVvoCbZSaLs  [ ]  Would you pay £1000 for an hour with her?<br><br>http://www.sugarbabesinternational.<wbr>com/female-escorts/aletta-ocean</wbr></br></br>  <br>…agreed…</br>  <br>yeah what this guy said ;)</br>  <br>r u srs</br>  Trips can get in, quads are VIP.
