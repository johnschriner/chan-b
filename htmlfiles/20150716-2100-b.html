[  holy fuck I am so tired <br> hit the bed <br> wide awake <br><br>Anyone else have this shit? Why? How do I sleep?</br></br></br></br>  <br>its called insomnia, take melatonin. it helps</br>  get drunk /b/ro  <br>I used to all the time. Then bumped it up to benadryl because it stopped working. Now that's not doing shit either.</br>  finger you asshole...................and sniff dat shit  <br> tfw under 21 american </br>  <br> implying this isn't already a daily occurrence </br>  i'm new at this  Somebody come put me under for fucks sake  <br>watch a silent movie</br>  <br>i kno how ya feel. block all lights and sounds. and relax your eyes until they close by themselves. in 3 hours you'll sleep.</br>  <br> 7AM <br>Fuck 3 hours, how about before the sun rises?</br></br>  Find an ASMR channel on YouTube that relaxes you. I don't have ASMR, but they always do the trick. Earbuds or headphones work best.  Same problem. This is going to sound gimmicky, but I swear it works.<br>Get comfortable. Lights out, phone silent, etc.<br>It's the 4-7-8 breathing trick.<br><br>Breathe in for 4 seconds<br>Hold breath for 7 seconds<br>Out for 8 seconds <br>Repeat until you're drifting off<br><br>I do it until I'm sufficiently sleepy, then just do like a 4 heartbeat in, 4 heartbeat out breathing thing until I'm asleep.<br><br>Works for me when I stay awake through the benadryl.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I bought a sleep/eye mask, whatever it's called to put over your eyes, recently. i found that it really helps me when i'm trying to sleep especially if i'm up past 4</br>  <br>this is a non issue run around your shithole house a few times, get tired, sleep.</br>  Computer, TV, and phone are read by the eyes as sunlight. They're all gonna make your brain want to stay awake. <br><br>Listen to music, something mellow, at a low volume. Helps me.</br></br>  <br>check' em?</br>  <br>  not knowing how insomnia works </br>  Ah yes don't worry, you are not the only one. I'm on about 20 hours awake myself right now. Been dealing with this shit for about 10 years now.<br><br>The best thing to do is usually just ignoring the fact that you need to sleep while in bed while thinking about random stuff. <br><br>What did you do today? <br><br>what happened in that movie I saw last week?<br> <br>eventually I usually just fall asleep. <br><br>If it takes too long to fall asleep jump out of bed and spend some time doing something else while waiting to get tired again. (avoiding computer/cellphone screens is advisable.) <br><br>also try to get in contact with a doctor. You'll probably not get any heavy meds but something that atleast slows you down a bit might help.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I've never met a hard working individual who has complained of insomnia</br>  <br>asleep yet dude?</br>  <br>You should write a book about how to cure insomnia and then sell it to all the people with insomnia. I'm sure they've never heard these tips before! I wonder why so much people have problems with insomnia when all they can do is run around for a bit and they will fall asleep instantly! You must be educated in this!</br>  <br>Fuck no. Help</br>  Building a new PC soon and it's time for me to select a case. All suggetions will be considered.<br><br>I'm looking for a full tower case, Doesn't have to be cheap, but I prefer functionality over looks. No limit really, but think about "would you buy it" or is it something you already own?</br></br>  This case. It's what I use and it's awesome. Great air flow, filters, cable management, hot swap drives, PLENTY of room.  <br>6 core intel requires ddr4 if i remember right... <br>for me, i could use the higher end cpus because i do render work but for gaming its only advantage is head room so if something in the background turns on you don't get stutters. <br><br>if i was just building a cp to game, i would go with silicon lottery because the guaranteed overclock will give you far more than the 2 extra cores will, at least till dx12 comes out, even than, it may still be better with the higher clock 4 core than 6 core.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fractal master race<br><br> pic related </br></br></br>  What does /b/ think of new joker?  theyre trying to hard. he looks like just another cosplay faggot  <br><br>woah. this seems really important to you...</br></br>  <br>nah man.. <br> 3dgy tattoos <br><br>that said I'll still watch it and hope it lives past my expectations</br></br></br></br>  Post dem desktops yo  <br><br>fellow master race. i remember talking to you about the little windows icon ton the right he other night. it keeps coming back no matter what. impossible to defeat</br></br>  fml    give me your best      Fuck off to /mlp/ niggers  anyone have google deep dream pictures?

Okay hip-hopfags and rapfags<br>listen up.<br>Explain to me how I've toiled to scavenge all of the corners of the internet and I still can't find a better rapper better than Eminem. Don't give me that bullshit that he fell off after his first albums because today he surpasses any rapper you can present me or this planet rather. And trust me when I say I've scavenged all around this fucking planet to find someone better I literally have searched into the depths of soundcloud and datpiff and just about any fucking site or underground album storage anyone can present to me but there's just no diminishing his status as the Rap God.<br> protip you can't </br></br></br>  denzel curry, Robb bank$, Sir micheal rocks,Bones, J.k the reaper, RVmirxz, $uicideboy$  Dizraeli<br><br>Baba brinkman<br><br>/thread</br></br></br></br>  Why is it that only edgelord white guys and tumblr girls like eminem?

I suck with languages, but I wasnt looking to do anything too foreign anyhoo. Just want to do some detective type stuff. I like the idea of CIA and undercover, as I am drawn to danger, but I think that doing it all day every day would be incredibly taxing. I just want to hunt criminals down using my wits and a code of laws to follow. For some reason, the whole idea of detective type work is super appealing to me. Id be okay with investigating white collar crime even... <br><br>There is nothing I love more than outsmarting my opponent, and the more rules and restrictions I have, the better I do. Ive spent some time dealing drugs and living the thug life, and it filled the adrenaline void I needed to fill, but it was both taxing (as I feared the law breaking into my house day and night) and somehow boring (no rules meant I got to carve any path I wanted, there wasnt a whole lot of challenge for the hick-ass backwater town I live in). <br><br>I really just want a job I can afford to make mortgage payments on, but if you throw in some danger (imminent or not) and a "game" for me to play (catching criminals is just as good as being one, IMO) and you have a job I would salivate over</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>its weird how so many channers are military bros</br></br>  <br>Its still good to know different languages even if your job isn't foreign because there are threats to mainland American from foreigners. Also I dont think you have a clue about what anybody in the FBI or CIA does. You've been watching to much tv.</br>  you are allowed to take 1gb of files / data / code (anything you can fit into 1gb) back in time to whatever date you want.<br><br>assuming you will be able to extract / read the stuff you take. what do you take and when do you take it to /b/?</br></br>  <br>clover field is 1.2gb. sorry anon</br>  <br>why winning every lottery??<br><br>realy no offense but this would be a little suspicious don´t you think so?<br>you would end in fbi custody for ether fraud or cut wide open to analyse your looking into the future power</br></br></br></br>  <br>Look at this dindu. Thinks they had 720p back then.</br></blockquote>]
