[ Can /b/ photoshop the fat out of this picture?<br>Thank you /b/rothers</br>  Whos this fatty lmao  Disturbing images thread. Bonus points for women/children/babies.  Can anyone think of a clever caption for this one?    Come on, faggots.  <br>would still bang</br>    i dont think reddit fags are ready /b/ros      Somebody else fucking contribute already.          Sup /b/,<br><br>My girlfriend of two years just admitted to me that she lied when we first talked about our sexual pasts with each other. Initially, she told me that she'd only slept with 2 other people, both boyfriends. Now she's admitted she's slept with 10 people (including me), had a threesome and has sucked 14 dicks. Most of these sexual encounters were apparently on holiday. <br><br>Am I justified in being angry?</br></br></br></br>  <br>ditch the bitch for not being honest, tell her you wouldve been fine with it if she was straight up :LLLLL</br>  Accept it or leave her. Her past is none of your buisness if you are happy with her right now    <br>My man goes to a used car lot and the guy tells him this car has been ib 15 major accidents. My man says well that's all in the past it's fine now</br>  sounds like you're dating a slut  <br>You can be angry at her for not being honest straight up, but she can't change her sexual past, if that's what upsets you.</br>  She wouldn't be as good as she is now if she hadn't sucked all those dicks before bro. If she doesn't have any sti's then just go with it. My girlfriend has sucked a lot of dicks too. I like to think of it like she's just been practicing for me haha.  <br>A lie is a lie, bro. Fucking slap her in the knee</br>  <br>Was this holiday while she was still with you or before?</br>  <br>Just means she knows what she is doing, it's not big deal bruh, as long as those sexual encounters didn't happen while she was with you, it's all gravy in the navy. Girls are allowed to be horny as well.</br>  She didnt lie OP, these just all happened after that initial conversation. I can confirm.  <br>Obviously no one wants to be lied to<br>I'd be more worried about being just another number. <br>How far do you see a relationship with someone like that really going?</br></br></br>  It's ok if she was on holiday, what do you expect her to do? I bet you suck dick on holiday, too.  Dante from clerks? Is that you?  <br>it took 2 years just to tell you that.Bitch is gonna cheat on you</br>  <br>no, i've sucked a lot o cock and i'm absolutely faithful to my guy, at least most of the time</br>  <br>Hmm.<br><br>At least she told you the truth now, right?<br><br>Do you love her?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Good analogy<br><br><br><br>Who cares if she lied to you initially OP? Will she lie to you again? Really, unless there's some deep philosophical reason why she has changed or why she isn't going to cheat on you now, enjoy getting cucked.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Well?<br><br>Do you love her?</br></br>  <br>Be mad that she lied. Don't be mad about her past.<br>Im sure you would have slept with 10 girls, had threesomes, and had your Dick sucked by 14 different girls if you had the option</br></br>  <br><br>yes you are.<br>dump here. and shut up about it</br></br></br>  girls like to fuck, guys like to fuck, there isnt much of a difference,<br>if you let little shit like sex pasts bother you, your not really ready for a full relationship.</br>  <br>Nah bro its really not that much</br>  <br>LOL have fun with that one bruh. I have absolutely no idea why you faggots date these type of girls. It's like sharing a fucking Fleshlight.</br>  <br>She accurately judged that you'd judge her for her number of sexual partners. She lied because you were a pussy. She told the truth because she thought you could take it. Apparently her judgment this time was wrong.</br>  Shot through the heart<br>And you're to blame.<br>You give love<br>A bad name!<br><br>You love her, don't you!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nothing wrong with disliking it. I'm not marrying a cum dumpster, but hey, that must mean I'm not ready to waste my money and love on a man toilet ay?</br>  <br>Haha the exact same thing happened to me. I could never look at her the same way again and she ended up being fucking crazy. If you dump her now, you're going to save yourself a lot of agro in the long-term. Once a liar, always a liar. Once a slut, always a slut.</br>  <br>every girl you hope to fuck, unless they are hideously dis formed, have wanted to fuck someone or something. see how you want to have sex with things? they do to..</br>  <br>Serves you right for believing her in the first place!<br>A 35 yr old, married coworker told me after having sex with me that she had 4 guys in the past. I believed her. Women lie! Accept it and let her suck dick.</br></br>  <br><br>Whores are not marriage material.</br></br>  <br>I didn't imply it's wrong to want to do stuff.. I am insinuating that I will never give my money or time to a slut, go cry a river if you're that insecure about it.</br>  personally would leave that type of girl ASAP  Ask her for some FFM three way action OP regardless of whether you stay with her or not.  <br><br><br>how is fucking 11 guys being a slut? that's like less then normal. <br>you should see how many guys my friends fuck on the daily, and these girls are not sluts by a long shot. they just happen to fuck. its not an uncommon thing unless you haven't seen the light of day.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Reminded me of my first and only gf ever.<br> Told me she was a virgin <br> Didnt bleed <br> Gave me herpes <br>Never again will I be jumping into a relationship with another human being. Ever.</br></br></br></br></br>  yeah, be the guy whenever you go out in public you run into a guy(s) shes got with. thats a real pleasure...  <br>Not even gonna argue with you. You clearly have no idea how girls work psychologically, especially after taking a lot of dick. Grow a brain.</br>  i dont understand, are people really mad at her for having sex with 10 guys?<br>i guess it depends on her age but also not really. even if it was 10 in the last 10 weeks, who gives a fuck? why would that even be a bad thing?<br>so your girlfriend liked sex before she met you... woah</br></br>    <br>Sure you can be angry. She lied to you. Doesn't matter how many she fucked tho, as long as there are no STDs.<br><br>But I think you should ask her what else she has lied to you about. Tell her that if she lies to you in the future, you are dumping her ass.</br></br></br>  <br>She's also got feelings for all that dick, most likely has consumed all that semen, and also lied. If you can't work this out, you are the problem.</br>  <br>Plot twist: the poster you were responding to is a grill. And she's a slut, just won't admit it to herself</br>  <br> As long as there's no STD's <br> Doesn't matter how many she fucked tho </br></br>  <br>I assumed that. Most guys wouldn't get that insecure about this specific topic.</br>  <br>she obviously had a good reason for lying, seeing the way all of you fucks are reacting.</br>  i would say that ranom sexual encounters arent a good sign, and if they were all boyfriends thats not a good sign either, i think you can stay with her but it will end up being a tearjerker later when youre masterbating by yourself laughing at frogs on the internet while shes out with her new bf  <br> even if it was 10 in the last 10 weeks <br> OP is in a 2 year relationship <br>This is the perfect example of a cuckhold</br></br></br>  Holy shit, I've just entered a relationship with a hot girl and I'm pretty sure she's lying about her sexual past (she says she's a virgin)  <br>Way to generalize on anecdotal evidence of one person. Trust me, there are cool girls out there too. Just be upfront with them. When you start dating, tell her the story about your first gf and that you don't tolerate lying.</br>  <br>NO, he's mad at her for lying, you dumb cum dumpster.</br>  <br>coming from the virginfag who's trying to say he knows how girls work, even though he dosn't think its normal for a normal girl to have more then 10 partners.</br>  <br>This. It should be obvious now as tk why she hid this from you, as it sounds super slutty.<br>however if you expect her to accept you in all your fault and way, and you truly like or love her, theh you should be accepting of her as well.<br>it took a lot of courage from her to tell you that info.</br></br></br>  <br>SHE GOT FUCKED BY A BUS LOAD OF COCK PRIOR TO DATING OP AND LIED TO HIM WHEN HE CLEARLY WAS HONEST TO HER, HOW ARE YOU NOT COMPREHENDING THIS? LMFAO</br>  <br>Listen Up fucktard<br><br>i bet she really really orgasmed and enjoyed herself too all that sex with you<br><br>I will let you in on a secret <br><br> a woman can fake an orgasm but a man can fake an entire relationship <br><br> what does a female orgasm sound like ? <br><br>WHO FUCKING CARES <br><br>Stop cucking yourself and get over it faggot bitch cared enough to not hurt you virginesque ass at the start</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You aren't justified for being angry, she probably has fucked 50 or more dudes. ALL GIRLS LIE ABOUT THAT. fucking newfag virgins "I think my girl is the honest girl, none of the others are hurr durr" Get over it, and stop being 12.</br>  <br>Yes, it's normal, doesn't mean I have to agree? What a time to be alive, hey sweetie? &lt;3</br>  <br>Sounds like a perfectly healthy sexual past</br>  Yes. Now leave. If she's lied about that, she'll lie about other, and worse, things.  <br>Hey there, femanon. Tits please?</br>  <br>its about having an std and making safe choices not about the meters upon meters of pipe that have been laid</br>  On one hand you fucked up for not knowing right off the bat they were lying.<br>On the other, fair enough, liberate yourself of the harlot.</br>    <br>Well when you put it that way, it makes me joke even worse kek</br>  <br>this, stop being so insecure you little faggot</br>  ITT highschool kids in there first relationships <br><br>Get some life expirience faggots</br></br>  <br>bad analogy. Sex doesn't equal car wreck. Only 14 year olds think women get "looser". OP is mad his gf has more game than he does is all.</br>  <br> healthy <br>kek</br></br>  <br><br>who the fuck keeps track of that??</br></br>  maybe you could have her dirty talk about it and jack off  <br>what kind of come back is that? <br>no wonder, does your mom do your laundry too?</br></br>  <br>Not a bad analogy. You're the faggot who thought he was implying girls get looser.. No, he means it's just fucking disgusting you cuck. You are the 14 year old</br>  <br>Yes, she lied to you. Tell her to make sure she doesn't lie again.</br>  <br>No doctor phil i speak a truth you wont grasp for another 5 or 6 years when you are in your 20s</br>  <br>Sorry to dissapoint but I have a dick bro.</br>  <br> what kind of come back is that?  <br> no wonder, does your mom do your laundry too? </br></br>  For lying, yes. Lying has no place in a relationship. Remind her of that and commend her on being honest.<br><br><br>Don't be mad about the dicks, Dante.<br>Jeez. Have you eaten/fucked pussy?<br><br>Cool. Vice versa. It's in the past. <br><br>Would you rather her be a virgin and contemplate what it's like to fuck other guys?? See if the grass is greener on the other side??<br><br>Prob not. She's played the field and chose you.<br><br>Focus on being happy. When you're happy, she's happy and then she fucks you better when that happens. And Prob less likely to not fuck other dudes. <br><br>So sack up and move past it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  ITT faggot virgins thinking sex with people means something <br><br>Grow up deadshits</br></br>  <br><br><br>Pissed off sluts calling OP "faggot" and "virgin" for being upset over being lied to.<br><br>This is why sluts don't deserve to be treated like human beings. They're children.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>her past is none of your fucking business.<br>ofc being lied to is a bit of a nogo though.<br>up to you if you can forgive her that.<br><br>If it actually troubles you that she slept with that many(to me the numbers sound average) dudes you better break up immediately.<br>shit will haunt you forever otherwise</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>kill her OP. then fuck her dead body. that's the ONLY way you can garantee you being her last fuck</br>  <br>Nice trolling attempt. OP is a fag, he's just upset he didn't get as much sex as his gf. You're 14.</br>  she must be easy.  <br>Wasn't a troll, it was literally just me taking my pants off and taking a sloppy shit all over you</br>  <br> girls <br> game <br><br>Topkek</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm older than that, sweetheart.<br><br>Here's a truth you won't grasp for a long time, if ever. People never really change.</br></br></br>  its the social media age<br><br>better get use to it</br></br>  <br>Dude if she lied about that then what makes you think she didn't lie about all other shit too? Fucking with everyone before she meet you is okay, that shouldn't be a problem to any rational person, however lying is unacceptable. Fuck her and then leave her, no other option.</br>  ITT virgins who have never lied to a chick just to fuck her and think the truth means something to anon sluts  <br>dubs that must be the truth</br>  <br>Female with vagina spotted.</br>  dude, don't forget that she liked you enough to lie <br>think about it.</br>  <br>Ask why she lied to you. Odds are, it's because your sexual history is short as hell and she didn't want to scare you off. <br><br>I've got a much, much longer sexual history than my g/f. Even though I was totally honest about it, I was worried it'd scare her off when we started dating. I even told her I've cheated in most of my long relationships. <br><br>She's trusted me not to cheat. I haven't. <br><br>TLDR; her history doesn't mean a whole hell of a lot now, and if she's not cheating on you, then none of this matters as long as she doesn't carry any STDs.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You must be a real catch then grandad with your ethics and morals that put integrity before anonymous sex with easy women</br>    <br><br>ARE YOU FUCKING WITH ME, OP? This must be a secret message to me.<br><br> been with gf for two years <br> she told me she'd only slept with 2 other people <br> both boyfriends <br> supposedly only made out with 6 more guys including me (went to the same high school), 3 of them during holiday <br><br>Brb, you motherfuckers, gotta prepare the interrogation. THANKS FOR RUINING MY FUCKING BEAUTIFUL SUMMER DAY, YOU PIECE OF SHIT!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> gf has more game than he does <br> girl has more game <br> girl game <br>They only need to say: "wanna fuck" and thar she blows. Even the ugliest of niggers could say that to almost any dude and he'll think: "anyone watching? Nah, good." - ok, where?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Another cumdumpster appears!<br><br>So, when you have to account for your extensive sexual history, how many encounters do you falsely claim are rape?</br></br></br>  <br> kekiest kek  <br><br>ITT Youngfags that dont know about resleeves</br></br></br>  <br>You dumbass. He's talking about honesty</br>  <br>You think putting ethics and morals before easy sex is a bad thing? It can keep you out of a lot of trouble.</br>  <br>Kek</br>  <br>Nice try at the bait faggot <br>I cant even tell where you concluded im a woman</br></br>  if its really easy for her to be talked into a threesome and shit tons of bj's how hard would it be to talk her into cheating.  <br>If you are a bloke over 20 as claimed i find it very hard to believe you have never lied to fuck a woman</br>  <br> Am I justified in being angry? <br>No she had a life before you. She isn't fucking other guys right now so why would you care?</br></br>  <br>Not hard, and I'm sure it's already happened.<br><br>Liars who think they're going to get caught soon let the truth out in spurts. <br><br>Stay tuned for her tearful confessions of cheating on you, OP.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think the biggest problem is that a girl with her past is very different than a girl who had sex with 2 guys in a relationship. Which you should have been doubtful of in the first place. She must act like a really nice girl? I am also curious of your location.<br>I think she's shady and you should phase her ass out.</br></br>  <br>Why would I need to?</br>  <br><br>How old are you, OP? And how old is your gf? Where'd you meet each other?</br></br>  <br>yes, break up with her, she lied to you and you can't trust anything she says, she's broken your trust. dump that slut, she did all that before she'll do it again. simple.</br>  <br>Oh, maybe because past behavior predicts future behavior?</br>  <br>She is a whore. That puts you in the position of deciding, do I want to be the guy who a whore settles down with (until she gets the itch again), or do I want to actually mean something to my woman? If you're okay with the former, stay with her. It's really no one else's business.</br>  <br>Fucking wow what are you jesus you cunt <br>such a caddilac of a man <br>an adonis chiseled from stone<br><br>prick</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>kek</br></br>  So I have nothing to do so I figure why not start so something to get people to destroy their Xbox One.

It's illegal in England if you're in a position of authority (such as teacher) to bang people under 18. <br><br>Even though the age of consent is 16.</br></br></br></br></br>  I live in the UK and a teacher fucked a 17 year old at my school, you guys know what happened? She got fired and struck off the teacher register, a very fair punishment IMO.  <br><br>Actually in the UK the teacher would have still been prosecuted for abusing their position of power.<br><br>Of course if it was a man doing that he would rot for a long time where as a woman might not even receive a custodial sentence.</br></br></br></br>  shut up britbong if this was england she would be in jail for failing to renew her tv license  she also had an incident with an 8th grader (13-14 years old for non murricans) and she had to resign and move  <br> Chances are you'd be executed. <br>Nope.<br><br>If you include manslaughter, the average person convicted of killing someone in the U.S. gets less than a year in jail.</br></br></br></br>  <br> she would be in jail for failing to renew her tv license <br><br>Top fucking kek, and true.

Serves her good.</br>  Why are so many /b/ags of shit complaining...? <br><br>She did nothing wrong. <br><br><br>Unless the 17 yr olds were niggers then she Dunn fucked up.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm shocked honestly. Normally women in this situation get a slap on the wrist while a man would get the maximum. Its retarded that it's illegal for her to fuck 17 year olds but it's not to see her not getting punished different since she's a woman.</br>  If I was a 7 year old kid I would have jumped at the chance to get a blowjob off a hot female teacher and stick my dick in her wet pussy. <br><br>Don't see what all the fuss is about, if it's consensual there isn't a problem, to me.</br></br>  Ahhhh comoooon 22 years?

They are jealous.</br></br>  <br><br>Murder can be justifiable, rape cannot.</br></br>  <br><br>Equality<br><br>Same thing a man would have gotten but he would get shanked in prison</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Only, it was not rape... dumb cunt.</br></br>  <br> Would of <br> run-on sentence <br> incoming excuse about how he doesn't give a fuck about 'grammer' </br></br></br>  <br>Except it wasn't rape.<br>They're 17 they are most 12 months away from being allowed to star in porn. How can you still class them as children...I'd they were 12 then yeah, arrest the bitch. But come on.</br></br>  <br><br>nobody gives a damn.</br></br>  <br>says the country with a massive violence problem, racial problems, equality problems, fast food problems. <br><br>Lead away, we are sure as hell not going to follow you.</br></br></br>  <br>Yep you fucking liar, you said<br>"If you include manslaughter" and then you cite cases ONLY involving manslaughter, including involuntary, which is a pretty fucking far cry from Murder 1, you lying ass cunt.</br></br>  <br>So 22 years in prison is a suitable punishment for sleeping with 2 students just shy of 18.<br>America doesn't treat criminals<br>It creates them</br></br></br>  <br>lol</br>  <br> sees someone who gives a damn <br> gives a damn about that person giving a damn <br> feels compelled to point out that no one gives a damn </br></br></br>  Yes, but was the student white?  <br>It's like you've came straight from the 1700's<br>22 years in prison for this. Brilliant, now when she comes out she's gonna be a programmed criminal.<br>Backwards America at it again.</br></br></br>  <br>lol rekt</br>  <br>and your a nigger!</br>  <br><br>And why do you give a damn? Do you always complain about grammar on the internet? You must be a very busy man. Get over it faggot.</br></br>  <br>Kek I live in Jew York where the age of consent is 17</br>  <br>At least one was a nig nog.</br>  <br> implying she'll serve even half of that <br>She'll be out in 5. No bullshit.</br></br>  <br><br>At least shes a woman so she wont have such a hard time in prison.<br><br>A man found guilty of the same crime is essentially being sentenced to 22 years of being raped.</br></br></br></br>  <br> who knows what kind of mental harm this could cause <br>Add 1 year on<br> oh well, they're two consenting adults </br></br></br>  <br> implies educating kids on grammar is a waste of time <br> wastes time trying to stop people from educating others <br>How delightfully vulgar.</br></br></br>  americas prison system is fucked up. This crime should give 2-5 years or so, max.    <br>kek'd hard</br>  <br>Oh nice, you're starting to get it. Laws can be confusing, I know.</br>  <br>Source, please.<br><br>And if so, guess it's better she rot than be allowed to give other teachers the wrong idea.<br><br>Teachers, do not fuck your black students. For your safety and the safety of the non-black students you fuck.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He knows what's up</br>  <br>equality, its what women wants, now they got it</br>  <br><br>What if this was a 7 year old girl, anon, and this woman had licked her little pussy and made her lick hers?! Would you be so qucik to defend her then?! What if it was your 7 year old little brother? <br><br>You fucking piece of shit, you disgust me.</br></br></br></br>  <br>THIS YOU STUPID AMERICUNTSSSSSSS</br>  <br>That's the stupidest thing I've read all morning. <br><br>Hey, want to know what will reduce crime to zero? Repeal the entire criminal code.<br><br>Hey, you know what supports the rule of law? Making special exceptions for women because they're young and pretty.<br><br>And you think you're fair. Imbecile.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So it can cause serious mental harm at 17 but not 18....OK, I think I'm starting to get it</br>  <br> mmm that lady around my mother's age is so sexy <br> she reminds me of my mom <br> mmm shes so nurturing, in her motherly role as a teacher <br><br>Yeah you guys have mommy issues. And I can't wait to hear what mental gymnastics you'll use to justify fucking your mother and why I'm sick for not wanting to.</br></br></br></br></br>    This is actually pretty evil. A big time mafia (government) takes away a woman consentially having sex with young men who CONSENTED, then completely ruining her life, calling her a pedofile, even though there's no difference between a 17 year old and 23 year old, not even in looks really, and sending her off to a place to be tortured, bashed, treated like an animal for 22 years, and severally fucking her up so badly. THIS IS EVIL!!!!!!! There's no justification for this, it's so fucking evil to do this to her. If you disagree, then you have been brainwashed by an evil mafia corporationalist government.  <br>Source: some guy in an earlier thread<br><br>But it was Florida, lots of nogs there.</br></br></br>  <br>The argument was because the "kids" were 17<br>Hey, lock the bitch up if theyre 7 but some kind of leniency should not been shown considering they're months away from 18 and clearly not children</br></br>  <br>Do you even know where you are? Fresh off the reddit canoe?<br><br>I've beaten off to beastiality manga before. This shit is small time.</br></br></br>  <br>nigger</br>  <br>that is the stupidest thing I've read all morning.</br>  Bear in mind boys mature slower than girls.<br><br>So a girl of 13 can easily handle sex with a guy in his twenties or thirties and that would be fine.<br><br>For a Boy they would have to be much much older to be able to handle it with the same maturity.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not because she's a woman but because they're fucking 17!<br>I'm done, stone her. I give in</br></br>  <br><br>What if this woman had showered naked with three 7 year old girls, washing their smooth, wet little bodies all over, honing in on their pubic area before slowly beginning to stimulate their little clitorises. Then getting them to wash her all over. <br><br>This is the kinda future Britbong pedos want for the world. This is one of the few good things American dominance of the world has brought about, an end to child sexual abuse, globally.<br><br>Fuck Britbong pedo cunts, this woman got dealt justice today.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Although you have a very good point, thank fuck I don live in that shithole called America.</br>  <br>Well, they gotta fill those for-profit prisons right?</br>  <br> implying at 17 you shouldn't be legally allowed to decide if you want sex or not </br>  <br>You wanna fuck your mother?

Did I mention they are all 6' ex military hulks and he's 5'8" and 140 maybe?  <br> I'm 6, expected to shoot my own father, or stab him. <br> I don't. <br> Today he's still an ass, but he's got money so every time I need anything I cry poormouth and take anything they give.  <br> They are retired and don't have it to give now but I chip away bit by bit and don't care. No one understands, I dont care.  <br> Fuck them both.  <br><br><br>I was a little kid and mom wanted me to kill my father, and though he was an ass, she was the one that beat me daily. I have no love for them, just a parental attachment. <br><br>Life is like that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Go kill them both. Now. Perfect time.</br>  <br>Not scary, just fucked.</br>  Tonight’s kind of a catalyst for this post. I just received another message, and it’s worse than any of the others.<br>My girlfriend died on the 7th of August, 2012. She was involved in a three car collision driving home from work when someone ran a red light. She passed away within minutes on the scene.<br>We had been dating for five years at that point. She wasn’t big on the idea of marriage (it felt archaic, she said, gave her a weird vibe), but if she had been, I would have married her within three months of our relationship. She was vibrant; the kind of girl that would choose dare every time. She was happiest when camping, but a total technophile too. She always smelled like cinnamon.<br>That being said, she wasn’t perfect. She always said something along the lines of, “If I kark it first, don’t just say good things about me. I’ve never liked that. If you don’t pay me out, you’re doing me a disservice. I’ve got so many flaws, and that’s just part of me.” So, this is for Em: the music she said she liked and the music she actually liked were very different. Her idea of affection was a side-hug. She had really long toes, like a chimpanzee.<br>I know that’s tangential, but I don’t feel right discussing her without you having an idea of what she was like.<br>Onto the meat. Em had been dead for approaching thirteen months when she first messaged me.<br>September 4, 2013. This is when it began. I had left Emily’s Facebook account activated so I could send her the occasional message, post on her wall, go through her albums. It felt too final (and too un-Emily) to memorialise it. I ‘share’ access with her mother (Susan) - meaning, her mother has her login and password and has spent a total of approximately three minutes on the website (or on a computer, total). After a little confusion, I assumed it was her.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  the grifter  anybody have goatman?  <br>Dawg just read the creepypasta today spoopy stuff</br>  <br>I got goats</br>  Not really spooky, but it always gives me shills<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ADj<wbr>Ch3j4Z2k</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Care to elaborate a little bit more?

With the age of Joseph Mengele about seems reasonable the other regime would experiment.</br>  <br>Hurry</br>  <br> dog badly photoshopped into picture <br>S P O O P Y</br></br>  <br><br>So we end up playing football. Dicking around with me, there's the white kid "Tanner", five of my cousins, and then four of their friends. In total, there were five girls and six boys. We all were around 15-17.<br><br>We ended up just dicking the day away. So, we head back to the camp and pulling out some stuff for a campfire, even though the trailers both had kitchenettes. Tanner says that his family's property sits up against my uncle's. He wants to run home and ask his dad if he can come out camping with us. My cousin Rooster says he's going to go with him since it's going to get dark soon. One of the girls also wants to tag along.<br><br>It's about 7 o'clock, and it's starting to get pretty dark. They take flashlights and take the trail toward Tan's property. The rest of us chill. We make smores, drink and kiss on the girls.<br><br>About thirty or forty minutes later, there's the smell of ozone again. You could smell it over the smell of the fire we had started. This really nasty, coppery smell like right after you've had a nosebleed and it's stopped. It wasn't exactly like dried blood, but it was that nasty metallic, back-of-your-throat smell.<br><br>We immediately think that it's some kind of electrical malfunction, or someone left a hotplate on or some shit. We search the trailers and nothing is on, and we can all smell it. All of a sudden, we can hear people booking down the path toward us, and Rooster, Tan and the girl all come running into the clearing, out of breath. And they don't even break stride; they all run into the trailer, right by where the fire is.<br><br>We all get the fuck outta there and into the trailers. They end up calming down; even Rooster is crying his fucking eyes out at this point. All the while, the fire is guttering lower and lower, so my other cousins say fuck it and are about to go outside to get the generator out of a shed between the trailers.<br><br>(cont)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It would be more scary if the dog didn't look like it had been glued to the original.</br>  <br><br>Tanner goes, "Fuck no! Lock the front door, ain't nobody else going outside!" He's been crying too, and his eyes are bloodshot and puffy and his pants are dirty as shit.<br><br>He goes on to tell us that they went up to his house. His father said sure, he could go out camping, but to make sure they were careful on the way back, and that maybe they should take one of the hunting rifles just in case.<br><br>Evidently, Tanner had seen something in their yard a few days before. One of their pigs had come up, ripped up and half eaten. They assumed it was just some big cats or coyotes, even though they don't usually fuck with live animals.<br><br>He had gone upstairs and packed his stuff, and told his dad they would be OK without the rifle because coyotes avoid people. So they started walking back toward where we were camping.<br><br>So, Rooster finally stops crying and shaking; the girl already had, but she was just staring out the window with a dumb look on her face. He says they had gotten halfway into the woods toward the camp when they started to hear shit in the forest. It was almost pitch black by this time, so they weren't sure at first what the fuck it was. The girl says that she heard something in the bushes right off the trail and they all beamed their flashlights over there and there was someone standing back in the woods in a little hollow. Rooster said they shouted at him and told him that he was scaring the fuck out of them and what a dick he was.<br><br>He says that's when he realized that the guy was facing away from them. So they keep walking, and they start smelling the nasty coppery ozone smell. They say that they look off into the forest on the opposite side, and it's a dude standing in the forest, backward slightly closer to the path.<br><br>So now they start powerwalking and Tan keeps going, "I should have taken the fucking rifle."<br><br>As they're telling the story, the smell is still super strong even inside the cabin.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They say that after they started walking faster, a kind of low gibbering had started coming from both sides of the wood. And as they started booking it back to the trailer, the girl said she had flashed her flashlight out into the woods to the side of them and had seen something jerking itself through the woods. The gibbering just got louder and louder, and when they could see the light from our camp fire, something had come out of the woods about 40 yards behind them onto the track, and they had just flat out ran as hard as they could to the trailer.<br><br>So we're out in the fucking woods, and we're assuming at this point it's some rednecks or some shit trying to fuck with us.<br><br>All of a sudden, my other cousin, Junior, starts going on about how he went to school with a native kid that was telling him about the 'Goatman' or some shit. We promptly tell him to shut the fuck up because we don't need any spooky talk right now.<br><br>But he just keeps going on and on about how it's the fucking 'Goatman,' and how we're in his woods and blah blah blah. Now at the time, I had never heard of this goat man or any of that, but then a couple years ago -- the year before I graduated from college -- I had a Menom for a roommate and I ended up asking him about it. And to sum it up, it's basically a fucking man with the head of a goat and he can shape shift and he gets among groups of people to terrorize them. It's also supposed to be kind of like the Wendigo, and it's bad mojo to even talk about it and even worse if you see it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Keep in mind, I didn't know this back when I was sixteen. So my cousin is going, "The goat man's going to get in and fucking get us." The girls are all terrified and my cousins and I are all fucking trying to figure out if it's just some hillbillies or if it's some animal.<br><br>So all of a sudden the smell just goes away. Like to this day, I haven't even experienced anything like it. Like, usually smells fade away or lessen. It just literally was there one second and then not the second.<br><br>So it's after an hour, making it around 9 or 10. We've stopped shitting bricks enough to go back outside and stoke the fire again. We figure it was just some assholes trying to fuck with us, so we don't go back home, because we think if we do, they'll chase us through the woods or some crazy shit.<br><br>Nothing else weird happens that night. And we stay another night, and for the main part of the night nothing happens. At about 1 in the morning, we're outside getting drunk and telling ghost stories. As someone is finishing some 2spooky story -- I don't remember what about -- the smell comes back. It's so fucking strong, that one of the girls literally starts vomiting.<br><br>I stand up, and you can actually feel how clammy the air is. I say we should get inside and this isn't right; we should have just fucking left.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We all go back inside, and we're standing around. My cousin just keeps going on about how it's the goat man. And my cousin Rooster tries to shut him the fuck up, and all the while I'm just feeling that something is wrong, and I can't figure out what the fuck it is.<br><br>We end up sitting in there for a while; the smell is just as strong, and we're terrified and all huddled in this camper. We end up cooking brats for everybody because nobody wants to go outside. It's one of those packs with 4 brats. We have a total of 3 packs. I grill them up on the stove and give everybody a hot dog. I get mine. After a while, one of my cousins gets up and goes over to the pot to get another one.<br><br>He starts grumbling about about how I get two brats and everybody else only got one, and I look at him like he's fucking stupid. I tell him that everybody only got one because there were only 12 brats, if he wants more he should open up a new pack and cook some more.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it's just a screamer dude</br>  <br>That's when the girl that had been out with Rooster and Tan just starts screaming, "OH JESUS, OH LORD, GET IT OUT!" She's crying and shivering, and then it dawns on the cousin standing up what the fuck is wrong. Me and him both glance around the room, and then I feel my heart fucking sink. I run the fuck out of the cabin and the girl runs out with us. The trailer door is banging against the side of the trailer as everybody books out of the cabin.<br><br>One of my cousin's friends ask us what the fuck was wrong. I start counting us. There's only 11 now.<br><br>"I shit you not," my cousin verified. There had been twelve people in the cabin. But being that everybody didn't really know each other well, nobody had really noticed the whole fucking time that there was an extra person. And then I realized earlier that I had kind of noticed something was off. You know how when you're just dicking around having a good time that you don't sweat the smallest shit, and you don't always keep track of certain stuff? I'm dead sure that someone else had been in the trailer with us, and that they had been there for at least a fucking day, eating with us. What makes it worse is, I could figure out which one because I don't think anyone ever actually interacted with the other person/the Goat-man.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The girl kept praying to Jesus and we're all sitting outside; eventually we get big-ass sticks and go back in the cabin, but there's nobody in there. We count again, and there's 11 people. We go back into the trailer and lock the door. We explain what the fuck happened, and the girl says that she realized too, and that when he was about to say something, the person sitting next to her had grabbed her leg hard and leaned over toward her and said something she couldn't understand.<br><br>So we are pretty much scared as fuck as we huddle together, and I fall asleep. When I wake up, the sun is just coming up, and half the people are asleep and the other half are packing our shit up.<br><br>We all want to walk back home, but like 4 people want to stay until the sun is all the way up. And some people think that we're just fucking around and still want to stay at the trailers. I just want to get the fuck out of the woods.<br><br>The girl's name was Keira, the one that the Goat-man had touched. Anyway, I asked her if she really thinks it was something bad, and she says she just wants to go home and she doesn't want to be out in the woods alone for another night.<br><br>So we decide to split up; the 4 that want to go can go, but I have to stay because I have the keys to the cabin and it's my uncle's and I have to lock up. I'm super pissed at this point, because I feel like people aren't taking this shit seriously, and I definitely didn't want to be out in the woods for another night. I spend the rest of the day trying to convince the rest of the people -- now 4 girls and 4 guys -- to get the fuck out of dodge. Tanner leaves with them to go get a rifle and says he's going to be back. So there are just 7 of us left by 4 PM.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>At around 5 PM he hasn't made it back yet, and we're getting extremely fucking antsy, and the only reason I stopped begging them to go back was because he went to get a gun.<br><br>it's about 5:30 PM or so, when the one cousin that did stay says that the girl Keira is outside. We all look outside, and sure enough, she's standing by the firepit with her back to the cabin.<br><br>I'm thinking to myself, if she was so fucking scared, why the hell would she come back? And then I get this nasty feeling in my gut. Keep in mind, the whole time the coppery smell has been gone. Now I realize I can smell just a twinge of it.<br><br>I say this to the rest of them and everybody -- and these are the people that wanted to stay in the fucking woods after we had the goddamn Goatman in our midst -- is laughing at me and asking if I set this up to scare them.<br><br>I'm looking at them like, "I'm not fucking bullshitting you at all right now." I ask them why the fuck would I play like that? So one of the girls goes outside to get Kiera. She gets halfway to her and stops cold. Keira starts heaving; I don't know how the fuck to describe it. Sort of like if someone with their back turned was laughing without actually making any sound. It was this fact that made me realize there was not a fucking sound in the whole woods; it was dead silent.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>3SPOOPY5ME</br>  <br>this</br>  <br>This was like later in September, so it was still fairly hot at the time, but it was super chilly some days too. And you could usually hear big-ass geese honking or some kind of birds or squirrels chitchatting.<br><br>So I step out the door and tell her to come back in the fucking trailer right goddamn now.<br><br>She backs up into the trailer and we lock the fucking door. We pull down all the shades except one, and put a guy there in a chair to watch her. She stands there for another 20 minutes or so. The guy turns to say that she's still there. And there's a HUGE fucking bang on the door.<br><br>We all jump the fuck up and scramble around the living room of the trailer. The banging is super fucking loud.<br><br>So now my cousin is holding one of the girls and the other two are kinda giggling with nervous laughter and me and the other two guys are shitting brix.<br><br>Then we hear Tan. He's screaming.<br><br>LET ME THE FUCK IN STOP FUCKING PLAYING!<br><br>So we go over to the door and open it, and he stumbles in with a rifle. There's nobody else outside.<br><br>Evidently, he had walked up to the campsite. Nothing weird happened in the forest, but he had seen a girl. Mind you, he said it was not Keira standing there. When he had gotten to the edge of the clearing, she had turned toward him with the slackjawed look and just stared him down, slowly tracking him as he walked around the outside of the clearing towards the camp. He said it wasn't till he was almost halfway to the trailer he had realized that she was getting closer to him. She had started off by the fire, and without him even seeing her move she had been turning, inching closer. He said he just ran the rest of the way back to the cabin thinking it would open. And when he got to the door and it was locked, he turned and it was about half the distance to the door.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He looks around the room and then gets super pale. He pulls me to the side and whispers in my ear, "You know there are only seven of us in here, right?" I get that feeling where you stomach drops to your nuts. It had been back inside the trailer while we were sorting out who was going where, and then when we all went outside to talk earlier in the day. It has just slipped right back in.<br><br>We looked out the window and there is nobody out there. So we recount everyone and then basically, I go over and ask everyone how many people were here earlier. And everybody says 8. I say, "Well, how many are here now?" They all do the count and then realize there are only now 7 people in the cabin.<br><br>So Tan had brought back a couple boxes of ammo and his rifle. And he had told his dad that there was some kind of animal in the forest because he didn't think his dad would believe him if he said it was Goatman. He says that his cousin is supposed to be coming down in a few hours and that in the morning we can all go back to his place and his cousin will drive us home.<br><br>Now I'm really fucking terrified, but I at least feel better because we can be American and shoot the fuck out of whatever it is if it comes back. But then my cousin gets into this huge argument with one of the girls because she thinks that I'm trying to be funny and prank them, and that she's getting really scared and that I'm not funny. He keeps telling her I'm not that kind of person, and she says, "Well, how do we know the girl wasn't just Tanner in a wig? Or if it's really the Goatman, how do we know that this is the real Tanner and that Goatman just didn't kill Tanner in the woods and take his gun?"<br><br>So we fucking get into a huge argument about this, where me and Tan are like, "we could seriously be in danger because at the very least someone has been sneaking themselves into our fucking trailer without us knowing and mingling with us, and at worst, something bad is in the forest fucking with us."</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>i had just forgotten about this, fuck you</br></br>  <br>One of the girls is crying and saying she wants to go right now, and we're trying to tell her we shouldn't because none of us are walking through the woods in the middle of the night. At this point the sun is starting to go down and it's getting a little cloudy out.<br><br>We eat something and turn on the radio for a while, but we can't really get a station out there with anything decent. So we turn it off at about the time that Tan's cousin shows up. He was like 19, I think. At this point, the sun is just barely over the horizon and he has one of those heavy duty lantern flashlights and another rifle. He walks up to the trailer and we whisper to Tan asking if he's sure that's his cousin and he says yes.<br><br>The guy looks behind him and all around the camp, then walks in. He kind of glances at all of us and looks a little confused.<br><br>He says, "Where's your other little buddy at? I figured she would meet me up at the cabin. Is she a little slow or something?" He also asked whether we had been cooking blood in the cabin, because it smelled like blood and hot pans all the way up the trail. We are all like fucking "NOPE." But we ask him what the fuck he's talking about with the girl he saw.<br><br>He had come down the same trail Tan had been using and he had come up on "one of youse guy's buddies" standing in the middle of the trail, looking at him slack jawed. He had asked her a bunch of questions, but all she did was just look at him. Then, she smiled at him and he said he kept walking. She couldn't seem to keep up with him and kept lagging a little behind him. He said he asked her if she was hurt or something, and if she needed any help. But, she had continued to stare. Eventually, he had been walking and turned around a bend in the trail. But when he turned around and went back to see if she was okay, the trail was empty. He'd assumed she had taken some short cut through the woods to our trailer.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We tell him the whole story of what's been going on. I half expected him to say we were full of shit, but he just listened and then sat down on the couches in the living room.<br><br>Tanner's cousin gets back to the girl. He says, when she had kept trying to lag behind him, it had kinda weirded him the fuck out, so he tried to keep her in front of him, but no matter how slow he walked, she was always lagging a little behind. And that he smelled this nasty smell, and it got stronger as he got to the camp. Eventually it got really strong. She had said something really low that he didn't catch, and when he had turned around she had been right the fuck up on him, and he stepped back from her.<br><br>It was at this point he asked her if she was okay, and if she wasn't, him to carry her back the rest of the way, and she just kept staring. He said he reached out for her, as in to grab her on the shoulder, but he must have "misjudged the distance" because she was off to the side of where he had put his hand, like she had moved while he was looking dead at her.<br><br>So at this point, we know this shit's real, unless Tan is playing a joke, which we can tell he's not because he's almost pissing his pants.<br><br>So they load up their rifles, we eat some more, and we just kind of sit around until about 11. To this fucking day, every time I think about this, I really pray to God that it's some huge prank that my cousins played on me and just never revealed so I would shit for the rest of my life.<br><br>At 'round 11, the stink of copper turns into an actual nasty gross blood-like smell, like cooking blood and singed hair. Tan and his cousin, Reese, get the fuck up instantly and grab the rifles.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's like a half-knocking, half-clawing at the door, and I shit you not, there's this voice, and it sounds like when you see those YouTube cats and dogs whose owners teach them how to "talk." It says in this halting, weirdly toned voice, "Let me the fuck in, stop fucking playing."<br><br>It made my fucking nuts creep up against my body, and one of the girls just starts crying and calling on Jesus.<br><br>It was so fucking obviously not a person talking. It didn't have the right cadence, and that's some shit that I never realized until that moment, but all people have a certain cadence when they talk, no matter what language. All people have a certain kind of rhythm to talking.<br><br>This shit didn't have any kind of cadence or rhythm. One of those YouTube cats, that's what the fuck it sounded like outside the door. So now I'm in full on terror mode. We keep yelling outside "Who is it? Stop fucking around man!" and it just keeps saying, "in" or "Let me the fuck in" for almost 15 minutes.<br><br>http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=qff9<wbr>V27Weaw</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>It sounded like this almost, just not funny. Sorry for being on a tangent, but if you can't imagine how this shit sounded, then you can't imagine how fucked up the whole situation was.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So then the smell goes away for a while. And for the next hour or so, you can hear someone basically creeping around in the woods and shit. Every couple minutes it'll come back into the door, and say something.<br><br>Finally when the smell fades away, it's around 2 in the morning right now. Reese says, "Man, fuck this!" and opens the door and walks outside with his rifle.<br><br>He fires a shot into the air, and says something to the affect of, "In the name of Jesus Christ, go away!" He fires two more times, and then from the woods right up against the river across from the trailer, it sounds like something is slowly jibbering and hooting.<br><br>Then it starts screaming and it sounds almost like a woman and a cat in a bag screaming together. Like I seriously have never heard any shit like that, and you can hear the brush over that way start to shake, Reese fires over into the treeline and then starts backing into the house.<br><br>We lock the door, and we can hear this shit keening and screaming. Reese says something had come out of the bushes, super low to the ground and crawling toward the cabin. He had shot at it.<br><br>Pretty much, that was how the rest of the night went; it was literally screaming constantly for the next 2 hours, and we could hear shit moving out into the treeline. But it never came back up to the cabin until everyone had finally fallen asleep.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tan had been sitting in the chair watching the door with his rifle; nobody else heard or saw this, and he told me two days later, after the whole thing was over.<br><br>He said he had been nodding off after the screaming and noises finally stopped, and he had been almost asleep when he saw someone come out of the bathroom and then lay down in the middle of the floor and go to sleep. He just assumed it was one of us and he had nodded off.<br><br>Then he said he kind of realized something was wrong, and while pretending to be sleeping, he counted us. There were 9 people in the cabin. He basically didn't want to try to shoot at the fucking thing in the cabin and have it kill us all then and there, or have Reese wake up and start shooting and then we kill ourselves. So he just stayed awake all night, pretending to be asleep.<br><br>He said sometimes, it would stand up and kind of do this weird jittery thing, or heave like it was laughing. But then it would lay back down.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The story closes pretty weak, because from my perspective nothing happened. We woke up. And I noticed that Tan was a little jittery, and that he was avoiding looking at all of us. But we ate some breakfast, packed up and started walking to his house. He stayed last in the cabin and said he'd lock up and bring me my uncle's keys; to just start walking and he'd catch up. Which I didn't really want to fucking do.<br><br>We got a little bit up the path, and when he came running up, basically we just jogged back to his house. His cousin took us home.<br><br>There was a window in the bathroom. Tan had gone back to lock up and looked in there. We were too stupid to lock a screenless window. The window was fucking up when he went in there.<br><br>I'm guessing it had been doing that all along, waiting for us to fall asleep or slip up and then getting in among us. It walked with us all the Goddamn way back to his house, and then he said it lagged to the back of the group and looked him dead in the eyes before walking into the woods.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>fuck me that was hilarious</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>QUite long, but hands down the best creepypasta I ever read.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's this site called /x/ on the deep web I think. <br>They all believe in muh-jick and neo-paganism.

A friend of mine introduced me to his own makeshift Ouija board. Basically, it was just a piece of paper with the words "yes" and "no" on opposite sides. The planchette was replaced with a string tied to a small weighted object at the end. We would then hold the string between the two words written on the paper and ask questions directed to the ghost. The weighted object at the end of the string would slowly start swaying towards the corresponding word to the questions asked by us. I don't remember what any of the questions or answers were, but the discussion ended with me believing that I had a new cool ghost friend to talk to! I created my own makeshift Ouija paper and had another chat with this "friend" before going to bed. Nothing unusual happened yet.<br><br>The next day, my friend called me on the phone, insisting that I get rid of the makeshift Ouija paper ASAP! He reported that his mom warned him not to mess around with these types of games, because chances are, it will be a demon toying with you. He insisted that I break off the relationship with my ghost friend immediately and said that he had already done the same by cursing out the Ouija paper.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>After hanging up the phone, I immediately went to my room, looking for the makeshift Ouija paper. I grabbed the paper, but then decided that the best way to repel an evil spirit was to write "I love Jesus" all over the paper. Halfway through writing Jesus' name, something in my trailer got REALLY, REALLY upset at me. I suddenly heard a very aggressive growling and even felt the whole trailer vibrating, as if something big and heavy was storming through the trailer. Unfortunately, my back was turned from the door, but the vibration felt like it was something coming from the hallway, heading towards my back. Neither were the growling sounds emitting from the ground, as one would expect from an animal. Whatever it was that entered my room, it had to be the same height as me, because the growling noise was coming up right behind my head!<br><br>For some strange reason though, I then decided to MAN the fuck up like a SOLDIER and turn around to face this angry entity that was clearly coming for me. My body tensed up, and I was ready to engage in the BIGGEST fight of my life. As soon as I turned around, however, the noise and the vibration stopped. Everything went quiet. But my body was still tense because I was SURE that a hostile entity had entered my room. Suddenly, I saw my dad struggling to carry an electric heater as he passed by my door, making grumbling noises as he stomped down the hallway.</br></br></br></br>  <br>shortest horror story ever amirite</br>  <br>Just finished it. Great read.</br>  <br><br>But I didn't let my guard down. I didn't believe what I saw, because I was absolutely CERTAIN that something entered my room! I remained in fight mode. Even though I never actually saw anything in the room with me, I felt the vibration and heard the growling coming up right behind me. I was as certain of this angry entity as a bat would be certain of “echo-location”. "Yeah Right!" I said out loud in my empty room. I then stepped out into the hallway and looked down the direction where I saw my dad headed. The lights to my parent's bedroom were on. I then called out to my dad, who then replied, "What?" except he replied from the living room, the other direction of the hallway.<br><br>I then asked, "Dad, didn't you just walk into the bed room?"<br><br>"No," he replied.<br><br>I then said, "But I just saw you walk by!"<br><br>"No, he's been in here with me the whole time," my mom said.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I then walked down the hallway to my parents' bedroom. It was empty. I then told my parents that the light in their bedroom was on.<br><br>My dad then said, "Oh, it is? I must have forgotten to turn it off then." I then went back into my room and completed the sentence I didn't get to finish writing. I wrote it again and again, all over the Ouija paper, folded the paper up, and stuck it into a Bible. I left it in the Bible for at least a week before I tore it up and threw it away. This thing that tried to terrorize me, never bothered me again.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>CONCLUSION:<br>I was like 12 or 14 at the time. I don't do drugs nor drink alcohol. I was not afraid of the dark. I never had any imaginary friends or problems sleeping alone at night. My parents are not the type that play pranks on me either. Even if this was a prank, this prank would be way too elaborate for my parents to pull off!<br><br>This memory is the ONLY reason why I'm not an atheist. There is obviously a lot of evil in this world - physical and apparently non-physical as well - but whatever it was that in my home, it SERIOUSLY got pissed at me for just writing a name down: Jesus. If God doesn't exist, then writing Jesus' name on the Ouija paper should not have any effect on it! There would be no reason whatsoever for this evil entity to get upset at me if I was writing a name of a fictitious character.<br><br>Now, don't get me wrong. I am not a Bible geek. I do not believe in every word of the Bible. I do believe in evolution. I trust the scientific method way more than blind faith. I am also very disgusted with what I've seen religious people do and the claims they make about "what God would want or despise", but until I can get a logical scientific explanation of this event, I can NOT become an atheist.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Why not just post the picture?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it is implied in that pasta though that he might simply be going insane though, with no way to know which is or isn't the case.

Odds of something like that happening to someone somewhere are pretty high, just to you specifically its pretty low. Crazy shit happens sometimes when weird things line up.</br>  <br>I'm an aerospace engineer and I reject the whole telekinesis thing as a possibility. I just can't explain it any other way. Even vibrations don't make sense. There is no way a localized oscillation could have gotten a response like that without me feeling it in my arms; even through the floor....<br><br>I am religious though i don't see any significance there either.</br></br></br>  <br>Really? Shit just gets twisted up randomly?</br>  <br>There's gotta be an explanation.</br>  <br>what he said doesn't really mean anything beyond that I missed a lot of critical physical information. That i wasn't paying attention. While this could be true and there are ranged and kinetic forces in the universe that humans cannot sense unaided those would reveal themselves in other ways. Simple physics really isn't simple physics; the weird shit that happens has some equally weird explanations and human observation shouldn't be discounted as much as it is.</br>  Some guy saw some weird creature fucking around in his house and the more he sees them the more aggressive they get, all the while he's talking to some dude through email about them <br>They're really smart they know how to make your death look like suicide<br>The two guys called them Gristers<br>Please tell me someone has the screen cap</br></br></br>  Bump  ayy lmao    <br>My cousin literally died because of the Grifter</br>  <br>This is the 3. time I have seen this.

I remember once I was home alone after everybody had left to go out or to the park, both parents were out of the house/working. I walk into my sisters room because I needed bandaids after I had accidentally gotten a cut. After putting the bandaid back on I stood there and felt the slightest draft of air on my neck beneath my left ear and hair almost like something was fairly close to my neck and had breathed on it. There is one window that can be opened on the opposite wall to my side but it was closed and I stood there just wondering with a sort of "huh" reaction. I didn't make much of it but I remember it clearly, this was maybe 7 years ago.</br>  <br><br> implying the "real grifter" is actually real </br></br>  <br>This one is actually pretty good.</br>  <br>Just read that one, can someone explain the ending?
