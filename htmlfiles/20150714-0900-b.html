Dont hate  <br>try to build it, not find it.</br>  being rich  <br>Crush your enemies, see them driven before you, hear the lamentation of the women</br>  <br>Generation kill, good shot.</br>  <br>See </br>  <br>show*</br>  <br>this</br>  <br>And this is pretty much all you need to know.</br>  to seek negative and not hide from the truth<br><br>that could for instance be to grab some meth, go to a haunted house with a black mirror and a candle and sit down in the darkest room and stare at yourself in the dark mirror, dim lit room by candle on meth..<br><br>im sure it will change you no matter what you see</br></br></br></br>  <br>God that series was fantastic.</br>    <br><br>being born an attractive woman</br></br>  Jesus  <br>Dubs confirm</br>  Vitamin D and 5-HTP  a large cock and a fat wallet  Real answer is:<br><br>Love.</br></br>  <br><br>Sucking dick.<br><br>You'll never run out.</br></br></br></br>  <br>bonus if you do this on a bunch of acid<br><br>don forget your gun for protection<br><br>dubs are truth</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the sweet release of death</br>  <br>remain ignorant of what's real in this world</br>    <br>pair of 2 confirm<br><br>OP must do this</br></br></br>  <br>the secret to happiness is finding the sauce for this</br>  <br>2edgy4me<br><br><br><br>Redheads</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> secret to happiness <br>Step 1: get enough resources to live a stable life. It's hard to be happy when you don't know if you can eat today. But don't pursue riches beyond what you need; it'll just make your life more complicated<br>Step 2: Get healthy. If you are not eating right and exercising, chances are your biochemistry is not set up for optimal happiness. And we are social beings; if you know everyone thinks you're a fat fuck, it's likely to affect you even if you ignore it consciously.<br>Step 3: Surround yourself with people you enjoy and respect. Again, we are social creatures, and our greatest happiness often comes from our interactions with other people. Good friends can make a huge difference.<br>Step 4: Master yourself. You will never be free to make your own choices if you are chained by addiction, distraction, or ignorance. Marketers and dealers will make your choices for you. You will be what the TV tells you to be. Free yourself. Put aside all the meaningless junk you use to distract you from your own mind and the real world. Build your will power, so that you may do with your life what you wish.<br>Step 5: Do something meaningful. Everyday. I can't explain this one for you. You will know what is meaningful to you; I do not. Work on it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Is my clit big?

It is the holy month of Ramadan.<br><br>Jazak'allah.</br></br>  <br>Because First Amendment, bitch.</br>  <br>Respect freedom of religion</br>  <br>No bikinis?<br>Well if you insist</br></br>  <br>this</br>    <br>Go suck start a shotgun!</br>  <br>When I was in an Islamic country I did not eat during daylight hours (during Ramadan), but that was just to be polite.</br>  <br>We are not asking you to convert. You are free to remain Christian, just show some respect during our Holy Month.</br>  I'm okay with topless too. Ramadan must be an awesome religion.  <br>i know you are bait, <br>but still, suck a dick</br></br>  <br><br>Non-Muslim brothers, it is important for us to respect each other as men so women will be dressed modestly please.<br><br>Also, since we are in the holy month of Ramadam, we fast during the day, and then give each other special qur'an hand jobs after sunset. Allah 'eu akbar.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Move to Saudi Arabia if you want people to remove their own free will and liberties for the sake of 'respecting' your religion.<br><br>2/10 made me reply.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck you raghead. Im sick of people saying it's the extremists ruining islam. Muhammad married a 6 year old girl, your religion is backwards and, according to Nietzche, the biggest retardation of the human race. Fuck your holiday, stupid towel wearing bitch.</br>  <br>Jazak'allah brother. That is very respectful. But you may have eaten in private during the day, just not in public.<br><br>May Allah grant you Janath'ul firdaus.</br></br></br>  <br>we are not disrespecting you by following our own beliefs...</br>  <br>I am perfectly happy in my home country, thank you brother.</br>  <br>you are trying really hard acting like a muslim, dont you?</br>  <br>because it feel so good do things that others persons makes really mad.</br>    <br>My answer to is is FUCK YOU! I don't care!</br>  <br>In my religion you are supposed 3 times during day light to praise the sun. Please respect that and stop ramadan asap. If you dont follow this we will declear holy war and force feed muslims around the world.<br>No offense though, I just want some respect. Dont forget my religion means love and peace and happiness for everyone :))) &lt;333</br></br>  <br>What's a Nietzche?</br>  <br><br>You are disrespecting me by forcing this shit upon me. <br>Fast in hell morons.</br></br></br>  <br>I have no respect for terrorists</br>  <br>Yes, you are. It is our Holy Month. We put up with your beliefs the rest of the year, but you cannot show respect for one month?</br>  <br> love and peace and happiness <br>you mean jolly cooperation right?</br></br>  <br>No bikinis!</br>  Where is the pic of a Muslim girl in a confederate flag bikini holding a Koran wrapped in bacon?  <br>Fuck off. You guys have enough countries that are already ruined and backwards.</br>  <br>I respect ramadan the same way I respect the christians not wanting to let gays get married. You think what you want, I don't judge, but it ain't gonna affect my life. other people don't need to follow your pointless laws.</br>  <br>I don't need to act, brother. I'm of the believers. Why would I pretend? I come only to enlighten you all.</br>  <br>well, im sure your muslim women dont wear bikinis during ramadan (or ever..? i cant tell whats going on under dem burkas)<br>and that is just abut the extent of your jurisdiction with that subject though</br></br>  bikinis: still easier to check for bombs than burqas  <br>First Amendment is free speech, no?</br>  <br>Muslim Brothers, why don't you respect other humans? Bombs, Singing 5 times a day and destroying world heritage is haraam. Please tell your folks to fuck off. It is 2015,</br>  i'm a muslim and i don't even bother about people wearing bikinis or not during ramadhan. and i do not want to force my religion to others. and no it is not bait. thank you and have a nice day.    <br> did not eat during daylight hours (during ramadan), but that was just to be polite <br>you mean <br> out of fear of being publicly bludgeoned to death <br><br>i mean, i dont go around eating food in peoples faces regardless of religion or time of year, but nigga, i know you aint be tellin me what to do<br> caint nobady tell me shiit </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yep, and religion, press, right to protest, etc.</br>  <br>The only countries of ours that are ruined are those ruined by your bombs, brother. <br><br><br>Are you happy that the constitutional court is forcing non-Christian beliefs on Christians by forcing them to accept gay marriage?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Dont you dare tell me how to dress shitlord.<br><br>At tumblr we dont stand for misogyny.<br>If you saw me in real life you wouldnt dare tell me to put on a bikini.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Waste of good bacon.</br>  <br>Islam respects all humans. But it also allows us to fight back against hostile humans. <br>Destroying world heritage is indeed Haraam. Only ISIS do that, and they are the most haraam.<br><br>We pray and think of Allah 5 times a day. That is not haraam. <br>Why are you so vulgar, brother? Perhaps you need the peace of Islam to sooth your angry soul.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> respect for one month <br>are you kidding? the entire world walks on glass around your ass backwords sheep fucking "dont draw muhammad plz" religion so random overzealous "martyrs" dont go around blowing themselves up over stupid shit<br><br>see, i have a religion, its called fuckoffism<br>and youre offending me and my believers by not fucking back off to pac-manistan so you can stone your women and bone your goats in peace</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because Fuck You.</br>  <br>Brother, visit Israel and try to eat pork. Why do you follow the Jews and not the Muslims? Why will you obey them and not us? Is it because they own all of the West and you are all effectively their slaves for money?</br>  Our women are allowed to dress themselves...    <br>im fapping</br>  <br>This I literally every Muslim I've ever met. Most just don't care.</br>  <br> peace of islam <br>yes brother, all is very peaceful after you detonate in an embassy or other domicile of haaram<br>you could say it leaves you<br> in pieces <br><br>WOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAHHHH</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>because your penis is bent</br>  <br> the entire world walks on glass around your ass backwords sheep fucking "dont draw muhammad plz" religion <br>Actually brother, the opposite is true. When we ask that you don't insult our beloved prophet, you intentionally decide to have bigger and bolder draw Muhammad contests and publish these horrible images all over. Your intention is to hate, not ours. Do not deceive, for Allah is watching.<br><br>If anything, it is us who has to walk on glass around you westerners, giving you special treatment when you come to live/work/vacation in our lands. The westerner gets very cranky when he doesn't get his booze, gambling and sleaze.<br><br>I am in my home country, brother, so you do not have to get so hostile.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> it because they own all of the West and you are all effectively their slaves for money? <br>while i do agree the west is run by the jews agenda<br>you are making a crucial assumption that i favor jews over muslims<br><br>when in fact <br>i hold equal distaste for both sides of that brown intolerant coin</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Look I like classy bitches but you don't define haram for me. Nor would I care to push my culture on you even though everyone needs bacon once. Besides, men aren't allowed to control women in my culture anymore.</br>    <br>Muslim brothers, why don't you respect other people ? Bombing and hating is not cool. Please tell your brother.sisters/friends to live modestly and bombing is striclty forbidden. It is the normal thing to do, no need to have a date for this.<br><br>Fuck you.</br></br></br>      <br>Why does horse bite the donger</br>    <br>I know this is a troll, but fuck those sand niggers, anyway<br>pic unrelated</br></br>  <br>to bend penis</br>    <br>Eye C</br>  <br> Your intention is to hate, not ours. <br>our intention has t he same dynamic as a socially awkward kid getting bullied for being weird<br>itll teach him not to be such a fucking weirdo<br><br>  giving you special treatment when you come to live/work/vacation in our lands. <br>oh yeah. thats right, i forgot about how our gracious eastern hosts dont assault, rape and persecute all the scores and scores of people who would just LOVE to sweat their asses off surrounded by angry sheep herders.<br> <br><br> The westerner gets very cranky when he doesn't get his booze, gambling and sleaze. <br>everybody likes this stuff. its super easy to do in excess<br>thats why its bad<br>but you cant blame someone for liking it.<br>its called the tourist trade<br>just because you dont like something doesnt mean everyone else has to agree<br><br> STOP LIKING WHAT I DONT LIKE </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you want us to respect your ways in your lands, you have to respect ours in our lands. I know the westerner is often like a spoiled child who throws a tantrum when they don't get their way, but you can't have it both ways. It is time the westerner learned to accept this. The world is not yours to rule.</br>    <br>Sorry Sand Nigger<br><br>Muslim rules only apply to muslims since your religion is all made up anyway</br></br></br>  <br>Bowl of mashed potatos with lipstick</br>  <br>ur welx m8 :)</br>  <br>Take your tulpa and tulpa accessories elsewhere pl0x<br>We're not interested.</br></br>  <br>because you don't respect our right to not have our heads cut off for disagreeing with you</br>      <br>  appulass <br>Topunf.jpg</br></br>  A salami lickem      <br>Islam respects all people. But it also allows us to fight back against hostile people too. <br><br>Those of us who are bombing feel they are doing the latter. Violence is forbidden in Islam, except when in defense of Islam and the Muslim people. I could, in the same manner, ask Americans to stop war-mongering, but that would not make sense.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Not very good bait, but you obviously know that summer is the best time to fish.</br></br></br>    Hello my brother,<br><br>sadly your religion's traditions interfere with mine's.<br><br>I believe in the mighty Dickbutt, and it is tradition, that in the month of July, we use the daylight by staring into the sun while eating crisps.<br><br>I would like you to stop starving yourself, this offends the almighty Dickbutt. The Islam is already religion with a huge following, and it would be nice of you to support us.<br><br>Sincerely</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  islam respects all people <br>  crusades <br>  literally hundreds of extremist groups worship the sandgod. </br></br></br>  <br>fag</br>    <br>Love you too</br>  <br> Your intention is to hate, not ours. <br>Our intention is to teach you to fucking deal with it.<br><br>So instead of blowing up people because they hurt your feelings you should just consider these people fools and continue your merry way.<br><br>In a way you're like SJW, getting all butthurt over trivial things that you can simply ignore.<br><br> Do not deceive, for Allah is watching. <br>Then let him deal with this crap instead of acting like some morally self righteous cunt who decides to be the judge when he has no right to be, and frankly insults his god by taking his place.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I want to cum inside rainbow dash  Lol, I hadn't heard the word haraam in a while. Strikes me as funny right now, for some reason. I think for a little while (maybe just tonight at the bar), I'm going to have a catch phrase where I say something is haram. See if anyone finds it funny. E.g., "Would you like a beer?" "Beer is haraam." But then I'll still order a beer.  <br> oh yeah. thats right, i forgot about how our gracious eastern hosts dont assault, rape and persecute all the scores and scores of people who would just LOVE to sweat their asses off surrounded by angry sheep herders. <br>If you're trying to be sarcastic, you're only making yourself look stupid. If we weren't so accomodating in Dubai, Oman, Qatar, Malaysia, Indonesia etc you wouldn't even be able to drink or wear a bikini at all. We made special permissions just for foreign workers.<br><br><br>But Christian/western rules apply to everybody? Why, brother, do westerners have such a superiority complex?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>RAINBOW DASH IS MY MUM YOU PRICK! &gt;:(</br>  <br>Nope, just freedom rules. <br>  murica is best nation. </br></br>  <br>Why, brother, do westerners have such a superiority complex?&lt;<br><br>Because your penis is bent</br></br></br>  <br>since when did the dude living in a cave playign with sheep and not allowed to drink booze become the "mature" one</br>  How about fuck you. The rules of your backwards, bronze age superstition don't apply to me.    <br>Freedom of religion and freedom from religion are the same thing you ignorant dune coon</br>  <br>&lt;3</br>  <br>  crusades <br>Brother, the Crusades was an act of Christian/Western aggression. They couldn't stand not owning/ruling everything, so they had resorted to what they know best - war-mongering. Not much has changed and the west still practice this mentality today.<br><br>  literally hundreds of extremist groups worship the sandgod. <br>all these extremist groups believe they are defending Islam and the Muslim people from western aggression and those who support western ideology.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Oops, meant to say pinkie pie.<br>I already came inside rainbow dash :^)</br></br>  <br> your lands <br> our lands <br>see thats the beauty of murrica<br>its everyones land.<br>if you wanna be a gay nigger faggot, youre allowed to!<br>if you wanna be a muslim, you totally can!<br>if you wanna eat garbage and balloon up to 600 pounds and die of a heart attack at 45, you can do so<br>and i think thats beautiful<br><br>you can do whatevr you want, as long as it doesnt affect anyone else<br>which is why people are getting all tight about you asking non muslims to change their behavior because of your beliefs<br><br>the christians got theirs when gay marriage was legalized<br>they may not like it<br>but its out of their hands</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>I don't have an issue with people of other religions practicing their own societal beliefs, but when you try to impose such beliefs on to the society of a completely different place, such as a country you immigrated to, that is when I have a problem.</br>  <br>Stop wearing burqas in our countries then you fucking scum</br>  <br>The same nation were we couldn't build a mosque near 9/11 ground zero? The same nation that only last week made gay marriage legal? The same nation who has to encrypt their own e-mails so his government won't read them?<br><br>So much freedom you have there.</br></br></br>  <br>That's the brice of ebin freedoms :DDD</br>  <br> But western rules apply to everybody? <br>They are technically not western.<br>They are expansions of the golden rule "treat others the way you want to be treated", which originates independently from different cultures all around the globe.<br><br>All the UN did was write it down in a more juridical prose.</br></br></br></br></br>    fucking muslims and their backwards religion, need to die off the lot of them  Nah, I am gonna eat some pork in my bikini and drink some ice cold beer.<br>Then I fap to the most haram porn you can find and cuddle with my dog.</br>  <br>You want women to be more covered?<br>So islam is a religion of faggots?</br></br>  "You do you imma do me ya dig"-nigger  <br>Well duh, everyone wants to do that. r u my daddy?</br>  <br>  crusades were a christian act of aggression <br>Haha no, argumentum ad populum states otherwise.<br>In other words:<br>[Citation needed]</br></br></br></br>  <br> The same nation were we couldn't build a mosque near 9/11 ground zero <br>Publically disapproved, majority didn't want one, majority gets to decide<br> The same nation that only last week made gay marriage legal <br>Is clearly freedom.<br> The same nation who has to encrypt their own e-mails so his government won't read them <br>What does that have to do with freedom? You have the freedom to encrypt emails, and the government has the freedom to try and crack it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because you Semitic dogs cannot just move into a country and tell Us how to fucking behave. Get fucked shit-lord. And since I KNOW this is just a troll post from OP. Fuck you too you Sperm Burbling Cum Dumpster!</br>  <br>Do ya want me to be? ;^)<br>Wait a minute... is this Chikun??</br></br>  I need some muslim gay porn.  <br>  has the freedom to try and crack it <br>Using your tax dollars</br></br>  <br><br>This is what a Muslim slut was doing when Ramadan started with me, you fuckers are just like any other religion.<br>You do everything you claim not to do behind closed doors.</br></br></br>  because allah blessed me with dubs  <br> which is why people are getting all tight about you asking non muslims to change their behavior because of your beliefs$ <br>You westerners are always asking us to remove the burqa in the West? Isn't that changing our behavior because of your beliefs?</br></br>  <br>I have the freedom not to pay taxes.<br>In return the government has the freedom to confiscate my possessions.</br></br>  <br>We will, when you stop wearing bikinis in ours.</br>  <br>  made gay marriage legal <br>If youd listened, youd know that the supreme court announcement was specifically worded to prevent making laws banning it.<br>It did nothing about the ones in place.</br></br></br>  <br>it's the measure of how summer you are. the scale goes from zero to one.</br>  <br>Because we're in our country?<br>If you want to force your religion onto others, you're free to do so in your own country.</br></br>  <br>Why do you ask us to remove our burqas in the West, yet have a problem when we ask you to put on some clothes in Morocco? That's treating us the way YOU want to treat us.</br>  <br>Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh<wbr>hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh<br><br>Snap.</br></br></wbr></br>   how would you feel if a group of American terrorists blew up Dubai's business bay, and then the US wanted to put an embassy next door? It would seem a little insensitive wouldn't it...    <br>the least thing you could do is show respect for my shamanistic religion the nuder I am the closer I am to my true nature</br>  <br>H4wt</br>  <br>why should I respect islam when the muslims never respected the Yazidi</br>  <br> Israel <br>I was once in the center of tel aviv and ate a burger with a quarter Bacon on it. Israelis love bacon wtf are you talking about.</br></br>  <br>OP pic is in Morocco fucktard. No go tell your ugly pig-women to put on some clothes when they come here.<br>Typical westerner, always assuming that anywhere he sees something it's in "his land". You do not own the world, brother.</br></br>  <br>Well said</br>  <br>Because a burqa doesn't allow easy identification.<br>The same reason why I'm not allowed to enter stores wearing a biker helmet, or any other face obscuring clothing.<br>That and communications is easier whan you can actually see someone's face.<br><br> yet have a problem when we ask you to put on some clothes in Morocco <br>That's a religiously motivated demand, which is wrong to enforce on people who don't follow your religion. Or would you not mind if someone forces you to follow rituals of a religion different than yours?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This</br>    <br>you guys realize ramadan is to feel the pain of those who did not have food for 30 days right? what does that have to do with not having sex and looking at woman? i swear you guys are retarded.</br>  stop being such a pussy, you damn sandnigger  <br>because i dont have to do any of your shit. as long as you leave me alone im ok, but get your muslim out of my life niggers</br>  <br>aloha snackbar, did i read something about handjobs? iis all bout dem handys</br>  <br> You westerners are always asking us to remove the burqa in the West? <br> why do you ask us to remove our bikini's in the east? <br>the exact same reason</br></br></br>  <br>It all so says not to have sex or touch opposite sex.</br>  <br>I really, really, really like this image</br>    <br>How about no. People don't want to adhere to your oppressive backwards ass religion.</br>    <br>im going to a public sauna this weekend, tits everywhere, you mad mudslime?</br>  Respect the world first you muzzy cunt...

We value that more than wanting to know who someone is.</br></br></br></br>    <br>  Brother, the Crusades was an act of Christian/Western aggression. They couldn't stand not owning/ruling everything, so they had resorted to what they know best - war-mongering. Not much has changed and the west still practice this mentality today. <br>Thanks for the lul'z</br></br>  <br>Because I don't care about your or anyone else's religion. If you don't wanna see bikinis then don't go where they are you cunt.<br>you're like a alcoholic trying to stay sober at a bar: an idiot</br></br>  <br>What? You banned the burqa in France and want to ban it elsewhere, yet we are told to shut up and accept it.<br><br>When we merely ask to respect our Holy month in Morocco and not wear a bikini, you still tell us to shut up and accept it.<br>Why are westerners such spoiled babies? Always throwing tantrums unless the whole world contorts for them</br></br></br></br>  Fuck Mohammed he sucks goat cock  <br>Why would a mudslime be on /b/ that sounds pretty fucking haram</br>  <br>Simply finding fact humorous does not make it untrue, my dear brother.</br>  <br>  Why won't you comply to my requests? <br>  you're all so selfish! <br><br>Christ you're a retard.</br></br></br></br>    <br>did the muslims simply acepted the ban of the burqa? no they didn't they still don't.<br>the only one throwing tantrums are SOME muslims about both us wearing bikini's and wanting to wear burqa</br></br>  muhumaad is a faggot  <br> Others must follow our rules in our countries <br> Others cannot tell us what to do in their countries <br> western logic </br></br></br>  <br>show me a passage of the quran that shows wearing a bikini is haram and that a woman should always wear a burqa</br>  <br>No no. That's the problem here. you respecting our ways means not pricing your bullshit on us. Pure and simple. Your version of "respecting your ways" means that we have to follow your ways or no way. See the difference you filthy mudeating camel jockey.</br>  <br>No, when people go somewhere they're supposed to learn some of the local customs, that way you don't insult local people and in return they're more willing to help.<br><br>it's why muslims are expected to at least expose their face when going out in the west, and why western people who don't dress a bit more modest when going to more 'prudish countries' are considered uncultured trash.<br><br>Resort areas are a different story as there are no real local customs since it has a more international mindset.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> we want to follow our own rules in western countries, it's our every right <br> westerns should obey our rules in our lands it's our holy low </br></br>  Continuation of Game of /b/ros<br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;627728777 <br><br>MUPDATE: Turn 15<br>Open Houses: Axuri, Martell, Tully and Tyrell<br>Open Schisms: Bolton, Dayne, Ebonhead, Frey, Hightower, Lorath, Lys, New Ghis, Norvos, Qohor, R'hllor, Royce, Tyrosh, Westerling and Yunkai<br><br>Event: Fall is Here - All strongholds go down in difficulty by 1 (Includes King's Landing)<br><br>Bonus Event: Oktoberfest - All sieges gain a bonus from men drinking the Andalish sours of Braavos. +1 on all sieges but a 0 get fails because too much is too much</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes if thats how they got there<br> King Grendel Baratheon, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, and Protector of the Realm <br> Allied with House Tyrell <br> Battering Ram (5/5) </br></br></br></br>  <br>Team Essos rules<br> Dragonpit Targaryen <br> NAP: Myr <br> Allies: Dothraki, Braavos <br> Permission: Myr <br> Bonus: Dragon (1/1), Emporer of the New Ghis Empire +1T </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;627730528 <br>I accept this offer if it's one of alliance<br><br> King Hjal Greyjoy of Pyke <br> Bonus: KoSaR+1 <br> Ally:Stark, Baratheon </br></br></br></br></br>   the jews did this   Best ship doesn't have a date to the prom, but then again, she probably won't be going to the prom either.  <br><br>B-besides...<br>I already got a date.</br></br></br>  <br>Hi hi, how're you?</br>  More of her please  nigga where u at?<br><br>how much time left?</br></br>  <br>Fuck she looks like Boxxy.</br>  9  Can someone please tell me what this is?  a Continuum Transfunctioner  <br>its a picture</br>  It's the horn of a cyber rhino  No cringe thread?
