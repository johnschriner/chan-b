He always did volunteer work at the hospital that my first son was at.<br>I never brought charges up against my ex-wife, I figured her own form of abortion was punishment enough. Yes, to this day I despise her.<br><br>I'll answer any questions you have. Gotta take a shot first.</br></br></br>  <br>What sport is it?</br>  <br>Sorry that this happened<br>Life is about the events that take us to the end. You have to cherish the good and understand the bad.<br>I am very happy that there are good people in this world and dont ever look down on yourself.</br></br></br>  <br>Sorry, man. If I said that, I would give away the donor. Couldn't do that to him. He's a hero of mine.</br>  <br><br>I'd like to believe this story is true. Means the world isn't so terrible.</br></br>  <br>Thanks. This event(s) actually turned me into a good man, and gave me the ability to be a great father. I'm honored my first son gave his life for that.</br>  <br>It is. I promise you. Every word.</br>  <br>Nigger, we don't even know what country your from. Every sport has a ton of fucking teams, and every team has a ton of fucking players. There's no way any of us would know who it is.</br>  <br>1999 in the country I live has a bunch of great wins. If I was to say, I would expose a man who helped save me. I am not doing that.</br>  <br>its tim duncan. Youre from san antonio, I can tell from the landscape, and the spurs always win. Tim Duncan is also the coolest guy ever</br>  <br>Alright. By that logic, I have a challenge that you should easily pass. In 2007 I met my favorite soccer player. Now tell me who it was.</br>  <br>This GET proves it.</br>  <br><br>check'd</br></br>  <br>Region is correct.give or take 500 miles.<br><br><br><br>Bayern München</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Quints cant lie</br>  <br>This may sound terrible but if you study probability and look how the events connect. Looking forward its hard to see the path. Turn around and it all makes sense. If it wasnt for your terrible first wife, you wouldnt have the amazing boy you have now.<br><br>I am happy you are able to see the positives. Thank you for the story.</br></br></br>  <br>I said player. But you're not even in the right country. SEE HOW THE SPORT AND YEAR DOESN'T NARROW SHIT DOWN.<br><br>Also, I'm just going to assume that &gt;629800000 is right and drop this topic.</br></br></br>  <br>The spurs also won in 1999, so this seems legit</br>  <br>Jesus Christ, Dude. I'm fucking with you. Do you even know where you are? I don't know, nor do I give a fuck. I'm telling you a story. It is true, and I don't give a flying fuck what you think. Get bent on your trap porn.</br>     is mad because  guessed it on first try.  <br>fuck. Clicked wrong one.<br><br> is mad because  guessed it on first try.</br></br></br>  <br>Actually, You're wrong. I hate basketball.</br>  The part I don't get is the baggy clothes and standing on stomach thing. She was pregnant and wanted a hillbilly abortion or what.<br><br>Help me out anons. I an a stupid.</br></br>  <br>She was so religious, she couldn't get an abortion. So, she killed my son the only way she could, without suspicion.</br>  <br>she left the kitchen. <br>nuff said</br></br>  draw thread  <br>Please don't taint our holy cartoons.<br><br>Fuck it, taint it with as much non-Steven/Greg shit as you want.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>If Andrew 'I hate the Indian more than the Jew' Jackson is not winning I'mma be fucking pissed.<br><br>America's most badass president by far was Andrew 'Look at me Sideways and I'll Trail of Tears you' Jackson, this is fact.<br><br>Washington a shit and had a terrible battlefield track record.<br><br>Old Abe was a homosex and looked weird as fuck.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Heads up I am working on this request, just figured I take some extra time on it.</br>  Post the last message a girl sent you.<br><br> I feel you i got days like that sometimes </br></br>   Sure.   <br> not checking the trips <br>kill yourself already</br></br>  Ok ty :)  Faces of /b/ thread<br>R8's welcome<br>Faggots welcome</br></br>    <br>benedict cumberbatch</br>  <br>Yeah, very much.
