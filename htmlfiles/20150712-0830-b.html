I still can't get over the fact that dinosaurs ruled the world for 100 million years. Pretty mind-blowing.<br><br><br><br>Good!<br><br><br><br>Studying the Bible and how it was made does help a lot in understanding what it actually is. <br><br>If I gave you an article of law and a shopping list, and you suddenly decided that the shopping list (which I found in my pocket, a leftover from Friday's outing), and you decided that this list was all the things your own people should eat for the rest of their lives, then you'd be adding a context to my text, one I never implied. The same happens to many books of the Bible; it's what happens when people assume to know the context of a text. One can't do that seriously.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>/thread</br></br>  <br> &gt;Say a bunch of ignorant shit to stir up anti-white sentiments <br><br>What?

I also believe, based on Scripture, that earthly life isn't the only place where you can be saved. Catholics solved this by deducing Purgatory, but other hints point at the notion that "Hell" isn't eternal and more of a correction than a punishment.<br><br>I believe God judges us perfectly within our own parameters. An atheist is merely someone who calls themselves an atheist, and I believe God cares more about what we do and why we do it than how we call ourselves.<br><br>In other words, an atheist who believes in goodness and acts accordingly is a noble being, and that matters more to God than merely calling yourself Christian. You can do both, of course.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you will donate sperm?<br>Do you like little girls?<br>Do you love yisus?</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>The name Christian is an anglicized version of the French name Tristan...<br><br>It was considered taboo to name ones offspring after Christ until very recently.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Godfather or Goodfellas?</br>  <br><br>In case you have a question.<br><br><br><br>A basic bitch... That has a ring to it. Gusta.<br><br><br><br>I don't.<br><br><br><br>Christianity wouldn't be the same without Catholicism. It's a Protestant idea to try to suggest Catholicism is some weird offshoot of Christianity when it's just the result of the Great Schism, the other part being the Orthodox Church. They both were just the Christian Church before the schism.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> implying a Bronx Tale isn't a better Mob themed movie </br></br>  <br><br>someone tell that to the panics</br></br>  <br>As-salaamu' alaikum brother. Why have your people launched another Crusade? Why are you all so afraid of death when coming to fight us? Will you accept Islam when we have defeated your armies?</br>  <br><br>Don't hold your breath...<br><br><br><br>No.<br>No, not sexually anyway.<br>Yes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not implying anything, just honest question.</br>  <br>you dont like, but you abused childs?<br>how you know the term of CP?</br></br>  <br><br>Honestly? Godfather. Casino is better than Goodfellas in my opinion, maybe even better than Godfather. I hold it in very high esteem, and, which is a big difference, it's based on a true story, while the Godfather is romanticised bullshit at heart, even if it makes for a great movie.</br></br>  Is Dylann Storm Roof a true Christian and a fine patriot ?    What do you think about how Adam and Eve and Noah were ripped off from the Epic of Giglamesh?  <br><br>The Vatican exists solely to collect Tithings for Zionism. That's it. They're the bodyguards of Jewry basically...hence why England cut ties with them ages ago.<br><br>After they cut ties, the Vatican hired the mercenary Guido (Guy) Fawkes to destabilize the newly founded Church Of England &amp; bring those tithings back into their pockets.<br><br>Fawkes was a massive failfag &amp; couldn't accomplish even the most basic of tasks, ergo; he's mocked anually on Guy Fawkes day here in England.<br><br>People to this day make effigies and burn them in the streets of London.<br><br>Catholics=/= Christians.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Let childs aproach to me!!  <br>Thank you for answer.<br>And yeah, Casino was also a great movie, but I find Goodfellas the most impressive gangster movie I've seen, maybe beside Once Upon A Time In America.</br></br>  <br><br>Christians fear death because they are humble enough to doubt whether their place in Heaven is assured or not. Not doing so is both arrogance and fanaticism.<br><br>I won't accept Islam because I don't believe Gabriel would contradict himself by telling Mary one thing and then Mohammed another; the first thing was most likely the truth, and the second was the lie.<br><br>God would not choose a warlord and a pedophile to speak His holy message. I'm sorry.<br><br>Even if you conquer the world, His kingdom is not of this world and neither is mine.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> abused childs <br> childs <br> CP <br><br>Everyone knows the term CP. I also know of the term "retard".</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't know about Christian, but he certainly loves his country and race.<br><br><br><br>Not familiar with that theory. Myths generally echo through civilisations though. Wouldn't be surprised.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Carlit's Way is the shittest gangster movie I've seen. Stay away from it.<br><br>Trying to think of good ones for you... Training Day was pretty good, although it all happens in a day, so it's not exactly the same, but it's a great movie.<br><br>THE DEPARTED<br><br>Now that's the shit. Fucking fantastic, don't miss it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Scarface is overrated. It's seriously crappy when you consider it. <br><br>Casino and The Departed are my favourites.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Carlito's way <br> Movie about Spic gangsters  <br> Expects it to be good, in any capacity <br><br>Topkek</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why are you so fucking arrogant?</br>  <br>why is there so many people with the name GEESUUUS?</br>  <br><br>I haven't done anything arrogant.</br></br>  <br><br>Mexicans think it's appropriate, that's why.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Jesus literally means "God saves".</br></br></br>  <br>did you just modify a swedish flag?</br>  <br><br>All European flags with a cross on it have it as a Christian cross. It's not a coincidence.</br></br>  <br>Weeeell you're a christian aren't you?<br>Per definition you believe that literally everything was created for you. That's pretty much narcissism in my book.</br></br>  <br> Christians fear death because they are humble enough to doubt whether their place in Heaven is assured or not. <br>Or, because you know the sins you have committed against the Muslim people will let you burn in hellfire, so you try to live longer and repent one day. Of course that is what your religion loves to preach - sin all you want, then ask for forgiveness. It's what Christian/western history is made of. Deception, oppression, genocide and theft, then turn around and tell your victims that violence and hatred is not the way and "love thy neighbour" yada yada...<br><br> I won't accept Islam because I don't believe Gabriel would contradict himself by telling Mary one thing and then Mohammed another; the first thing was most likely the truth, and the second was the lie <br>Except the first thing was the revealation to Moses. 0/10. Furthermore, if that is your logic, why do you not follow the old testament if you believe Gabriel wouldn't contradict himself? You willingly ignore the teachings of your book over some obscure reference. Don't you think if the old testament was no longer applicable (a massive change) then the Lord would have made it clear, not left it up to some old clergyman to infer from a vague statement?<br><br> God would not choose a warlord and a pedophile to speak His holy message. I'm sorry. <br>Yet he spoke to Moses and made a 12 year old give virgin birth.<br><br> Even if you conquer the world, His kingdom is not of this world and neither is mine. <br>Islam will conquer the world, and we will all bow before Allah. You may not see it now, but once your society falls through it's own decadence, the purity of Islam will shine through.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Or, because you know the sins you have committed against the Muslim people will let you burn in hellfire <br><br>I haven't done anything to any Muslim.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeshu, his actual name...doesn't mean that at all.<br><br>He was Semitic, spoke Aramaic, was a swindler, magician &amp; con artist.<br><br>He accomplished nothing but brainwashing the instability of Goyim &amp; defectors from Judaism.<br><br>Christ was a tool used to remove weakness from Jewry.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>sideways<br>and that didn't answer my question</br></br>  <br> if that is your logic, why do you not follow the old testament if you believe Gabriel wouldn't contradict himself? <br><br>We do, except on the parts where Christ changed the Covenant through His sacrifice.<br><br>It is very clear. Paul even specifies which laws should be dropped and which should be kept.<br><br>The New Testament also makes it clear that a false prophet would appear and lead many people to do evil. Obviously Mohammed and all the evil that Muslims commit over the world.<br><br> Yet he spoke to Moses and made a 12 year old give virgin birth. <br><br>Mary wasn't 12.<br><br> Islam will conquer the world, and we will all bow before Allah.  <br><br>That will be difficult considering most Muslims who move to Europe abandon their faith very quickly and start drinking and having sex with prostitutes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>josheph jesus his father, was talked about only once in teh bible, this probably means that they needed to keep his identity secret. historians think he was initiated in a group of assassins to that assassinated romans. <br><br>jesus was just like his dad, he just took on a more propagating way instead of assassination.</br></br></br>  <br>Are you stupid? How could dinosaurs rule for 100 million years if the world is only 2015 years old? Faggot</br>  <br> I believe God cares more about what we do and why <br>What leads you to believe this about god? The bible?</br></br>  <br> Yeshu, his actual name...doesn't mean that at all. <br><br>It does. Google it.<br><br> was a swindler, magician &amp; con artist. <br><br>To do what He did, you need much more than that. No magician or conman would want to live like a beggar and be crucified for nothing.<br><br><br><br>Because you didn't expect an actual response. Sideways or not makes no difference.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He killed by subversion &amp; rape of cultural heritage...which is worse.</br></br>  <br><br>Joseph is mentioned far more than once in the Bible. There are no reasons to assume he was an assassin... You play too many video games.<br><br><br><br>Why would you think the world started when Christ was born? You think Mary shat Him out of her cunt as the Big Bang unfolded?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yes.</br></br>  <br><br> live like a beggar <br><br>He had 12 whipping boys to do his bidding not to mention all the morons that actually believed he was a physical manifestation of God &amp; gave him piles of free shit.<br><br>To say Jesus lived a poor man's life is an outright lie &amp; based in profound ignorance.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you American? Who do you like in the election coming up?</br>  <br><br>Jesus lived as a poor man, but He also did things that thousands of people were impressed with. We know Christianity was extraordinarily popular because of His acts simply due to the insane number of manuscripts that were preserved until today. Most manuscripts get lost, so having 1500 as we have is insane. Caesar's own writings only have 4 remaining manuscripts, to give you an idea.<br><br><br><br>I'm Swiss. According to some website, my ideas fit most with Rick Santorum, whom I only know by name.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Right, slight of hand trickery &amp; general "magical" abilities is what made him popular. Also great oratory skills, hence why people like Hitler, Mao, Stalin, Mussolini, Washington gained popularity for their causes.<br><br>It's not hard to trick the average person if you have a slightly higher intellectual capacity.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I didn't say you did. Read my original question.<br><br> Mary wasn't 12. <br>That's not what experts say. Of course the Bible and modern church have hidden and altered so many truths.<br><br>Most if not all accounts give her age between 11-14 while Joseph was 90 years old.<br><br>Islam will dominate. Most Muslims who move to Europe have set up entire communities and built many mosques there. Those Europeans who have lived amongst the Muslims have seen how pure and humble the Muslim is and have began converting to Islam. It is Europes fastest-growing religion.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I know him, but I don't think he's running this time 'round. You know he's so anti-gay his name has been given to the mixture of feces and lube that you get if you have anal sex incorrectly, right? I mean, I count myself a fiscal conservative, But that's a bit much, I think. I'm rooting for that fat fuck from Jersey, Christie. He's the only one who doesn't want to waste tax dollars yelling at social liberals and wants to ban fracking. Here's to many years of non-flammable tap water.</br>  <br><br>How do you heal the sick with slight of hand?<br><br><br> That's not what experts say. <br><br>Experts have no way of knowing the exact age of Mary. Same goes for Joseph.<br><br> Islam will dominate. Most Muslims who move to Europe have set up entire communities and built many mosques there. Those Europeans who have lived amongst the Muslims have seen how pure and humble the Muslim is and have began converting to Islam. It is Europes fastest-growing religion. <br><br>Go to London. 80% of the Muslims there abandon their faith within a year. They start drinking alcohol, eating pork, and having sex outside marriage.<br><br>Muslims aren't pure at all. In my country, 90% of the inmates are Muslims: they rape, they steal, they are violent, they are criminals and don't respect the law.<br><br>Sorry, brother. Your faith is only the fastest growing because Muslims make many children, but those children are only Muslims in name. Give 1 or 2 generations in Europe and they've already stopped being Muslims.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Modern Satanist here.<br><br>In my opinion Chris here is winning the argument. He seems to be judging way more relevantly and objectively about his own faith.<br><br>You are making an ass of yourself saying he should repent for the crusades. Are you unaware of your own blades clad in the blood of the carcasses of heathens you built your Ottoman empire on?<br><br>It's hypocrisy and you know it, next to both of you not being obliged to feel shit about what happened in those time-periods. Didn't god tell you that's hubris?<br><br>I respect a lot of your beliefs to the fullest of my ability, as well as I do reject a lot completely, because I feel they shouldn't and shan't apply to me. I also generally don't invite people to let me subtly force my own on them.<br><br>Regardless, christianity will die out when people stop feeling sorry for themselves out of calvinism. Islam will die out the moment most of you leave your sandbox.<br><br>Hopefully after we can all die happily together when you 2 bozo's have realized we're nothing but glorified animals.<br><br>You immoral godsuckers.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What brings you to 4chan?  <br>So what's Satanism like these days? Do you actually worship Satan or do you do the LaVey thing and just appreciate Lucifer as a metaphor?</br>  <br> Regardless, christianity will die out when people stop feeling sorry for themselves out of calvinism. Islam will die out the moment most of you leave your sandbox. <br><br>I agree with the Muslim part, because that's what happens. Muslims stop being Muslims as soon as they aren't forced to.<br><br>As to Christians, it's the exact opposite. Consider China: 10 million people convert to Christ each year. Think about it. 10 million a year is 100 million people per decade. It's the fastest conversion since Roman times, and even back then it was willing conversion, not forced. Nobody forces the Chinese to come to Christ, but they do, en masse.<br><br>Islam is doomed if it can't use violence, Christianity thrives on its own.<br><br>The next great Christian nation is China.<br><br>I don't feel sorry for myself and am Christian. There are other reasons for my faith than self-pity, thankfully.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>hi christian, nice to meet you i am carlos</br>  <br><br>Brings? Been here since 2008. Long before I converted.</br></br>  <br><br>Can't really talk about the "We" in this out of principle; but we all just generally try to do what Manson does and make auto-fellatio.</br></br>  <br>How many childs do you raped?</br>  <br><br>LaVey wrote the Satanic Bible for quick cash back in the 1960's.<br><br>Manson actually believes in God, he's a theist, despite his dislike of organised religion.<br><br><br><br>You would not be such an obvious samefag if you could actually spell "childs" correctly. It's "children", an irregular plural based on the old way of doing plurals, from old German.<br><br>Your tenses also need some love.<br><br> do you raped <br><br>Back to studying auxiliaries, sir, you don't know how they work.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Even being an agnostic I can see China's christian rise as a pretty good thing. Conditions over there are mad inhumane. May get better if some law makers over there have some kind of divine inspiration to stop shitting on god's doorstep with their industrial state. I mean, Fuck. If you have to put nets up on factories to keep employees from jumping something's gone wrong.</br>  <br><br><br>How do you justify being here, given your faith?</br></br></br>  <br><br>what is your opinion on gay marriage?</br></br>    <br><br>Wouldn't you agree that /b/ is the one place that needs Christ the most?<br><br>Jesus Christ didn't hang out with saints and good people: He visited whores and murderers.<br><br>My faith doesn't prevent me from going anywhere. I could visit pedo websites just fine because I'm not actually attracted to children. There's no sin in this.<br><br><br><br>I'm against homosexual marriage but for political reasons rather than religious ones.<br><br><br><br>You can't really post this after 89 posts showing that people actually care.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why do u call yourself after Christ when Christ was Jewish?</br>  <br><br>China you say? I'm intrigued. I will research these statistics.<br><br>I do sincerely hope you'll realize that far from all conversion around BC went peacefully.<br>The godly pantheon was quite the thing you know.

I'm intrigued. I will research these statistics. <br><br>Source: The Economist.<br><br>I'm aware conversion was made mandatory by Rome when Christianity became the state religion, I was talking about before, because no religion suddenly becomes state religion without a good part of the population being of that faith too. Romans converted in droves after seeing Christians being tortured to death, preferring to testify of their faith than deny it, and all the while forgiving their killers.<br><br> Am not converting tho. <br><br>You're already converted to God's beautiful female bodies.

Also compare a gay couple to a single mother or father dating heterosexually while raising a child without the child's other biological parent, A common scenario these days. Which do you think would impart more damage on the child? It seems apparent to me which has the most variables that could lead to damage, but that's just my speculation.</br>  <br>what's it like being a homosexual?</br>  <br>I did not write the bible so I did not make the rules. There is no citations inside of it that explain you can obtain a "get out of hell" free card from talking to some self entitled shmuck in a church. Your way of "being saved from it" is by actually following what the good books says and that is by not sinning. Quite simple. If you have more questions let me know.</br>  <br><br> Studies show that children raised by homos are not happy. Most homos agree that they would not have wanted a childhood without their mother, for instance. <br><br>This is biased. Check these sources and pinpoint the relevance a bit more please. Verify in which states/countries this actually holds true and you will find out what affects these families most is bigotry and bias, generally from religion and social retardation.<br><br>I've also already converted to God's beautiful male bodies and everything in between, still wanna invite me? (I've even fucked a massive pile of construction-yard-sand when I was like 9; I don't need conversion to love what nature offers.)<br><br>My dad's a homo btw, doesn't mean I didn't get to have a mom.

I also think single parents, even if homo, are better than two homos together. Not everybody can be raised by Jodie Foster.<br><br>I wouldn't even go statistical on these, as good parents will always be better for the child, but I also believe that every child should have a normal childhood which fits nature a bit more.<br><br>I wouldn't want two fathers who fuck each other in the ass, if I'm honest and rude.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's a pain in the ass.<br><br><br> I did not write the bible so I did not make the rules. <br><br>Nor do you understand them. <br><br> Your way of "being saved from it" is by actually following what the good books says and that is by not sinning. <br><br>Actually, if you read the book, you'd know what saves you, and it's not your actions. Actions can be evidence of faith, since there's no faith without action, but actions don't replace faith in Christ.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It's a pain in the ass. <br><br>Practice bruh. You will find the prostate eventually!</br></br></br>  <br> This is biased. Check these sources and pinpoint the relevance a bit more please. <br><br>It's not biased, there are plenty of young people who had homo parents and they explain why it didn't work for them. One point is that, if you have two fathers, your mother has been obliterated one way or another, and most children will not be OK with that. Just because daddy wants some cock doesn't mean your mother should be wiped out of the picture as if she never existed.<br><br>I condone homos who still found a traditional family. Sex shouldn't be this important inside marriage, and nowadays, with safety measure, it should be OK for a homo to marry a woman, have children and raise them, and occasionally suck the D on the side and get penetrated by penors. I'm OK with that if you raise children traditionally.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Your personal delusions about your own religion implies you can mass murder and not go to hell because you have faith in god. Absurdity.<br><br> I'm done having asinine discussions regarding the way you are personally interpreting the bible and rejecting the hard truth. Enjoy torment of eternal fire in the presence of the lamb. I just wish I could hear Satan's laughter when you realize your sins mattered.</br></br></br>  <br>That's fair. I see plenty of couples gay and straight I wouldn't want to peek into the bedroom of.<br><br>I'm confused by the religious concept of the natural, though. Homosexual activity is prevalent in animals that lack the capacity to do anything their instincts don't back up. We see male penguins stepping in to warm eggs in the event of an egg sitting male's mate not making it back sometimes. Male Lions will sometimes mount other male lions when too many of their lionesses won't have them. And bonobos... well, Don't google them with someone else in the room, if you catch my meaning. These creatures seem like the best indicator of god's intent for nature to me, He created them as they are, or saw fit to change them somehow that wound up here. It is all part of his plan, after all. Right?</br></br></br>  <br>The Christian god is a very jealous and unforgivable god.</br>  <br> Your personal delusions about your own religion implies you can mass murder and not go to hell because you have faith in god. Absurdity. <br><br>I don't actually believe that, precisely because of my beliefs. Stop assuming your ideas about Christians apply to me.<br><br> I'm done having asinine discussions regarding the way you are personally interpreting the bible and rejecting the hard truth. <br><br>You don't know the Bible as well as you think because you spent no time studying it beyond a casual reading of it here and there. Let alone original languages and concepts.<br><br>  I just wish I could hear Satan's laughter when you realize your sins mattered. <br><br>Very noble of you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> pic related <br>Your post just made me remember this</br></br>  How does ignorance feel?  <br><br>Except there is no reason to raise children "tradionally" because in the end it's what you teach them and there's no foundation or lack thereoff which would make it impossible to educate.<br><br>From the same logic many religious children say that THAT didn't work for them, which in the end amounts to the parents being retards.<br><br>Kids not getting a sense of sex in the grand cultural scheme due to stupid homo-parents ALSO, just amounts to the parents being retards.<br><br>Furthermore you don't "obliterate" any mother by having a son in a two-father-household. There's plenty chicks jumping for the opportunity to breed for their friends. Ask them if they feel obliterated. If I were a woman i'd ofcourse say yes but I'd imply I thought it felt kinky at the same time.<br><br>It's also never been NOT okay for a homo to marry a woman; my dad was for 17 years to meh mum. Not that it made me and my brother happier when they were still together...<br><br>What you're implying about the status quo here is pretty black and white dude. But regardless, it is my opinion that tradition is inherently senseless and a weaker trait of humanity. You seem not to believe this.<br><br>I condone that too though.<br>Wanna fug?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm confused by the religious concept of the natural, though. Homosexual activity is prevalent in animals that lack the capacity to do anything their instincts don't back up. <br><br>Most animal homosexuality is not homosexual. A dog will fuck another dog the same way it'd fuck your leg: not because it's attracted to your leg esthetically, but simply because it feels good. That's a huge difference. When animals fuck a hole, it's not a lifestyle, it just feels good.<br><br>Some animals do it to show who's boss. I don't actually know of animals who feel homosexuality the way humans do, but I'm sure they exist.<br><br>I believe God designed the universe in such a way that what happens happens. Evolution is a crafty process and plenty of insane things happen in nature (see duck sexuality, angler fish, etc).<br><br>That said, many Christians feel the exact same way about "natural" sex, heterosexuality and all. That's where I tend to differ from most, for reasons similar to yours. Sex is always overrated in religions: sins of the flesh, like lust are the least important sins in Christianity. Dante places the lusty in the first circle of hell, in the "excess of love" department. It's the least big deal of all sins.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dude, That's a crazy stance to take anyway. If God is the architect of the environment that sin can exist in, you know, free will, Then he can absolve it if he wants to. How do you have a christian world view that limits God?</br>  <br><br>That's Jehovah as described by Jews. Remember that some of their stories have God killing people while another story has Satan do it. You can't rely on the Old Testament for much.<br><br>It's often myths, and sometimes it's fiction and people don't even know, like the Book of Job is a poem and a lot of people take it as nonfiction. It was written as fiction, just like Dante's Divine Comedy or Milton's Paradise Lost. It takes nothing from its value but it's not intended to be read as a factual account.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't know.</br></br>  <br><br>Homosexuality has never been a lifestyle as much as your religion has never truly been one coherent doctrine.<br><br>Sexual preference is just that: sexually caring which holes you fill or get filled.<br><br>I agree that it's arbitrary as fuck though.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why cant christians define christianity?</br>  <br> Ask them if they feel obliterated. <br><br>We have asked them and virtually all have felt left out of the family, simply because they were. The children, at any rate, have said that they felt strong resentment at having been given up like that, for the pleasure of homos.<br><br>Marriage shouldn't be just<br><br> licensed sex.<br><br>  it is my opinion that tradition is inherently senseless and a weaker trait of humanity <br><br>Some traditions have enabled us to survive. Current "traditions" are leading us to extinction. And very fast. Within a century, there will be no Europeans anymore. I guess our old traditions did have some good in them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You know, That seems well thought out to me. Don't get me wrong, I'd still laugh if the pope slipped on his robes and died, I still think the institution is harmful, I still think a loving god who gave us free will only to punish us forever if we don't stay in his parameters is silly, but if more Christians thought their issues out like you do I feel like I probably wouldn't.</br>  <br> Homosexuality has never been a lifestyle as much as your religion has never truly been one coherent doctrine. <br><br>It's very coherent when you understand it at length.<br><br><br><br>They can. See the Catechism of the Catholic Church for one of the better attempts at definition.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I still think a loving god who gave us free will only to punish us forever if we don't stay in his parameters is silly, <br><br>it is. The early Christians didn't believe in that. They believed Christ was going to save your ass no matter what and the only thing that could prevent your salvation was if you denied God while knowing perfectly that He existed and loved you (the unpardonable sin, not by God's will, but because you can't forgive someone who doesn't want your forgiveness).</br></br></br>  <br>That raises kind of another point. If God won't deny you salvation if the word hasn't reached you so you can knowingly denounce him, Isn't spreading the word harmful? I mean, I suppose that ties back to the fruit in Eden, But modern day there are plenty of people on the fringes of civilization that have never heard God as a proper name before that missionaries are going out and giving bibles. Aren't they harming them?</br>  <br> If God won't deny you salvation if the word hasn't reached you so you can knowingly denounce him, Isn't spreading the word harmful? <br><br>You can never know for sure until you die, basically.<br><br>People who never heard of God can still lead evil lives. It's not a matter of knowing of Christ or not, it's a matter of how you act and why.<br><br>I'm familiar with this issue though. Reminds me of a funny picture, let me see if I can find it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Bump</br>  <br><br> It's very coherent when you understand it at length. <br><br>Clearly it hasn't been coherent enough for a day because there hasn't been 1 since their inception that didn't see the blood of a believer who was an infidel in another's eyes.<br><br>But hey, you are the religious expert.<br>I tend to think of myself as an expert on faggotry ánd the interactions between religion and faggotry and I do have to admit the outdatedness of belief and discussion of it has always been purveyed pretty coherently in these wars of bigotry.<br><br>Still no fug?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I can't find that image.</br></br>  <br> Clearly it hasn't been coherent enough for a day because there hasn't been 1 since their inception that didn't see the blood of a believer who was an infidel in another's eyes. <br><br>Coherent doesn't mean nobody can have a different opinion. There can be two coherent opinions about the same thing, and even more. One doesn't flow from the other.<br><br> outdatedness  <br><br>It's 2015, get on with the times!<br>It's 1933, Hitler's in power, get on with the times!<br><br>The time argument is worth nothing. It makes you look dumb because you assume time sort of naturally evolves for the better, for no particular reasons. Life doesn't work that way. Newer doesn't mean better.<br><br>You say it's incoherent, but you don't show me a point that is incoherent in your opinion. If you had something in mind, you'd show it, right?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This time thing kind of makes me think, Though. Do you believe, Were God to change his mind, leading from the assumption that he'd already know what was going to happen and that he probably wouldn't, But also allowing for the fact that he is God and thus can do whatever he wants, that we would know about it? That what was once right may now be mere tradition afloat on happenstance?</br>  <br><br>I believe God limits His foreknowledge by giving us free will, making us His equal in creation, also giving us tremendous responsibility for ourselves.<br><br>There is no future, literally. It's just an idea, a concept, but it really is about things that don't exist yet. God can't know the future any more than He can make a rock so big He can't lift. Logical impossibilities aren't within God's realm of possibilities simply because these things can't exist.<br><br>I don't believe that morals change, either. God has shown adaptive behaviour in the past, though, but the core remains the same.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>1. I do know what coherent means.<br><br>2. I do have many a thing in mind regarding this but I tend to think in the grander scheme (with more religions than just christianity in mind) and not focus on the complete clusterfuck of dichotomies in just your book. I don't out this NOT because they're cliched but because the burden of proof doesn't fall on me. <br><br>3. The time argument isn't valid because it's an opinion. I decide what I feel is outdated out of my own self-entitlement.<br><br>4. Whoops, it might actually be valid the moment you research how the social norms of atheists weigh up to those of them still living out most traditions based on your new testament and/or other religions.<br><br>5. If you feel that there's no dichotomy about in this, please do reflect on your need to make your own new testament.<br><br>But I'll humor you and ask a few thingies:<br><br>How do you "interpret" the absolute?<br>What is the meaning of the latin verb: "religare"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Do you believe the part of the bible about niggers being cursed by god to be slaves for the other races?</br></br>  <br>Hey, There's something you don't get to ask a christian every day without having to have a bible on-hand for reference. Define the core for us, What's the core moral structure, in your opinion?</br>  <br> Whoops, it might actually be valid the moment you research how the social norms of atheists weigh up to those of them still living out most traditions based on your new testament and/or other religions. <br><br>It doesn't, for any creed. The League of Militant Atheists should make you question your belief in the good of atheism as a creed.<br><br>Your points refer to no obvious references, so I have no idea what you're talking about in most.<br><br> this <br><br>Wot.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  http://<span>youtu.be/3H03NsUwKjM  [ ]  <br><br>Sem? Of course not. Nobody believes you literally chance race because you steal like a bixnood mufugga.</br></br>  <br>Nigger</br>  <br> What's the core moral structure, in your opinion? <br><br>Love God, love your neighbour as yourself (which implies that you love yourself in acts, for real, to begin with).<br><br>That's the core, and it's nothing very surprising, especially to people who grew up in the West, where all cultures were bathed in this idea.<br><br>Christ was asked the same and that's what He said, so I give you the same answer.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That is satisfying.<br><br><br>You mean the mark of Kane, Right? Bear in mind most of this happened in the middle east to people of dark skin, themselves.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He meant the children of Noah, Sem and the other two. The mark of Cain (Kane is a video game thing) is something else entirely.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>I think it was the curse of Ham (or Sem) where god blackened the face of one of noahs sons because he looked at noahs nakedness when noah was drunk.<br><br><br>That pervy guy was the ancestor of all the blacks according to the bible.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I like it. The next time I see that fossil Pat Robertson on TV being crazy I'm going to think back to that okay stranger on the internet and change the channel in mild discomfort rather than abject fear and disgust.</br>  <br>Why do you come here? watching porn is a sin</br>  <br> That pervy guy was the ancestor of all the blacks according to the bible. <br><br>According to people who wanted to enslave nigs. The Bible doesn't go that far at all.<br><br>Obviously, a Jew's child can't be an African.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's hardly even perversion. I mean, What man hasn't entered a public shower in gym class or something and snuck a peak just to see how you stack up to your peers?</br>  <br><br>American TV Protestants are the worst. I dislike Evangelists to a high degree. I think American Protestantism of that sort of the worst thing to happen to Christianity.<br><br>I cannot stand Creationists, megachurches and all that shit. I just can't. I'm glad I can be a counter to some of it.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh, Right. Cane's kin were out of the picture already.<br><br>Now I want to dig out the playstation and pick Soul Reaver up again.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Watching porn isn't a sin per se, but even so, you can open a thread here without looking at anything. You can even disable images, for starters.<br><br>Either way, Christians know they are sinners. You can't avoid your sinful nature, it's not about acts.<br><br>As to porn, I've used it so much that it's literally dead to me now. Porn doesn't turn me on anymore, it's like those anatomy books. It's just naked humans to me. I've lost the attraction to porn.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh, then there's a fun question!<br><br>What do you think of people like Pat Robertson, Getting paid millions to go preach crazy-talk and confuse those who don't know better than to listen whining, from their tax-exempt mega churches no less, about progressives in government oppressing them by giving gays rights and teaching kids about condoms in school, and such?</br></br></br>  <br>Why is your religion right and every other one is wrong</br>  <br><br>I think it's shit. I cringe at the idea that we're supposed to be of the same faith.<br><br><br><br>That's what I believe to the best of my ability because of what I have found regarding this issue, because all other religions have failed where Christianity has succeeded. There are plenty of reasons but it took me years to cover them and I don't suppose a few posts could do it justice.<br><br>That said, Christianity is the only religion that claims God became a human being to save us; other religions don't have that, and none can hold water when compared to the New Testament, that's the most of it. I've read most sacred texts, nothing compares to the power of the gospels, ultimately.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Rekt/9001<br><br>Seriously one of the most underrated posts I've ever read on /b/.</br></br></br></br>  What is your view on evolution? To what extent do you think it holds truth?  Ok questions:<br><br>1. Why do you believe anything the Bible says? If I said I can fly without providing evidence would you also believe that? Why do you disbelieve Islam, and all other religions, but believe Christianity? What criteria do you use to judge the truthfullness of religion?<br><br>2. When Cain killed able Able he was cursed and exiled. He found other people. Where the fuck did these people come from given that only Adam, Eve, Cain and Able(Not anymore) existed.<br><br>3. When Jacob used striped cones to breed certain color goats by having them look at the cones while mating, he defied everything we know about genetics. Now days someone would probably say its fucking stupid to try to instill offspring with a certain trait that way. But the Bible says otherwise. Any comment?<br><br>4. You said you believe in Dinos and the "old earth" theory otherwise known as just normal regular history. This means you don't believe in a literal creation story. My confusion then is if you don't believe Adam and Eve or the garden of Eden actually existed, then you don't believe in original sin either. Original sin is pretty much a corner stone of Christianity so can you explain why Yahweh made us sinful and has decided to torture us forever because he made us the way he did, without the idea of original sin? <br><br>Regards<br>Heathen Atheist</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You know what's even better? Most of the money that those mega churches go to don't have to be tracked by the government because of the church's tax exempt status. They don't have to tell anyone where their money winds up. Mostly in funds called Super PACs that blindly fund campaigns for presidential candidates, Not just hardcore christian ones, either, Pretty much anybody with an R next to their name. They're funneling untold millions into a government that's supposed to be distinct from a church, and using that essential louphole not even to further christian ideals, but to unilaterally halt every non-republican regardless of faith or issue.<br><br>Paying for motherfuckers that pull shit like filibuster the central government into shutting down like it did a few years ago.<br><br>The fuck are these people doing in my government? It's sure not governing!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>See<br><br><br>Why don't you know anything about any other religions on the planet?<br><br>All Atheists are the same, copypasta arguments from "The God Delusion" while having absolutely no original ideas of their own.

I believe in the scientific method and empirical data can be trusted.<br><br>True faith doesn't force you to close your eyes to the wonders of God.<br><br>Nobody gets to tell God how to act, like Einstein with his "God doesn't place dice", well maybe He does.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>See<br><br><br>Yawn.<br><br>Being an evangelical for Atheism accomplishes one thing, selling books for Dawkins while you stay poor.<br><br>Topkek at you working for free.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Tell me a christian joke  <br><br>Leave it to a Buddhist to point out why all white people hate themselves.</br></br>  <br>Is your last name Bale?</br>  <br> Why do you believe anything the Bible says? <br><br>I can't answer simply to this, considering that the Bible is 66 book spanning millennia in many languages.<br><br> If I said I can fly without providing evidence would you also believe that? <br><br>I can't look into my heart and see whether this sounds true or not to me, whereas if Christ tells me to love my neighbour as myself, I can look into my heart and see whether I believe the same or not.<br><br> Why do you disbelieve Islam, and all other religions, but believe Christianity? <br><br>I've read their sacred texts and studied them. That's how Christianity came on top for me. <br><br> criteria <br><br>Coherence, likeliness of having been started as a philosophy rather than a religion, likeliness of being a scam, etc. There are plenty of paremeters I've used.<br><br> 2. When Cain killed able Able he was cursed and exiled. He found other people. Where the fuck did these people come from given that only Adam, Eve, Cain and Able(Not anymore) existed. <br><br>I used this when people say Adam and Eve were the first. The Bible doesn't claim that. They're the first people of God, though. I don't read Genesis literally, many Christians don't, most Christians, in fact, don't (also because you can't).<br><br> But the Bible says otherwise. Any comment? <br><br>Different level of reading. Same thing with numbers, you can't read numbers literally in the Bible because all numbers have a symbolic value in Hebrews, and the authors were aware of it, that is why one of the authors of the gospels knowingly alters generations to get certain specific numbers which have a high symbolic value, more important to him than the accuracy of the facts. There's no point in applying genetics, geology, or other, to Genesis, for instance, because it wasn't written for these purposes nor was it ever intended to be read this way. That's my comment.<br><br>(cont)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>No but the bible does say the earth is only in the thousands of years old, I forget what the exact number is but i think around like 10000 or so. in other words if thats true then dinosaurs were around hanging out when humans existed. No evidence of that. And the whole evolution thing, bible says that god made adam and eve..........theres so many things wrong with that i dont think i even need to list them<br><br><br>You cant fucking choose to believe some parts of the bible and ignore other parts, These other parts being things that just dont make any fucking logical sense but the bible IS the word of GOD. You cant read some stories as metaphors or symbolic when again, the whole bible is to be taken literal. Another problem with religious people is they think they know the bible but have you ever read it from start to finish? Surveys have shown most dont. So why do you "live by" (i say that cause again, you dont actually follow the bibles rules cause you arent stoning women to death and killing gays like it tells you to), Why do you live by this ancient book written thousands of years ago designed to explain things they didnt understand back then and to live by a code that made sense 1000 of years ago but is meaningless today.....And why do you all of you live by a book that most of you havent even fully read?</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>I was going to make a snide comment about the Spanish Inquisition, but someone on /b/ would be expecting that...</br>  <br><br> blah blah blah Richard Dawkins argument blah blah blah I pick on Christianity exclusively because it cut into my video game time on Sundays <br> blah blah blah I hate my parents  <br><br>Why do you hate everything about your European heritage?<br><br>If it wasn't for Christians Islam would have conqueres Europe during the Crusades &amp; none of what you love would even exist.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br>No one would expect it.</br></br>  I looked into my heart and determined Hawkings is wrong about his ideas on black holes.<br><br>...See actually knowledge doesn't work that way. Its why scietific journals aren't published claiming "it feels pretty right to me."</br></br>  <br>Well, I've somehow made a tangent into bitching about the American government's shady funding and lobbying policies. But believing the US's government is bullshit spans every faith.<br><br>And I don't even like Dawkins. If someone's inclined to become an atheist they don't need to be spoonfed "Science+Evidence=Probably no god" That's the reason so many teens are proclaiming themselves atheist to piss off mommy and daddy by being edgy. Because it's easy now, You don't need to do any soul searching, yo don't need to be passionate about science, all you need now is passion for the hype that's in vogue. <br><br>I mean, I'm at risk of using the through process that leads people to say shit like "Ugh, Skyrim was just a watered down husk of Oblivion and Morrowind" even though I fucking hate those people, But Atheism was made easier to wrap your head around, And nothing good's come of it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> You said you believe in Dinos and the "old earth" theory otherwise known as just normal regular history. <br><br>I don't "believe" in dinosaurs, I trust paleontologists and geologists about their field of expertise. OEC isn't what everyone believes, and neither is "history" either. History requires writing, all else is prehistory for a reason. OEC, or "Old Earth" as you say, is Creationism, it just believes that God suddenly created the earth as a miracle, but not just 6000 years ago, some older time, to fit more with science, but still not completely. OEC believe they have evidence of that, but it doesn't line up with what geologists actually think happened.<br><br> This means you don't believe in a literal creation story. <br><br>I do believe God literally created the universe, but I have no reason to think anyone in the desert of 1400BC or around has any clue on how it happened.<br><br> My confusion then is if you don't believe Adam and Eve or the garden of Eden actually existed, then you don't believe in original sin either.  <br><br>It doesn't flow from that that I can't believe sin exists. I don't believe the earth was made quite that way, but I don't doubt it exists. I don't believe in a literal Adam and Eve, but it doesn't flow from that that I don't believe in humans.<br><br>I don't believe in Zeus, I sure believe in lightning.<br><br>I believe, as many, that Genesis explains what happens to us as we grow up, whether as humanity or as humans: as you get older, you become an adult, you suddenly become unlikely to show up naked like an innocent child, etc. Growing up means getting out of the Garden. Original sin may just be the fact that not being God, we fall short of His perfection. <br><br>I've already discussed the idea of hell forever ITT, but I can come back on it if you want.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    You retards need to read the bible in context not literally. Maybe if you didnt have so much autism and actually understood that some of these "bible stories" were written for the people back then, you could take the meaning of context rather than literal meaning.<br><br>People of the past didn't know anything, that's why the Genesis story explains it in a way for them to understand. For us it sounds like a stupid story because of science, but for them it sounds like something believable. You need to realize not to take bible word for word, because then it will be just another story.</br></br>  <br><br>I made pic related. It's both a joke and actually very fucking real to me. Readable on two levels, depending on your respect for Christ or lack thereof.</br></br>  <br>I dont hate my heitage, I dont hate christianity. I dont mind it existing as long as they stop trying to FORCE it on those who dont want it and in places it doesnt belong such as public schools and science books. I'm just pointing out facts about the bible that can not be disputed because they are facts.....and im just asking honest questions because I really cant understand why people still follow it other than because the bible tells them that theyre special and that when they die they arent really dead. <br><br>As far as history goes, I dont hate it at all? History is history no matter how I feel it wont change the past so I embrace and I love ancient history. I think its cool. But we are now in the year 2015, this shit doesnt make sense anymore.</br></br></br>  <br> No but the bible does say the earth is only in the thousands of years old <br><br>It doesn't. Genesis lists people who descend from Adam and Eve and some American tards added up the estimated ages.<br><br>It doesn't take in account that these names have meaning in Hebrew and are most likely a series of concepts, rather than actual people, and their ages (ranging in the hundreds) most likely have numerical meaning too.<br><br>Either way, Genesis doesn't claim to tell us the age of the world, apart from this interpretation:<br><br>While Sefer HaTemunah sees the world as existing in the second cycle, others[8] say it is in the seventh cycle.[1] If so, Adam was created when the universe was 42,000 years old, and six worlds were created and destroyed before the creation of Adam.[1] This thesis was laid out by Rabbi Isaac ben Samuel of Acre, a 13th-century Kabbalist, who said that when calculating the age of the universe, one must use divine years rather than physical years.<br><br>"I, the insignificant Yitzchak of Akko, have seen fit to write a great mystery that should be kept very well hidden. One of God's days is a thousand years, as it says, "For a thousand years are in Your eyes as a fleeting yesterday." Since one of our years is 365 ¼ days, a year on High is 365,250 our years.[9] ”<br>By interpreting the texts of Sefer HaTemunah and the Midrash, Isaac ben Samuel of Acre calculated the age of the universe to be 15,340,500,000 years old."</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I used this when people say Adam and Eve were the first. The Bible doesn't claim that. They're the first people of God, though. I don't read Genesis literally, many Christians don't, most Christians, in fact, don't (also because you can't). <br><br>How did you come to this conclusion? I'm fully aware that most Christians don't read the Bible in a literal sense but this seems a tad far fetched to me. When the Bible documented the creation of Adam, I don't see why it shouldn't be assumed that this is the first man created; for what other reason would he hold significance over the actual first man created enough to be documented? <br><br>Also, if you believe that Adam and Eve were not the first humans to be created, you surely believe the others created beforehand were also created by God, yes? So why where these humans created ignorant and unaware of the existence of God? And why were they not spoken of explicitly?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> You cant fucking choose to believe some parts of the bible and ignore other parts, <br><br>That's one way to put it. Another way is to learn about what is what and choose for yourself: one you know that the Book of Job was a poem, you also know that you're not supposed to read it thinking that the God in there is God, but you understand that it's a character in a poem, just like God in Paradise Lost or anyone in Dante's inferno. It does make a huge difference to know what you're actually reading. We have very good knowledge of how the Bible was written.<br><br>The only choice I made was not to close my eyes to the context of those texts.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is one of the ways holding out his hands to visualize the amount of caring?<br><br>I'm sorry for being an asshole, I was just curious if that's what you meant.</br></br></br>  <br><br>people who follow the bible literally are fools, people who follow it in the context, and take lessons from it are in fact the smart ones. All these american evangelist are the shitcan of christianity. They themselves don't know what they're talking about and try super hard to force it onto others. Read the bible in the context and not literally, apply it to real life, and learn from it. Thats what the fucking book is.</br></br>  <br><br> I don't mind if it exists. <br><br>Thanks for giving an ideology 2000 years older than you permission to exist.<br><br> that fucking arrogance. <br><br>Why do you hate everything that makes Europeans what they currently are?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> but the bible IS the word of GOD. <br><br>Literalism and belief in the Bible as the word of God is fairly recent and is not actually supported by the Bible itself. The New Testament almost always has the author declare who they are and some, like Paul, even specify when they speak for God and when they don't.<br><br>Discrepancies in both Testaments also indicate that the Bible cannot be the exact and infallible word of God.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Absolutely none of that has to do with why you hate yourself.<br><br>I'll assume you enjoy wine or beer, thank Jesuit &amp; Franciscan monks for keeping those recipes &amp; practices safe during the Crusades.<br><br>Every time you toast a glass of champagne, thank Catholic Monks for inventing it.<br><br>Why do you hate being white so much?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Another problem with religious people is they think they know the bible but have you ever read it from start to finish? Surveys have shown most dont. <br><br>Most parts of the Old Testament are the history of the Jews, which you don't need as a Christian. Don't forget that Christians have followed Christ without a Bible for centuries, then they compiled a Bible and since then we've had one. The Bible isn't considered necessary to be a Christian, since it wasn't in existence for a long time. It's a great tool though.<br><br>I have read all of it but I focus on the New Testament because that's the one that's specifically for Christians. Plenty of laws from the OT have been abandoned in the New.<br><br>Old and New Covenant made a huge difference. Stoning women and men is part of the change, that's why Christians don't follow the OT, but Christ. I personally don't believe in the OT as coming from God, for reasons cited, so I don't personally believe God ever wanted people getting stoned. I think it was just the Hebrews acting like humans would. But that's me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>interesting, so how do you interpret John 1:1? <br> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. </br></br>  Why do you think it's alright to hate the gay community? Why not just embrace it? The bible says it's okay to own slaves, just as long you don't kill them. Do you think that's alright? Also pic related.  <br>I'm so happy to find a fellow believer on here!</br>  <br><br>Faith in God doesn't mean you don't believe in education. Top kek.</br></br>  <br><br>That's why some things are relevant to science while others are not. Issues of morals are not, while black holes are. It's really not a problem to me to see which belongs to which.</br></br>  <br> I can't look into my heart and see whether this sounds true or not to me, whereas if Christ tells me to love my neighbour as myself, I can look into my heart and see whether I believe the same or not. <br><br>And here we have the crux of the Christian argument - blind faith with no empirical evidence to back it up. It just "feels right" to them. The can "feel" the truth of God in their heart, no matter what evidence points to the contrary. This is why arguing with Christians is pointless. The confirmation bias, cognitive dissonance, and emotional ties to their argument are so powerful within them that no amount of logic or evidence will ever convince them otherwise. <br><br>And the call us the blind ones...</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not OP but fellow Christianon here.<br><br> Why do you think it's alright to hate the gay community? <br>It's not. And that's not what the Bible teaches us. On the contrary, it teaches us to love all, including fags, but hate the sin.<br><br> The bible says it's okay to own slaves, just as long you don't kill them. Do you think that's alright? Also pic related. <br>Like OP has mentioned, much of the OT has been made "outdated" due to the sacrifice Jesus made on the cross. Notice most, if not all, of the arguments that start with "But what about this law ____" usually come from leviticus</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd thank the men before the faith, really. And if it weren't for the other christian sects they may not have been at risk at all, Granted they may also not exist, I sure don't have a way of knowing that. I'm sure there's other cool stuff I'd enjoy that may have existed. All that stuff that people say Tesla wanted to make sounded handy.<br><br><br>And it's because of all the sunburns I get bouncing on big black dicks at the big libtard parties that are part feminist rally, part flag burning lesson, and all male gay orgy in plain view of at least 3 public schools. I keep getting the sunscreen mixed up with the orgy lube and the flag lighter fluid, and it's just a big mess.</br></br></br></br>  <br> How did you come to this conclusion? <br><br>Very simple: I don't think God literally believes the world is a half bubble surrounded by infinite waters, which is how Genesis describes the universe. It's obvious to me that this is the POV of a human and not God, hence, Genesis was written by a human. Either that or God is lying, or wrong. My choice is quickly made between the two options.<br><br>  When the Bible documented the creation of Adam, I don't see why it shouldn't be assumed that this is the first man created; for what other reason would he hold significance over the actual first man created enough to be documented?  <br><br>Genesis doesn't say first man created, just the first made by God. This fits the Jews' idea that they're chosen and special above goys. It's cultural, rather than divine revelation in my opinion.<br><br>We now know that men didn't just appear out of nowhere suddenly. That confirms my understanding that this stuff is mostly cultural and definitely not of God.<br><br> Also, if you believe that Adam and Eve were not the first humans to be created, you surely believe the others created beforehand were also created by God, yes? <br><br>Everything is created by God in my belief, so yes.<br><br>  So why where these humans created ignorant and unaware of the existence of God? And why were they not spoken of explicitly? <br><br>In the Bible? Because the Jews are special snowflakes and etc, but that's just as far as their narrative is concerned. If you mean in the real world, nobody was spoken in direct ways until the Hebrews. Why did God choose them? I guess He needed a selection of people to make the Messiah come out eventually.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It is. You know when people say "I care this much" and they show you a tiny distance between their fingers, or when people extend their arms and say they love you this much, and it's the max space they can cover with their arms? That's what it means. It works because God's sacrifice is indeed the most accurate representation of His love for us.</br></br>  <br><br>This. Jews comment on their sacred text and discuss them a lot, in the Talmud. When Christians just take the Torah and act like nobody questions it, it's foolish. The very people who wrote it discuss it, and for some reason, we're supposed to take it literally and not ask any questions? No.</br></br>  <br><br>I literally have no idea how you connect this with literalism.<br><br>You do know that "the word" is how we translate the logos, right? And that logos, or word, is Christ, right? The Word isn't the Bible, it's the Second Person, God the Son.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Most parts of the Old Testament are the history of the Jews, which you don't need as a Christian. <br><br>Sure - you don't need that history if you're just going to "be a Christian" and believe in Jesus. But if you read the context and history behind Jesus' words (he was well schooled in the Old Testament, obviously) and look at the political climate around his time, everything within the bible makes more sense. <br><br>And by "makes more sense," I mean it becomes easy to see that religion was a man-made concept born out of necessity at the time of it's development, and nothing more. There is nothing at all to suggest that there was an actual, divine intelligence behind it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>American retardation at its finest.<br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logos<wbr>_(Christianity)</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Literalism also doesn't work too well with the fact that you're reading a translation of a text that existed far before the language you're reading it in. I'm sure there were sentiments in the original Aramaic that don't come across in other languages as well. Even today translation errors cause plenty of problems.</br>  <br><br>Your image: Leviticus' rules on eating are cancelled by God through Paul in the New Testament. Most Christians know this much. Paul doesn't cancel homo laws though. You can easily find this for yourself.<br><br>As to the gay community, I don't hate them and I don't endanger them the way the LGBT does. Most homos dislike organisations who claim to speak for them and in fact make their lives worse. Most homo will tell you that they preferred when they weren't used politically, and when marriage was only for heteros, because since the legalisation of homo marriage, homos are more at risk of being attacked and insulted. We can no longer say that homos don't influence your life, country, and law. This puts homos at risk, for virtually nothing. I don't condone using homos for Liberal purposes.<br><br>As to slavery, Americans tend to think it's special. Everybody used slavery, and many slaves led better lives than many employees nowadays.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>amerifag agnost here tl;dr?</br>  <br><br>The typical Roman slave led a better life than the American working class man who has to work 3 jobs to make ends meet.<br><br>The Roman master also treated his slaves better than the average boss treats his employees.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Leviticus 20:13<br>"If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them."<br><br>If you think it means hate the sin you're a dense motherfucker. So if you see a gay couple out in public it's cool to punish them with death? <br>Cuz that's what your bible clearly says.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> And here we have the crux of the Christian argument - blind faith with no empirical evidence to back it up. <br><br>Articles of faith are called thus for a reason. If it's not empirical, you can't use empiricism to test it, obviously, so you take it on faith. For everything else, you use science. Pretty simple to me.<br><br>You must not have read many of my posts.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And if the OT has been deemed outdated, why continue to have it in the bible? Your religion is brainwashing you into thinking those things are good.</br>  Why do you believe this shit? <br>Pic related.</br>  <br><br>Their practices were part of their penance to God, so perfecting beer brewing &amp; wine vinting was their service to their Christian God.<br><br>I'm agnostic I'm just trying to figure out why you hate every single white person alive including yourself.</br></br></br></br>  <br>this was written during the times when fucking animals had to be killed on altars so shit didnt go down. after jesus was sacrificed shit changed</br>  Rationalize this shit.  <br> Literalism also doesn't work too well with the fact that you're reading a translation of a text that existed far before the language you're reading it in. <br><br>I never said I restricted myself to translations. I don't, as a matter of fact. I study the Bible in its original language as well. It takes longer, but it's vital.<br><br>Translation is a big issue here and many experts assume we might be wrong on plenty of things. I believe in that, because I've seen excellent evidence of it.<br><br>It has nothing to do with literalism, however.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Rationalize this.  <br><br>The "Word" is Christ. It's not "the words of the Bible". That's one of the most retarded things I've ever heard about the Bible, but it's the second time I come across it. The Word of God is Jesus Christ, the Second Person of the Trinity.</br></br>  <br>Why is God able to cast judgment on us when we've done wrong? It's not really fair. HE made us the way we are. HE can change us if he'd like. HE can make it so we don't sin. But once we get to heaven god gets to sit there and be like, "hey remember that time in third grade you stole that pencil from your teacher? Yeah...you're boned. Off to hell with you" he could change that if he wanted to. But he doesn't. That's like if I were to bake a cake, I make all the ingredients, I combine them to make a batter, and I put it in the oven. Hour later I take it out and it's mush and I blame the CAKE for it being mush, when it was MY fault, not the cakes.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Why do you hate your European heritage so much? <br><br>What exactly about being white is the bane of your existence?<br><br>Ethnomasochism is sickening, also pathetic.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well i say "outdated" for lack of a better word. It's still useful for helping us understand what was going on before Jesus died on the cross and it helps emphasise the significance of it.</br>  <br> Articles of faith are called thus for a reason. If it's not empirical, you can't use empiricism to test it, obviously, so you take it on faith. <br><br>Pretty convenient, I must say. People (prophets) say "believe in this! I can't prove shit but believe in it because God told me..." and people actually believe in it. <br><br>Making "faith" a key component in salvation was a brilliant move by those who sought to convert followers to their way of life - it's unfalsifiable - there is no argument against it. That's why it evolved in human consciousness to exist as part of religion - it allows people to stay blind to the truth despite all evidence to the contrary. It ALSO has been the source of the bulk of human conflict since the beginning of civilization. And yet people like you still can't see that - you still can't shake it. You still won't wake up. From the bottom of my heart, I pity people like you, and I fear for the future of the human race.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Whether God wanted this or was just thought by Jews to want this, it doesn't change the fact that with the Atonement, God's own sacrifice, it is no longer necessary to stone people to death.<br><br>I personally don't believe God ever wanted this, but even for those who believe in that, it makes perfect sense as to why Christians never practiced stoning. Early Christians never put anybody to death either.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Marcionism is a thing and it almost happened. Gideons' Bibles don't contain the OT.</br></br>  <br>sorry if i sound literally retarded but, uh, why's he called the "Word"?</br>  <br>Nobody who eats bologna or wears blue jeans gives a shit about those laws, They're not relevant to most modern Christians.<br><br>And I'm cautious of Leviticus because a lot of it sounds like general advice for middle eastern living safety.

Things you can't prove are taken on faith because there's no other way to take them.<br><br>Stop acting like it's a cop out to avoid empirical inquiry. The day you can inquire about the Trinitarian nature of God, please call me and we'll watch that documentary together.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Did you know that it says gullible on the ceiling?</br>  <br>Actually, That does make perfect biblical sense. The events on earth are, biblically speaking, Minor and temporary. The important thing is to repent, do better and forgive. Life is kind of a test. Doesn't matter so much facing eternal after life. Sort of like "Real life" really.</br>  <br>But why wouldn't he? If he loves all of his children sooooooo much, why not make it so we can't sin? It's that simple. Why would he want us to go to hell. I knew if ihad children, I wouldn't want them burning in hell forever and always.</br>  <br>Okay.. The amount of ignorance in this response is painful. <br>A perfect being cannot great something imperfect so if it "has cons" then it's not perfect thus it wasn't created by a perfect being. Thus your God didn't make it. So gods not real. <br>"Ultimately the result is alway human"? How the fuck would you know? What evidence do you have to show for that? How do you even arrive at such an assinine proposal?</br></br></br>  <br><br>It's translated as "The Word" because that's what we used to translate the Greek word "Logos", which is a complex concept combining "logic, reason, principle" and plenty of other things familiar to Greek and their philosophy.<br><br>So we translated it by The Word, for lack of a better term, but it's definitely not the word of the Bible!</br></br></br></br>  <br>and i assume you would rather raise a robot, void of sentience instead of a conscious human being</br>  <br>reading comprehension much?<br>pictured post says atheists are masochist cucks</br></br>  <br>If life is a test what's the point? God is all knowing. And he "has a plan" as most Christians say. If that's so then what's the point of the test. He already knows what the outcome will be because he <br>A. Planned it that way, and gods will be done. Or <br>B. Knows all so he already knows your fate. <br><br>Either way there's no point to any of it. And it could have saved a lot of people from hell and horrible lives had he just not created us in the first place. <br><br>Are you saying that's it's gods plan for people to suffer in poor countries? For thousands of children to starve to death every day? For children to get cancer? What the hell kind of God is that?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Things you can't prove are taken on faith because there's no other way to take them. <br><br>Of course - and the "faith" you rely on is the word from bronze age, superstitious writers with none of the science we have today to tell them anything different - who all relied on word of mouth stories in the first place. The faith I rely on is constructed through what we now know to be scientifically supported evidence.<br><br> The day you can inquire about the Trinitarian nature of God, please call me and we'll watch that documentary together. <br><br>Why would this even warrant inquiry? All the solid evidence we have today strongly suggests there is no god - there never was. I certainly don't believe god exists, so why would I be interested in the human-made concept of the trinity?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's a weird assertion, though. If an all powerful entity could do all of this shit I doubt he's limited to the perfect. I mean, What about miscarried babies. That ain't so perfect, It's like a God abortion. I think if he can plan for that he can make shit as imperfect as he wants. Not that I think he did.</br>  <br>Thats the dumbest thing I've heard all day. You can get skin cancer without ever getting a sunburn. <br>In fact, skin cancer is what you get when your body DOESNT react properly. Explain.</br></br>  <br> And I'm cautious of Leviticus because a lot of it sounds like general advice for middle eastern living safety. <br><br>It is. Shellfish back there and then was poisonous. Adultery literally threatened the entire tribe because STDs were rampant, with no cure, and fucking around meant the death of many and the inability for active Jews to defend the tribe against invaders. A small fraction of diseased men and you were at a serioud disadvantage to defend everybody. Also, Jews believed sperm remained active for a year in a vagina, combined with the extremely important notion of lineage, and you get rules that seem extreme to us, but weren't at the time.</br></br></br>  <br><br>That child's sin will also be forgiven. Going by your logic, nobody can be forgiven of anything and everybody goes to hell.</br></br>  <br>You don't get it do you? <br>A perfect thing cannot, by nature created something that's imperfect. Something cannot do what's not in its nature to do. <br><br>If God is all powerful then can he create a rock so heavy he cannot lift? If he can then he's not all powerful because he cannot lift it. If he can't then he's not all powerful because he could make the rock. And if he's not all powerful then he's not a god.</br></br></br></br>  How would you respond if you were asked where god came from?I grew up in a religious household and this has always boggled my mind.  <br>That child's sin? Are you serious you think a three year old little boy has sinned? Are you fucking serious? Listen man.. Please do not reproduce and spread your nonsense to the youth of whatever nation you're from.</br>  <br>Well, There's free will. If god ever could see the future that may stick a pin in it. I don't know, though. I'm just saying that the biblical model looks like a test. "You have free will, Don't use it how I say not to or you can't come up to the awesome place with me and my rad son and your grandparents and childhood dog."<br><br>But you're pretty much right. Even if you believe this stuff there's no getting around that beyond god there's no point. He "Always has been and always will be" so he invented the concept of holding a magnifying glass over some ants to melt them to kill time and we're the ants. And time may be infinite or fake. Life begins painfully, hopefully doesn't hurt too much for a while, ends painfully, then who knows? I don't.</br></br></br>  <br>What about the "no clothes made from two different types of cloth" thing? I always wondered why that came about.</br>  <br>The concept of original sin kinda means we all come into the world as sinners. Also, if you dont want to believe that, lying begins when theory of mind is developed which can happen as early as at year 3.</br>  <br><br>Top kek.<br><br> have you ever spoken to the Big Bang face to face? </br></br></br></br>  <br>Actually you misunderstood. I'm saying that with God there is no point. Without God there is a point. <br>Free will? <br>So up.. I walk up to you on the street with a gun, and I tell you "give me everything you own and if you even THINK about not doing it I'll torture you for the rest of your life" <br>Does that seem to make sense? Am I really giving you a choice? Is that really what free will is? A being that is willing and does punish people for thought crimes is not worthy of being called a god or being treated as one. He's just a dick. I didn't ask to think those things.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I get your assertion, dude. I just don't agree with it. If there is a perfect and all powerful thing, Which is pretty unlikely, I don't think they'd be limited to create perfect things. <br><br>Then again, Because this perfect thing super doesn't exist, We're both pissing in the wind, Both of our points are impossible to test, and don't amount to anything.<br><br>So, like. I don't know. Let's all just so have sex with something.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Different issue entirely. You're just dodging the fact that the texts we have today are the same they had centuries and centuries ago.</br></br>  <br>We have evidence for the Big Bang. That's the difference. We can actually "see" the Big Bang. <br>You don't have any evidence at all for the existence of your God.</br></br>  <br>kek</br>  <br> But why wouldn't he? If he loves all of his children sooooooo much, why not make it so we can't sin? It's that simple. <br><br>Freedom is more important. You wouldn't force your wife to stay with you by force if you truly loved her, you'd want her to stay because she wants to. Same with God and us. <br><br>Hell isn't what you think, at all. It's a place God made so we could have the choice of not being with Him.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Actually I wasn't the guy you were arguing with. If that's your assertion, I don't deny it. But my point was that these original texts are far from perfect - they reek of what they are, which is oral tales told by men many times over until they were actually written down... by men. Nothing divine whatsoever.</br>  <br> A perfect being cannot great something imperfect <br><br> great, create <br><br>Yes it can. There's no logic there. A perfect gardener can make a shitty garden if he wants. You're an English speaker, you can write a shitty sentence if you want. The point is that humanity's imperfection came about because of humanity's ability to choose, not because God decided we'd be imperfect. Big difference.<br><br> "Ultimately the result is alway human"? How the fuck would you know? What evidence do you have to show for that? How do you even arrive at such an assinine proposal? <br><br>Basic biology:<br><br> any species able to hold something between its limbs is more likely to develop technology <br><br> limbs closer to face will develop into hands <br><br> opposable thumbs <br><br> technology <br><br> eventually, humanoids is always the shape it comes to <br><br> front limbs busy manipulating technology, hinder limgs become legs <br><br>Even dinosaurs had taken that path. Given enough time, you always end up with humanoids and as soon as they can handle tools, you get technology and those beings become master of every other species.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So does believing in invisible thing. <br>Oriniginal sin is bullshit. A just God wouldn't punish someone for their ancestors mistakes.</br></br>  <br><br>You hate yourself because the sun harms your skin? <br><br>Seems a little pathetic.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Look, I'm an atheist too, but where in the hell do you get the idea that something perfect can't create something imperfect? There is no logic behind that at all. A "perfect" being, by definition, would make no mistakes - but it could create imperfect creatures if it intended to do so.</br>  <br>Yeah, I dig the Epicurus vibe you're on but I don't happen to think that the absence of God somehow imbibes life with any objective meaning either. The objective meaning of life, boiled down, is make more of us. And we've got 7 billion, man. Cheee-eck! Done. <br><br>The only current meaning of life is to serve the ego and try not to fuck over your peers in ego while you're at it. There's nothing wrong with that, of course. Plenty of people's ego compels them to do awesome shit like feed the hungry and climb mountains. Maybe even go to other planets some day and put hungry people there to feed and climb their mountains, too. It's all good, We win nature, It'll be hard to get rid of us.<br><br>I mean, Unless you pull out one of those things that are hundreds of times bigger and older than human civilization. Then it'd be pretty easy, We can't deal with those just yet. Soon, though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it was in a documentary but whatever floats your boat</br>  <br>This is all I have to say to that. You're a fucking creationist fucktard and you're the reason this country is a shit whole now.</br>  New question. How could one tell the difference between a universe created by an intelligent being, and a universe created through only naturalistics means?  <br>You have no idea how evolution works and until you figure it the fuck out avoid talking about it. You're just making yourself look stupid.</br>  <br>Relevant story of what happened to me these past 2 days.<br><br>So I just went to Disney Land today and yesterday.<br>I took my wife and kids, and we had fun the whole day. Even the hotel was great, free food, small gym, etc. The thing is I was wondering why all the adults in the park kept looking at me weird. At first at thought maybe it was because I didn't shave, and now it looks like a short pirate's beard. Then afterwards I realized why... I was wearing a shirt that was of a death core band, and it was White Chapel. The worst part is that, today I yet again unknowingly did it. This time I wore the shirt of Burn The Priest (now known as Lamb Of God). Today I was stopped several times, and people pf course keep bringing up religion. "Jesus and anti Christian this and that, Allah and his messenger blah blah blah". Like damn, there are so many crazy religious people there. I just responded with either "Burn the priest" or with "God is dead/isn't real". My wife realized this yesterday, and she didn't say anything because, she was too busy laughing at me.<br>Oh wait, here's the best part. I was threatened to be kicked out of the part, just a few times by Disney employees.<br><br>So /b/ how has your day been?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, The libtard orgy-flag-burn-emism-meet-n-greet-a<wbr>nd-suck-off-black-dicks-a-thon happens in the summer, man. None of the black guys have this problem. And the feminists are protected by the UV-blocking visible green clouds that their permanent scowls and barren nethers emit.</wbr></br>  <br>That's essentially the same argument as "you can't prove there is no god." It's not provable one way or the other, so it's basically a senseless question to ask, as it proves nothing.</br>  <br>hey i think this is an interesting perspective ive never seen before<br><br>just interested to know more, so what do you think about adam's sin and how its theorised to have brought death into the world? and do you think the other humans living before, and at the same time, as adam and eve had been tempted to sin similarly by the serpent? and do you think they were sinners by the time adam sinned?</br></br></br>  why r u bein cunty?  <br> He already knows what the outcome will be <br><br>I don't believe in that. The future doesn't exist, God can't know what doesn't exist. Simple.</br></br></br>  <br>You didn't realize you wore that shirt to Disneyland. That's your story? <br><br>OK. Either didn't happen, or you wore it just to get the reaction you got. Hurrdurr.</br></br></br>  <br> Of course - and the "faith" you rely on is the word from bronze age <br><br>You should look up "bronze age" before parroting Hitchens... Seriously.<br><br>And no, Trinity, for instance, doesn't date back this far, at all.<br><br>Stop twisting things to your advantage when you don't even know what you're talking about.<br><br> Why would this even warrant inquiry?  <br><br>Because it's an important part of Christian theology. You still don't get what "article of faith" means, eh?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You must have missed the part where Christians believe we live in a fallen world.</br></br>  <br> A perfect thing cannot, by nature created something that's imperfect. <br><br> a perfect shoemaker can't make a not perfect shoe <br><br> a perfect shoe cannot be made to be less perfect through use <br><br>Logic!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because it's not in the perfect beings nature to create something imperfect. <br>Again if God is all powerful then can he create a rock so heavy that he cannot lift it? If so then he's not all powerful because he cannot lift it. If he can't then he's not all powerful because he can't make the rock. <br><br>The argument to that thought problem is that it's not in his nature to do so. That it's not in his nature to do something like that. God doesn't do things out of his nature thus if God is perfect them is out of his nature to create something imperfect. That's the point. Listen I've spend to years, openly atheist, at a baptist university. I've heard and refuted every argument in the books.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>First Cause, God doesn't "come from" anywhere, because He is the only reality and has been before time itself. There is no beginning or end in God, He isn't like our physical universe.<br><br>It's like asking where the line begins, when the line goes around a sphere.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Finally someone gets it!!! Someone understands why there's no arguing with these people.</br>  <br><br>I seriously forgot to pay any attention to what I was wearing. So yeah that was very stupid of me, but at least my wife got a kek out of it. So I guess that's good.</br></br>  what does /b/ think of my beard?  <br>Looks bretty ok.<br><br>Are you a Chechen insurgent?</br></br></br>  The adventures of mr skeltal (Jim), part 2.

There are two problems with these:<br><br>1) They are almost by definition theories that can never be proven or falsified, and thus are not true theories in the scientific sense. They're just neat ideas. The reason that they can't be proven or disproven is that our laws of physics are simply inapplicable in the conditions that would be required for the theories to be true, and so you can't use those laws to prove the theories.<br><br>2) They really only push back the question a bit further. Ultimately the whole framework for universes, multiverses, singularities, and so forth had to come from somewhere. The very system under which something can come from nothing under certain circumstances... that framework itself had to come from somewhere. To say that that framework came from nothing just pushes the question back again: whence came the framework that allows a framework to come from nothing?</br></br></br></br></br>      <br>God has always existed</br>  <br>holy shit!</br>  <br>It's like saying "God did it"<br><br>Checkmate atheists</br></br></br>  Heaven goes in all fields.  <br>Do religious fags honestly belive that God appeared out of nothing in nowhere and created it all in a few days out of nothing?</br>  WHAT IS YOUR ENDGAME?? You fuck! I just want to break that little girl's teeth now!  <br>Not this shit again.</br>  <br><br>This argument is retarded. I bet your one of those idiots who think pretending to be an idiot is funny, when in reality it just makes you an idiot.</br></br>  <br>This</br>  <br>I honestly have no clue. <br><br>I think that's the greatest challenge of the human species to find out. <br><br>To find out how everything started from the very beginning, that is. <br><br>What do you guys think our biggest challenge is, if any at all?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So explain what the hell created god then?

It has been a very long time since monotheists believed that the only explanation for natural phenomena was God. Some of those "gaps" remain for many believers though: the soul or mind being at least somewhat independent of the brain, for example. However, there is one natural "gap" that is the most important of all. It's the one that all of the others really boil down to: how did this all get here? And we're back to the frameworks question that you replied to.<br><br>What most religion is chiefly concerned with, however, and has been for millennia are not explanations for the "gaps" but the questions that science does not and probably cannot get into. The "whys" and the "therefor whats." I think that religion has a very sound role in those as well as in that question of our ultimate origin.</br></br></br>  <br>Believers would say that by definition God is supernatural. That the characteristic of arising from nothing and from no framework allowing something-from-nothing is inherently supernatural and impossible for our minds to understand. The universe is by definition natural, not supernatural.<br><br>I know that won't satisfy your overall objection with the concept of a supernatural creator, but hopefully I've answered your question.</br></br></br>  <br>Most children discard silly beliefs when they grow up and realize humans are all fucked up... and just use (well intentioned) religious books as a way to control people for their own agenda</br>  <br> science has no business trying to figure out religion <br> any attempt at proving GOD or religion true or false just shows how little you understand the concept of GOD and religion <br><br>you are so fucking delusional.<br><br>so let me get this straight:<br><br> Man decides one day that GOD is the answer to the ultimate question <br> No research or proof or any critical thinking can show you that this is the answer or even a possible answer.. <br><br> ...but trust me, it definitely makes sense. <br><br>I'm sorry we dont have all the answers. <br>I'm sorry you have to die one day. <br>having an imaginary friend that not only makes you understand the orgins of the universe, but will also give you eternal life will definitely make it easier for you to cope, so keep your delusions anon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>so if it's supernatural, how do we even know of him? Provided that humans cannot transcend to whatever "supernatural plane" GOD exists on, what and how has this supernatural being done in the natural world to make us aware of his presence?<br><br>in other words, how do we know that GOD is even a thing?</br></br></br>    <br>Oh, Anon, if that's what you took away from the discussion of the impossibility of proving or falsifying ideas about the origin of the multiverse then you really are a mediocre thinker.

This will piss off their racist base to no end. And they still will never get my or other democrats votes cause of all the other fucked up shit they do. Best of both worlds. Fuck them hope they go the way of the whigs.  <br>There are only 2 parties that anyone seems to care about in the USA therefore they have to appeal to the median voter if they actually want to win. The same dude who is pissed off about this isn't going to suddenly vote for Hillary Clinton or Bernie sanders, he is going to vote for the repub if he votes at all.</br>  <br>what dumbasses like to forget is that isnt the confederate flag and at the time of the confederacy, the south was entirely democrat.</br>  <br>Yeah and don't forget how all of them flew wholesale into the republicans open arms during and after the civil rights movment. Rethugs were looking for votes and pandered. This is why all the rejects and dead enders are rethugs to this day.</br>  <br>Well, yes.<br>It's a shitty flag, a sybol of a cause lost both on the battle field and in society. They wanted to lower the value of humans to that of cattle, and somehow lost.<br><br>The annals of time is what takes it down really. Even if the south rises again it will only mean a greater fall.</br></br></br></br>  <br>the GOP have totally sold out everyone with conservative values. stupid shit with the flag is just a metaphor</br>  <br>no they didnt</br>  <br><br>Of course they did, Democrats were the ones who put it up back in the 1860's.</br></br>  New trap thread ...  <br>Moar/sauce/whodat?<br><br>Also, anyone remember that webm of that trap with vibrators to his nipples, and his panties were soaked with precum?<br><br>Anyone got a sauce for that? I'm not really into traps if I can notice they are a guy (apart from the dick) but that webm gets me fucking hard every time. Dying for more.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a bdsm thing OR it's because some of the transgirls really don't like it when you try to play with their junk. <br><br><br>You're a retard.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Reminds me of Aubrey Plaza</br>  should i pierce my nipples, /b/?  <br>Have you ever heard of mammary glands ? What the fuck is wrong with this moron ?<br><br>Fat tits won't jiggle much as compared to skinny tits with bigger mammary glands.<br>Fat tits will sag because they weight more, they will also feel less softer whereas natural ones whose glands are more developed will bounce.</br></br></br></br>  <br>reroll</br>  <br>refer to this post faggot<br><br>and join this faggot on your quest for faggotary<br/></br></br></br>  draw thread  <br>Something with Redstripes. <br><br>All I really remember is some shit went down, she lost her powers, killed her siblings, got new powers from there souls and is trying to take over where Overlad left off.
