[ If you live anywhere in the US east coast, get out now. There is going to be a massive tsunami in the next few years and it will turn Florida into modern day Atlantis. This tsunami will destroy everything and everyone on the east coast all the way to the mountains. Get out of the east coast.<br><br>Another thing that will happen is that there is going to be a nuclear war between the U.S. and Russia. The entire North American continent is going to go through drastic changes and millions will die.<br><br>During this time, there will be a few cities you can take refuge in while God pours his vengeance on the U.S. There will be a massive asteroid storm that will also kill millions, and the lower Mississippi River will spread out. During this time of sadness, many of you will go to Christians to seek help.<br><br>Believe me or don't believe me. Either way it will happen.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>remember everyone... sage goes in all fields</br>  <br>lol no<br><br>3/10 made me reply</br></br></br>  <br>but i can't swim op</br>  I feel like you microwave bunnies OP  <br>So is texas safe</br>  s/fur with cute animals  <br>no</br>      <br>-&gt; /gay/ faggot.</br>  <br>yes</br>  Gerald wants food.
