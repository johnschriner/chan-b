[ **Public Service Announcement**<br><br>Stop fucking with inferior lube! KY, Olive oil, throw it all out!<br><br>COCONUT OIL!<br><br>Coconut oil as a multi-purpose, unicorn-like ingredient isn’t a new or revolutionary discovery. But what is new is the realization that the best smelling stuff on earth can also be used during sexy times as an organic, yummy alternative to drugstore lube brands. Not only does it feel, taste and smell good, but it’s good for you too! It’s moisturizing, anti-fungal and anti-bacterial which means it does a great job at preventing yeast infections. <br><br>Important tip: Don’t use coconut oil (or any oil for that matter) with latex condoms. It’ll weaken the latex and result in tears in breaks. <br><br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/625145212#p625145212">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You mean nigger oil you stupid fuck.</br>  <br>Do you sell that stuff or why the announcement?<br><br>I myself found coconut oil last year and I use it everyday.<br>I got allergic to deodorant and now use coconut oil. I never smelled better, even after a whole day and a half of working and sweating a lot. <br>Also coconut oil is the most healthiest oil around to eat and lose fat. If mixed with rice you only take up 2/3 from the calories.<br><br>So: I don't understand why you post this on /b/, but I share your celebration of coconut oil!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Feet thread<br><br>Bonus for young<br><br>Bonus for cum<br><br>.gif's and .webm's welcome</br></br></br></br></br></br>                                      ay    lmao    <br>Dat skill doe, I love when white girls milk them mulatto-black cocks with their toes.</br>  http://goatse.me/hai2u.php  Anyone here into dirty stinky feet?

I just have to be mindful to not ask her every single time I have some spare time with her to wear a diaper.</br></br></br></br>      <br>I love being diapered and wear one every chance I get, but it just felt boring and stupid when my gf would wear one too. And so not wanting to detract from the good times, I asked her not to do it. <br>Sounds stupid, but it's how I am.</br></br>  <br>i get it.<br><br>i'm in the wearing mood every once in a while.<br>One time i got my gf to change me and check on me a couple times. that was pretty amazing, maybe try that.</br></br></br></br>    <br>I can't get enough of her changing me, and teasing me, but the moment she wants to wear too, I start to hate it. <br>Somehow she feels like she is supporting me by wearing (her own words). It doesn't matter now, cause we don't talk much.</br></br>  <br>wait so she changed you all the time, and then she got so into it she wanted to wear herself?<br><br>or am i just misconstruing shit now?</br></br></br>  <br>She changed me all the time, but she got the idea into her head that I would like it more if she wore too (because of certain pictures I had on my computer)</br>  <br>ah, okay. well she must have been a pretty fucking cool girl then.<br><br>anyway, why didn't you just tell her you wouldn't like that?</br></br></br>  anyone got a link to a functioning onion site on this?  <br>I did, and she understood. She was so awesome. <br><br>Treating me like a little kid turned her on like nothing else. <br>We would always have the best sex afterwards. Wearing a diaper and having sex is a great experience.<br><br>Thanks for the pics too, anon</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Requesting diapers full of shit    who lurking?      <br>I think this will satisfy your need.</br>      <br>Me.<br><br>I'd contribute but I can't find the cable for my external hard drive</br></br></br>    <br>I get it now</br>  Once my gf forced me to mess myself, then made me wait 20 minutes for her to mix a cake before she changed me. Sitting around watching cartoons in a soiled diaper is actually quite nice.<br><br>What's your experiences guys? Best/worst? Any participants? Age you started? Age you accepted yourself?</br></br>  anyone else fantasize about being forced into pink diapers?  <br>ive always wanted a gf to diaper me, or have a girl to diaper, or both... <br><br>does your gf ever just rub the front of your diaper?</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, sometimes she'll rub me gently and say "You're far too young for this, but we'll keep it mummy's little secret. M'kay?"</br>  <br>mmmm...moar, does she tease your hard cock while ur diapered?</br>  <br> "You're far too young for this, but we'll keep it mummy's little secret.

DO EEEETTT!</br>  <br> see her twice <br> she says she loves you <br><br>Borderline personality red flag. Enjoy the ride, but be prepared to wake up to her cutting your dick off.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This!</br>  Tell her you love her to and that you want to fack her in the ass and if she really loves you she will suck a big nigger dick cause it makes you really horny to the point you'll love to suck her shit out her ass.  <br>Op here. Anal win already. First night.</br>  <br>This.<br><br>haha<br>I certainly enjoyed the ride.<br>Now I'm poor, in a low paying job in a country I never intended to be in with all my previous opportunities erased, and my health failing.<br><br>Only took 3 years.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dude, that's a Fucking red flag right there</br>  <br>Definitely Borderline Red Flag. Watch out for the break up it gets toxic as fuck and big potential for stalking. Don't invest too much into her because she will demand you focus only on her and cut you off from other girls and friends really quick.</br>  Impregnate her  <br>Yeah I did wonder when she asked me to. But was pretty drunk so thought no more of it.</br>  Tell her you love her almost as much as you love her body. <br>Coax her into sending the n00dz.<br>Post here.<br>Dipset.<br><br>Not too hard of a task,</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Borderline girls are way more trouble than they are worth. They use emotional black mail a lot, and self harm when you don't do what they say. They're highly manipulative and controlling. Not to mention when they split their opinion about you and hate you one day, then adore you the next.</br>  Op here. Major update.  <br>Yup. See pic below.</br>  <br>Holy fuck, she is splitting already? She is worse than the one I dated.</br>  <br>supreme kek</br>  Dubs decides what I say next.  Send her my snapchat. Yakob1234 <br>I'll make sure she ends up with someone her age that will use her better than you ever did.</br>  <br>hahahah<br>hjahah<br>hahaha<br><br>Yeah, that's borderline.<br>borderline is short for borderline psychopath - and it fits.<br><br>Only found it so funny because I am this guy </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Back to 9fag with you.</br>  <br>Take my advice you'll want to block this bitch and cease all contact. These types of girls are toxic as fuck and will make your life shit. Sure it may look like funny drama at first, but they always escalate the shit to dangerous levels.</br>  <br>Fuck her right in the Lissy<br><br>Then... GTFO</br></br></br>  <br>Where is her Lissy?</br>  <br>Where do all these fucking nutjob bitches come from?<br><br>It is like they step out of a factory, designed to ruin men's lives.<br>Noone warned me about these before I encountered one - and it took me quite a while to figure out what it was - during that time I thought I was going crazy.<br><br>Made me think about the cartoon where only one guy keeps seeing the dead frog stand up and start dancing with a hat and cane "hello my darling, hello my honey, hello my good time gal!" - then flops down dead whenever anyone else looks or is in the room.<br>Everyone else saw her as normal, and she only ever showed one face to them.<br><br>With me she split into two different people.<br>I was hallucinating at one point after a month of it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>On my goddamn phine that Lukes to autocorrect everythung</br>  <br>Op here. Fucking hell dude! I think I'm gonna have to do an Iron Maiden and Run to the fucking hills.</br>  <br>They fuck with your head really well. I wasn't warned about them either until I dated one. It was a living hell. She didn't start splitting until a week and I wondered why she'd suddenly be pissed off at me for no reason. She constantly found reasons to get mad at me.<br><br>So I would back off, then she would accuse me of leaving her. I was constantly frustrated and wanting to smack a bitch.<br><br>The longer I stayed with her the more she fucked with my head as you said. I started to wonder if I was going crazy becasue my parents liked her, and my friends said she was a catch.<br><br>Eventually i broke up with her, she would text me for about a year before I changed my number. Then I got a new girlfriend, and she showed up at her place of work threatening her.<br><br>It just doesn't end with them unless you ignore them right out from the start once you notice the red flag.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this. It's pretty simple.</br>  <br>fuck off jakob</br>  <br>Bad idea, read the lyrics</br>  <br>Would be the smartest move you've made for your life so far.</br>  In the words of Duncan Bannatyne. Im out!  <br>keep us updated or let dubs decide OP</br>  <br>Send her this. It will buy you some time. <br>You don't have to be rude <br>You don't have to dodge the question. Keeping your dominance. <br><br>Works every time. <br><br>Once she hits you with the girlfriend stuff you gotta go though. <br><br>Enjoy the ride, anon</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Op here. I said duds decide.</br>  <br>Pump dat rump and be the baws. Seems to have a nice figure but Im sure you will get bored eventually.</br>  <br><br><br> dubspeak </br></br></br>  <br>Mine has lasted 3 years and is coming to a slow, depressing end.<br>I ignored the red flags at the start - thinking it was just a quirk, like you said - they are mind game machines.<br><br>I almost broke up with her several times - but something kept me there or pulled me back.<br>She played the "you'll leave me" for months and months - I had to keep reassuring her - then she'd spin around and be a monster, then back to being an angel.<br><br>It's psychological torture/conditioning.<br><br>Unfortunately I was isolated from all my friends for the long beginning - was out the country - so I didn't have anyone to help me see reason.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Whats the difference between a dishwasher and a teenager<br>One of them doesnt follow you around for a week after you drop a load in it,<br>Get out OP, shits flagging mad red...</br></br></br>    <br>Yeah, and seeing the shit advice in this thread I worry for OP. He'll be another to tell the tale of his adventure with a Borderline. <br><br>They are shit to men, and usually have other men in their pocket while they are dating you doing the same thing.<br><br>I think it's their manipulation and almost innocent facination with love that makes them addicting. The thing is they are emotional vampires and suck every ounce you have out of you.<br><br>I'm not surprised by the depressing end. My end was more volatile, I had to call the cops because she wouldn't leave my front door and started to camp there until I took her back.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  "Whatever, I'm already earning big money on you through the internet. ;)"  <br><br><br>The dubwhisperer</br></br></br>  <br>Rolling for that</br>  Listen I'm just afraid you won't like my fetish....<br>I need to listen to TOTO's africa while you rub your pink zone like a Disc Jockey and you stare right into my eyes while flaring your nostrils.</br>  <br>look Abbie, what you said really threw me off the other because I have been burnt before.

It was a long beginning.<br><br>Really weird - they fit their profiles so precisely.<br>Seems like you've thought it over quite a bit.<br><br>To make my story more complicated - she was a lesbian when I met her, and stayed with her girlfriend (who she described as - "I haven't seen her for months and things haven't been going well" to start with) - for 10 months after. I thought I was being patient, doing the right thing, believing in love, sacrificing and so on.<br>In truth I was just demolishing myself, or allowing myself to be demolished.<br><br>Wasn't healthy at all.<br><br>Funny thing was, I had always conciously avoided girls with bad personality traits, rudeness to other people and so on before. Don't know why I let my guard down with this one - she must be really really clever.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Well, I tried to warn OP, now I'll stay to watch the show haha  <br>dump the bitch she seems like a nut job</br>  <br>https://www.facecutes.com/Abbie</br>  Filmed it, imma fap over it now  <br>youve hit the jack pot, enjoy it while it lasts.</br>  Well babe, the thing is<br>I only make girls that let me fuck them in the ass my girlfriend</br>  <br>hahahaha <br>If OP isn't careful, he'll be posting on here a year or three from now - saying "my life is a complete mess, I feel like killing myself - I have no family or friends left - lost all my money and my girlfriend is sleeping around but she won't admit it - she says I don't matter to her anymore, what should I do"</br></br>  abbie.wood.56?fref=ts is her FB<br><br>thank me later</br></br>  <br>Weird website</br>  <br>It's their learned personality traits. They literally learn manipulative behavioural traits to draw in a victim. They basically emulate the ideal and make it into their personality.<br><br>They've already got a disrupted sense of self to begin with so they adopt traits and "think" it's who they are. Then their real self emerges after awhile. <br><br>They're so good at manipulating they manipulate themselves while manipulating you. So they come off truthful. We might have sensed it from the start, but chose not to trust our gut.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>just ignore her from now on. You will get a text saying she loves you today or tomorrow, so you can fuck her again.

Absolute utter shithole, with no redeeming factors.<br><br>Why is the cunt in the comments talking like a nigger?</br></br></br>      let's go OP  <br>A smart man would milk this shit for all it's worth - she is pretty much a blank canvas, in other words, your fuck-toy. don't beta and all will be well, who knows maybe in 3 months time you will be wrist deep in her asshole. just an idea.</br>  too easy OP  <br>OP's girl is cute</br>  <br>That was what happened with me.<br>I ignored my gut so many times - in pursuit of holding onto what I thought was true love.<br><br>Instead, it seems it was a siren - projecting the image of whatever I wanted to see or feel - I dunno.<br><br>I read somewhere about bpds, that they will leave you wondering whether they ever loved you at all.<br><br>There should be mandatory warnings for men about these things - from childhood.<br>"These are the signs to watch for".</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Or - "My girlfriend just kicked me out and is sleeping with another girl - I'm in the street in a strange city with no friends for thousands of miles"</br>  <br>Heh.

This is a perfect opportunity for OP to get nudes and post them, don't fuck this up morons.  <br>Yeah. I shouldn't have watched so much shit on television.</br>  <br>that'd be quite rude my friend</br>  <br><br>this</br></br>  <br>To easy? I don't really think he was trying to hide her.</br>  <br>I agree about the 'Did they ever love you at all' I got that feeling as well. <br><br>Siren is quite right, the reflect back to you want you want in a girl to hold you in place.

Fuck her and move on, change number!</br></br>  <br>yeah<br><br>the only times she really came close to me were right in the beginning - then after 9-10 months i decided enough was enough, and distanced myself, planned to leave - take a flight and disappear - then suddenly she became really loving and affectionate - and some sad events happened - so I stuck around.<br><br>i was waiting for the train to go to the airport, the flight was paid for and 2 hours away from happening - then i thought, i can't leave her like that, she was so sad.<br>went back - missed my flight, and the rollercoaster went on.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  It's too late OP, she'll have pizzas at her doorstep soon. It's time to block her.    <br>You stuck your dick in crazy didnt you? What would happen if the roles were reversed and you did that to a girl you hooked up with? Theyd fucking run.

They suck you in, they go back to their usual false self and continue the cycle again. It's why we get sucked in.

I have a sister with a bad case of BPD, and I'm mildly BPD too.

As I had no idea what it was - I kept believing that her real self would emerge and be victorious, that by being consistently loving towards her - and making her feel safe that I would never leave - that she would feel safe enough to stay herself.<br><br>By the time she did show some long term affection and behaved more like a normal person, I was already half cut off from her inside - eventually I told her, and broke her all over again. Things weren't the same after that.<br><br>Finally last autumn, I accepted a job abroad - things went down after that - but the distance thing stressed me out even more and caused me health problems which might be permanent.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>snatchchat = abbielouisew<br><br>send dickpics</br></br></br>  <br>shes on u because u have money and nobody at her age has shit cuz they still work at maccas<br><br>It's dead obvious, just be straight up sex only cuz u cant have a relationship atm make up a shit reason</br></br></br>  <br> You're just entitled twats there is a difference. <br>t. armchair psychiatrist.<br>Fuck off cunt.

Rather rip my eyes off and play soccer with them</br>    Hey /b/ I dunno what the deal is buy my teeth are fucking killing me. <br>All of my teeth in the front row are causing my head to pound non stop. <br>I brush twice a day and have a normal dental record. <br>It's almost as if i'm chewing on aluminium foil all day.<br>Any ideas?</br></br></br></br>  Jews  <br>I fucking knew it. <br>God damn kikes</br></br>  Dentist  <br>Pharmafag here.<br><br>Do you take any meds?<br><br>Is your nose blocked? Do you have a cold or something?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Seriously nothing out of the ordinary and no meds. <br>Ate a popsicle last night to check if my teeth were just abnormally sensitive, but everything really does seem fine. <br>It's not a gum issue either it's like a piercing pain through all of my teeth.</br></br></br>  <br>How long has this been going on? Stressed out a lot lately? I'm thinking about maybe grinding your teeth or blocking your jaw during sleep. See if your jaw muscles are relaxed or not atm.<br><br>Alternatively, do you still have your wisdom teeth?</br></br></br>  <br>probably a week or so. It's just now really starting to bother me.<br>Inb4 vapelife fag or what have you, but my ecig makes it ten times worse. <br>I don't grind my jaw or lock it during my sleep(to my knowledge)<br>Still have the wisdoms.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Then it could be something as simple as the wisdom teeth growing out. The pain starts out as a mild annoyance and then goes up into fullbown HOLY SHIT territory. Though that doesn't really fit with the ecig thing but with me being just behind a computer, that's all I can do.<br>Did you smoke a lot before switching on the ecig? Smoking isn't exactly good for your teeth either. <br><br>Anyhow, my advice is to get a visit at the dentist. Meanwhile you can take something with ibuprofen if you know you don't have sensitivities to it ( like stomach ulcers or kidney problems). 400 mg 3x a day with meals to start. If ibuprofen is not sufficient, you can also take some paracetamol but not at the same time (leave an hour between paracetamol and ibuprofen and 4 hours between every gram of paracetamol). <br>Don't take aspirin. <br><br>When you have your appointment, avoid the ibuprofen since it can make you bleed harder, just take the paracetamol. <br><br>Keep watching yourself for signs of fever, and if you have one, deff tell the dentist. It might be an infection.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was a heavy smoker before but I havent had a smoke in a year. <br>It isn't my wisdoms that hurt tho. Canines and front teeth are on fire. <br>Dentists scare the shit out of me so i'm sure i'll put it off for a while.</br></br></br>  bumping to make sure anon sees this  <br>your wisdom teeth themselves don't always hurt so much, it's the teeth that are being pushed out of place that can be really annoying. <br><br>Anyhow, still try to visit your dentist, mate. Getting fake teeth is a lot more expensive.</br></br></br>  <br>Also just noticed sucking in air while making the bubba face stings a fuck ton. It feels like my teeth are hollow. <br>I'll givem a ring.</br></br>  <br>ah, maybe your gums are retracting a bit, leaving the collar unprotected. <br><br>Stuff you can try:<br>Switch to "sensitive teeth" toothpaste and a very soft toothbrush. It might help as well.<br>Avoid acidic shit (soft drinks, juice, coffee).</br></br></br></br></br>  Okay anon, pharmafag here, got to run.

I think she was a bit ashamed when I told her I didn't really want to...
