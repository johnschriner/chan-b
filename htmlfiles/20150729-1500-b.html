I haven't been on a draw thread in 2 months and there is weird fetishism everywhere  <br>spits between the boards, and a few spamers</br>  <br>Drawthreads are full of cancer/tuba spam right now. Sucks to try to draw in that. I took an almost two month break and came back to threads that give me a headache just to fucking look at</br>  <br>The spammers scared them all off.</br>  <br>we need to go deeper</br>    I find it more fun to draw in a cartoony manner instead of the typical anime artist so that's why I use it more on draw threads.<br><br>Is it less work? yeah but at least that means that I will be able to fulfill nice requests faster.</br></br>  <br>NP <br><br><br> her <br> she <br><br><br>Shitposting on other boards/skype/irc/steam/other chans.<br><br><br>Dreams do come true.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Welp.

I used to try and save at least 2-3 of every drawfag. But I slacked since I never come here anymore.</br>  <br> that does not mean that they did not improve <br>dude. Some people don't improve.

How much money to spend?  why the fuck would anyone need to hide a car  <br>he didn't give a time limit. I'd say next to none since he seemed to be saying you couldn't just pay someone to make it disappear</br>  Best bet is to sell it to a nigger in coontown.  dump it in the deepest water you can find, preferably the most remote. of course use common sense.  <br>1. Drive to river with matches and gasoline<br>2. Remove license plates<br>3. Pour gasoline on interior<br>4. Let burn for 45 minutes.<br>5. Push into river.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>no idea lol. He's a mechanic so I assume he knows something I don't</br>  <br>That would get rid of the Vin? Seems to easy</br>  <br> Go to the ghettos. Preferably remote from your place <br> remove ID plate <br> leave door open and key on car. <br><br>Done.</br></br></br></br></br>  ooo if he's a mechanic say to take it apart and scatter the remains  <br>Yeah, I could get behind this. Flaming car might draw some attention, though. Also, you'd have to wait, what, 24 hours before it was cool enough to touch. Also, I hope you brought a friend, cause when the fires out, the tires will have melted and now you're going to have to get those coagulated, anvil shaped tires to rotate and push that sucker into the water.</br>  <br>just like a body.<br><br>strip it. dump smaller parts, fender, seats, etc in random places. cut up frame. you need a place to do it though, and a little time. i work at a body shop i could get that bitched stripped down in a day.</br></br></br>  Sell it to a mechanic so they part it out. Crush the waste  <br>Good point. Make sure to scratch that out with a screw driver.</br>  <br>Yeah but if he has access to a body shop, doesn't that make the whole thing a moot point?</br>  VOLCANO  <br>you can do it in your garage with some basic tools and a sawzall.<br><br>but the noise.</br></br></br>   take license plates off <br> remove all stuff in car that is yours <br> drive it to a car scrapyard at night <br> once there, removes the battery and cut a bunch of shit up in the engine so it's unusable  <br> scrapyard will check if it works, then prolly strip it down and sell the parts in every direction </br></br></br></br>  dig a pit twice as big as the car. fill it halfway with coal. drill holes down to the charcoal and install air compressors at the tops of the holes, seal them well. dump a huge amount of gasoline on the coal and ignite. drive car into the pit. start air compressors. you should be able to create temperatures close to 5000 degree's in this pit, with enough air injection, and the car will melt entirely.  <br>you could, but the average guy doesn't work in a bodyshop</br>  First, you don't post about it on /b. Someone is gonna track you down, get the incriminating evidence from the car, and either extort you or troll you four /b's amusement!  <br>too true op is a fag</br>  <br>drive it to some deep deserted woodlands hopefully having a place you can get into the offroad and drive it as far as you can and leave. will sit for long enough to avoid criminal charges.<br><br>or just duck it off for the time being and when the heats off do what you gotta do</br></br></br>  <br>so now my uncle is a criminal? lol</br>  My money says drive it into a state park, some place remote. Maine, upstate NY, rural PA (I'm from philly). Pick a spot you know reasonably well and where you know there are abandoned cars and tractors. There are places like this all over the east coast. Drive the car in, puncture the tires so it's a real hassle to move... Maybe even pull the wheels entirely and then use a chisel to bust off the lugs. You just have to make it a pain in the ass, not impossible. Then spray the inside and then the outside liberally with a squirt bottle of fuming H2SO4. Hoof it out. Bring some hiking gear so you don't arouse suspicion.<br><br>This whole thing assumes that you don't own the car, right??</br></br>  <br>We're already working on this guy. Check his youtube, we got him last night too.<br><br> 9/11 Truthers Night! <br>Host David Sponheim<br>3rd Party Presidential Elect<br>His opinions on Obama!<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=0a7<wbr>miz08YJw</wbr>  [ ] <br>Get in the chat with everyone else. <br>http://vaughnlive.tv/thirdparty<br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>he didn't say, but I think you do</br>  Keep it in a normal spot  <br>aye mane. i know this biz.<br><br>why else would you want to make a car disappear? I'm not judging at all lol. but if its all legal just go to a scrap yard and get a few hundos out of it</br></br></br>  <br>I've done this before in Tijuana! The car was found and brought back to me.</br>  <br>now thats a mind puzzle</br>  There are multiple vins on a car, average Joe won't get them all when trying to strip a car.. id part it out, sell the parts on craigslist or some other anonymous way, then cut up and bury what's left..  <br>fair point. he likes giving me puzzles to solve though, this one just seemed random and weird lol</br>  Newerish cars can have lots of vin numbers and traceable identification numbers, some which are not easily removable. Your best bet it a place that will completely destroy the car with a shredder like a recycling plant. You might need to cut the car up to get them to take it.<br>Lighting the car on fire makes a huge fucking scene. If you go this route, put kindling in the truck, interior, and under the hood. Break all the glass to get as much airflow inside. Start the fire inside the car. The seats, carpet and plastic will get the fire hot enough to start deteriorating the metal. Note that someone will eventually find this.<br>Cars hidden in water have a high chance of being found. If i were to so this, look for a high current salt water source.</br></br>  <br> legal  <br>go to a chopshop and get some cash for the parts<br><br> illegal <br>same as above, but you pay them</br></br></br></br></br>  Dig large hole in side of hill. Drive car into hole. Cover hole. Complete.<br><br>Also note the car maybe serialized in multiple locations deep within</br></br>  <br>Yeah it was an insurance scam went wrong.they did steal the radio</br>  <br>Yeah, I agree. Those vins are all over the fucking place now.<br><br>I still think that all you have to do is make it inconvenient to reach, basically. You push a car off a gorge in a semi rural area into a somewhat deep body of water, especially where swimming is forbidden and fishing is inconvenient, and there's not a small town in the world that's gonna waste any money to drag that fucker out of the drink.</br></br></br>  <br>Legal chop shop (scrap yard) requires the title of the car to be transferred to them, that's pretty darn traceable...</br>  <br><br>What year car? The older the car the easier it will be to remove a few VINs. Newer cars have GPS computers and VINs all over the place. Anyways drive the thing into a good sized lake.</br></br>  <br>Take license plates, bury them in backyard. Then in the middle of the night drive the car off a pier.</br>  <br> thermite vin on frame <br> thermite vin on motorblock <br> burn paper work <br> thermite license plate <br> set on fire with lots of diesel <br> leave </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>all cars (in US at the very least) have the vin on the engine block as well.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=qYp<wbr>Lk65rbps</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Baltimore?</br></br>  I'm not a millionaire or anything, but I do have a backhoe and over 100 acres of woods behind my house. Id make that bitch disappear no problem.  <br>fuck the engine block. keep that bitch and grind it off and sell it.<br><br>the main problem is the body frame ect.</br></br></br>  <br>My car is a 96 and it has the vin etched into every window, plus about 5 other places normal people wouldn't know about.</br>  repaint it and park it in a car dealership, then put a fake price sticker on the winodw.  <br><br>wouldn't jet fuel do it faster</br></br>  <br>Engine, tranny, firewall, dashboard, hood, fenders, truck lids, doors, door sills, window etching, ecu, radio. They can be fucking everywhere. Some are manufacturer stickers, metal etching, and scanable barcodes. I buy scrap cars for a living at a recycling plant and 99% of the time i can find a traceable id tag on a stolen car.</br>  Ugliest tits you ever seen. <br><br>Go!</br></br>          <br>everything is disgusting</br>  <br>ugliest pussy too</br>  Really?..  <br>Those cans look like they were glued on</br>  <br>monitoring this thread for flapjacks</br>    <br>lol</br>    <br>winrar<br>god damnit</br></br>  <br>god i remember this girl..looks like an axe wound</br>  <br>Everytime i try looking at it to see wtf is going on there i have to turn away. <br><br>Goodness man I'd say you won.</br></br></br>    <br><br><br><br>I can't not see a froggy face with her tits for eyes and belly for mouth.<br><br> Ribbit </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So this is why Arnold Swaznigger was happy to welcome gay marriage</br>    <br>My sides are nowhere to be found.</br>      Here's another one.      <br><br>virgin detected</br></br>    <br>Damn.
