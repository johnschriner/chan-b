No other way around it.    She'll be fucking niggers in no time...  Where the fuck did her tits go?!:!:!:!  <br>This can't be a reduction. Maybe it's just her fat covering them up.

There are illegal guns around, I can drive 30 minutes to philly or camden and grab a gun. Your logic makes no sense to people who arent naive as fuck. You ever wonder why college kids are liberals and adults are conservative because we work and arent living off of beer and weed getting spoonfed bs by professors</br>   guns are illegal <br> therefore cops can't carry them </br>  <br>shut up faggot</br>  i luv janeane garofalo!  <br>Go suck john stewarts dick</br>  <br>you go fucking suck some rednecks dick</br>  really?  <br>Mad as fuck your dumb as shit lol</br>  <br> implying we would ever need assault rifles to defend us from police <br> implying the US military's firepower isn't 600 trillion times more powerful than a single rifle and an assault rifle would protect you from being droned </br></br>  <br>Stop fucking arguing with me faggot and get the fuck out Asshole</br>  <br>Have you ever heard of the american revolution?</br>  <br> implying half of the military wouldn't defect  <br>  implying the remaining half wouldn't get fucked by guerrilla warfare </br></br>  <br> comparing British tyranny to current day US govt <br> this is what conservatards actually believe </br></br>  <br> damage control </br>  <br>Hahahahhahahaha why dont you move to the UK where guns are outlawed and you can live a happy life of an everyday cuck</br>  <br>Lmao hows it different explain to me please</br>    <br>found the welfare recipient</br>  <br>Someone has never heard of checks and balances.</br>  <br><br>It's almost like you're ok with the military droning people in their homes.
