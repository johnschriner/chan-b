He's 20 years old, has hundreds of millions of YouTube views, has tons of young kids and celebrities imitating his dance moves, pretty much recognized as the "realest rapper" from New York right now, in jail on $2 million bail awaiting trial for crack dealing and gang related conspiracy charges.<br><br>How does /b/ feel about the popularity of musicians like this?<br><br>Here's a video of his audition to Epic Records for a boardroom of white label people (3:30 mark is best part): <br>https://youtu.be/T2oX0twHWD4?t=3m30<wbr>s<br><br>Hot Nigga: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBX<wbr>niiEgmMk<br><br>Bobby Bitch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6u<wbr>rRX_szKQ<br><br>Shmoney Dance: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHc<wbr>V-gj5djE</wbr></br></br></wbr></br></br></wbr></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  he is a nigger so what do you think...  free gucci  <br>he dances like a monkey</br>  <br>free gucci</br>    <br><br> He's 20 years old, has hundreds of millions of YouTube views, has tons of young kids and celebrities imitating his dance moves, pretty much recognized as the "realest rapper" from New York right now, in jail on $2 million bail awaiting trial for crack dealing and gang related conspiracy charges. <br><br>So he has all that and still feels the need to sell crack?</br></br></br></br>    <br>all i see is a monkey trying to dance</br>  <br>and kill people, yes.<br><br>his rap lyrics in hot nigga, bobby bitch, computers and shmoney dance are practically a document of his crimes</br></br></br>  Its pathetic when I come to /b/ and you pastey white shits try to act like you know anything about rap. Its cringe. /b/ has the worst rap taste. Not you op but im just anticipating it. <br><br>Hes just another nigger being milked by a record label but hell only ever be a one hit wonder, he made a dance radio song that already completely blew over. The rest of his songs are typical shit. <br><br>Then heres whete it gets stupid because everyone on /b/ will be like "lol good rap chance the rapper joey badass. Flatbush zombies" <br><br>If you wanna hear some real real real rap, check out ancient mobb deep albums, nas from anytime, old styles p, jadakiss.

Does it matter? no. They were together for a reason, and than they broke up for a reason. They may fuck, but she won't go back to him if that's your concern. If you're not a bitch about the entire thing, that is. If you make a huge deal out of it she WILL get pissed and consider going back.

I don't care. Will bump with a few.</br></br>   girlfriend has a shitty job, i suggest she gets a new one. <br> she goes for a job interview, completely ruins it by crying halfway through the interview for some reason <br> blames it on me for setting her up for failure <br><br>my fucking face</br></br></br></br>  <br>I got nothing. Normies get off my board</br>  <br> wake up sad after a tough week of sitting in my dimly lit room fapping to horses <br> need some company <br> parents hate me because im 27 and live at home and unemployed <br> pick up phone to call girlfriend <br> realise i'm a fat autist who spends his time on /b and would never have a girlfriend </br></br></br></br></br>  Not a story but does anyone else here feel the same way as me?<br><br>I love my wife and she means the world to me, but sometimes the shit she does makes me think that our intelligence levels are drastically different (shes not retarded or anything) but most times I have to, let's say, explain a concept or something, and it is so simple, but she just doesn't seem to get it, I feel pretty bad for thinking she might be dumber than I am, at least dumb enough for it to be noticeable</br></br>  Not a massive issue, but I unintentionally scare my gf about 6 times a day. bitch, we live in the same house, expect to see me walking down the hallway every now and then.    <br><br>In the same line<br><br> wife be cooking <br> im setting up the netflix in the next room <br> she calls me "hey honey, can you come over for a second" <br> walk over to the kitchen and say "hey, what you need?" <br><br> She's all like "Jesus CCHRIST DONT SCARE ME LIKE THAT!!" <br><br>mfw</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I'm med school they're drop out and sometimes they don't understand my vocabulary and mispronounce or know things like Oedipus but he's not dumb. Like he's an idiot savant   Wife hates job <br> "You should start applying for different jobs and try to find something you enjoy." <br> "I know..." <br> Never applies for new jobs and we continue having this conversation two or three times a week. </br></br></br>  <br>this is why im single</br>  <br>Sure</br>  <br>this guy gets it. Nowadays when my girlfriend complains about her job (without doing anything about it ever) I just say "damn, I can't believe your job is that bad and you still haven't quit". There's basically no response to that question without admitting defeat or laziness.<br><br>Works every time.</br></br></br>    <br><br>Another one<br> Plan for over a year to adopt a puppy <br> The time is here <br> Puppy time <br> Hey Babe, I've been looking around and here is a nearby shelter with a litter of nine pups and their mother. We should go see them and maybe pick one out. <br> "I don't really want a puppy" <br> What? <br> We've been planning this for over a year. <br> "I didn't think you were serious." <br> Lose my shit.  <br> We got the fucking puppy. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   feminist <br> the end </br>  <br>my wife is like this with everything. after all these years she hasn't figured out that I don't bring up shit like that without being serious. Talking about buying a dog is not a fucking comedy routine, christ.</br>  <br> Gf says I need to have my own opinion and speak my mind and not always agree with her <br> Point out that a girl has a fat ass <br> It was bigger than hers yet she didn't agree.. wtf <br> single now </br></br></br></br>  <br>This mansplainer needs to check his privilege.<br>This is seriously a problem, him thinking that he's smarter than his wife just because he spends all of his time on the internet. He probably doesn't even know how to so what he's explaining, just saw some real man (or probably a woman) do it on a youtube video. What a welp.</br></br>  Love my gf to death mfw when she doesn't have a license at 26...  <br>she exaggerates...</br>  <br>...</br>  <br><br>wear a mask and scare her for realy in the middle of the night, she'll learn what fear is<br>but beaware, this will cause massive bitching for and unlimited amount of time, but worth it imo</br></br></br>  My ex gf had a petplay fur fetish drove me almost insane  <br><br>Ive actually considered that more than once, or even going as far as carrying the camera with me to make a compilation, I'd probably have a video up every couple of weeks, because of how often it seems to happen,</br></br>   on fb, posts DJ hiad - Djihad on my wall <br> ex gf comments ' I want to end my life' <br> I see one of my friends liked this status <br> I hesitate <br> *clicks like* <br>did I do good /b/?<br><br>song related<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Xzf<wbr>o5oVWmAo</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's cheating on you. Probably has her phone in her hand texting some dude and hides it quick as soon as you come around the corner, but acts like you scared her so you don't ask what she was doing and to cover up her uneasiness.</br>  <br><br>I had to MAKE my wife get her driver's license. We got married when she was 26, but for our entire engagement, about a year and a half, we practiced driving. She went to take her test and failed the first time, then cried and cried and said something about "Maybe I'm just not cut out to have a driver's license."<br><br>And I did something ballsy. "Then I guess we can't get married. I just don't see how things can work if you can't get yourself from A to B. What if I'm in an accident and have to be hospitalized? What if I go out of town to a conference for work? I think we should put the wedding on hold until you can get this done.<br><br>She waited the minimum amount of time to retest and fucking aced it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   gf <br>https://<span>youtu.be/JCeOf2q6_TA  [ ]</br>  Bumping for more  <br>Thats pretty good anon, seriously 10/10 for you</br>  kek  <br> virgin gf <br> 3 month together <br> wants no pencil in vagoo <br> oky, im not too kinky <br> always wants me by her side <br> mother invites her over for dinner <br> rustled, not without my approval <br> break up <br> mother puts her plate on the table <br> tell her <br> mother disappointed as never before <br> finish dinner <br><br>wurf</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Oh boy, do I have a few. Last gf, who's now an ex (no wonder why).<br><br> self-confidence issues <br> she hates her body, like really hates it <br> she sometimes even wonders why I'm with her <br> she's in fact gorgeous <br> but she can't stand herself especially her face and nose <br> one day brings up the fact she wants to put on a septum ring <br> not gonna happen honey, shit is ugly as hell <br> you're beautiful to me but that's too much and I won't be able to find you attractive anymore <br> to me it's just immature attention-whoring, especially on a spot you despise <br> shitstorm ensues as expected <br> blarglarg how can you say you won't find me interesting anymore yadda yadda <br> never said uninteresting, but unattractive <br> still, puts the septum shit on hold <br> couple months later does it by surprise <br> sends a picture of it <br> see how pretty I am now ?? <br> mfw <br> doesn't understand why I'm pissed at her and don't want to look at her until she takes it off </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Thanks. I do think she is becoming more self-reliant as time passes. EXample: When she and I first started dating, my dogs would just maul the shit out of her, licking her face and trying to play with her. She'd be all like "HELP ME!" Hahaha good times. She finally asked "Why don't they do this to you?"<br><br>I told her "Because I don't roll over and take it. They think they are dominant over you because all of your body language is submissive. They think they can do whatever they like to you, and you just roll over and take it."<br><br>Now, seven years later, the dogs are trying to maul her and she just grabs them and sits them down in her lap and makes them be good.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br> she can't stand new people <br> it's really hard for newcomers to break the ice with her <br> she doesn't help at all, awkward silences and so on <br> says people need to make an effort to be interesting and funny with her <br> yet doesn't understand why she would have to make an effort for people <br> same goes with our friends <br> was important to her I got along well with her friends <br> did well, these people were nice, still in touch with some of them <br> when meeting them she would get pissy if I got along too well <br> when meeting my friends things went horrible, silences, being often on her phone, not replying to them etc… <br> blamed me for bringing her <br> before that blamed me for not introducing her to my friends </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    Aaaaaaaaand /b/ is running low on women stories. Suprise suprise.  <br>kek</br>  <br><br>I gave four. I don't really have a very dramatic marriage. When she isn't hating her job but doing nothing about it, pretending to think I wasn't serious about adopting our cool new puppy, trying to get out of the responsibility of being able to drive like a grownup, or being a wuss who would let herself be pushed around by two 25 pound dogs, she's pretty great.</br></br>  <br>ive got a couple<br><br> be me <br> be dating the future wife <br> her mom be protective as shit, shes an only child <br> mom call on our dates every couple hours, see what we up to <br> mom call whlie were driving, on our way to d movies <br> mom asked wat we bout to do <br> I sarcastically reply "tell her we're going to go to a motel to have fun" <br> moms super christian and all "save yourself for marriage bs" <br> she replies to her mom exactly what I said in a completely non-sarcastic serious way <br> My facepalm that day ejected my brain into orbit <br><br> mfw I have to call and deeply apologize for making such remarks (i didnt care, but i didnt want her to be mad) </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>another gf:<br><br> tells me she had 3 bf with the exact fucking name as i have <br> rustled again <br> she dosn't understand <br> i chill out eventually <br> start to mock her with it <br> she never chilled out </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> also had abandoning issues <br> might have partially been why she hated people that much <br> to the point where the only meaningful thing to her is her cat <br> calls it her son, her one and only child, gets reaally moody if she doesn't see it for a couple of days <br> red flag incoming <br> later on discovered she had three abortions that didn't go well at all (being careless) <br> ohboy.exe <br> last year cat got run over <br> OHBOY.rar <br> as expected, shit ensues. Full depression mode engaged. <br> denies it, even though she cries all the time, has panic attacks, sends everyone to hell, loses interest in everything <br> lasts for months, but still in denial <br> I'm happy the way I am <br> tells me at night how she misses the cat <br> fed up with it, tell her I'm sick of that and I'm gonna leave if it carries on <br> Oh. Well that would bother me for a while, but nothing compared to the loss of my cat. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> fed up with it, tell her I'm sick of that and I'm gonna leave if it carries on <br> Oh. Well that would bother me for a while, but nothing compared to the loss of my cat. <br><br>That's your cue to leave right there</br></br></br></br>  Guess my gf is pretty generic <br> any problem, weight, school whatever <br> use this solution  <br> She dosnt wants to  <br> but it will help u? <br> says she dont wanna deal With it <br><br>U wot m8</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  man, do any interesting women actually exist? like they actually have a desire to pursue something or whatever, I dunno. Girls are so boring. Hot but boring.  <br>I live With a girl. Get up, study, nap, school, eat, get drunk on weekends. Repeat.<br><br>No goal in life and No hobbies</br></br></br>  <br>wow it took her 7 years? it took me 7 seconds as a man</br>   She goes out with her bff weekly and gets shitfaced for BFF fridays. <br> comes home at 430am and wakes me up to fight only saying that "you don't really love me"  <br> try to calm her down but fights escalate to the point where she's ready to break up with me. <br> tell her to sleep and we'll discuss it in the morning <br> everything is normal in the morning. "I was drunk" <br> this happens sporatically for 2 years. <br> yesterday hangouts is open on her comp while she's away <br> curiosity gets the better of me, read some convo with BFF <br> BFF is reprimanding for making drunk decisions. <br> read only so far before I get sick <br> got drunk with and fucked her ex bf whenever we would have a minor fight <br> got drunk with and fucked my old roomate/ friend who she led on saying she had feelings for him <br> stopped fucking him then did the same thing to her coworker but much more physical. I've shared drinks with this person in my apartment. <br><br>I'm annoyed, her stuff is packed, she's my ex when she gets back from her parents house today</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And now for the oh so classic ex story.<br><br> had an ex-bf who cheated on her, multiple times <br> guy is manipulative, she's weak-minded <br> took her two years to finally decide to stop seeing him after they broke up <br> after the cat's death she called him <br> "to let him know cause he knew the cat" <br> I'm upset, but still appreciate she had the honesty to tell me for a change <br> still the guy called her drunk couple of days later to ask to take him back <br> pissed off, ask her to tell me if he gets in touch with her again <br> agrees and says she understands <br> couple months later, alone at her place, looking for a lighter in her bag <br> find a postcard from the ex <br> "still thinking about you" <br> don't yell at first, wait for her to come back <br> In conversation ask if the ex has tried anything lately <br> "Uuuuh noo… <br> Nothing at all ? <br> No, nothing really" <br> mfw <br> Confrontation time bitch </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> forgot to mention the "you don't really love me fights" linked up with these occurrences for the most part. She probably manufactured issues in her head to justify her actions. <br> been together for 4 1/2 years </br></br>  <br>From the sounds of it I'd say good call if you see it to the end</br>  <br><br>Sorry bud, this means she loves him more than you. <br><br>Dump the bitch.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yea man<br>I'm fuming but so numb right now as a defence mechanism I think. Like my mind is blank. No matter how much I love her I can't stay with her because I will never trust her again.</br></br>   girl i know for 10 yeas <br> some drunk fun <br> kissed for once or twice <br> she got a bf, good guy <br> together for 2 years <br> befriend the guy too <br> get drunk, kissed her again <br> mfw all she does is complaining about his bf to me eversince <br> mfw they live together and she can't live with me <br> mfw i have to just listen to it </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Confrontation time bitch <br>you're such a cuck for not just leaving</br></br>  <br><br>It was more gradual. Probably took her about two years before she actually started to assert herself. Lots of me reminding her that my pets thought they were higher than her on the hierarchy.</br></br>  <br>that's still pathetic and you're with a retard</br>   have girlfriend <br> gets stressed over the littlest of things all the time <br> I always offer solutions x, y and z to her problems <br> if there is no solution tell her to stop worrying cos she can't do anything about it <br> still constantly worrying... <br><br>same girlfriend<br> she: virgin, saving self for marriage <br> me: fucking love sex <br> but she'll give me handjobs/blowjobs... (Christian logic) <br> one day she can't make me cum <br> me "it's just not doing it for me any more" <br> her "i've been thinking about it for about 3 weeks, maybe we should have sex" <br> me "nah lets break up" <br> couldn't stand the thought of taking her virginity, didn't think it would be enjoyable at all, probably a shit ton of stress </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The ex part 2<br><br> she feels deeply sorry afterwards of course, especially because it was shortly after my second break-up <br> knew she was walking on thin ice <br> bought myself some peace for a month or so with that <br>  fast forward last winter, her phone breaks <br> no backup of course, loses all of her stuff, including phone numbers <br> I invite her to spend a couple days at my place for winter holidays (she's a student) <br> coming back from work, I get on the laptop looking for an old article on web history <br> find out she's been talking on facebook with her ex <br> mfw <br> henshin a go go baby ! <br><br><br>Indeed.

I might as well just live a half-assed life with nice hookers and pursue my hobbies. right?</br>  <br>doesn't matter if you're an asshole, doesn't change the fact she was irresponsible for her own body</br>  <br>here's the chat log</br>  Not really exiting, but alot of the times she does things without thinking it through, then gets upset when it doesn't work out, could be anything from trading in her car to deciding on what to say. She then hates it when I point this out.<br><br>Also she will tell me she knows something when infact she doesn't. For example we need to go to a certain place, I explain I'm not sure where it is, she says she knows, we get close to location, I ask where abouts it is, she's like "oh around here somewhere" ffs woman! Or I say I don't know how this works or I don't know how to do this, she explains she knows, when infact she doesn't, she just has a vague idea of something, and actually I probably know more. Really fuckin infuriating.</br></br>  <br> you're still with her <br><br>amazing how some men can pull their hand from a blender and then put it back in.</br></br></br>  <br>What a cunt</br>  <br>I had an ex I dumped who went on to only date guys with my name after that.<br>What a fucking psycho.</br></br>  <br>You don't want your nails to fall into the wrong hands.

Sigh. It's so fucking exhausting.</br>  Lets do this...<br><br>  Be a methodical man, always plan things in advance <br> I'm no fairytale guy so I get prenup prepared before I get married. <br> Interesting fact, in the 21st century I do not trust women. <br> Interesting fact 2, my parents are happily married for 40 years. I wanted something like what they had. <br> Reality check it is the 21st century. <br> Woman I married was intelligent and smart, had the patience to fool me for a couple of years before I said yes to get married. <br> A few months after marriage bitch shows her true colours. <br> We live in a massive house [owned by my parents], and we live in another part of the house. <br> Bitch wants my parents to move out of the master bedroom and she wants it, because its my house. <br> I reason with her, as it makes no practical difference. There is nothing wrong with our bedroom. <br> Bitch feels further parents should move out and into their own place. She needs more space for the future kids. <br> mfw the fucking house is big enough to house 10 families. <br> I reason with her that if she does not want to be in the same house as my parents we can move out. <br> Harpy shrieks <br> I ask the bitch to back the fuck off because she is disrespecting my parents. <br> She withdraws, as she noticed my calm tone turning murderous. <br> About a year later [with usual disagreement on trivial issues], she cooks up a big fight about me not wanting to have kids. <br> I don't pull punches, and lay it straight to her. <br> The character she has demonstrated and misbehaviour towards my parents is unacceptable. <br> She tries to lay in a burn by saying that I've misbehaved with her parents as well. <br> We haven't met her parents since marriage, since she didn't want to. <br> I say enough is enough, she can fuck off to her folks. <br> She does <br> Weeks later everyone is happy. <br> We receive a divorce notice and a letter explaining how she is entitled to blah blah blah and half my house, nonsense like that. <br> Get my own lawyer, had enough, send her a second copy of prenup and signed divorce papers. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Fucked up and married an international student from Taiwan. <br> She has zero awareness of culture or history or anything interesting.  <br> i.e. Star Wars, any given actor, TV shows etc <br> She's cool other than that, we are best friends and love to do shit together. <br> But now I appear as a forever alone with a mail-order-bride everywhere I go since I'm a manlet <br><br>Not sure how to get past that.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> be pisslord <br> keep gallons of my piss <br> girl complains all the time about them <br> tell her to bad <br> one of them breaks open <br> summer heat and the gases inside <br> gets all over a bunch of her clothes <br> fuckit.jpeg <br> she complains about the weird smell <br> also there are lots of flies inside now <br> finally go to clean up the broken pissjug and the flies have laid maggots <br> Piss maggots and flies <br> she freaks out that piss flies have been landing on her stuff  <br> cant kill these piss flies <br> entire generations of piss flies that only feed on my piss <br> make her clean it up <br> she bitched and moaned <br> poor little piss flies </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   have a gf for two years <br> met her while backhorse riding <br> cute chick is actually taller than me <br> learn shes a gamer <br> play games with her from times to time <br> shes brings her laptop to play vydia <br> finally gets to fuck her just to learn she was a virgin <br>  her parents are rich as fuck <br>  shes going to.med school <br>  we always share our toughts and problema with eachother <br>  barelly had any fights <br>  always on the pill so i fuck her raw all the time and creampie the shit out of her <br><br>  hit the jackpot </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> me several years ago <br> have live-in girlfriend <br> she refuses to get job <br> got applications for her which were either ignored or filled out but not handed in <br> tell her there might be a barmaid job at my regular <br> it's 10pm by this point <br> tell her we can go and ask but pubs close at 11pm <br> she starts to get ready <br> 10:30pm <br> "We need to leave now." <br> "I'm almost done!" <br> 10:35pm <br> go into bathroom <br> she's still putting on fucking makeup <br> "What are you doing you don't need makeup they know me there and they don't care about that kind of thing there." <br> "IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME I WANT TO LOOK MY BEST!!!!!" <br> roll eyes and go watch TV and wait for her <br> 10:45pm <br> go into bathroom <br> she isn't there <br> go into bedroom <br> she's on my computer  <br> "Oh I thought you were mad at me and we weren't going to go." <br> mfw </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Had a gf that did that to me.

What the fuck like every single detail you put is accurate to my experience</br>  <br>Yeah women get better grades than men on average because most teachers are women but I truly believe that men can handle basic tasks in a more logical way especially if it is of the physical nature. <br> my girlfriend at the time was a self proclaimed feminist (I know it sucked) <br> I'm a strong independent women and all that ego stroking feminist bull shit. <br> Buys a computer chair from Staples <br> Me "Do you need help putting it together?' <br> Her "I don't need no help from a man" <br> Takes her hours to try to put this chair together <br> Finally asks for my help I put it together in like 10 minutes. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>These are just women, dude. Same goes with every fucking women i've been. I think that's because they don't have the need to be responsible for anything, they grew up having everything they wanted and just don't give a fuck or take anything seriously.<br><br>Also, my current gf grinds my gears for not being present mentally during a conversation/moment/arrangement, like her mind floats in space. And also, when we talk about a moment like that, she doesn't remember actually attending it. Really. Fucking. Annoying.</br></br></br>  Reading this thread makes me think half of you are the autistic/annoying/dumb ones in the relationship. If you're the one telling the story and you come off sounding like the idiot, chances are you're actually a fucking moron.   Fishing with wife and dog <br> Using my dad's pole that he left to me in his will <br> Let her use it while I run around with my dog <br> Big mistake <br> She has this things where she never dries her hands or wipes them clean <br> She just handled a fish so she has fish mucous all over her hands <br> Pole slips from her hands while casting <br> Lost my dad's pole in the middle of a lake <br><br>My fault, really. But then....<br><br> "Oh well, I was wanting to get rid of that ugly thing for a while." <br><br>....Was it on purpose?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It is a first world problem.look at the thread. Your mates are getting hot wax thrown on their dicks, getting sued for alimony, getting cheated on...and you are complaining about your wife not knowing pop culture references!</br>  <br> She has this things where she never dries her hands or wipes them clean <br>fucking this<br>every time my gf comes out of a bathroom her hands are soaked, or she sometimes wipes them on her dresses</br></br></br>  <br>There are dozens of shitty stories and posts with baseless significance. The thread called for:<br><br>"Funny, infuriating, annoying, whatever. I don't care."<br><br>Going out of your way to mention the degree of significance is pointless if it falls in any of those categories. <br><br>I feel for my bros. But you could tag on 'at least' to any fucking post.<br><br>Stay irrational, faglord.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You never truly realise how fucking disgusting women are until you've lived with one intimately.</br></br>  <br><br>oh my god niggas im about to rip my hair out over this shit<br><br>i have to have dry hands, if i get anything greasey or oily on my hands i have to wash them immediately, im a bit spergy about that<br><br>but this bitch<br><br>THIS BITCH<br><br>DONT NEVER DRY HER HANDS OFF<br><br>HANDS ALWAYS BE LOTIONY OR WET OR SOMETHIN<br><br>WHAT IS THIS NONSENSE</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw gf plays games as much as me </br>  <br>Triggers the fuck out of me. When she puts her hand on my clothes or some shit holy fuck</br>  <br>Ok.</br>  <br>You can press charges for holding you captive against your will. 'Not knowing how to express yourself properly' is hardly a good excuse for going psycho on your ass. <br><br>Also, all those stories of girls threatening to kill themselves: that counts as domestic abuse and you can press charges.</br></br></br>  <br>My girlfriend did the same thing and punched me in the jaw thinking I was an intruder. Now she can get something from a high high spot by her damn self.</br>  Britsh / Irish slut thread  god tier bands<br><br>pic related</br></br>  they're 7/10 not 10/10  are you dumb  all comes down to personal taste i guess  it's the only band that i listen.<br>poets of the fall</br>    <br>Definitely at least 8.5/10, close enough to qualify for this thread<br><br>Not quite god-tier, but acceptable</br></br></br>  <br>This is the only true 10/10 band</br>  <br>Please elaborate.

Also Hard Times, Rock The Blues Away and Rock or Bust are pretty cool songs on the last album.<br>And by the way you should listen "Two's Up" from Blow Up Your Video, it's pretty much awesome.</br></br>  Covenant Era is best      <br>that's some edgy cover</br>    <br>After 25 years of putting out the fastest thrash around, they're bound to go shitty at some point.</br>    <br>most overrated band of the last century</br>  <br>probably thought up by the edge lord himself, Kerry King</br>    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=GHd<wbr>Yh8xu6eA</wbr>  [ ]  <br>GIVE US A NEW ALBUM YOU FUCKING TWATS</br>  <br>They've always sucked to me.
