Ask a person who just installed Windows 10 anything  Coke or Pepsi?  What is the meaning of life?  <br>why haven't you kill yourself yet?</br>  Should I upgrade, seriously? I'm stuck on Windows 8.1 and I'm having to jump through all sorts of hoops to even get the option to update  <br>Coke, Pepsi has a really strange aftertaste you know?</br>  Should everyone call the guy below me a dirty nigger?  how do you get marigolds to bloom evenly?  <br>no because youre a dirty nigger</br>  <br>dirty nigger</br>  <br>dirt nig</br>  <br>Honestly, it really doesn't feel much different, but the sounds are so nice. and upgrading is such a non issue just wait a bit and everything you had before is there. Is it really worth it? I would say if you really missed the start menu then yes. if you are okay with metro then no</br>  Why didn't you install it in November like me?  <br>fucking dirty ass nigger</br>  Should everyone call the guy above me a dirty nigger?  <br>Did you turn of half that botnet shit they leave on.</br>  <br> how do you get marigolds to bloom evenly? <br>what are you doing with marigolds to begin with? Only plant voilets and your life will be better. If you really want wasps around your home then plant marigolds</br></br>  <br>Dirty nigger</br>  <br>hows the new search bar? also has it fucked with compatibility on any of your programs?</br>  <br>shit on all of it</br>  <br>Because i didn't want an OS in beta. I actually want to 'use' my computer</br>  <br>is tech support still shit?</br>  <br>Is it more secure, or a conspiracy to get hack my personal files?</br>  <br>Im running both FL Studio 11 and iTunes as you can see and they work just fine. Idk about my old PC games tho</br>  <br>Probably but hey atleast im not running XP where there is none or Vista for that matter</br>  <br>Slimy nig</br>  <br>like what?</br>  Alright /b/rothers, I need your help.<br><br>I read a guide on how to force the installation of W10, and it told me to delete "C:\Windows\SoftwareDistributuon" in order to reset Windows Update. Upon doing this, the upgrade icon in my task bar is now missing. Can anyone tell me how to restore it?</br></br>  <br>Just being on the internet compromises your files! if i were you i would run a strong magnet across your Hard Drive to get rid of the bots inside of it perferably in a vertical up and down fashion 7-8 times to be completely sure!</br>  <br>If you reserved your copy already then there might be an email. If you really wanted W10 so bad you shouldve just gotten the beta iso instead of digging in your windows directory</br>  <br>Its my older stuff i'm concerned about, don't want to have to do a song and dance to make them work,again.</br>  Are you getting the task bar not displaying the right click menu?<br><br>Also, that search bar is pretty annoying. And windows button does nothing.<br><br>10/10 Microsoft, quality product.</br></br></br></br>  <br>nyet, call him something creative</br>  <br>Where do you live? I'm compatible with it but I haven't gotten the option to download yet<br><br> my internet is pretty fucking fast too </br></br></br>  <br>They have a lot of collect data shit turned on when download too much to remember all of it but some one has a Screen cap of all of it maybe they'll post it.<br><br>Voice data, browsing, app and other stuff someone said even something like a key logger to see how you type and shit. <br><br>Of course all just to improve your experience with windows anon.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it works just fine for me</br>  <br>US of A maybe microsoft isn't releasing it worldwide same day, i could (Probably am) be wrong.</br>  <br>What programs are you talking about exactly?</br>  <br>is it faster?</br>  <br>it is pretty fast in opening programs and the such much faster than 8.1 metro, i haven't tried out edge yet</br>  Might have to get offline and download my copy botnets and all.  <br>i think its pretty gnarly botnets and all. Atleast it isn't linux</br>  So when do I get to download the upgrade? I've had my copy reserved for some time.  <br>just click on "Get Windows 10" and immediately it will tell you to upgrade</br>  Do you have to format your drive or is it just an upgrade that you install?<br><br>Do you have any cracked software like Photoshop installed? Do they still operate?</br></br>  Upgrading from Win 7, do I have to format or any shit or does it just replace the windows files and leave everything else intact?<br><br>Have backed up necessary poon anyway</br></br>  <br>The drive is not formated unless you want a clean install, i have FL Studio cracked-ish and it operates just fine</br>  <br>Can you go from Windows 7 to 10? Or do you have to install 8 then 10?</br>  <br>see <br>I still have my over 6 gigs of music and my 2 gigs of fappening but thats me upgrading from Win 8.1 im sure win 7 would be the same</br></br>  <br>You go from 7 to 10 as its like an automatic update deal.</br>   Be me <br> wanting windows 10 <br> But I have a 1gb folder of loli <br><br>I mean I'm not worried about the NSA spying on me cause I dont look at CP, I just like middle schooler sized loli, which is just 5'0 girls with big boobs its just a preference<br><br><br>Should I get it?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't see the option.</br>  <br>is loli illegal??<br>if not then you are FINE. Unless you are going on CP deep web sites then you are fucked, they don't track you unless they have a reason to</br></br>  <br>Cheers mate, appreciate it</br>  <br>are you updated completely? or are you pending some updates? i don't know my man czech the microsoft website</br>  <br>Thanks</br>  <br>It's not illegal, but if some official wanted it to be illegal, they could easily make it so. I mean it's not CP, but a lot of it is obviously children. I like the smaller girls with better busts and overall proportions that are easily manhandled, but most of it is just pedo shit to be completely honest.</br>  <br>no problem man, the first step of the upgrade (and the longest taking me 30 - 45 min) is copying files so im pretty sure you won't lose anything, compatibility may be a problem if you are using old XP programs or bonzi buddy or something</br>  Use this if you can't get your download to pop up:<br>http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/soft<wbr>ware-download/windows10</wbr></br>  I'm sticking with Windows 7 until it becomes obsolete, fuck all this "app" bullshit.  <br>"I like the smaller girls with better busts and overall proportions that are easily manhandled" <br>Said just like a neckbeard.</br></br>  <br>well if they arent nude or just drawings then you should be fine.</br>  <br>see </br>  <br>You mean, it does it all itself right? I'm coming to /b/ for help and steadfastly refusing my IT student gf</br>  <br>shieeet nigga i love my bonzi buddy tho</br>  <br>Not a neckbeard, I weight 115lbs and I workout daily, what's so hard to understand my fetish is just smaller girls? Some people like taller girls, is that an issue? Nope.<br><br><br>Of course they're nude I beat my dick to it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>unless you are doing a clean install that wipes your hard drive then yes it does it by itself. its the first thing it does then it sets up drivers then it tweaks things. Its basically like giving Windows 8 a new skin</br>  <br>oh right, well i thought you were talking ACTUAL children. shit if they are nude drawings then who the hell cares</br>  <br>No no, it's all 2D hentai bruh. But like that can still be made to look bad mane. People don't give a fuck anymore, they love to hate.<br><br>I just dont wanna be jailed over some stupid shit like this</br></br></br>  <br>you can be a skinny neckbeard</br>  <br>So I get to choose the option of clean/not clean install?</br>  <br>I don't have a beard or a neckbeard.<br><br>But I lurk /b/ so I might as well be a neckbeard</br></br></br>  <br>None</br>  <br>Is there a benefit to a clean install?</br>  <br>I didn't get the option just to upgrade but like im sure the option will be there eventually but why would you want that?</br>  <br>A fresh new copy of windows. all malware and shit taking up HDD space is gone. along with your files and your memes :'( a clean install is only necessary if your computer is fucked</br>  <br>better chance of shit not getting botched in the upgrade.<br>really it shouldnt matter unless you have trojans and malware up the ass.</br></br>  <br><br>thanks gonna try this after i back up some photos</br></br>  <br>this<br>As a person who just installed it, all my files are here and nothing was botched just don't let your computer turn off. It will reset but don't fuck with it and everything will be okay</br></br>  <br>hows edge?</br>  <br>I havent tried it yet but i just clicked on it and at the speed of clint eastwood it opened. it looks... promising</br>  <br>Cause then I'd have to do a more careful backup of all my stuffs.</br>  <br> at the speed of clint eastwood it opened </br>  <br>honestly just do the upgrade and you will be just fine, i know i was, be patient for like an hour max and you will have win 10, everything will be there if you didn't fuck with it while it was installing everything will be there.</br>  <br>its honestly really impressive, like as soon as you let go of the left click its up and running, now if they let you use ad-block and thumbnail zoom then it will become my default</br>  <br>Try it and tell us if it works</br>  http://steam-wallet-gifts.com/?user<wbr>=a35457<br>toppest of keks</br></wbr>  <br>maybe ill regulate edge to be my porn browser.</br>  <br>Must be something broken on my end<br><br> Start button isn't working <br> No windows update <br> Firefox UI is broken <br> Right click menu (When you right click on a program on the task bar and get that pop up) doesn't work <br> Can't adjust date/time (moved my clock forward to trigger the 10 update, can't move back now) <br> Ocassionally won't let me switch programs (This is my 3rd attempt trying to post this) <br><br>I already checked<br> Drivers are updated <br> Firefox is up to date <br> Restarted computer twice <br><br>Really tempted to go back to 8.1 until the first service pack. This is a load of shit for their "most tested update"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  its habbening!  <br>oh shit this is nice, its like going to get gyros for the first time and taking a bite like this is so fucking nice. all it needs is the plug ins and its set. 10 / 10 would recommend. This is honestly Firefox and Chrome on speed like this is nice</br>  <br>it happened to me for a bit too, but i just opened programs and let Win 10 get situated and now everything works. I havent even TRIED Cortana yet.</br>  <br>und it feels SO GOOD</br>  <br>I'm going to reinstall using the DL linked provided above.<br><br>If it doesn't do anything, I'm going to go to bed (kek it's 4am) and try again around noon. If I get the same bugs then, back to 8.1 I go.</br></br></br>  <br>cortana is the shizzle brah<br>got a windows phone. she mah boo.<br>always reminding me to go to bed and calling me a faggot</br></br></br>  <br>I like windows 7 UI and fucking hate windows 8. Anyway I can get that tablet crap out of there?</br>  <br>ayyy gnarly, i cant wait to be called a faggot by cortana!!!</br>  <br>Like that god damn "store" link. Fuck that shit.</br>  just got here, and saw there are some problems with the windows 10 installation,<br>I didn't notice I had it downloaded, kek<br>should I install it?<br>opinions about my autism and windows 10.</br></br></br>  <br>Windows 10 is basically the best of both worlds as you have your start menu plus metro personally i like it because i can access my programs plus my directories pretty quickly. And edge is so good! i cannot say this enough but after years of being bullied IE grew up got gains and called itself edge</br>  <br>hows dat morrowind running on that os ?</br>  <br>You can unpin it, bro.<br><br>I immediately unpinned it and IE11.<br><br>Also<br> M$ wants to distinguish 10 from 8.0/8.1 <br> Uses the same fucking icon for Edge as they did Explorer, the shittiest part of Windows <br><br>kek'd</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i was fond of 8.1 but Win 10 is really a step up, its literally the best of win 8 and win 7 the start menu says it all, it has a condensed "metro" along with the start menu of 7</br>  <br>Is Windows 10 that much better than Windows 9?</br>  Why do you use FL studio? it's confusing as fuck use REASON.  <br>gucci</br>  <br>if its like the wp variant it should ask you what you want to be called by.<br>nothing better than "hey faggot remember to buy some milk today"</br></br>  <br>Yes absolutely<br>As much as i love my word 98 easter egg games windows 10 is much better</br></br>  <br>noiceee!<br>thx m8</br></br>  <br>Sure it has a STEEP learning curve and is not accessible but once you learn how to use it its SO GOOD. You gotta get good to make things sound good</br>  <br>don't use FL studio use REASON</br>  Does all your stuff get deleted if you upgrade?  <br>but we have lost a comrade :'(<br>Farewell Sim racing i never played you</br></br>  <br>no unless you choose a clean install<br> it asks "What do you want to keep?" <br> all apps (programs) and files <br> all files but programs get removed <br> nothing </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>no<br> upgrade keeps shit <br> Clean install doesn't </br></br></br>  <br>we hardly knew thee sim racing</br>  <br>see </br>  <br>How fast did it download?</br>  <br>well once you reserve your copy it downloads immediately you just need to install, if you are asking how long it takes to install it takes an hour about</br>  <br>same here...no option to download it and it's already mid day, 29th of July</br>  <br>atleast NBA survived Ahhhh :')</br>  <br>what's wrong with your resolution?</br>  <br>see </br>  <br>See <br>https://archive.is/9EKTy#post109600<wbr>9</wbr></br></br>  <br>Shouldn't it be downloaded automatically?<br>mine did</br></br>  <br>oops i meant </br>  <br>Good, I'd like to make it as close to 7 as I can. I actually enjoyed xp. Did the job. 7s built in UAC and other BS bugged me, but it was easily turned off. Just installed 8 on a business comp. since it came with it. Had a bunch of "Mind if we monitor all your crap all the time?" "options". Does windows 10 have that?</br>  <br>it should, but some people were reporting errors when trying to update win 7/8 to prep for win10.<br>The update responsible for the cute win10 advertisement icon wouldnt install correctly or something.<br>Also impatience.</br></br></br>  Cortana...
