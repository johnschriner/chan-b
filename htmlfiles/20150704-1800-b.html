Whereas The Wall and Wish You Were Here are very much about the problems of fame and the inhumanity of the music industry, and Animals is clearly political, Dark Side of the Moon speaks to the common man and the human condition as it exists in a modern industrial society.

Not all Mexicans are bad but I can tell you as someone that works in a jail about 60% of our incoming are Mexican and more than half are in the country illegally. It would be nice if this crap stopped and we could only deal with our nations trash and not have to deal with the influx of trash from Mexico as well.</br>  <br>someone upset kek</br>  <br><br> Rollin  <br> Rollin  <br> Rollin </br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh you mean like Sarah Palin?</br>  <br> implying we aren't already a global society <br><br>At this point the idea of separate nations is only around to keep the common person quarreling with the other common people while everyone in politics plans out their next tactic to make a dollar.</br></br></br>    <br>Fasten your tin foil hat, 2016's gonna be a wild ride.</br>  <br>Trump being elected could be a good thing. If he can manage successful businesses perhaps he could have the balls to make congress get their shit together and actually balance a budget rather than just hemorrhage money.<br><br>I also like that he is an asshole who isn't going to put up with bullshit or pussyfoot around with issues. He would be the type to take decisive action even if it's unpopular. He would be an actual leader and not someone who panders to bullshit and worries about hurt feelings.</br></br></br>  <br>He already has plenty of money you dipshit, him running is about the ultimate power. ..... plus my dollar will be worth more with him in office, which is the only reason to vote Dumbass.</br>  <br>Countries are not businesses. This moron would make George W Bush's Presidency look like Camelot. in other words...you don't want to even imagine how bad.....</br>  <br>Glad you're not old enough to vote</br>  <br>You're a lib fag still suckling on your mom's tit... move out and get off government assistance asshole</br>  <br>On some level, that's true.<br><br>But everyone in politics doesn't make their fortune by literally licensing their family name on to the sides of hundred million dollar projects just to punch up the perception of clout. Trumps very name IS his most valuable product and he is in business maximizing its exposure and selling it for real money.<br><br>Announcing a run for president, saying a litany of crazy things loud &amp; proud that 90 year old billionaires love to mutter under their breath, and keeping the show going for as long as possible, before bowing out hopefully somewhat gracefully, is the best possible thing he could do for his own interests.<br><br>It's like these kids don't have any idea who he is, how he makes his money, how he attracts attention, how much money he'd fucking lose taking 4 years off to make a few hundred thousand a year working himself to death as president.<br><br>That would be the absolute stupidest thing he ever did. There is zero chance of him doing it.<br><br>Nevermind the GOP has no interest in fitting him into their strategy whatsoever.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>I'm voting for him<br> btw, 36 year old, 10 year /b/ fag reporting in. </br></br>  <br>They aren't businesses but require leadership and people who can make tough decisions. He does seem to have that going with him. I could see him making decisions and not being afraid to stand before the cameras and talk about those thought decisions a lot more than our current president. He always seems to take the political approach to not hurt feelings and I say fuck that, just tell us how it is and get the job done, don't pussyfoot around.</br>  <br> This moron would make George W Bush's Presidency look like Camelot. <br>As opposed to who, another Bush or Clinton?<br>More status-quo will make any prior administration look like Camelot. Obama continued all of the shit that Bush brought on including Patriot Act, the bailouts, more outsourcing, and no border control. Clinton will be Obama on steroids and Obama is considered Bush on steroids already to increasing numbers of people. Trump doesn't have a chance per the establishment Republicans, but to say he would be worse than Bush is speculation at best. At least he's saying what a lot of people are thinking and he's going against the establishment.</br></br></br>  BERNIE SANDERS 2016<br>E<br>R<br>N<br>I<br>E<br><br>S<br>A<br>N<br>D<br>E<br>R<br>S<br><br>2<br>0<br>1<br>6</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd vote for him based on the asshole factor.

Listen to his "policy". He doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about. He can't do anything he says he'll do.

These things will pass and cannot be upended.</br></br>  <br>I already pay taxes. I pay out of pocket for healthcare as I own my own small business. For my kids, wife and I we paid around $400 per month before the "Affordable" Care Act and since that shit went into effect we now pay $920 per month for roughly the same coverage. <br><br>Would I want my taxes more than doubled to cover that? No that would mean paying even more out of pocket. As for functioning infrastructure I have no complaints about how it currently functions. We don't need even higher taxes to further fund the leeches living off of the government.</br></br></br>  <br>Right, I remember that. They don't just magically disappear though, they go to Guantanamo bay. How many people do you know that this has happened to? Do you really think people like Osama bin laden, ayman al-zawhiri (sp?) or the Boston bomber deserve a multi million dollar trial when it's obvious that they're guilty? They have been giving trials to Americans arrested for plotting Isis inspired attacks. <br>But sure. Go ahead and think the government is going to come sweep up you and your family for no reason. Not my problem. <br>Maybe you can get some Xanax from a doctor if you tell them about your concern about this.</br></br></br>  <br>Some of us are offered into your schools and so are willing to learn at your expense, others cross into your lands and are given new beginning to life and create families.

His burner is still on low right now. Trump is burning his candle out hot already.<br><br>...This is how candidates are played. The game builds. You want to save your best cards for last, keep them out of the spotlight for as long as possible so they're still fresh when the pressure is at max and it's coming down to the wire. Your loose cannons like Trump are early firecrackers that burn hot and fast. They draw a lot of attention, spark some conversations amid the public, stuff that you want said but you don't want pinned on your candidate. Then as you get into stumping and debates, the plebs are paying more attention, so you want your more experienced intermediary goobers out front, exchanging some witty banter &amp; barbs, warming everyone up for the big show. You let them burn each other out, leaving your big guns who actually stand some kind of chance. In this case, that's Bush &amp; Ryan, even possibly Christie, but for all his ability to grab the centrists and swing the vote, he'd take quite some working over to keep in line.<br><br>Post-Rove, the early front runners are not intended to win the marathon.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Illiterate, ignorant WHITES are the reason this America-hating nigger got elected, twice.<br><br>Even those fucktards can see what a scumbag liar and his completely failed policies have done to OUR country.<br><br>Nobody is going to vote for Batshit Bernie, Hitlery, or any other raging America-hating beanerlover for POTUS.<br><br>Niggers are even tired of him, and the direction he's gone.

Since his reelection in Wisconsin, he's been in DC nearly the entire time being groomed for a candidacy, so that's all already accounted for as a contingency in the strategy, and when he finally makes the announcement, that contingency becomes part of the strategy. It's like an enormous jigsaw puzzle, figuring out how you can lay all these pieces together so that they all serve their purpose and lead to a victory for the party...<br><br>My sister worked on a GOP national-level election committee thing when Bush was running...

I can't block her on facebook because we need it for work. Right now, I'm out of the country for the rest of the summer and have been seenzoning her for a week. I told her litteraly 5 times to fuck off, but she never takes "no" for an answer (typical feminist cunt). What should I do??  Post screenshots please OP  She wants me to do anal on her and throat fuck her tho. Won't post screenshots for privacy reasons (our profiles pics appear)  Just have her give you a blowjob and let it be done.
