The Day  <br>Pandorum</br>  <br><br>I second this.</br></br>  <br>This, Snowpiercer was a pretty good movie.<br>Lots of food for thought though the ending could've been done better.</br></br>  <br>Kek.

Like, seriously.</br></br></br>  <br>Sure thing kid. Just cause it went way above your empty head...<br><br>Speaking ill of Kubrick is cinematic sacrilege. The man was a god. <br><br>Go watch Transformers or Twilight. Something a little more your level.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Exactly.<br>The movie is a -5 whereas the book sits at about a 5 in the other direction.<br>Movies never beat the books.<br>And the book wasn't great either.</br></br></br></br>  <br>chekd</br>  <br>nobody gonna back this guy up?</br>  <br>edge of tomorrow</br>    <br>Eyes Wide Shut.<br><br>*drops mic*</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, great movie</br>  <br>europa report</br>  <br>Edge of tomorrow/Live die repeat/ Tom cruises fucking ludicrous adventure is alright</br>  <br> Snowpiercer <br>This. This movie fucking BLEW my mind. It's so good.</br></br>  <br>Considering the actual Kubrick cut was never seen by anyone but himself and the studio Execs, we'll never really know what it was supposed to be.<br><br>Still a good film.</br></br></br>  <br>Ex Machina is great, watched it last night. It has like %90 on Rotten Tomatoes.<br><br>It's basically about a super genius guy who builds a fuck doll robot that has human-passable AI.<br><br>Feminist reviews of it are hilariously vitriolic.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Lol. Anyone claiming Eyes Wide shut anything other than complete and utter garbage instantly reveals themselves to be a Kubrick nut-hanger. I.E., completely disqualified from having an opinion.</br>  The Book of Eli was a pretty good watch  <br>Switch it up and watch Akira</br>  I wish there were Shadowrun Movies.  <br>Stay ignorant, retard.<br><br>I'm sure you'll be one of the faggots lined up for 3 days this Dec. waiting to see Star Wars.</br></br></br>  <br>tap dat bitch. hnnng!</br>  <br>Literally Dredd</br>  <br>What a waste of two fucking hours!</br>  Nobody's mentioned Children of Men? Fucking great movie.  <br>Actually pretty awesome movie.</br>  <br>Some amazing cinematography in that flick</br>  <br>Automata, it's a pretty good robots getting sentience type film.<br>Snowpiercer, earth is frozen, people live aboard a fucked up train.<br>The Road, some dude and his son are trying to not die eaten by cannibals in a post-nuclear world.</br></br></br>  <br>It's mediocre at best.</br>  <br>Nah, just first week. I dont need to see it opening night. Better than tom cruise crying in a fucking mask like a faggot for 2 hours.</br>  <br>Not a movie but a mini series.<br><br>Very weird, full of secret societies, brainwashing holograms from your tv, anti-corporate resistance fighters, etc.</br></br></br>  <br>Good fucking movie, even the comics are fucking amazing.</br>  Only Blade Runner gets on this ones level.  <br>Running man was 10/10 Arnold</br>  <br> tom cruise crying for two hours <br><br>If that's all you came away with, there really is no hope for you.<br><br>I guess it didn't have enough 'splosions and cheeky Weadon-esqe one liners to satisfy your refined tastes.</br></br></br></br></br>  watch cube if you haven't seen it. very must watch  Try: Infini, Sunshine, Mr.Nobody, Interstellar, that's just off the top of my head.<br><br>If you want to try some sci fi series, I'm currently watching Ascension. Helix wasn't so bad. I'm not sure. Can anyone name anything else?<br><br> pic related <br>Infini, strangely it was pretty decent. The acting imo was what did it for me. Check it for yourself.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's scary how close our society is getting to the one in the film.</br>  <br>Muh nigga. This is all you need. This or Event Horizon, which isn't dystopian but still a decent watch.</br>  <br>A Boy and His Dog</br>  <br>Read "Brave New World." Its basically exactly that except people have kids. The state still raises them.</br>  <br><br> Black Mirror <br><br>Not a movie, but most certainly interdesting</br></br></br></br>  <br>EH was originally at least 30 mins longer and was far crazier than what we got. The studio wouldn't realise it as it was, and forced the director to recut.<br><br>The footage was lost, but a small piece is floating around on youtube.<br><br>What could have been would have been a horror legend.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I have. Great read. Demolition Man was a play on BNW as well. Lots of references, right down to Sandra Bullock's character's name, Lenina (char from book) Huxley (author).</br>  <br>Brazil</br>  <br>This right here.<br><br>Easily the most wonderfully disturbing things I've seen in years.<br><br>Every episode leaves you thinking for hours afterwards.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That sucks. I always got the feeling that they cut a few of the more graphic scenes from it, would be very interested to see it again now with that extra 30min. <br>Why must studios ruin perfectly good films?</br></br>  <br>Here, I found the one I know about.<br><br>By 90's standards it would have been NC-17 without a doubt.<br><br>http://m.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ZK1deb<wbr>nXYlA</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you even Machinist?</br>  the old mad max movies<br>a boy and his dog<br>the road<br>book of eli<br>I am legend<br>12 monkeys<br>postman</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>do you even the prestige</br>  <br>"the old mad max movies"<br><br>don't even fucking bother, the first one is boring as shit and road warrior is low budget garbage, thunderdome is the only one worth even half a shit and fury road is still 2000000x better</br></br></br>  Blood of Heroes (aka Salute of the Jugger)  <br>thunderdome is awesome</br>  <br>Thanks for that. Look's impressive and I can see what you mean about the rating, for 90's audiences that would have been pretty graphic. Then shit like saw and hostel comes out and it suddenly doesn't look so bad.</br>  <br>are you autistic? or 12? thunderdome is fucking garbage.summerfag</br>  TRON!!!!  Prometheus  <br>also gonna vouch for this one.<br><br>good mini series.</br></br></br>  Children of men  <br>This has to be bait.<br><br>No one can be that clueless.</br></br></br>  <br>Psychopass for ya weeb</br>  <br>This</br>  <br>lol ikr?</br>  <br>If you like animation - fantastic planet.</br>  <br>this</br>  <br>My nigga</br>  Steins;Gate  Adventure Time  Cloud Atlas!  <br>I second this.</br>  <br> Cloud Atlas <br><br><br> Cloud Atlas! </br></br></br></br>  Rick and Morty  Trigun  <br>A movie about driving one road for two hours with no fucking plot. IMDB 8,5/10 seems right, right?</br>  <br>under rated post</br>  <br>Yup</br>  <br>I approve of this post</br>  <br>Steins;Gate was good.<br>The only anime I have ever seen are action-y ones with storylines a four year old could understand (Considering they explain everything, then flashback 2 episodes to re-explain.)<br>Steins;Gate was incredible, if not hard to start and incredibly Weebish.</br></br></br>  <br>El. Psy. Congroo.</br>  <br>Agreed, but that movie deserves some points for how brilliantly made it was technically. It's a beautiful movie, just wasted on the story. Certainly not worth 8.5, 7 maybe.</br>  <br>Still, everyone told me to go to and watch it and after 1 hour i still waited for some sort of story-line to start. The music, props, actions etc was all good tho.</br>  <br>it's good, but not topic-related, since they never show the future</br>  <br>Read a fucking book, no movie gets close to your own imagination, ohh wait you're 13</br>  <br>sepressing</br>  <br>Goddamn she's perfect</br>  <br> I thought that movie wass boring as fuck.
