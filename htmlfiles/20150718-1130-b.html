They aren't bad, I just feel like I always go there just for the giant bag of tits-delicious fries.</br>  Shit, this one looks delicious, OP. Still, i prefer Wendy's ones.  <br>All the best burgers in the world have a fried egg somewhere in them. Also they do not come from a chain.</br>  <br>my friend got fresh ground beef and made big burgers on the grill but it tasted like i was eating a meatloaf sandwhich it wasnt very good and no good flavor. then we had cheap frozen burgers another night and it was great.</br>  smash burger<br>pitstop</br>  <br>gtfo that pre made shit is disgusting. <br>your friend obviously didn't season them</br></br>  <br> i notice i get pimples if i eat greasy burgers. <br><br>I hope for a troll.

I always buy an extra burger from their to eat for lunch the following day.<br>I don't really need to say much about InO.<br>WhataB, tripple meat, double cheese, plain with spicy ketchup.

Because that doesn't exist in the US not at the current prices of meat. Unless of course you're talking about one of those frozen manufactured 50/50 patties...then LOL at you, burger pleb.</br>  I'll stick with a pub sandwich    <br> Not greasy if you grill them at home <br> I will admit that processed cheese is garbage, but it is somehow delicious when melted onto a burger <br><br>Go eat one of your fish pies, <br><br>or ya know<br><br>kill yourself.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This.</br>  <br> inb4 heartattack <br>Is it a common practice to take picture of what you eat in Niggerica?</br></br>  homemade burgers are fucking overrated<br><br>burger king is GOAT</br></br>  <br>Whataburger can be on par with In-n-Out, but it really depends on what town you're in. I grew up in a medium sized town, and WhataB's ranged from great quality to "what the fuck is this stuff on my bun", and small town WhataB's I've been to didn't have anything wrong with them, but they didn't have great quality burgers. Dallas locations all seem to be great about burger quality, though.<br><br>On a side note, how is White Castle burgers? I've heard they're the west coast equivalent of Whataburger, but I've never been to one.</br></br></br>  This  <br>Fuck yeah! Because other countries don't have hidden menu items like "Meat Mountain" at Arby's or the Quad Baconator at Wendy's. They aren't cheap, but damn they're good!!</br>  <br>Foodruckers is really good aswell, any of you been there before?</br>  <br>Probably steak n shakes $4 menu.

Cajun fries are spectacular. <br><br> Checkers/Rallys: Also used to be bigger and more loaded with toppings, but ok every so often. Always get loaded fries. <br><br> Burger King: Meh...if there's nothing else around. <br><br> In-N-Out: Never had it. Want it. Not around here. <br><br> Whataburger: Never had it. Want it. Not around here. <br><br> Everything else: Meh </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A burger isn't a sandwich, fucktard</br>  <br>172. 5'11", so no not a fatty.</br>  <br>*too lazy</br>  <br>Best i ever had, shot a 650kg moose at 250 meters, take it out, let the meat hang for 3 weeks, make burger on moose meat on rye with my own chantellere mushroom, onion and black vineberry gel.</br>    <br>Best burger joint?

I don't know the place you're talking about, but the burger place everyone was raving about when I was there was in Five Points. I can't remember the name of it. But they had some good ass burgers. Also you could play poker there and get drunk.</br>  got a 20 gift cert to south street burger corporation. went over the 20 with a double-patty burger, fries, and milkshake. took forever too. burger was alright, nothing special. free guac. fuck that place. i still go there all the time.  <br><br>Thanks to a hysterically high metabolism, i can (and have) eaten things all day and put on absolutely fuck all weight.<br><br>I will die at 30 though, I'm aware of that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>ever been there?<br><br><br>nah, I think the true american patriots know how to eat these</br></br></br></br>  shake shack master race  <br>No.</br>  <br>I usually do this. I also marinade red onion with lemon. Excellent ingredients are a must for good burgers.</br>  <br>ill agree to this.</br>  <br>I never really liked Five Guys' cajun fries. They always taste like they dump it in a batter filled with paprika and it always tastes dry on the inside, not like Checkers' fries. Also BK is really good if you're looking for a cheap fast food burger. Their Double Cheeseburger is nice and only costs a dollar</br>  why are hotdogs so inferior to everyone i love a dog with lots of onions relish and mustard and some lettuce. not those nasty skinny hot dogs i mean the sausage or smokie ones  <br>Of course.

I make burgers that people say are better than five guys or in-n-out or whatevever.<br><br>Here's what I do:<br><br>80-85% lean ground beef. Dump it out into a bowl in one big piece. Season with black pepper and salt. Crumble it up. You are NOT mashing it like play dough. Just move it around a bit. If you start mashing, you lose. The idea is to be able to see those 'noodle' shapes, same as they were in the packaging. You don't need any binder, it holds together on its own because you didn't mash it into a pink paste.<br><br>Take about 4 ounces of meat, shape it into a ball, slowly squash it flat. The center has to be thinner than the edges, and it has to be thinner and of a larger radius than you think is right - it will shrink in radius and also fatten up vertically.<br><br>Grill it or put it in a fry pan on the stove. They're thin so a hot fire takes no time at all to cook them. Remember to let them rest a couple of minutes.<br><br>Add toppings. Use a soft bun.<br><br>This is how the popular burger chains do it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>no the pickled pepper you fuckchild<br>all kebabs come with a pickled pepper</br></br>  <br>McHerpes</br>  <br>North Korea? Well...that could work. If you go there and tell ol' Kim you'll make propaganda videos for him as an American defector talking about how much better North Korea is than the US, he might set you up with a decent life.<br><br><br>Oh no, I know. They have some weird cultural ideas, and they're not very tolerant of things outside the cultural norm. But at least they're of a mind to let men be men and women be women. And at least they aren't crazy religious.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You can buy a grill skillet, buying higher grade meat also helps.</br>  <br> $17 <br><br>I mean I guess I saw it coming considering you have three burgers with about 4 patties each</br></br></br>  <br>don't...don't say such things. ate white castle the other day for the first time...IT...WAS...FUCKING...DELI...<wbr>eh alright.<br><br>A lot like Krystals</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>Cause it is.</br>  Masta race burger  <br>i had a bike so i would drive under the barrier and go get everyone mc D's and shakes i'd get back with a hiking bag full of burgers and a bunch a shakes on my gastank</br>  <br>I've been thinking about it for a while.

Lol</br>  <br>have you even seen the video? its a suprise that the guy even came. she sucks and sucking, keeps stopping, complains that he "keeps choking" her when he puts his hands on her head. she is hot in a celebrity way, but she wouldn't be able to get me off with those dick sucking skills</br>  <br>prove me wrong</br>  <br>Is she actually coming here? Look at those nipples hardening. Sauce?</br>  <br>yes</br>  <br>And who is that?</br>    <br>lol this is prof its NOT HER!!</br>  <br>Or it's a photoshopped version of the right side picture. It's literally the exact same pose</br>  <br>I can't see filenames, whose tits are these?</br>  <br>It's Hayden.</br>  <br>How is that proof it's not her?</br>  <br><br><br><br>its audrey bastien<br>though the refliction does look a HELL of a lot like Isabelle Fuhrman http://starsmaster.com/a/audrey_bas<wbr>tien_01/</wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  Julianna Guill  <br>It's the same pose, but not the same angle. It's a comparison of Miley making the same face, proving it's her in the BJ pic, it's not the same picture.</br>  <br>Her name is Roberta Paulson</br>    <br>I didnt read your post, and you provided only plausibility for me. <br><br>On one hand, that could be a legit pic, but on the other, this could have also been used to create a very nice shoop.</br></br></br>  <br><br>It's Avril Lavigne. Here's another old nude of her.</br></br>  <br>No corroborating pics, nothing similar. Someone just posted it one day and said HP. They could equally have said some other blonde.</br>    <br>Who is she?</br>  <br>Uh no, they couldn't, because it's from this specific photoshoot of Hayden. See same bathroom.</br>  <br><br>Better in the dreamers. You see her bush.</br></br>  <br>No it couldn't, because those are just comparing her face pose, they're all at different angles than the actual pic.</br>  <br>sauce?</br>  <br>Lizzy Caplan</br>  <br>Jennifer Carpenter</br>  <br>It's the same pose, but it's at a different angle. You couldn't change it like that in photoshop.<br><br>The image is proving that the face in the pic is Miley's. There's also a load of other proof to do with the pic and when it was taken, as well as the resolution/lighting etc.</br></br></br>  <br>film sauce you stupid cunt</br>  Look if they're in a nude scene in movies and you can't see their face then 9/10 times they're fucking body doubles.  Rose Leslie (Ygritte in GOT) and her fine body  <br>I know this is from true detective but is she a relevant actress any other roles whats her name</br>  <br>Which has what to do with this thread? None of them apply here.</br>  <br>Thanks, Great Quad Satan.</br>    <br>Lilli Simmons, also in Banshee</br>  <br>My FUCKING nigger.</br>  Lady gaga crowd surf? anyone ?

A 100 Mbps Fiber optic connection are also being offered by PLDT and Globe in selected villages in the country for ₱ 20,000.00 a month ($440 USD/month) which is so overpriced compared to their neighboring country Singapore where a 1 Gbps fiber optic connection only costs as low as $49.99 SGD or ₱ 1,680.00 which is still cheaper than a 3 Mbps DSL connection in the Philippines.

But who knows, it gave me negative chills and was fucking awesome at the same time</br>  <br> 60 minutes <br> facts <br><br>you must be retarded? kek.</br></br></br></br>  <br>sorry anon, smh is not a great source for anything factual.</br>  <br>damn, i would be shitting my pants while holding my tears in panic<br><br>would be dope tho</br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=oJ_<wbr>t1eOAipo</wbr>  [ ]  <br>i wont watch it because you cant post embedable links, u fokin wankah</br>  <br>the fuck is this shit</br>  <br>Literally nothing better in the world than getting stoned and watching Shaye Saint John vids.</br>  imho people rather weird VHS  <br>Modern Way of Learning</br>  <br>i wish i could experience what the fuck that was like. its been heard worldwide but barely talked about</br>  <br>Before the NBN rollout, 2.5 mbps was average in Australia.</br>  <br>i dont even know whats going on anymore m8</br>  wow. i have never seen so many motherfuckers with dangerously low IQs in one place for quite some time.<br><br><br>  australia <br>  similar speeds <br><br>hahahaha. fuck off, idiot.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  This is older than the upload date on youtube. I first watched it on kazaa.  <br>22 min into the doc about him</br>    <br>NOPE</br>  Daisy's Destruction<br>The Grifter<br><br>Either of those will change you</br></br></br>  <br>Nothing but chills and confusion. Reminds me of the alien over the millitary base in GTA V</br>  <br>Seriously, I think these people just wanted to fuck around with some crutches for shits and giggles</br>  <br> 2.5 Megabits per second (Mbps) <br><br>Recommended System Specifications for Broadcasting<br><br>Quad Core CPU<br>4GB RAM<br>1500Kbps upload bandwidth<br>Dedicated video card, 512MB VRAM<br>Windows Vista / Windows 7<br>Mac OS X 10.5 or higher (v20.0.89)<br>Mac OS X 10.6 or higher (v20.2.0)<br><br>You're retarded. I can't believe you're still trying to defend your shitty point. Even if the average speeds are 2.5, this is more than enough to broadcast. I live in Australia. Although we have speeds up to 8mbps, other plans still have up to 1-2mbps. Before the rollout, average speeds were around 2.5. Why are you so autistic? It was reported in most news outlets that he livestreamed it. Even though you'd normally want a bandwidth higher than 2.5 for HD streaming, you could still livestream lesser quality. The same level of quality as your shitty posts. It just sounds like your feelings got hurt and you're desperately trying to defend your point even though it's wrong by telling everyone to kill themselves and that they're idiots. It makes you look like a faggot.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i always liked this video, its so meaningful about human nature</br>  <br>thats intense, right on man.</br>  <br>See </br>  You guys not done with this streaming in indonesia shit yet? faaack, no wounder why you get called autistic super neckbeards.
