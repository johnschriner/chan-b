And the possessions thing is fine, I know this sounds horrible and insensitive but if it makes him happy, it's good, and you can just wait for him to pass then sell any of it that you don't want/need. As far as I can see all you can really do is just be there to support them both, and keep the atmosphere pleasant. Like you said, keeping a positive outlook.</br>  <br> Try online dating, or at least meeting people online and then develop a friendship into dating. That way, there's no pressure of having to be around someone or do stuff, but still an emotional connection. Then when and if you're ready, you can choose to meet them without that beginning pressure of someone new. <br><br>Thx for the advice, but i don't think i can.
