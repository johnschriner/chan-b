Soooooo, A.    moar here  <br><br><br><br><br>WHEN YOU PLAY THE GAME OF DUBS YOU GET OR YOU DIE</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>this thread is dubs and full of terror</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Read the picture without reading OP#s message. Look down and see: <br>See OP's message: "Choices thread" <br>Read it as, Cringe thread. <br>Everything looks regular.<br>Realize it's a 'choices thread'?<br>Prefer the first.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>all men must die.<br><br>do you want to go out in an epic battle or have some preteen girl zap you?<br><br>also the chance of getting pussy in westeros is much higher.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I would have to go with A. You see, the actual story of Mr. Potter is only, wild estimate here, like 1/1,000 of all the magic culture they had. The books really were poorly written about these details. Perhaps because in a world where magic is the pure essence of culture that it would be way too much to endure in order for the story to be present and clear. I mean, the only magic/magical history/magical relics/creatures used were those that were necessary to the story. They even published small pocket indexes with more information in the 56 pages they each had than the books themselves. Hell, look at a series like LOTR. Tolkien's series has way more intuitive depth. I'm sure they could definitely dive deeper with the Potter series, but whatever. That being said, I would choose A and do what I could to learn as much as a world like that had could offer.</br>    <br>The chances of getting an STD in Westeros is much higher...<br><br>also<br><br> being stuck in a castle with hundreds of teenage girls most of the year, for 7 years <br><br>I think I'd go with A myself</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>what is this</br>  <br>why didn't every wizard in the world just team up to kill voldemort?</br>  <br>Circle</br>  <br>The Heart.</br>  zombies<br>fuck u n*ggers</br>  <br>because magic apparently makes people lazy and beta, they don't even have a standing army. I also don't undestand how any witch or wizard (including voldemort himself) can be scared of death.. there are actual fucking ghosts floating around. doesn't that prove the existence of an afterlife for them?</br>  the fuck's goin on in this thread, dubs and trips and quads and shit everywhere  <br>you're seperated from the girl and under constant survalence in castle proven to be riddled with booby traps, dangerous animals, curses, and a fourth of your class mates are evil. come to think of it plenty of people have died at hogwarts including seeral students before harry even arrives there.</br>  <br>Because tge wizardry world isn't all about magic that kills people and cool wars and battles. The wizards in their world used magic as a tool of everyday life, it's sort like a form of technology. It can be used to kill people and do battles, yes, but that's not what magic is mainly used for in the Harry potter series.</br>  <br>Wasn't it written that he specifically had to kill himself by killing Harry?</br>   not picking hogwarts <br> not wanting to learn dick enlargement spell <br> not wanting to fuck your classmates with your giant wizard cock <br> not creating a secret sex club within hogwarts <br> not wanting to befriend hagrid  <br><br> picking Westeros and more than likely die before you hit 20 </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah and in the second to last film didn't they have a potion or a spell that could instantly heal mortal wounds?</br>  <br>Hey, I'm all for the idea that they should have combined some sort of CQC system with magic, but that's how it was pUT on paper. Would have made for a much more interesting story.</br>    <br>Hogwarts without a doubt.

So I have a gf I've had for 11 months now and things are pretty okay. Until yesterday. Had to work while the gf went to a 4th of July party. No big deal I just told her to make sure to not get too drunk (we're both 18). So I just got a text telling me that yesterday, she and a friend had been "taken advantage of" by a friend of hers while they were "too drunk to even walk". So what should I do /b/? I mean, a certain level of responsibility obviously has to be taken as she got wayyy too drunk (according to her) I think I'm gonna have to take a break from our relationship. But I don't know. I really do love her. Please help me guys..<br> pic unrelated </br>  <br> she has been raped before <br>I'm starting to think that OP is a troll.</br></br>  <br> "taken advantage of" <br><br>You mean she is actually saying she's been raped and you want to take break...<br><br>Yeah, take a break, you cunt. She deserves better...</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Go ahead and think that. It's the truth. She's had a fucked up life. She's kinda broken.</br>  You know what to do.  <br>The one good one so far. Have a cookie.</br>  <br>brilliant</br>  <br>kek</br></blockquote>]
