[ In this thread I pretend to be a psychologist.<br><br>Tell me your problems anon and I will help you.</br></br>  <br>No warranties on help given, help must be returned within 30 days if unsatisfactory.</br>  I don't have any motivation, I can't get out of the bed and I really want to die.  why am I such a faggot?  <br>Well you won't be able to kill yourself if you can't get out of bed so I guess the practical options are off the table. Any idea why you feel this way?</br>  <br>Either you like men or you're OP and it seems like I'm OP.</br>  <br><br>Maybe an easy life?</br></br>  <br>I am an ugly 300lp balding 24 year old with a tiny penis who is afraid of making any sort of relationships with another human being and works part time in retail with no motivation to move up the ladder.</br>  <br>Well I'm going to take a guess here, you're saying you have an easy life so you feel like the world has not been particularly rough on you. Had a family that sheltered you and made sure your needs were met, got through school and such with no real difficulty. But still you don't care, nothing seems interesting and you're sitting here on the internet absently browsing trying to think back and figure out why. Why do you feel this way when nothing was really ever that bad? Maybe its because it was never that bad? Maybe you lacked challenge, or obstacles or some sort of essential vitalness and that's why everything seems so anemic? <br><br>I dunno, not a bad guess. Do you think that's right?</br></br></br>  <br>Part time retail is a dead end trap and I can't imagine you don't know this. Your lifes ambition was never to be shift manager at target, of course you don't give a shit. But why are you afraid of making relationships with anybody?</br>   tfw I'll never be a girl   <br>I don't know, I just am...</br>  <br>Do you think they'd reject you even if you tried?<br><br><br>Would you like to be teh little girl anon?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Well...life wasn't that easy...Mother was an alcoholic and bulimic and shiet. But besides that...never had real obstacles.<br><br>Yeah, I think you're right. The problem is that I have not the motivation, strenght or whatever to go outside and seek a challenge. And of course, complete it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Anon, I want to have wild sex with corpses</br>  <br>Sounds like 'easy life' maybe isn't the best description here. What was going on with all that?</br>  I repeatedly start projects and am incredibly enthusiastic about said projects, but then lose any inspiration, motivation or drive about half way through and never actually complete them. Hell, I've been working on a video game for the past 2 years, and it's been on hold for the last few months because I just lost all motivation but don't want to actually give up on it.  Why am I always alone.  <br>Well it might be wild on your end but keep in mind they're going to be a little unresponsive. Any type of corpse in particular you'd like to have sex with?</br>  I still hate fucking Dominicans.  <br>Not so much reject as just I usually become another face they have to acknowledge any time they see it but never anything more.</br>  <br>I'd suggest suicide, it's your only option.</br>  <br>I can dress and act feminine, but my body will always be hulking and gross and masculine. Even HRT and SRS can only do so much.</br>  <br>Sad thing about the world is that the dream of something and the fact of doing it are rarely the same. What was it that got you excited about all these projects of yours?<br><br><br>Well there's different kinds of alone. There's the literal kind where you're not around people and there's other kinds where even if you're around people you feel no kinship, no common humanity with them and staying in their company just feels forced and draining and lonely. Are you one of those kinds of lonely or some other kind?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Try cutting bits off</br>  <br>I was excited about them for various reasons, but they were always things I really enjoyed and was interested in, still am. Multiple games I started making, 2 different books, a webcomic series that never even got any uploaded, only sketches drawn..</br>  <br>Yes, I like cute dead girls, like the ones that are of legal age but look younger than it</br>  <br>The second kind, everyday I tell myself it's gonna change, that I'll go out and make friends and live life, but I'm so out of touch with my own humanity, that all that ever happens is I distance myself whether I like it or not. I just want a friend.</br>  <br>Me too buddy.<br><br><br>Well that's another kind of rejection, they'll acknowledge you but only shallowly. Never really be your friend or lover or anything else. That's still pretty shitty.<br><br><br>Godamnit anon<br><br><br>Well maybe you can be feminine at heart even if your shoulders are always gonna be a dead give away. What part of femaleness is it that you want to be? Not all of it's great, I'd suggest skipping some parts.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So fake lolis, hm? I must admit, those are tempting. But you must be careful anon, try getting a job in a morgue or graveyard. That should give you plenty of easy access to your new cold-fleshlights</br>  <br>I think you need a psychologist or therapist yourself OP, you're talking to yourself..</br>  <br>I got this pain behind my right eye and sometimes when i wake up i'm super sensitive to light and no nightvision whatsoever. No actual headaches but i get eye pains. How do i solve my depression?</br>  <br>You're telling me, buddy. Also<br> tfw you will never hug a Ran sensually </br></br>  I am going through a rough time. I got caught smoking weed and now am on probation, my girlfriend left me, I can't get a job, and I haven't really had a friend for a month now. I don't know what the fuck to do.  <br> implying OP is the only one who can post Ran </br>  <br>Smoke more weed, DUH!</br>  <br>Can't I get drug tested every week.</br>  <br>Bullets help, try applying them to the eye and general face area.<br><br><br>Try growing shrooms, they're easy to grow, kids will happily buy off you because they're dumb, and even if they don't, free shrooms.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What video game r u making? Jumping cats? Kek</br>  <br> Implying I'm not the other one posting Ran </br>  <br>I did though and now i got that shit from previous post. Kinda just makes me depressed which makes my depression that much worse.</br>  <br>Well there's 2, my main project and a small side one I started recently. Pick one and I'll describe.</br>  <br>Graveyards are kinda spooky...<br>I think I'll go with the morgue, thank you very much!</br></br>  <br>Well here's a way to think about this that might help. There's a difference between motivation and discipline. Motivation is about that push to do something, express something and the joy you take in doing it. Discipline has very little to do with that, its about habit plain and simple. So is it lack of motivation or lack of discipline that's stopping you here?<br><br><br>I'm not sure of the legalities here but maybe you could find some corpses of 16 year olds that have been sitting out a couple years and they'd be legal?<br><br><br>Well I guess the place to start is, what would you like to talk about and share with a friend?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why not both? :)</br>  <br>Hmm.. Seems like you need some way of relieving your sadness so you can focus more on getting your life back on track. Try buying a fleshlight, or getting a pet.<br><br><br>Happy to help anon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think it's more the motivation. It's kinda like writer's block. Like I know exactly what I wanna do next, I just can't be bothered actually putting in the effort to do it. So I'm just stuck here with half-finished projects.</br>  <br>I got into a car accident yesterday and went into shock for almost 2 hours despite having minimal injuries what's wrong with me?</br>  <br>Just stupid normal shit<br>"How's your day?"<br>"Good"<br><br>It's becoming more and more of a struggle everyday. I just want to be normal.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But wouldn't the corpses become spooky skeletons then?<br>I don't want to have sex with such a scary thing...</br></br>  <br>Sounds like it might be migraines, see a non-pretend doctor for that one. Depression depends, why are you depressed?<br><br><br>Step at a time. Weed isn't super serious unless it was a felony somehow, ignore it move on with your life anyone who'll really judge you for smoking weed is an asshat. Rest you're going to have to put in some work. Which one is the biggest priority for you?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well my main is simple, just something to see what I can and can't do really. Stereotypical adventure RPG with fantasy elements. Set in an alternate world where we never discovered electricity, so we're stuck in simpler times. You, as the main protagonist, have had your town under siege for years by a nearby warlord. But he's gone too far recently, kidnapping many members of your town, including your mother and sister, to breed his armies. You have to get them back, travelling a massive world, collecting allies, completing tasks and eventually saving your family. Lots of easter eggs and plot twists along the way, of course.</br>  My life is going downhill. Recently ended things with a significant other, and am devastated. I haven't eaten in about 2 days, and feel as if I won't find love anymore. What do?  <br>I'm a tertiary bimutual semitransparent pelagic parasexual double reverse quadruple gendered demiuniversal quintessential roboplatonic transmasculin omninigger.<br><br>what should I do is this dangerous?</br></br></br>  <br>I have several fleshlights and 2 dogs and 2 cats. Hobbies do nothing. Social obligations feel like shackles. Can't even enjoy cooking anymore.</br>  <br>Cutting in here with random advice. It's called self discipline. Motivation is a thought that drives you to do something but self discipline is more of a sub conscious, built in leant thought that makes you do the things you don't want to do easier. Try being extra hard on yourself for a while and persevere an finish a project even though u don't want to. The more u do that the easier motivation will come.</br>  <br>You're a wimpy faggot.</br>  <br>Hm. Cooking just gave me an idea. Stick your head in the oven for a while, when it's on of course.</br>  <br>Probably. I ended up being taken to the hospital despite not wanting to go</br>  <br>I'll try giving that a go, pushing to complete one of my smaller projects. Thanks anon, even if you're not OP.</br>  <br>You're getting better at doing the same style but you're using way different filenames still.<br><br><br>Which one do you want to get finished the most? and why?<br><br><br>Shit's scary, you could have died, holy shit. How're you feeling?<br><br><br>Normals overrated, sounds more like you want to be liked and accepted no?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Yeah, liked and accepted is more like it, I don't know why I won't change.</br>  <br><br>The side project one was just something I had the idea for and got really excited about, as something small to fill my time and help me think of ideas for the main. It's kinda like a mini-game, several little ones in one. You start off as a character in one of 4 situations, each with a different aim, but the character is always the one least suspected normally. For example, there's one where you play as a toddler. Your mother was recently murdered, and your father was a suspect but cleared of any suspicion after an investigation. Only you know that really, you did it. Your aim is to frame your father with the murder, without being detected or injured as it could lead to suspicion. And of course, as that character you have all the limitations of a baby/toddler.</br></br>  <br>Have a bite to eat. Might feel appropriate but starving yourself won't actually do much lol. Why do you think you won't find love again?<br><br><br>Sounds like it might be contagious<br><br><br>That's a good call, whiplash and brain damage often don't show right away. You could have been concussed to shit and had no idea. Human's aren't made for impacts like that. Did you have a headache or anything the day after?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The one I WANT to get done the most is definitely my main game, it's been the one I've worked on longest and put the most into, plus I feel like it could actually have good outcomes for me, whereas the others would just be "There, done.". With the game I could sell it, or put it online, or even try get it on Steam greenlight.</br>  I can take criticism easily, but when my friends insult me i burst into tears.<br>Other than a fag, why does this happen?</br>  <br>My friend suddenly stopped talking to me after getting a boyfriend<br>It's been 6 months already</br></br>  <br>I don't feel like eating though. Whenever I get depressed I don't eat, and when I try, I get nauseous. Also, I'm very unnatractive and shy around females. My last relationship, we were in a situation where we didn't see eachother often, so I didn't have to constantly try to make myself look good for her. I don't think I can find that again.</br>  <br>Well sounds like something is up. I'm not sure if it's your problem but you seem pretty convinced. What's going on? What do you need to change?<br><br><br><br>Have you considered putting a demo or a beta up on itch.io or somewhere similar? A little exposure and interaction with real people might do wonders for your motivation.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I tried that too. It didn't work so i thought i'd be classy and go traditional and make headcheese but my jowls refuse to render.</br>  <br>That might be ok actually. I could try getting one of the games to a point where it's not bug-ridden and at least playable, and stick a demo version up somewhere. I'll do it, and I already know where I have to get to first. Thanks anon, you're my motivation for today. &lt;3</br>  <br>Chemical depression. Lack of serotonin means i'm physically incapable of happy thoughts. Meds they gave me almost killed me and gave me permanent memory problems so meds are out of the equation.</br>  <br>How about I try you then OP?<br><br>I'd say based on what you've said already, you're male, in your late 20's, maybe early 30's. You're relatively settled with your life and career, but you feel as if you lack a proper purpose. You strive to fulfill your boredom and pass the time by somehow maybe helping others and tending to their issues, as you can understand some yourself; after all, you've had a life of bumps and troubles along the way. So now you come to /b/ and set up this thread, maybe even gaining a slight sense of satisfaction from the advice you give to these people. And once the thread inevitably 404's, you'll go back to your monotony, but perhaps you'll be lucky enough to retain some slight glimmer of that satisfaction and pride. I doubt it though. After all, you're just one person out of billions, a speck on the universe. Insignificant overall.</br></br></br>  <br>Well a friend insulting you isn't the same as a teacher critiquing your work or something like that. The insult implies something about your relationship to the friend, at a guess maybe you're more bothered by that? I dunno, can you give me an example?<br><br><br>Start slow, tea and some crackers. Sounds like you're working under the assumption that unless you work really hard at it you're unlovable and women won't care for you. Do you think that's true? and if so why?<br><br><br>Are you a guy and she's a girl? If so that sucks but you can probably guess why right?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I have brain tumours. <br>Do I kill myself?<br>If yes, please tell me how.</br></br></br>  <br>Quickly and painlessly, bullet through brain. Hell, stream it, maybe then you'll have some love from /b/ when you an hero on cam.</br>  <br>Water is boiling at the moment, I'll try some crackers and tea. In all of my life, the only way I've gotten attention is if I put myself out there more-so than I usually enjoy doing. When i'm just "me", no one really gives a shit.</br>  <br>I am able to masturbate to almost everything except coprophilia, why is that?<br><br>PS:I am masturbating right now</br></br></br>  One of my employees is really cute, but she won't come to bed with me. What should I do?  <br>Quads of truth.</br>  <br>Roofies.</br>  <br>Glad to hear it, next time you see one of these threads post a link to that game so we can try it!<br><br><br>Ok lets test that theory. I want you to imagine an empty field with green grass stretching as far as you can see, you look over to the left and notice a figure looking out at the horizon, it's adolf hitler leader of the third reich. A single tear runs down his face. Why? You follow his gaze. A blue whale is floating in the sky with a giant yamika, and is masturbating furiously while mockingly throwing the nazi salute at hitler. At any point during this description did you feel a twinge of amusement?<br><br><br>Not bad, not quite settled but stable enough to support the mental space for a hobby like this. Bit late at night for me to be doing this if I'm untroubled and just looking for something to be proud of tho no?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe they gave a shit and just didn't express it as much, because you were being normal. If you're putting yourself out there you're more likely to attract more attention, but not necessarily the good kind. And I'm glad you're trying to eat something.<br><br><br>I think you're just a horny little devil, solved.<br><br> (You)<br>Quads, nice, and now you've got the filenames closer. Advice is still obviously different though :P<br><br><br>Honestly, give up. She may be cute, but that doesn't mean she should necessarily have to sleep with you. Be careful, if she says anything to HR you could lose your job. You'll find someone anon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>My psychologist isn't a true psychologist. What can I do?</br>  <br>I'm getting sloppy with this.<br> (You) </br></br>  <br>Nothing, you're saving money so it's good.</br>  <br>Possibly. I guess I should just be myself more, and attract people that would actually know that I'm quiet and shit. People expect me to be outward if they meet me when I'm being outward, eh? Thank you, anon. You've been a great help.</br>  <br> Next time you see one of these threads <br>You gonna make this a regular thing OP?</br></br>  <br>God, you're a good fake psychologist.</br>  <br>I want to commit suicide. How should I go about doing this?</br>  <br>I did not cry while playing the last of us, does that make me the reincarnation of satan?</br>  <br>It's not late for me, so I didn't factor that in. Whereabouts in the world are you?<br><br><br>No, I'm the fake fake psychologist. The fake psychologist is over here <br> That's boring though, so I think I'll join them and try actually offering help.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait and see, cancer's kinda tricky sometimes it just spontaneously remits on you and you're fine.<br><br><br>Well that kind of puts you in a nasty bind. If you're yourself no one cares, but if you do what you need to to get attention its only because you acted like something you're not and that shit's hollow and takes a lot of energy to keep up. I can see the issue. So if that's how it is why'd you decide to break up with this girl? Or did she break up with you?</br></br></br></br>  <br>The other guy's filenames are all MD5 hashes. They're 32 letters long and only contain the numbers 0-9 and letters a-f, and can be generated with the md5sum program.</br>  <br><br>See </br></br>  I feel like i don't have an identity. I feel like i'm fake, and everything about me is fabricated.  <br>Thanks, but I think I'm gonna start actually helping them instead of impersonation. I'll start posting with wallpapers, so the anons can tell us apart.</br>  <br>What bothers you about your psychologist?<br><br><br>That was a nice touch lol<br><br><br>I'm going to be horribly sporadic but around every now and then.<br><br><br>Round 6:26 am</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Welcome to life as an average person.</br>  <br>Everyone is like that?</br>   I am very mentally ill.  <br>I am boy who dresses as girl and wishes to be one every. I want to become a cute animu girl someday but I'm not sure I'm ready to override my penis with filthy vagina.<br>What do?</br></br>  <br>Bc that would make me feel better.</br>  <br>Why do you think that? Do you find yourself purposely acting differently or lying to people? Perhaps you fear they might reject you if they knew the real you? Try meeting some people online, I've always found those are the ones I'm the most genuine and honest with, since there can't be any real world consequences.<br><br><br>Florida? Ohio? Somewhere around there, I know Florida is in that time zone.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Join the club</br>  Starting a sock folder and dumping what I have so far.

The switching of foots and popping the shoulder is a common technique to get more power in hooks.<br>It is one of the first things you learn, how to use foot work for stepping out and countering. Your feet ends up in a straight line so when you shift body weight from the left to the right or vice versa you get a lot more momentum.</br></br></br>  <br>Loved that movie.</br>  <br>if you have a license to box (or other kind of fighting) it's classed as a weapon in the UK</br>  <br>That's great, provide a citation.<br><br>Also,<br> License to box </br></br></br></br>  <br>if he was a southpaw he would've helped him up with his left hand, not his right.

They have no gloves blocking is not going to work.<br>The only reasonable thing to do is to step out to the side by moving your other leg back and pop the shoulder diagonally.<br>Which is exactly what he did. This puts you in an excellent position to counter with a hook.<br>Which is exactly what he did. It is a reflex, the hook serves two purposes. The first is that you can hit your opponent, normally though it is just to break his rhythm because you are in an awkward position with your feet. So you hook and move back as a defensive move.<br><br>This black kid is not a fighter so he got hit. <br><br>Does it look clean?
