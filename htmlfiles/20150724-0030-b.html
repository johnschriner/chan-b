Oh als Kölner so eine Antipathie? Ich arbeite in ossendorf, die meisten haben da nichts gegen Dortmund :p</br>  <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleur<wbr>isy<br>that can happen with too much water and ice in the bong. i was talking about frequent ice bong use, like for your everyday toke.<br>i cant find a vap for a good price i want a nice handy thing, preferably wood and other nice natural workmaterials. got any suggestions?</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>Ne, wo lebst du denn. FC und BVB haben seit längerem ne Fanfreundschaft, der BVB is mein zweitliebster Verein. Ich wohn direkt bei Ossendorf, was arbeitest du denn?<br>Verkauft uns mal den Großkreuz, wir brauchen nen neuen Holzkopf als Poldi Ersatz</br></br>  <br>Der watzke hört leider nicht mehr auf mich.. Köln wäre perfekt für ihn. Ich bin network engineer bei nem ansässigen isp, komme egtl aus Dormagen</br>  <br>hash pipe</br>  <br>the vaponic is boro glass, stainless steel and 100% medical silicone. its what i use, but it looks like a crack pipe. 30€ on amazon. usage is ok, but has a learning curve to avoid combustion and the hot glass can shatter and burn you. Closest you can get to a joint. use a torch<br>if you like bongs</br></br>  <br>Nice, bin Fachinformatiker für Systemintegration in der Lehre. Also ähnliche Schiene wie du. <br><br>I was looking for something that could vape ground nugs and stuff. is that even possible for a hand vap?</br></br></br>  https://<span>youtu.be/SXRbPda6ZK0?t=6s  [ ]  <br>Sogar die selbe Schiene um genau zu sein :)</br>  <br>That's so ironic.</br>  <br>:D <br>Sehr gut, ich hoffe du hast nen netten Arbeitgeber und verdienst gut. ich hab extrem glück, hab gleitzeit, genug urlaub, chef is korrekt, kaffeemaschine und kühlschrank immer gefüllt. azubi gehalt ist zwar mager aber mehr als andere azubis und das einstiegsgehalt ist super wenn ich denn mal fertig bin.</br></br>  <br>if you like bongs, try the vapostar. just a stainless steel diffusor, but you will inhale the exhaust of the lighter flame. So use a torch. weed needs to be grinded, not with the vaponic. needs restirring and regrinding with your fingers, not with the vaponic. Head is untreated walnut. dont like the wooden taste.<br>those two are the only ones i tried, so far. both around 30 €. maybe the vapman or the vapbong. all manual with good materials</br></br>  Yo anons if you need a good vaporizer I recommend the "vapor genie". it's a handheld vape that requires a lighter to work, but damn does it hit... You can get it online for about 50 usd. Best way to quickly consume cannabis flower in my opinion  1g its like 4€ here  <br>just break off a peace of weed, cram it in the vaponic, done.<br>the others i mentioned later all require grinding and regrinding.</br></br>  <br>"here" <br>where? columbia?</br></br>  <br>spain</br>  <br>totally forgot that one. didnt try it and opinions vary. my two cents: uses standard lighter, means sooth in your lungs. torch operated ones produce less sooth and vapes like the vaponic or vapman are heated before use, so no lighter exhaust at all.</br>  <br>noice, from where do you get it? dirty gypsys? <br>I got high in barcelona once in some hidden hash bar a local chick lead us. was pretty awesome, i wish we had stuff like that in germany</br></br>  <br>yes, gypsys have the best prices if u know them. But here its allowed to grow at home for personal use.</br>  <br>hey look<br><br>this thread is still here<br>guess I'll get high wit ya'll</br></br></br></br>  Okay sir, that'll be $26.99 + $20 tip<br><br>Give me the tip</br></br>  <br>Heres $2. Dont ask for a tip next time and I might give more.</br>    <br>I asked for mountain dew btw</br>  MWF i live in scotland and tips dont exist<br><br>MWF i visited amerifat and didnt give 1 top the whole time<br><br>i wont pay your wages, negotiate a pay rise or leave, im not your charity</br></br></br></br>  <br> trying this hard to troll </br>  <br>Here 25$ keep the change</br>   tip <br> clearly picking it up from the store </br>  <br>well I'm telling you that's what happened, I didn't leave any tips. I'm not poor, I just wont pay your wages so the boss doesn't have to.</br>  <br>That makes literally no sense whatsoever.</br>  <br>It makes perfect sense. But not tipping just means your a complete dousche bag. At least I give a dollar.</br>  <br>I DIDINDU ORDER NUFIN</br>  <br>well faticans say tipping is essential because they dont make much money doign those jobs ;_;<br><br>Don't take the job or negotiate a pay rise. I'm not making up for it<br><br>Why would I pay you for doing your job and bringing me a box?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You realize how retarded that is?? you know damn well someone has to have that job to cater to your needs. The fact that you think you're better than them because you were able to get a decent job says a lot about what kind of person you are. Or maybe you don't even have a job, maybe you just sit at home all day shitposting on /b/ waiting for your mom to get home from work so you can ask her for money.</br>  <br>Imagine a world where steelworkers solicited a couple of $ from motorists at junctions.<br><br>This is completely normalised and nobody bats an eyelid.<br><br>They do this because their line manager at the mill thought he could save on wages if the beneficiaries of the steel covered some of the cost.<br><br>They don't unionise and campaign for better wages because they think they're getting a good deal by begging motorists for loose change.<br><br>Motorists give them the money because they'll look 'inconsiderate' if they don't.<br><br> this is completely normal to Mericunts </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Maybea if that all those "someones" had some dignity not to be bum fucked and taken advantage of the industry would HAVE to change? nah didn't think your fat american brain would handle that.<br><br>People like you are EXACTLY why this system exists.. they rely on guilt tripping an individual into paying their fucking wages, if people stopped, then the system would stop.. but then how would you get your big fat pizzas?<br><br>fat cunt</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>EXACTLY</br></br>  <br>fuck you nigga! racist muthafucka. imma spit on ur pizza. da gas in my 300 sittin on 24 inch chrome isnt cheap, stupid cracka.</br>   2015 <br> Tipping <br> HA </br></br>  <br>Right I get your point as I said you made sense the first time. But I as a person can't change that fact, so why be a dick and let the delivery workers get rear ended, an extra dollar won't kill you.</br>  <br>No. If people stopped tipping people would have even more reason to be worried about missing rent payments, giving up one thing to make sure their 2 year old kid has food. Then they move back into their parents house because they cant afford to keep an apartment, and they cant find a new job because people like you turn them away for lack of experience. Whats wrong with giving what you've earned to someone less fortunate?? Nothing, you're just a greedy pathetic loser, plain and simple.</br>  <br>This is a completely ridiculous analogy.<br><br>There are no steelworkers left in America.</br></br></br>  <br>10/10</br>  <br><br>What he's saying is that you are right in that tipping just continues the cycle of the bosses not paying at least minimum wage. But your boycott of not tipping just fucks over the little people (I.e deliviery drivers). It's just a matter of moral sense and integrity at that point. I've met some vets who got fucked over and some college kids who are barely making it and even gave em an extra 10 bucks. Think about it.</br></br>  <br>This. It's like being pissed off at the ref for a bad call and taking it out on the players.</br>   you goddamn black bastard, fuck  <br> you and your tip. Get the fuck off <br> my doorstep and go back to your  <br> ghetto <br><br>H-h-here's your $20. Thanks so much.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>trolling this hard<br> as if people with cars like that do an honest days work </br></br>  In Britain a Tip is a reward for work well done, not payment for a job completed.  <br>Its not my job to pay those faggots</br>  I don't tip because I know it pissed people off and leads to threads like this. If people didn't get so pissed off about it Id probably tip more.    Don't be black. *Throw dollar on the floor*  <br> Whats wrong with giving what you've earned to someone less fortunate?? <br>This is called Charity, what is Voluntary.<br>Expecting someone to give a extra 80% value of the meal to you for nothing is being stupid, i would expect more than "here' a pizza and drink, that's $50 including tip" attitude</br></br></br>  <br>Whilst I understand that servers are underpaid, I was told that if they don't make the minimum wage, they can go to their boss and get the difference. Is that correct?</br>  <br>That's so ironic.</br>  <br>This is legit the norm in the UK and Scotland</br>  <br>because we pay our workers properly</br>  <br> trolling <br>I guess you don't live in the uk then.</br></br>  <br>Tip: mandatory act of charity that need to stay<br>Obamacare: evil communism<br><br> &gt;Americunt logic </br></br></br></br>  <br>Okay, sheepfucker, you don't have to tip in your country, but in America, you tip, if I go to Scotland, I'll try to follow the customs, even if I don't particularly enjoy sheep fucking and bagpipe playing. You pretend like you're going out on this moral mission to change the system, but we can all tell that you're just a bitter, overweight, pasty skinned Scotsman, kinda like us, but you live on a big island with shittier weather.</br>  <br><br><br><br>I live in the UK and tip as do most people. You guys are just assholes.. Probs ignorant too.. Reason I hate been called English</br></br></br></br>  <br>I am one of the UK guys, I Tip when I go to restaurants and such, as you say most people do. <br><br>but we are making the point that is isn't considered mandatory and the workers are not relying on the tip money because we have proper minimum wage system</br></br></br>  The biggest tip you can give to a waiter or a a delivery guy is to tell them to get another job. Now where is my nobel price?  <br>Fuck off nigger</br>  <br>Won't even bother to pay an extra $10 to help a struggling waitress out because you're too busy being morally superior and "giving le america da fingah teehee"</br>  <br>Haha just accept that your bad is flawed jut like the rest of your country.</br>  <br>They may not rely on it (No idea if true or not) But its common decency...Not to mention bad manners anon..</br>  <br>so if you go to a restaurant, and after being seated you wait 45 minutes before seeing seen then wait another long time for your food to arrive, the food is not to the standard you expect and the server is acting a bit surly.<br><br>You would still tip would you?</br></br></br>  <br> bad manners <br><br>Fuck off is it. If they're getting paid Nat. Wage and haven't bothered other than bringing the food over. Why should they get a tip?</br></br></br>  <br>Of course.. <br> Because all of that is waitresses fault <br>Learn to sit down, be patient and ask where your fucking food is.<br><br>Mr Fucken Ramsey Asshole Shit Nit Picking Cunt Bag</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is 100% true. They make AT LEAST minimum wage.</br>  <br> Common decency. <br><br>God dammit save us America with your V8's and Baseball pls</br></br></br>  <br>I went to a restaurant once with family, we got a drink and were seated. the place was practically empty, we waited ages and didn't see any sign of serving staff, either coming over to us or just wandering around so eventually we just left. <br><br>it is a Service Industry, if they don't want to serve you well they shouldn't be working there</br></br></br>  <br><br> Special Snowflakes </br></br>  <br> America <br> v8's <br>HAHAHAHHAHHHAHAHAHAHAH</br></br></br>  <br>we weren't the only ones. understandably that place has shut down. <br><br>I don't think it is unreasonable to expect someone to take your order when you go out to eat</br></br></br>  <br>Tipping is an important custom, because it propagates the "American myth" that hard work brings reward.</br>  <br>Put the right price in the food, pay the workers a decent amount.<br><br>"If every server gets the same the service will be terrible"<br><br>No, as in every other job in the world if you're a bad employee you get fired.<br><br>But of course I tip where is customary to tip, I'm not an asshole.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Still being this stupid. These people still fill a role in society so you can sit on your ass not preparing your own food. They should still be paid livable wages. Tips only help the owner save money by keeping wages low</br>  <br><br>If your wages are insufficient, take industrial action. I'm a customer not a donor.</br></br>  <br>The American Dream is alive and well, despite what you jealous cunts might believe. But that's cool - the less people had try hard, the less competition I have. <br>Thanks, Obama!!</br></br>  <br>How dare that anon not give his hard earned money to someone else that already gets paid at least minimum wage. <br>I remember just the other day, I was on my way to Walmart to buy a shovel. I was cut off in the parking lot by a man who took the spot I was pulling into. I angrily got out of my car and threw a $20 bill at him. <br>"Keep the change!" I said. That'll show him. I would've tipped him twice as much if he wouldn't have been such an asshole. <br>After finding a spot and walking inside, still angry from the gentleman outside, I was greeted by the 'greeter'. It was so nice of him to do his job that I gave him a $50 tip. He's underpaid. <br>Finally I found my shovel and headed toward the check-out. The cashier rang it up. $9.99. <br> Fuckin' sweet ass sale <br>I handed her $100 and told her to just keep the change. She was angry that I didn't tip her more, but that was all the money I had on me at the time. <br>I felt bad. <br>I think I'll go back tomorrow and buy her a car as a tip. She's a struggling cashier.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're stupid. Go tip your mum for the insest asshole.</br>  <br>The American Dream Died on June 11th</br>  <br>Says the socialist twat on the dole.</br>  The only thing I'll ever willingly give a negroid is .40 calibre.  <br>lmao ur so full of shit</br>  <br><br>Britfag detected.</br></br>  <br>You ignorant fuck wits need to be cleansed.</br>  <br>You're not even allowed to own a .40 "calibre" due to the sissy laws in your country, <br>Are you?</br></br>  Rulle 34, starting with some toon MILFS                Bumping                  anyone here?        lurking  I'm in here.            bit of a break.

There are hardly any in Aus</br>  who the fuck stands to wipe?  Fark, was just thinking about posting something like this the other day. <br><br>Is it more common to wipe from the side/behind or from between your legs?</br></br>  <br> between your legs <br> howtogetshittyballs.png </br></br>  <br>I just stand and spread my cheeks. I like getting a proper clean. After it's clean I take baby wipes and get an Acura wipe down to ensure I'm fresh and clean.</br>  <br>Girls sit and wipe their cunts. Men stand and wipe their ass</br>  Your supposed to wipe?  <br>That's how you get dubs you mean.

Houses in the us don't come equipped with them tho. I'd get one if I had extra cash for one. Save money on tp expense</br>  This is the only correct way.  <br>I thought I was the only one</br>  For the past 10 years or so iv taken on the practice of wiping both ways. So first the traditional wipe then I'll go in between the legs pull balls up and clean taint real good. You'd be suprised how much shit is left there  <br>bidets are not common in the majority of europe though. its not a single country faggot.</br>   having to shit <br>I bet you retarded Untermenschen can't even modern diet.<br><br>water and whole-digestible foods, nothing left after your insides are done digesting.<br><br>stay &lt;2015 plebs</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Italian <br> gtfo with your "dinning" <br><br>Ive seen you faglords in restaurants<br><br> mineral water <br> white wine <br> appetizer <br> soup <br> first main dish (lasagna) with white wine/mineral water <br> main dish (something more heavy on the meat) with red wine and more mineral water <br> dessert with more wine <br><br>If I ate like you faggots my country would be as broke as yours.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Man's got skills!

I need some advice. Tonight at work I found out (from my brother in law) that my girlfriend of 7 years is wanting to leave me. We have 3 kids together and such, so Im sure it would be a pretty messy split. Im at home now, and seeing as this relation ship is going to end anyway, How should I go about this situation? Should I wake her up and tell her to get out? Should I wait till she leaves me? Shes asleep right now, but will be waking up in 40 minutes. Any advice will be considered. <br><br> pic related. probably what she does while Im at work. </br></br>  <br>Empty every shared account.<br>Move all items of value to a location she does not know of.</br></br>  <br>Fucking tell me about it man...
