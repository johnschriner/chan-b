[ Pictures from inside Mormon (LDS) temples. Hoping to dig a few more up.    <br>Interesting i recently ordered a the book of Mormon from Amazon</br>  <br>I highly recommend the leaked videos before you go much further!</br>  Yah? And? They're crazy, did you not know that already?<br><br><br>You got ripped off, they hand em out for free.</br></br></br>  <br>https://<span>youtu.be/FnbYcB9ctu8  [ ]<br><br>You uh... read any good books lately?</br></br></br>  <br>seems just as crazy as any other cult to me<br>dont get why they are so special</br></br>  <br>15 million people, serious power in Utah/elsewhere and temples with rituals totally closed to people who aren't members in good standing (ie - prospective converts don't know the weirdness).</br>  it's kinda stupid, kinda creepy. Nothing outrageous.  <br> 9/11 Truthers Night! <br>Host David Sponheim<br>3rd Party Presidential Elect<br>His opinions on Obama!<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=0a7<wbr>miz08YJw</wbr>  [ ]<br>Get in the chat with everyone else. <br>http://vaughnlive.tv/thirdparty<br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  bump  This one time I was 12 or 14 we had to do baptisms for the dead, I shit you not we had to wear the magically mormon underwear and white suit, they had a list of people to do this dead people and they even asked if we had members that we'd want to baptize them if they had passed, after that night I really said fuck this shit and stopped all together took a few beatings from my mom and months of grounding but all in all worth it to exit this cult  I once fell asleep in church and got the death stare from the whole ward once my mom was so pissed to wake me up she pinched my ear lobe pretty hard and I ended up shrieking in the middle of a hymn, and scared about 10 babies in the pews behind and infront of me, good time that was till I got home had my ps2 confiscated for a month for that one  baptism video, not from a temple: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=h-y<wbr>ue50spTk</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>(apparently these aren't supposed to be filmed)</br></br>  <br>should've stuck around to make hidden camera videos<br><br>(or not, it's terrible)</br></br></br>  One time I was in sunday school learning about Joseph Smith and how much of a boss pimp he was. Get real bored and decide to look up the dress of one of the girls in my class, the teacher sees what I'm doing deems me irresponsible and forces me to stay by his side for the lesson. Class ends and the few girls that were also in that class started saying shit calling me out for looking at her legs, but in reality I was trying to see those panties, and I was close to but I wasn't subtle at all and got caught to quick.  <br>Nah if I stayed by now (Im 22) they would want me to baptize those childrens and scar them for life not to mention teach sunday school classes so double fuck that.</br>  <br>I could always drop in one sunday and record an actual 2 hour sunday service until I burst out laughing or fall asleep which ever would come first</br>  <br>Those aren't actually closed to the public tho, you're just probably not supposed to film them. <br><br>Leaks of the "secret" (sacred, if you ask a mormon) stuff is what's interesting</br></br></br>  <br>I hope OP realises that Mormons open up their temples to the general public for like 3 weeks before they are dedicated. It's not a big deal to see what it looks like inside. Also this is a terrible picture.</br>  <br>The architecture isn't the interesting part, it's the weird cult stuff<br><br>It's a terrible picture bc it came from the terrible app whisper.</br></br></br>  <br>Mormon speaking here, temple ordinances aren't as mysterious as you think. Yes they're sacred and that's why they're a secret. No sacrifices or anything of that nature happens if you are wondering</br>  Heres a weird tradition they do when halloween falls on a sunday, they get together on the sat and do something called Trunk-or-Treat, essentially trick or treating just add cars and a parking lot, and less candy due to the number of kids vs number of trunks. <br>Yea my childhood was a little fucked.</br>  I never got what was such a big deal about the temples or whatever. I've only been in the waiting rooms and baptismal fonts but they're pretty tame. Just all white rooms and shit  <br>what weird cult stuff do you expect to see?</br>  <br>Something about sealing families forever in the temple and baptisms for the dead also marriages that's pretty much it.</br>  <br><br>looks more like a hospital.<br>would not go there.</br></br></br>  <br> Mormon <br> on 4chan </br></br>  <br>pretty banal stuff! culty outfits, baptisms, prayer circles, handshakes, whatevs... just both fascinating to outsiders and worth getting out in the open to those not aware of it.</br>  <br>It really isn't all that weird unless you have no religious background whatsoever. I've been through different temples multiple times. They all have the same shit, they all serve the same purposes. I could go into detail on the specifics if you really want, but all this info can be found online anyway. <br><br><br>There is a simple explanation for this. I'll sum it up in one word, safety. Getting free candy from people you know is entirely different from having your children go to some stranger. It isn't just a mormon thing either, not that it matters.<br><br>Ex mormon, returned missionary btw. I'm sure there are plenty of others like me on 4chan.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  there is nothing dumber than a religious/"spiritual" person<br><br>fucking commit suicide immediately</br></br>  <br>How about ex mormons? They do exist anon, like me glad I got out when I was 14 or 15</br>  <br>Yeah the sealing families is just a ceremony that involves the entire family, baptisms for the dead are like normal baptisms but they say "on behalf of (insert name here) and marriages again aren't as weird as you think. People just like to assume it's weird cult stuff because they're not allowed to see it. Photos/Videos out of context also make it out to be much stranger than it is, you need to understand the Doctrine to understand the meaning behind the ordinances.</br>  <br>Yeah, I'm ex mormon.<br>Also got out before all that prayer circle shit.</br></br>  <br>But they only did the trick or treat thing on saturday when halloween would fall on sunday maybe my ward was just more messed up than I thought</br>  <br>its just white clothes, baptisms, and generic jesus shit, nothing really crazy imo</br>  <br>Yeah I'm slowly trying to stop myself coming here, only every now and then. Too many weird things. Mainly use it for /s/</br>  <br>we did it every year, i thought it was just a 'community' thing</br>  <br>'generic jesus shit' =/= stuff lifted from masonry, baptisms for the dead, ceremonies secret to the public, etc<br><br>admittedly it's better/normaler than it was?</br></br></br>  <br>True.</br>  Probably relevant porn:  <br>Baptisms for the dead is mentioned in the bible. It's originally an early Christian teaching.</br>  <br>Yeah, no.<br>Only endowed get "magic underwear"</br></br>  <br>tsk tsk tsk<br>Hope you're reporting that to the bishop, anon.</br></br>  <br>Not everywhere, bro.<br><br>They still have reserved areas the gen-pop never gets to see.</br></br></br>  <br>He possibly misremembers the white jumpsuit?</br>  <br>Could tell this was a lie once you mentioned magic underwear, it's only worn by those endowed and you need to be 18+ for that to happen</br>  <br>Well when I put those on I felt pretty weir- I mean magical.</br>  <br>Nope I remember those jumpsuits and they gave us pure white underwear</br>  <br>As the other anon said, it is more of a community thing. Not every church will do it, but some have made it a tradition of sorts. And the reason for it being on saturday instead of sunday is because sunday is the sabbath for mormons, they want to 'keep it holy'. Same thing for the 4th of july in utah, many parades and big fireworks displays are on saturday, not sunday. I think that was the case last year, or maybe the year before.<br><br><br>If I remember correctly, they do give you underwear if you don't actually have your garments, ie magic underwear. Smart people will bring a change of clothing so they don't need to use the hand out stuff. Everyone wears a white jumpsuit for baptisms though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>just because something is secret doesnt make it weird. i don't know why it's secret anyway, it's what i imagine most other church ceremonies are like</br>  <br>Hahaha I meant /sp/, it's funny because I'm mormon.</br>  <br>Pay Lay Ale</br>  <br>Other churches don't really... *have* secret stuff. Especially not stuff they keep from converts, etc</br>  <br> Could tell this was a lie once you mentioned magic underwear <br>It was a joke, but yes they gave us all white underwear and white suits and we all lined up to be dunked in the water for dead people, but feel free to call me a liar I don't care</br></br>  <br>you're suppose to bring your own white underwear so it doesn't show through when you get wet retard</br>  <br>nice save</br>  <br>I wouldn't call it a save, I'm posting as an anon anyway haha, still a hilarious misunderstanding.</br>  <br>Welp I wasn't the only one who didn't get the memo 6 of us didn't have white underwear so we got those instead and a couple of the older guys joked about it being magical underwear relax holy fuck why are you so mad?</br>  <br>jumpsuits =/= garments.<br>You wear your garments all the time, even outside the temple. Some people even have sex while wearing them.</br></br>  <br>Converts can visit the temple soon after joining. Why does it bother you that you can't know. It's kept from the public so it can't be mocked on sites like this due to members holding the ordinances in high regards. Back during the times of the Jewish temples only priests could enter the holy of holies.</br>  <br>Alright I got it.</br>  <br> Back during the times of the Jewish temples <br>pretty sure they still have those</br></br>  Mexican pop  <br>every church has secret stuff, it's just not normally what normal members do. the higher ups in every religion keep stuff from the sheeple</br>  <br>He means the temple era/second temple/etc, not like, the normal kind of temple.</br>  Am I seeing that only two people ever have leaked pictures from the temple and one is a kid on Whisper?!<br><br>I'm disappointed.</br></br>  <br>Fucking binary trips + quads, noice</br>  <br>I know.<br>But no one stops you from going in to a temple. Or a Catholic church. Or a mosque, for that matter.</br></br>  I got another story, one time there was a church function and the women brought doughnuts so me and friend go into the kitchen and grab a couple of doughnuts and we bitched at hard with some bitch saying that we don't deserve these and blah blah blah, so someone else goes in and takes the dozen and just leaves, about 10 mins later we get blamed and shamed for 5 bucks worth of dough. I got my revenge a few weeks later.  <br>There's a whole video on youtube on the endowment ceremony, anon.</br>  <br>There are no pictures because people don't care. It's not interesting enough for people who are outside of the church, and not weird enough for people inside to try and share</br>  <br>That's the first person to leak pictures/footage. Though there was audio recordings prior lol</br>  They actually just allowed the public to view a temple in Phoenix, never went but it was a big deal apparently.  <br>Not really impressive the politics always made it more interesting, especially sunday school with the goofs I grew up with, we learned nothing and made all out sunday school teachers mad, with our reinspired versions of songs.</br>  <br>Trunk or treat is pretty common now. Schools do it. The YMCA by me does it too.<br><br>But Mormons are weird, true.</br></br></br>  <br>Well fuck I guess.</br>  <br>Endowed as in having a big dick? You Mormons are crazier than I thought.</br>  from newnamenoah, don't think it's from a video<br><br>very stupid picture btw</br></br>  <br>looks like a pastry convention</br>  <br>My aunts church does trunk or treat because Halloween is "da debils holiday and tricks aren't nice"</br>  <br>top kek</br>  I remember in primary (sunday school for young kids) we would have to sing all these terrible songs like this one https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ZcF<wbr>ks_graPQ</wbr>  [ ]<br>and me and a few friends revamped the songs to more or less make it funny, our inspiration was good ol' weird al and the Arrogant Worms</br>  <br> priests could enter the holy of holies <br>Only the high priest could enter, and even then it was only once a year, and even then everybody knew what he was doing. Are you really this brainwashed?</br></br>  <br>Didn't know this, my bad. Either way I don't see why it bothers people. I can assure you we are not planning world domination or building death rays inside them</br>  <br>I'll reply for him: "It's sacred not secret and besides it's totally normal and uninteresting anyway who cares"</br>  <br>haha</br>  <br>It's more the "what have you got to hide" idea.<br>But knowing something about your religion's history, I can understand why policy is to bar outsiders.</br></br>  <br>They would tie a rope around his waste to pull him out in case God killed him while he was in the Holy of holies.</br>  <br>It's not so much what we have to hide but what we don't want ridiculed by the general public due to the fact that we hold these ordinaces or "rituals" at such high regard.</br>  <br>I'm mormon too!<br><br>These threads make me kek.<br><br>I'm an RM too. Wearing the underwear.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Didn't know that.<br>The Viet Minh used the same trick.</br></br>  <br>They don't one lone Chad to take all of their women</br>  <br>Sneak in a camera next time you're at the temple, thx</br>  <br>As hell bound as you can get.</br>  <br>Or you could join and see firsthand</br>  <br>Your mom is a dick bro.</br>  <br>Yeah, but that's due to the infancy (in relative terms) of your church. When you've been around 1000 years and there isn't any more major drives to eradicate your faith, you'll stop caring about people mocking you.</br>  <br>Mmm.<br>Pics pls.<br>Sounds sacrilicious tbh.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe, I guess we'll have to wait and see. I just think people get to hyped up over what's happening "behind closed doors". We're not brainwashed cult members, we're not even a cult. We just have differing views on Christ compared to many mainstream Christians</br>  <br>You guys used to come to my door to try to convert me... you're not even trying anymore :(</br>  <br>TRIP QUADS!</br>  <br>Nah, that pic isn't really going too far. It depicts baptisms for the dead. I mean, generally you're not supposed to take pictures inside the temple once it's dedicated (plenty of pics are taken before a temple is dedicated). It's the endowment that you're not supposed to reveal. You can go ahead and do it, no skin off my nose but there will be condemnation to those that do it who are under covenant.<br><br>These things are sacred to me. You may disrespect them as you wish but know that you may have to answer for such actions in the next life.<br><br>For those truly curious, just talk to the missionaries. I was one. Missionaries are cool guys too, even if you're nowhere near close to being interested in Mormonism say hello. Buy them lunch.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you really want the Elders to come visit just call the mormon.org numbers or whatever. They might even just be down to hang out.</br>  <br>Doing Baptisms for the dead really are no more crazier than any other church ritual. And Mormon's are not a freakin cult.</br>  <br>Baptisms for the dead is mentioned on the bible and is encouraged</br>  <br>It's not as creepy as it sounds. We just do baptisms for and in behalf of those who have passed on.<br><br>Baptism requires having a physical body. Those who have died can't be baptized. Baptism is required for salvation. The descendants of those who've died do this for them.</br></br></br>  <br>hidden camera vid for reference<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=mkZ<wbr>Wts_BUwQ</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Who cares? Go pick on someone else like Scientologists, Atheists, or any other fags.</br>  <br>Who gives a shit?</br>  <br><br>the Mormons have descended to use their new debate tactic, 'who gives a shit?'</br></br>  <br> it's in the Bible <br> doesn't say which verse <br>Sure</br></br></br>  <br>It helps that you're concentrated in the more stable areas of the globe.<br>Just look at the Muslims. The ones that live in the poorer parts of the world are still living in the 6th century.</br></br>  <br>lol it's just a white mesh tank top and white compression shorts. At least those are the type I chose.<br><br>There's lots of different styles.<br><br>How is it any weirder than a yarmulka? At least we wear it underneath our close instead of something we broadcast to everyone.<br><br>Garments are merely a personal and private reminder of the promises we make in the temple.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>1 corinthians 15:29</br>  bump  lol Mormons who use /b/ are based  <br>the fact that they keep spare underwear on hand instead of bending the rules to let you wear different ones is probably the weirdest thing here</br>  <br>Its just that you're supposed to wear all-white when doing baptisms. Even regular ones. Even if you did it in a river. It symbolizes purity.<br><br>Of course people are going to come into the temple with the wrong underwear on hand. So they have extra white briefs to rent.<br><br>They're not even the same style as the "magic underwear". The magic underwear is more boxer style.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>is boxers v briefs a major point of your religious doctrine?</br>  <br>Good one. Nice. Funny guy.</br>  <br>This has to be the most autistic and out-of-place text i have ever seen in the bible. You could extract any meaning from this you want.</br>  bump  <br>Mormons, man</br>  In other news Mormongirlz's recreation of the temple anointing is insane and fantastic    <br>This doesnt happen in the Temple Jesus H Christ<br><br>Its funny how normies think inside is becuz its all a big sekret.

Russians would've blown the U.S. in already if it was fake.</br>  <br>Then why didn't the Soviets easily expose this, with their vast spy network?</br>  <br>Of course it was. The only interesting thing about that discussion is trying to figure out what percentage of people who say they think it was faked are sincere, versus those who are just trolling. <br><br>I'd like to think only about 10% of those people are sincere, but I'm probably way off.</br></br></br>  <br> 1969 moon landing <br>Fake<br><br> two subsequent moon landings <br>Probably also fake<br><br> every other moon landing <br>The government had to go there eventually to prove that they did</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  this ithread interests me, I'm on my iPhone. aliens invented iPhones  <br>But did they? Who says they're not faking to remain superior</br>  <br>fake it till you make it, then get naked, because home is where you make it</br>  Itt: dumb shit  <br>We have moon rocks. Technology wasn't advanced enough in 69 to get to the moon, but in the 70s technology had advanced to the point where we could really put a man on the moon. The Russians probably helped</br>  watch e! news to get the latest on Kim's trench coat trauma  <br>Of course it happened.</br>  <br>you're a smart fella</br>  <br>If tech wasn't advanced enough, how come they successfully made a moon landing mission?</br>  <br>Video evidence from moonwalks show the extraneous hang thingys on the space suits undergoing the same gravitational affect as the man walking, which wouldn't happen if it was on Earth if they were just moving slower.</br>  <br>because you touch yourself at night</br>  <br>Anyone who thinks it's fake is wrong and has zero evidence.</br>  <br>Yes, but the government wouldn't have been able to get there if they hadn't had reverse engineered the space ship recovered from the Roswell crash</br>  <br>It was all done on a sound stage at Area 51. Learn to google shit you top notch kek.</br>  <br><br>Pls be trollin'</br></br>   the U.S. government spent however many billion dollars building a rocket, training astronauts, etc., launched the rocket and the astronauts into orbit, but then didn't actually send it to the moon <br>This is what conspirafucktards actually believe.</br>  <br>lame</br>  do you think USA has gotten more corrupt over the years? less corrupt? stayed the same? i mean, I think dinosaur  It would have been more expensive to fake it, than to actually do the mission.  <br>I believe we went but I think a lot of the pictures were taken on earth.</br>  <br>huh uh nope you're wrong</br>  <br>You like to see homos naked?</br>  <br>are you just typing things?</br>  <br>I like to see chomo's naked, you cis gender</br>  <br><br>I say this every thread. The U.S. was in the cold war with the soviets. If the U.S. really did fake it, then the Russians would have loved to find out and expose America to the world. However the Soviets couldn't because it was legit.<br><br><br> 2015 <br> being this stupid <br> mfw I think about idiots who believe the landing was fake </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>and you're a fart smella</br>  <br>That's a fact.</br>  Get this right you faggots who believe in it, why haven't we gone back since the 70's or after Vietnam was over? It was to deter the public during vietnam and also to have the one up on the communist considering the cold war tensions were extremely high then. If we truely did go there, we would have cultivated it by now and made it clearly known.  <br>SHIT JUST GOT REAL</br>  Yes, it's been proven by dozens of independent parties, it was real.  <br>It was fake and gay retards.<br><br>Seriously - Stanly Kubrick shot it. Donald Rumsfeld on camera admitted it was faked to bankrupt the USSR. There's a documentary on it FFS. Lern to internets dweebs</br></br></br>  <br>This is really the only evidence we need to know Murica were the first on the moon</br>  <br>shit just got really real</br>  We cant get humans past the van allen radiation belt stupid fags  Moon landing deniers are as dumb as creationists and chemtrailers.  <br> we would have cultivated it by now and made it clearly known. <br>Cultivated what? It's a big rock with nothing on it.</br></br>  <br>chemtrails are real</br>  <br>There are lots of people who want us to go back, it would just be expensive as fuck for not much benefit other than to say we did. And it is clearly known we did, there are just fucktards like you who keep saying nuh uh</br>  <br>Ayyyy lmao</br>  <br>the moon is an alien space ship</br>  <br><br> /thread </br></br>  <br><br>That's from a movie, the whole "bankrupt the USSR" thing, not important enough to remember which movie though. <br><br>That being said, Brian Cox agrees it was real. #nobgate was a trending topic on twitter not but a few days ago. <br><br>http://www.cnet.com/news/moon-landi<wbr>ng-deniers-get-tweet-in-the-eye-fro<wbr>m-prof/</wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you sir could lick my perfectly waxed and bleached asshole.</br>  <br> why haven't we gone back since the 70's or after Vietnam was over? <br>Because NASA has largely taken a back seat, budget wise, to wars no one asked for but keep the rich rich.</br></br>    <br><br>You didn't say this, Brian Cox did you coattail riding homosexual.</br></br>  <br>Just to say America did it fucking idiot. Thats why you think Murica walked the moon... to say they did it first.<br>Nice try pussy boy</br></br>  <br>Ok. What is the van allen radiation belt and why can't humans get through it?</br>  <br>No troll, where do you think the microchip and computer came from?</br>  <br> why haven't we gone back since the 70's or after Vietnam was over? <br><br>Do you know what it costs to put a man on the moon? Or how dangerous it is, the logistics of it all? <br><br>Also, do you know what's on the moon? A whole lot of fucking dust. The moon is an interesting place, yes. But there's not much going on there. <br><br>Everything we need to know about the moon can be safely obtained with autonomous machines, probes or other robots.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Was the 1969 Moon Landing real? <br> I say it was. <br><br>I remember watching that on TV.<br><br>My parents were so excited. Every adult was, even the older kids. <br><br>Yeah, it was real. <br><br>Sad that the current generation of basement dwellers are too fucking lazy and scared to follow up on what they did.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Its called Wikipedia faggot</br>  <br>Very small transistors</br>  <br>Thanks for confirming you don't have a clue what you're talking about and are just regurgitating bullet points you've seen.</br>  <br><br>It's common sense you baboon. I wouldn't expect you to understand that, your keyboard is probably coated in cheese doodle dust mongoloid</br></br>  <br>The moon doesn't even fucking exist anymore. The US and Russia secretly agreed to blow it up in the early 1980s when it was discovered its orbit was deteriorating. <br><br>It's a giant projection from a naval station at true north disguised as an NWS relay.</br></br></br>  Tai Lopez did 9/11  I still don t understand why we don t have a base on the moon. <br>And i don t understand why we don t have an interational space programm instead of NASA, esa, roscosmos , china space , india space , japan space . Like wtf , if all the countries would put the moneyz and the resources toghether we would be on mars already , fucking mongoloid human race</br>  <br>Hey, you're right:<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_A<wbr>llen_radiation_belt#Implications_fo<wbr>r_space_travel<br>From that article:<br><br>The Apollo missions marked the first event where humans traveled through the Van Allen belts, which was one of several radiation hazards known by mission planners.[30] The astronauts had low exposure in the Van Allen belts due to the short period of time spent flying through them. Apollo flight trajectories bypassed the inner belts completely to send spacecraft though only the thinner areas of the outer belts.[31][32] The command module's inner structure was an aluminum "sandwich" consisting of a welded aluminium inner skin, a thermally bonded honeycomb core, and a thin aluminium "face sheet". The steel honeycomb core and outer face sheets were thermally bonded to the inner skin.</br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>yes, of course it was real, there's plenty of evidence</br>  <br>You're only noting negative aspects of the moon to prove your point little bitch.<br>You do realize not just NASA does things involving space operations. These agencies have black budgets. Endless spending. Classified technologies. <br>It doesnt matter shit about cost, only if they want the press to know about technological accomishments, they will use NASA.</br></br></br>  <br>Russia, India, China, Japan, and the ESA have all independently confirmed the landing sites are on the moon whete they are supposed to be.<br><br>All moon landing conspericy theories are invalid and should just be ignored.</br></br></br>  <br>“It is commonly believed that man will fly directly from the earth to the moon, but to do this, we would require a vehicle of such gigantic proportions that it would prove an economic impossibility. It would have to develop sufficient speed to penetrate the atmosphere and overcome the earth’s gravity and, having traveled all the way to the moon, it must still have enough fuel to land safely and make the return trip to earth. Furthermore, in order to give the expedition a margin of safety, we would not use one ship alone, but a minimum of three … each rocket ship would be taller than New York’s Empire State Building [almost ¼ mile high] and weigh about ten times the tonnage of the Queen Mary, or some 800,000 tons.”<br><br>Wernher von Braun, the father of the Apollo space program, writing in Conquest of the Moon</br></br></br>  You morons will believe anything.<br><br>Yes we went to the fucking moon.

The US did not have the technology to take photos in space during the Apollo missions and most of the films must have been shot on Earth to ensure film integrity. Jay Weidner, author and interviewee about the moon conspiracy theory in the documentary film Room 237. In this film he repeatedly states that he does not necessarily doubt that America landed men on the moon even though he thinks there was a conspiracy with Stanley Kubrick to fake the lunar landing footage.  <br>How fucking retarded are you, you dumb summerfuck?<br>I never said that.

By unedited I mean before NASA cut out the parts they did not want the public to see. The film shows 3 people, plus the person taking the video makes 4, when there were only supposed to be 3 people on the mission. The video was actually taken inside a KC-135 aircraft decked out to look like an Apollo command module, at the time it was performing a parabolic anti gravity loop. Support structure takes loads imposed in 2-1/2g pull up, after which zero gravity is achieved for 20 to 30 seconds on a parabolic flight path. The person in blue overall at 0:34, is the KC-135 pilot. As camera pans around notice 2 other astronauts, plus person taking film makes 4, also ROUND porthole window at 0:22 and 0:40 showing blue skies, green trees, and white buildings. This part of film was taken as aircraft took off on runway, hence no anti gravity, once the aircraft had gone into a parabolic anti gravity loop, the astronauts began performing as though they were in a space capsule orbiting the Moon. What a con, they were not even in Earth orbit let alone Moon orbit LOL this is hilarious, are people really gullible to believe NASA lies about landing or even orbiting the Moon? Notice torch and other objects floating around regardless. Russian cosmonauts claimed that everything had to be strapped down once in the weightless of space, as floating objects could cause serious damage or injury. Seems NASA were not bothered by objects floating around, but then again, if the astronauts are only in an aircraft, then it's no problem, and they can lark about to their hearts content. But why release this film as being genuine film taken by Apollo 8 crew orbiting the Moon, when clearly it is not. In reality no camera's at all were taken on any Apollo mission, NASA had not yet found a way to prevent film from fogging. <br><br>Description from the original Youtube poster .</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nigger are you retarded?

What Houston is saying is in reply to the Astronaut springing easily up to the ladder &amp; down again, "A little push and just spring right up", Houston said "I guess those guys out there with those wires know what they're doing", then the Astronaut crackles with laughter, and replies "Yea, sure glad they did too, thats great"<br><br>Also at 2:30 to 2:40 in the video when the Astronaut is crackling with laughter at Houstons witty reply, look at what the Astronaut is doing with his arms and hands.

And kiddies usually go back in Augest hence summer being over</br>   that kid who had the bowl haircut <br>that was me<br><br> that kid who brought his gameboy and played pokemon during lunch <br>roughly a quarter of the boys at my school<br><br><br>ouch<br><br><br> overdose </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks Mr. Spooligan</br>  <br> being this 12 </br>  <br> that moment when you were moving in a month <br> that moment when you tell your crush and she looks down at the ground and says oh <br> that moment when its the last day of school and shes been trying to talk to you all day but you evade her because you dont want confrontation <br> the moment when the bell rings and you immediately leave school <br> the moment you see her running after you, tears in her eyes <br> the moment when you see her fall to the ground and cry even more <br> the moment you realize what you've done and know for a fact she hates you now <br> the moment when you want to make it up to her <br> the moment when you get excited and contact one of your friends to get in touch with her again <br> the moment when you check your Facebook messages and see a notification from one of your friends <br> the moment when you see the words,"shes dead anon, she got ran over." <br> the moment when you fall to the ground knowing she died hating you <br> the moment when you cry so much realizing what just happened </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Lol he actually ninja ran for lunch kek'd</br>   green colored text   <br><br> That kid who ended up on /b/ making threads talking shit about him, only because he is delaying the eventuality of him committing suicide because he's a fucking loser </br></br>  <br>  that moment when everyone falls to the ground </br>  <br> that kid who posts irrelevant pictures on every post </br>  <br><br>EVERYONE WALK THE DINOSAUR!</br></br>  <br> that kid who missed the quads by one </br>   that girl who was a total slut that you and your friends fucked but secretly you were in love with her.   <br> "That kid who was still getting grounded at age 16." <br>This. My mom never grounded me but still it's embarrassing to get grounded at any age over like 6. I only know one kid who got grounded up until we were 18 and he dropped out of college and sits on his ass playing vidya at his grandparents house because his parents disowned him.</br></br>  <br>Kid died of heroin, alcohol, and xanax combination roughly a year after graduating. A lot of my older friends knew him a lot better first time I saw any of them in serious emotional pain.</br>   that kid that shits in the shower   <br>I punched my dad's door one time during a fight and broke my hand, knocking the door off the hinges. Walked out and went to the park down the street to calm down. He took my phone, cut the power cable to the TV, took away all of my guitars and electronics and locked them in his trunk, and went to work. <br><br>Little did he know I got some 8/10 girl's number at the park. Twas a success.</br></br></br>  <br>This. Every year two teachers and one kid died for me. I even transferred to a school two miles away and it happened there minus the kid dying. Wtf</br>  <br>vito junior pls</br>  <br>Did she spank you?</br>  <br>kekled my shekels</br>   that kid who makes greentext threads on /b/    that girl you didn't know very well but ended up becoming best friends with in university and falling in love with <br> that girl's boyfriend </br>  <br>Ayy lmao</br>  <br>I typed up a really long continuation of the story but I accidentally clicked another button and now its gone.<br><br> the moment when you type a really long greentext story and it dissapears <br> the moment when youre devastated and fall to the ground <br> the moment when someone calls you and you get up to pick up your phone <br> the moment when you hear your ringtone and its "everybody walk the dinosaur" <br> the moment when you fall to the ground devastated because of the irony <br> the moment when youre having a seizure and all you can hear is "Everyone get on the floor, Everybody walk the dinosaur" </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That was me. What am I saying, that's still me.</br>   that cute girl who you knew but didn't pay much attention to <br><br> tfw you dated her years later and found out that she was dealing with being a rape victim and being bullied and you never knew </br></br>  <br>weak sauce</br>  <br>Fuck you bro. Fuck you so much. <br><br>My girlfriend is playing games with me and it kills me inside to think about that girl and how there would be no games.</br></br></br>   that kid who asked you if you went on 4chan   <br>I saw a website once that posited that all of the unusual deaths in my town were due to the vengeful spirit of a man who was murdered by the police. The same guy also had websites dedicated to slandering his ex wife/gf. I wish I could find them again but I don't remember how I found them initially.</br>  <br><br> tfw you weren't one of them ;-; </br></br>  <br>You're welcome. Im in the same situation though so I can relate.</br>  <br> implying everybody doesn't shit themselves at least once as an adult </br>  <br><br>Not mine. She did die, just not physically.</br></br>  <br> in the locker room before gym <br> skinny skater kid walks in <br> comes up to me <br> "hey...the game" <br> "w-what" <br> "4chan bro" <br><br>and then i never saw him again.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>autist detected. it's fucking July.</br></br>  <br>We can cuddle if you need bro.
