[ I'm thinking about formatting and doing a clean installation of Windows 8.1, before installing Windows 10, since I can't now. Will the Windows 10 icon in the down-left part of my screen stay there? If not, what I have to do then?  <br>Are you retarded? Why not just install Windows 10? Jesus fucking Christ ...</br>  <br>I just want to delete all my shit from my pc and start again with it and Windows 10.</br>  <br>Yes? SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST INSTALL WINDOWS 10?</br>  <br>... then just boot Win 10's install and delete your partitions before installing ...</br>  <br>I can't, maybe I can get it later today or maybe tomorrow. Also, calm the fuck down sir</br>  <br>Are you legally retarded? Windows 10 is out today. Just download the fucking ISO from MS' site.</br>  <br> nload the fucking ISO from MS' site <br>Is there really an iso like for win 7, where you can instal it and then activate later ?</br></br>  <br>Ehm... That isn't even an option. You have to just wait until you get a notification. And calm the fuck down again, I think you have some kind of mental problem that can't allow you to just relax</br>  <br>Nope, need a serial. But yes, the ISO's are out.<br><br><br>Oh my FUCKING God you're retarded! THE ISO'S ARE OUT FOR DOWNLOAD! IT'S ONLY IF YOU WANT TO UPGRADE FROM EARLIER YOU HAVE TO WAIT! YOU CAN DO A CLEAN INSTALL OF WIN 10 RIGHT FUCKING NOW YOU RETARDED WORTHLESS LITTLE SHIT<br><br>This has to be a fucking troll, no one is this fucking stupid</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>You can force the update right now if you want to update.<br>But why not just do a clean install?</br></br>  <br>They just aren't. Copypaste from Microsoft's site:<br>How do I upgrade my existing device?<br>Upgrading is simple:<br><br>Reserve your free Windows 10 upgrade now in the Get Windows 10 app.<br><br>Upgrade when you get the notification that Windows 10 has downloaded and is ready for your device.2<br><br>Enjoy Windows 10 for free!<br>I don't see what you say "out for download ISO" anywhere, sir. And please go see a doctor because maybe you have some serious depression issues.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i downloaded it from the site today bro. its on the site lost the link tho</br>  Apparently it has to be done using a media tool from their website.<br><br>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sof<wbr>tware-download/windows10<br><br>Otherwise its only available to MSDN and VLSC subscribers.</br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br><br>I literally just finished downloading the ISO using the media tool. It works just fine.</br></br>  <br>OP, I posted the ISO media link above my post here. <br><br>Alternatively, windows 8.1 installs very quickly and it wouldnt be a terrible idea to start fresh and just upgrade to 10 from there but it'll take you much longer.</br></br></br>  <br>You're not OP. I am.</br>  <br><br>You guys are not OP, I am the real OP.</br></br>  <br>of course</br>  <br><br>http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/soft<wbr>ware-download/windows10<br><br>nigguh!</br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>for the 1st year is a free up-grade.</br>  Does anyone know, if I renew my Computerhardware and install windows 7 again, does the win 10 tool come again or not?

Just give back the shit you stole, serve your time and that should be it.<br><br>The cops that aims the gun at someone and shoots them, shouldn't they be shot by cop-cops. And then they by Cop-cop-cops etc?!</br></br></br>    <br>deserved it for driving too close to the vehicle in front. should be at least a 3 second gap</br>  <br>real webm also yes the escalator was still hungry an hour later</br>  <br> filename </br>    <br>so to clarify, when she spins over her head gets kinda stuck under the lowest rung and snaps her neck.</br>  <br> victimizing criminals <br>Fuck you and your shitty opinion</br></br>    <br>Topkek.</br>    <br>Next time you illegally download something, I hope cops shows up and shoots you.

The switching of foots and popping the shoulder is a common technique to get more power in hooks.<br>It is one of the first things you learn, how to use foot work for stepping out and countering. Your feet ends up in a straight line so when you shift body weight from the left to the right or vice versa you get a lot more momentum.</br></br></br>  <br>Loved that movie.</br>  <br>if you have a license to box (or other kind of fighting) it's classed as a weapon in the UK</br>  <br>That's great, provide a citation.<br><br>Also,<br> License to box </br></br></br></br>  <br>if he was a southpaw he would've helped him up with his left hand, not his right.

They have no gloves blocking is not going to work.<br>The only reasonable thing to do is to step out to the side by moving your other leg back and pop the shoulder diagonally.<br>Which is exactly what he did. This puts you in an excellent position to counter with a hook.<br>Which is exactly what he did. It is a reflex, the hook serves two purposes. The first is that you can hit your opponent, normally though it is just to break his rhythm because you are in an awkward position with your feet. So you hook and move back as a defensive move.<br><br>This black kid is not a fighter so he got hit. <br><br>Does it look clean?

If you've gone that far you should be known.<br> I've trained too but haven't gone out of amateurs and ended up quitting due to alcoholism. There's nothing in that video that tells me he used technique he learned in the gym. I know the advanced footwork you're trying to sell it as, but I don't see that at all. His stance is also far too wide for someone with that much advanced training. and like I said he's clearly right handed and he starts out in southpaw. which yes, I know isn't uncommon in boxing because some learn both. but for something as amateur as this? I'm not seeing it. it was an exchange, he stumbles back to avoid the black kids attempt and I'm sure he could feel at that point he's not in proper position so he re-positions himself. It looks to me like he corrected himself naturally and got lucky.

I'm on a phone. I know. Retarded. I'm trying to keep up and not let this thread 404</br>  <br> :D <br>  Fucking kill yourself :D </br></br>  <br>I was on a psychedelic trip with generally experienced people that went like this once. Much like how regular drinkers might accidentally get insanely wasted unexpectedly one night, regular psy users might suddenly one day find themselves out of their fucking minds for a few hours. The lack of control in terms of dosage and quality in the market helps account for some of this variability, but honestly I feel the psychedelic experience sometimes makes you sit the fuck back while it takes over because I've seen people truly go berserk.<br><br>Everyone thinks it's a "lol noobs couldn't handle their shit" until it happens to them.</br></br></br>  <br>kek</br>  <br>Just a random camaro randomly open in a random street</br>  <br>  :D <br> go back to reddit fuckface </br></br>  <br>Come on, motherfucker, go the fuck on</br>  <br>i remember those wave lines. that's arctic monkeys</br>  <br>Welcome to the summer</br>  <br>summer is soon over.. cant fucking whait</br>  <br>people have died from nbome. No ones ever died from LSD itself</br>  <br> Starts to fuck with anything he can inside the car and we can't do shit about it <br> I told my one friend to stay here with him until he's finished and to call me when he does <br> Hop back in my friends car and look for the other faggot <br> Just as I do, another buddy calls me and tells me that the other friend is at the school <br> Sweet, one less fucking problem <br> Go to school and look for them, can't find them <br> Call my friend and he tells me to look up <br> mfw I see my one friend on the roof naked as well <br> He starting to rant about something saying that all of our minds are connected in one way <br> Brush that shit off <br> Friend calls me to get other friend in car <br> Go get him and now we have two. Only one more fag that couldn't handle his acid to go. <br> Get to the school and there are 5 pig wagons sitting in front of the school, lights on, ready to fire on my friend <br>Continuing</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why u mad at a smiley face? LOL</br>  <br>Point made. I've done psycs a about 4 times and I never lost my shit. I was spiraling into a negative state on shoots once. I dropped nbome in highschool I was cool but my friend almost died and snitches out the whole shindiggy. I was on probation almost raped my life.</br>  <br>Yeah, this story doesn't sound fake as fuck at all.</br>  <br>Pretty much this, this story sounds more bullshitty every new post.</br>  <br>It happened to me anon-kun, many times. I still kept my cool, simple: do nothing.</br>  <br>This would make a lot more fucking sense if you'd bothered to name everyone to start with. "Other friend" is a fucking terrible way to refer to specific people.</br>  <br>are you not tripping balls at this point aswell op?</br>  <br>I know new friend. I never said they were an honest good source of nutrients</br>  Most pathetic and boring acid story I've ever seen, no visuals description, thought loops, no comeup, nothing, just some obvious shitty tabs ingested by a bunch of retards. Even 1 tab of decent acid would give you a far better story to tell than this.  <br><br>This. OP's story doesn't add up</br></br>  <br>No. This was 2 years <br>Fuck let me cont.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Shittest cid story ive ever heard. Abandoning thread before finishing. Just felt like I should tell you that you are shit at telling stories OP.</br></br></br></br>  <br>OP confirmed retard for not understanding that question</br>  Has anyone ever done acid and seen tv in 3d?  i think op hasn't seen a good trip report before  has no1 here made fun of this idiot yet for paying 255 for 17 hits of acid hahaha, also most people that say its double dipped have no idea and they just tell people that. I know people who actually lay sheets and they claim that when people say that its false 80% of the time.  <br> He's still ranting to the FUCKING COPS themselves saying that all humans are connected by one MIMD and that we're all the same people living the same life and all that <br> Brushed that shit off also <br> But then my other friend that had gone crazy calmly gets out of the car and stares at my friend on the school hard as fuck and he immediately stops and looks over but making sure not to let the pigs know of our existence <br> Friend that looked at him gets back in the car saying, OK, he knows now. <br> The only two sane ones are myself and another friend <br> We stand there dumbfounded for a second then our friend tells us to go back to my gpas <br> We say no, but before we could get anything out, he stops us and says "He knows. He'll be fine. Let's go." <br> So we stay for a little and when we looked back at the school, our friend was gone and the cops scattered, looking for him <br>Continuing</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>anyone ever hallucinated that something was wet?<br>like i looked down and my mousemat looked like it was pouring out water moving away from me</br></br>  <br>I have. I watched a few minutes of some documentary on penguins. Shit was intense</br>  <br><br>Fuck you're fluttering me. Let me type this fags</br></br>   be me 18 <br> talk to a 16yo girl on snapchat i knew on the internet <br> I ask if she wants to play truth or dare <br> she agrees <br> she picks truth <br> I start with the typical question <br> whats the furthest thing youve done with a guy <br> she says she fucked one some days ago <br> she asks what was last time i jerked off <br> we still continue with sex questions <br> she chooses dare this time <br> I dare her to send topless pic <br> she does <br> I screenshoot <br> finally see her tits yes! <br> that was actually last night </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>good story</br>  Took shrooms last night and watched south park for hours and it was probably the hardest I have laughed in a while  <br>That doesn't happen. Stfu and actually do drugs before you spit false information. I've done 20 hits and I do 10 all the time. It's just more fun, nothing bad happens. Stfu.</br>  <br>this is what acid does, yes</br>  <br>Thanks kek</br>  <br>post it u fag</br>  HOLY SHIT STOP. This is the worst fucking story I've ever read. Frankly, I'm fucking pissed I went this far. Dude yourself a favor and kill yourself you piece of shit.  <br>Better quality story than OP</br>  https://<span>youtu.be/ZIHF5EoEixc?t=3m48<wbr>s</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>anyone ever hear noises like this while peaking<br>i hope its not just me</br></br></br>  <br> Go back to my gpas house and wait <br> Start to get worried that my friend got caught when I hear a noise on my roof <br> Put my head out of the window and see this nigger jump down <br> Climbs into my window, and lays down on my bed still naked and falls asleep. <br><br>So I know I'm getting a bunch of shit for this story, but I'm not really sure how to prove it to you fags. You won't find anything online about it but I can answer all your questions you have.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This happened to me. The walls moved like they were made of water.</br>  My acid story:<br>Be me <br>Don't do acid</br></br>  <br>No. I don't want her doxxed</br>  <br>skip to 3m48s</br>  <br>then fuck off</br>  <br>I have a question. When you were making up this story, did you actually think it was good?</br>  <br>i love it when windows and walls start to breathe its intense</br>  1/10  <br>Op here, also my friend claimed to not remember a single thing. I still to this day have absolutely no idea how he got away. He'd never tell me. Or at least he'd tell me that he doesn't remember. But that's the only thing that's missing from the story in my book. I'll probably never find out</br>  <br>brruuuhhh i need a hookup :(</br>  <br>hypnosis</br>  <br>Cont.<br><br> nigger lays down in my bed and starts to take his clothes off <br> i get excited by this and the visual of watching his massive cock grow as it gets harder and Hardee <br> decide to suck his fat cock and eventually fuck him in my bed <br> eventually he asks me to move from the bed down on the the floor everybody walk the dinosaur </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dannimeow is by far the most boring whore I've seen on /b/,<br>Not the ugliest, not by a long shot, but so goddamn boring looking th it's impossible to fap to her.<br><br>Goddammit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's echoing/trailing sounds plus heightened senses.

I've found myself in some sticky situations with my friends, but nowhere near what you posted, holy shit. That sounds like a hilarious nightmare and difficult trip all in one.<br><br>My most memorable trip was my most recent. Everything changed colors and spasmed in the most beautiful ways right before my eyes (~300ug), I got to see the sun come up and that in and of itself was amazing.<br><br>Basically, if you haven't done actual LSD already, you really should do so...</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>thanks<br><br>I love the heightened senses<br>makes you feel really alive</br></br></br></br>  <br>Op here. Acid is great, but only if you can handle it. I know that story sound like bs and shit, but I mean I can't prove that its not, so by all means, give me all the hate you've got but seriously, don't take too much. That shit will make you go insane. Now the only reason my other friend and I were able to handle that amount was because we're bigger than the other two and we did this more than they did. We aren't pros, but we can handle our acid.</br>  <br>Fuck off your not who posted the story, its me</br>  <br>Roll 69 and its yours</br>  <br>69 get. Easy</br>  <br>69'd</br>  <br>69 get</br>  <br>Op here. Well, you're the only one that seems to even remotely believe my story, which I don't blame everyone else for, honestly. But yes, that was one hell of a night. I want to experience what you're talking about. That actually sounds like a pretty relaxing trip.</br>  <br><br><br>A little desperate, are we? She could be a 400kg whale for all you know.</br></br></br>  Ever have any embarrassingly stupid moments on acid?<br>thinking that you are the universe and shit<br>makes me sad</br></br>  <br>Actually weight has nothing to do with handling your shit.<br><br>Ever read the news of that MMA dude freaking out on psychedelics and killing his friend and eating his liver.</br></br></br>  <br>The only thing I don't get is how the fuck were you fine if those guys were literally off their fucking heads? You took the same amount.</br>  <br>Like even tripping on regular acid makes it hard to function most normal activities, let alone this.</br>  <br>Checked.<br>Yes, I was convinced I was Buddha reincarnated talking hippie crap to my brother.</br></br>  <br>Op here. I responded to someone else with the same question. But I'll tell you. The only reason my one friend and I were able to stay same while the others went crazy was because we're a lot bigger than they are. We also dropped way more than they did, so we were able to handle it way better than they did.</br>  <br> on ACID drive around I call bs </br>  <br>Not op,<br>I take LSD 1-3 times a month, I drive while peaking. Family can't tell if I'm high. Carry on normal conversations.</br></br>  <br>Op here. Honestly, I'm not sure. I'm not a doctor, but what I can tell you is that weight is pretty much the deciding factor. Don't give a shit what anyone says. You're ingesting it. Of course weight and metabolism has EVERYTHING to do with it.</br>  <br>i sent my girlfriend<br><br>am an infinity feelings11111111111111<br> mfw she broke up with me that night </br></br></br></br>  <br> mfw forgot face </br>  <br>Op here. Driving on acid is surprisingly really easy. Even when you're peaking. But as I said before, the level of how it affects you on a scale, say, is different for every single person. There's no telling what'll happen.</br>  <br>Damn that sucks to wake up to, or while tripping. Kek</br>  <br>Mental state has nothing to do with weight faggot</br>  Give me the best YLYL pics you got.  <br>Solid fucking gold</br>    <br>kek</br>  B/ro's it's my Gf's birthday in a week and i can't decide what to get her. so I'll leave it up to you. you have a £200 price limit and dub's decide. <br>Can use multiple dubs to make up price limit.</br>  <br>Shit in a box - free</br>  <br>Roll.</br>  Buy yourself a fleshlight and make her watch  Hi op anon here<br>buy 11 roses and one fake<br>Tell her you'll love her til the last rose dies<br>Once they all die take a shit on her cat and eat the fake rose in front of her</br></br></br>  Big black dildo.

Inside one of these boxes is the greatest present you'll ever receive, all you have to do is discover which one contains it!"<br><br>Then when she's opened them all and covered every single fucking thing in glitter that she'll never get rid of, when she's screaming at you about where the present is, just tell her that the greatest gift of all is love, and it was right in front of her the whole time. <br><br>Then laugh maniacally in her face.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Engagement ring</br>  <br>You can do better than this 4chan.</br>  <br>Lucky lady</br>  <br>Erm making and cooking mainly pretty boring shit.</br>  <br>Make up* Op is a retard.</br>  <br><br>this</br></br>  <br>ROLLIO</br>  <br>Evil bastard, do this OP</br>  <br><br>lol rolling</br></br>  <br>Rolling.</br>   rolling <br> implying we don't already have a winrar <br/></br>  <br>Looks like we have a winner.

I love it that feminists claim that fat actually is "a normal body". Start working out if you´re jealous</br>  <br>We should all agree that the average man and woman is becoming fatter every year.

But complaining about every skinny girl in video games and comic books as being "unrealistic" is ridiculous.<br><br>Sure the depictions of skinny girls might not represent the average girl, but they're certainly realistic. I know plenty of women with bodies like that.</br></br></br></br></br>    Feminists projecting their insecurities, nothing new.  <br>Wat lol</br>  <br> both pictures show perfektly realistic body types <br>But it's idiotic that they're complaining about the left being unrealistic when they use REAL LIFE FUCKING MODELS for the characters. Then again it's feminists we're talking about so this is no surprise.</br></br>  <br>Yeah but Sonya blade also fights people from other realms to defend her realm</br>  <br>Though it may be at best a bad generalization and at worst a complete fallacy, the assumption is that the guy is the one who wants to have sex. This does not change no matter how drunk he is, he is there to bang. The girl is presumed to just want a few drinks, and maybe a cuddle. <br><br>Of course, the truth is that women want to fuck every bit as much as guys do. Generally speaking the girls are more likely to be repressed and be convinced that they don't want sex by a weird society that traps girls with such puritan nonsense. <br><br>Guys cant win. Just try to find a grill that isn't afraid to fuck and can cook and you're good to go.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't understand. Do they think no women are cut and fit?</br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>on their mind, anything cute and fit is an unrealistic portrayal<br><br>if you give them a good example, "mysonygy" is what you will hear from them</br></br></br>  <br>There's no way this isn't satire.

Literally thousands of girls look like one on the left. I can't imagine how many look like that on the beaches of Cali where GTAV takes place. <br><br>Feminists come from dumpy as fuck places like Oregon, Idaho, Wisconsin and the like. They're all fat, ugly or worse just plain as fuck where they come from and have never been to a place where attractive girls are literally everywhere you look.</br></br></br>  <br>yet some elements are taken from our world, like motion capture, where the "actress" has very similar body proportions than the virtual one</br>  <br>Gender fluid? Is that like cum?</br>  The portrayal of men in video games is completely unrealistic, they are oppressing us by showing those unrealistic goals  <br>My gf weighs 60kg (158cm not-tall), runs and works out daily to keep her body nice and tight and can lift my sorry ass off the ground with ease.<br><br>When we were in Rome, we walked for like 8 hours a day (she wore high heels), slept maybe 4 hours a night and she still was as fresh and fit as it gets.<br><br>If she's not healthy, nobody is.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>calm down god damn</br>  <br>fucking kek I'm not sure I've ever seen someone /thread their own post</br>  <br>Why am I seeing Harry Potter dragged into the sjw argument left and right all of a sudden? <br><br>Now my inner nerd is pissed.</br></br></br>  <br>And then there's others they chose to waste time remodeling like Cortana who isn't even real in the game universe she's involved in.</br>  I'm just gonna put this here....  <br><br>http://www.snopes.com/pregnant/3dfi<wbr>lm.asp</wbr></br></br>  <br>There were two mistakes, I guess you can't count either.</br>      <br>You know a guy (most guys) wouldn't say this because it adds zilch to a conversation and only says, "Look at me!" It's the same fucks who say, "This. So this," or, "This is so me."</br>  <br>Those aren't feninists, they're the fucking pro-fat retards. While yeah, there is often intermingling between the two, they're not the same thing.</br>    How Can Thin Women Be Real If Our Bodies Arent Real?  <br>As if the super buff video character than can just walk off a shotgun blast in the torso was a realistic depiction of men.<br>What a bunch of cunts.</br></br>  <br>that was good, but one of zoe quinn's negatives is coloured green and it's triggering me</br>  <br>Did someone get triggered?</br>  <br> zoe quinn <br> not fat <br>10 years ago maybe.</br></br></br>  <br>How come SJW don't realize that the reason why they're called minorities, is because most people aren't part of it? <br><br>Isn't it less than 1% of the population that's LGBT, plus Hogwarts is a snapshot, meaning there's likely less.<br><br>Also there's legitimate reasons why there's only a handful of non-white wizards.

Don't complain about the way someone wrote something.

I got called racist because I said I find black people not as attractive as white people, even though I grew up somewhere where there is no black people, so I wouldn't develop strong physical attraction to that physical aspect, and that its only "I've never seen a black person I've found attractive"<br><br>Also, it's mostly women.

It means many things, but mostly it has to do with a structural significance in the way society "needs" to be set up in order for the human race to succeed.<br><br><br>You're welcome.</br></br></br></br>  How does one petition to become a member or find members of a chapter in their district. What sectors of society are you most involved in.  How can I be an illuminati, Mr illuminati?<br>Please show us more of your knowledge</br>  If so why do you believe society must be structured in such a way? What is so significant about the way society is structured currrently, or is there plans for change?  <br>We seek members who might have an influential aspect to offer to the Illuminati. There needs to be a certain degree of control one must hold over their peers. It's not really something you seek out or work towards. It's a more natural process than that.</br>  If you're really the illuminati, why can't you turn off 4chan?  <br> Success <br>Fuck your specific version of successful humanity. There is no point to anything but to enjoy our time here.<br>You play your societal legos. Enjoy, child.</br></br></br>  When you say it's a more natural process than that do you mean people that are selected are naturally gifted in the areas the organisation seeks or is it more who you associate with.  <br>You can become a member by seeking the light above.

Seems like a busy day. Do you ever get to relax?  Lol this thread is fucking retarded. Do you actually think anyone is going to believe you?

We are looking out for the betterment of humanity, not to simply "enjoy our time here".<br><br><br>Individuals who have the talents we want will present themselves.

No one will never notice you, if you aren't a privileged member of society</br>  <br>I find it funny that you actually believe your aggressiveness expells lies and dishonesty.<br><br>You are not promoting truth in any way by promoting anything illumi-culture. You are causing nothing more than shortening the youth of man.<br><br>The path of perfection is not bound by neither space or time.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not really like that. You're thinking of a few similar minded individuals controlling all of decisions. It's simpler than that. Everyone who is a member understands why they're a member. It's not really a hierarchy.

'take me to your dealer!'<br><br>xD</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Will the Illuminati kill most of the human population? If so, why? And How?  <br>Religion is a major hurdle humanity as a whole is combating. There are over 1 billion muslims in the world. There are 2.5 billion christians at least. We are trying to make people more accepting of diversity. But how we're doing it for muslims and christians is different. It's a gentle process.</br>  <br>how does it feel to not exist ?</br>  <br>Alchemy is a false science. We only try to better the human race through logic.</br>  <br>How do you expect us to be a government secret if we're out having a smoke in the open?<br><br>They'd be like "ayy lmao" all day.</br></br></br>  <br>No, only some. The world is not as negative as most people view. We never purposefully kill. It's only a byproduct of what our goal is (preserving the human race). More lives are saved than if we didn't intervene at all.</br>  Did you faked the moon landings?  Mr.Illuminati, serious question!<br>Are you working with the notorious hacker 4chan to defeat Anonymous' plan to build their Faggotron 9000, which as from our sources at Fox News confirm it has the ability to cause the anti-Holocaust?</br>  <br>No, those were real. We have an international space station. Why do people doubt this anymore?</br>  <br><br>*sigh*<br><br>frustrated because i can't even poop without you guys knowing how much it weighs and deciding what to do about it... ugh.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you mr illuminati?</br>  Coke or Pepsi?  <br>It's either poo or shitty TV.</br>  <br>I like Pepsi.</br>  <br>Iluminaty confirmed</br>  <br>Good point Mr illuminate. However, im confused what u mean by gentle. For instance the Islamic religion is increasingly becoming demonized in that the war on terror has facilitated Islam's association with the bad to the point where islamic folk are persecute on looks alone. Further, the Islamic nations are being torn apart as we speak. Is this the gentle process u refer to?</br>  Is Brad Petrey Illuminati? Do you support his actions? Why?  <br>man, that's the CIA and you know it...establishing terror groups in those regions to divide the population.</br>  <br>LOL</br>  <br>It becomes complicated. Not all Islamic countries are being torn apart. There are certain warzones, where religious extremists still exist. We are trying to do away with that. Countries like Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and especially The United Arab Emirates have been working with the Illuminati for awhile. We come closer day by day to achieving a balance, where people can sacrifice beliefs for humankind as a whole.</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>Oh man I dont doubt it! I just wonder if those inflammatory organization like CIA work in conjunction with or are guided by a illuminate paradigm, as our enlightened friend here seems to suggest.</br>  <br>OP, what do you Think about:<br>- Masonic<br>- Jew financial domination<br>- World New Order's massacre of 80% of population.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The Illuminati has ties in almost every organization. That doesn't mean we absolutely control the actions of all humans in power.</br>  <br>Or thats what they want you to think</br>  Is "Eyes Wide Shut" an accurate portrayal of an Illuminati Party? If not, Why? Was Kubrick Illuminati?  <br>How do fucking magnets work?</br>  <br>The Freemasons are not exclusive. They hold public meetings. They are not hierarchical like the Illuminati. <br><br>Jewish financial domination is a myth.<br><br>The New World Order only diminishes the population as necessary. Currently we have plans to sustain the current rate of human life.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you a traveling man?</br>  Can I have some money?<br>paypal:<br>djrdragon@yahoo.com</br></br>  What Minecraft server do you play on?  <br>Not really. Those in power are acting as they please, because they know that power-class struggles cannot last if the human race is to continue. They're only enjoying the time they were born into. Kubrick was not a member of the Illuminati. Those parties have little to do with our beliefs.</br>  <br>Thanks for your time mr illuminate, real or not, you have some interesting perspectives</br>  <br>There's literally no company or organization or whatever that has their shit together.<br>Miscommunication everywhere.<br><br>How would/does the Illuminati manage to be any different?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I mostly stick around St. Louis.<br><br><br>No, but your quality of life will improve as the economy gets worse in the years to follow. Gracefully approaching an obsolescence of the current fiat money system is a daunting task.

And that into an Aramaic Dialect. It is very simple to make an illumanti, the leaders are exchanges in syllables (No one uses this language except dead people, everyone dies, it will kill you. Good luck)<br>Moving on.<br>Here are syllables that many of you will counter impose your opinion of it being a total hoax, that is a defense mechanism, you should be glad to have one.<br>Picking out a syllable from some of the readily known availiable lists: Are rune type pronounciations not unlike the ki-op from martial arts.<br>You have even within that a paradious like inclination to discount every entry of said syllables are a joke. (It is a joke, enjoy it while it lasts) (It won't, for it is the killing way of all kind).<br><br>For instance, Kae Dae Nea Are simple terms that are fluent within themselves.<br>Tae Lae Hae Mae. (do you see now that this is already a taught and evident method of constructing one's own founding explorations into the realm of what is called free thought.)<br>Then you have entirely more difficult and fluently inaccesible terms that have no place in existence, these are what are known as passings onto man from on high (by a transcendal intervention from above)<br>Kael- Mathael-Darual-Tiel-or Thael (are terms indicative of a higher grandose enlightment by design)<br>The are other's but these are the most common. So generally it is quite easy to randomize it to complete and total infinity through a series of ranked and categoricalized expressed permutations of complex syllables.<br>These are things that will kill you, so enjoy it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Does the illuminati have truly global reach? Do you have facets in military? Law making? Why is it that you refer to the set course of logic as a belief? You don't "believe" in logic, it is self evident. Would you say that after the fiat money fiasco is dealt with, will a resource based economy prevail? If so will the money look cool and have compound structures and high definition images of earths components? Why not hold a quiz or make correct, logic-proof education systems or something? Sorry for sperg typing I am at work  <br>The Illuminati does truly better mankind, whether it is apparent or not. The hidden mysteries of nature and science are only hidden within man.

How many different alien species are out there that have made contact with us?
