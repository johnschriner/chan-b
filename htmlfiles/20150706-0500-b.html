They also make you look like an edge lord</br>  Zippy wippoes are the tippy top besties  Trap lord xDDD  <br> hey bro do you have a light <br> oh yeah wait here's this bigass magnesium cock in my louis vitton handbag </br></br>  <br>OP said its not for smoking. Lighters are for smoking. If you want to start fires a lighter is not nearly as versatile.</br>  Sunday Osu thrwad!<br>Maps will be 5+ stars<br>Room and password: autism<br><br>Also streaming the room for those who can't in to Osu.
