[ Could you survive for almost 2 days in the woods?<br><br>this 16 year old girl did<br><br> "It's a miracle, no question about it, " Lt. Col. Jeffrey Lustick of the Civil Air Patrol said Monday. "Moments of joy like this can be hard to find."  <br> joy <br> miracle  <br> superhero <br><br><br>http://www.theguardian.com/world/20<wbr>15/jul/15/the-only-one-that-made-it<wbr>-out-autumn-veatch-tells-plane-cras<wbr>h-survival-story<br><br>http://abcnews.go.com/US/superhero-<wbr>teen-survived-plane-crash-slept-san<wbr>dbar-forest/story?id=32439713</wbr></wbr></br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    The woodlin critters stole half her eyebrows.    <br>all that dipping sauce and not one used<br><br>typical women can't make up their minds<br><br>and what was she doing so far away from the kitchen?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You may say 2 days raping here in the woods</br>  <br><br>it's a hell of a thing taking a teenage girl's eyebrows Take away all she's got, and all she's ever gonna have.</br></br>  I'm pretty sure you'd be okay as long as you can get some water and don't run into bears.  <br> kitchen jokes. <br>Sure smells like summer here.</br></br>  <br>2 days? Fuck me it is only 2 days, thirst and hunger won't do anything significant and it does not take a genius to make a fire for sleep. I mean unless there is something more to it it is not that impressive.</br>    <br>You almost don't have to try to survive two days in the woods. Unless the temp is going way below the norm you might be a bit sickly and dehydrated but come on you should not be dead. A toddler or a baby I would say it would be more a "miracle".</br>   2 days in the woods?..  <br><br>Shit son get serious, that's baby-tier</br></br>  I wanna fuck it  <br><br>she was near a stream and had lots of water<br><br>she was slightly hungry tho tbh</br></br></br></br>  <br>she was in a plane crash chill out</br>  <br> 2 days <br>So go camping? Yeah I'd be ok</br></br>  <br>Bears are pussies, they run away. It's the Sasquatches that'll rip you to shreds</br>  trips gets her noods    <br><br> filename <br><br>lost</br></br></br></br>  <br> woodlin <br>It's Woodland.</br></br>  <br>2 days, you wouldn't even starve to death at that point. As long as nothing kills you anyone can survive 2 days.</br>  <br>She did manage to "save herself" though, and she's 16. <br><br>Fuck off /b/ half of you guys wouldn't even have made it out of the plane since you're too fat. Then being able to walk for 2 straight days afterwards? Nope. It's no "miracle" though, it's all her being not stupid and using her legs</br></br></br>  <br> Near a stream <br>Are you fucking me? I mean fuck me if someone can not eat for more than 40 days for a religious religion that bitch will be fine. She is not a hero all she did was sit near a stream and drink for 2 days while having a bit of the munchies.</br></br>  Apparently she also survived a plane crash that lead to these 2 days in the woods  <br>moar</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>she was in a plane crash shit heads</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Fuck off /b/ half of you guys wouldn't even have made it out of the plane since you're too fat. </br>    <br>Survived plane crash and you guys post her nudes kek <br><br>I love you guys ROLLIN</br></br></br>  <br>What a qt</br>  Trips  noods  <br> 2 days in the wood <br> "OMG SHE MUST BE SO MALNOURISHED" <br> give her shitty fucking fast food with no nutritional value </br></br></br>  Why is she so looking so fucking happy? She left her grandparents to die in a fire/plane crash  2 days is nothing ffs. The only way this could be even remotely impressive, is if the woods were below freezing temperature.  <br> Living in a country where you can't find a road by walking forward for like 5 hours <br>Literally 4th world</br></br>  <br>Nigger, two days aint even long enough to die of dehydration.</br>  <br> 2 days <br>kek</br></br>  <br><br>Not just two days. Two days without any good idea where you are and after being through some serious shit.<br><br>She did most everything right. I wonder if she watched "lost and afraid" or any of the other survival shows. About the only bad idea was drinking water from streams without boiling it. That can give you the shits and other bad things.<br><br>She did good, she did real good.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;"OMG SHE MUST BE SO MALNOURISHED" <br> &gt;give her shitty fucking fast food with no nutritional value <br><br>merica</br></br></br></br>  <br> ITT: Literally The Waifu Version Of Gary Paulson's "Hatchet" </br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br>That would not make here a hero or anything amazing, she got lucky and did not die, also aren't you suppose to stay at the sight of the crash when trying to get rescued?</br>    <br> Why is she so looking so fucking happy? She left her grandparents to die in a fire/plane crash <br><br>she said she watched them die screaming over a relatively long period of time, they burned to death<br><br>she does seem pretty happy given that happened like, hours ago</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>She fucking asked for the nuggets you idiot.<br><br>Me, I'd go for a big ass burger.</br></br></br></br>  <br> religious religion </br>  <br>because she didn't die. i'm sure if you didn't spend all of your life on /b/ you'd be happy too</br>  <br>That book was good, don't fuck it up with this bullshit.</br>  <br>She would need a fuck load of carbs, which is exactly what she got. <br>And tell me you wouldn't go for the greasiest, least nutritional food after thinking "this is the end" after a fucking plane crashed and you were the only survivor.</br></br>  <br> two days <br><br>this is b8</br></br></br>  <br>She is lying, she pulled some shit to kill them and save herself.</br>  <br> mcdonalds makes you obese <br> the complete opposite of starvation <br> thinking no nutritonal value means unhealthy <br><br>Nice meme</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>2days? That's nothing. I grew up in the country. We'd that shit for fun when kids. Now 2 weeks, that's a diff ballgame.</br>  <br><br>Generally, yes. But with small aircraft (no transponder) it's not likely they will find you for many days if at all. Depends on where you pranged in.</br></br>    female <br>  alone <br>  no white strong alfa male to protect her <br><br>It's a miracle indeed</br></br></br></br>  <br>just saying if she was really in that much danger she wouldn't have been allowed fucking chicken nuggets</br>  I just got done fasting (no eating or drinking) while doing manual labor in 100°+ weather for a month, and this bitch can't go two days without food?  <br><br> , also aren't you suppose to stay at the sight of the crash when trying to get rescued? <br><br>it was a small plane crash, many times if you crash in the woods those are never found or not found for many months till some random hiker comes across it<br><br>i would have left a note on the plane "I lived, i am going to follow any stream i find and try to make it to the nearest highway, pls look on the most obvious routes away from here for me kthxbye ^_^"<br><br>and yes i would right out the emoticon, but im a cute girl so it works for me</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>people are forgetting the fact that she survived a plane crash that killed her grandparents, THEN survived in the woods on her own making her way to safety</br></br></br>  <br><br>Well then, she wasn't in danger. Just hungry and dehydrated now wasn't she.</br></br>  <br>Kek</br>  <br>She survived, now they try to poison her to death with that awful dog food. I think someone wants this girl dead.</br>  <br>Face the facts some bugs or animals would rape you and you would be a breeding toy. /d/ told me this</br>  <br> I just got done fasting (no eating or drinking) while doing manual labor in 100°+ weather for a month <br><br>cool story tbh mfw</br></br></br>  <br>wait, are you cereal?<br>I've fasted before but you at least need liquids when performing intense manual labor. how did your body cope? I've got to assume you're exaggerating</br></br>  <br>This exactly.<br><br>I'm amazed she didn't have broken bones.<br>The pilot must have managed a controlled crash landing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>well she did survive a plane crash tho</br>  lmao, i know this girl. you guys are funny as shit. shes just some edgy tumblr girl who watched some survivor shows.  <br>It was for Ramadan. You can't drink either.</br>  don't superheros normally save people and not walk away while they die terrible painful deaths<br><br>?</br></br>  <br><br>lolololololol</br></br>  Seriously OP... two days and thats tough?? fag  Why would such an ugly bitch survive.  <br> Could you survive for almost 2 days in the woods? <br>Yes. np. What's the big deal with that cunt? I went for a 2 week survival trip and nobody made articles about me.</br></br>  <br>When the sun is down you can eat and drink.</br>  <br>Seriously what the fuck<br>2 days? A fuckin child could survive that</br></br>  <br><br>No eating or drinking for a month = ded<br>No water for ten days is basically the survival limit providing you aren't sweating. In the high desert it's a matter of two days.</br></br></br>  <br> It was for Ramadan. You can't drink either. <br><br>is that where you can eat and drink whatever you want every single day after the sun sets but then make a big deal about how hard it is?</br></br></br>  <br> 2 days in the woods <br> "It's a miracle, no question about it, " <br><br>kek, pick one</br></br></br></br>  <br>The plane didn't crash as much as it landed roughly her grand parents died because they were old and fragile, she had plenty of supplies on the plane to make it out of the forest she is not a hero just really fucking lucky</br>  <br><br>jezus fucking h christ two days??<br><br>do all you basement dwellers die the moment the wifi disconnects?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Right, but during the day, when the sun is out you can't eat or drink.</br></br></br>  <br> When the sun is down you can eat and drink. <br><br>they always leave this part out kek</br></br></br>  <br>have a look into why mcdonalds makes you fat<br><br>bigmacs don't even decay over time. that should be enough for you.</br></br></br>  <br><br> I just got done fasting (no eating or drinking) for a month </br></br>  <br><br>2 days? Are you fucking serious?<br>Baby can do it.<br><br>Survival starts when you reach upper limit of how much your body can go without food, warmth and water.<br><br>2 days is fucking nothing. She is qt tho.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Right, but during the day, when the sun is out you can't eat or drink. <br><br>oh so it's no big deal and you are just going a few hours without food every day<br><br>amazing, tell us more</br></br></br></br></br>  You'd have to be a complete useless human being if you can't into the most basic of survival knowledge. It shouldn't even be called survival. Any single person should have the basics know hows to be able live in the wild forever and ever.  <br>eid mubarak buddy</br>  <br> Few hours  <br><br>It's usually 16-19 hours.</br></br></br>  <br>Imagine no fb or Snapchat for 2 days!!!

Shit, I use to camp out in the woods without shit for that long when I was that age. And she was found severely dehydrated, after having found water, but refused to drink it because it did not come out of a fucking bottle. Her survival is not a miracle, but at the same time it is a miracle she has lived this long.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The longest you can go without water is 3 weeks and that's if you're not sweating, and most nutritionists think it's less than that.<br><br>The thing is that I don't think you are full of shit. You need to find a doctor because you might be a superhero.</br></br></br>  <br> refused to drink it because it did not come out of a fucking bottle. <br>So, she's smart? I wouldn't drink water from some random stream either, unless I had a way to purify it.</br></br>  <br>She survived a plane crash. Pure luck. That had nothing to do with surviving in the woods for-<br>Wait, this is bait.<br> spititout </br></br></br>  <br> I just got done fasting (no eating or drinking) while doing manual labor in 100°+ weather for a month, and this bitch can't go two days without food? <br><br>you never went 2 days without food that whole time though if you were eating every night<br><br>fucking muzzies</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>why would somone pickup on someone saying he didnt drink or eat for a month is ramadan when thats not what muslims do.

No one has put up our flag Yet xD    Hey /b/.<br><br>I'm gonna have a son. Can you give me some legitimate pros and cons of circumcision?<br><br>My stances are this:<br><br>Pros: Little to no dick-maintenance, less chance of catching some serious diseases during childhood, less sensitive (gives the poor kid a chance with his first girl)<br><br>Cons: P. much mutilation, uncircumcised looks nicer but I don't care much about aesthetics or aerodynamics, I mean if he finds a girl/guy who likes him, I think they'll overlook whether or not he's circumcised. More sensation during sex/masturbation- a double-edged sword. I don't want my boy to be a quick shot.<br><br>I don't really know how much better/worse sex feels with regular circumcision. I mangled my dick pretty bad when I was young by jumping onto a couch with a hardon hips first, so my experience doesn't help much here. I hardly feel anything during sex, and I'm pretty sure that's because of the scar tissue.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>umm<br><br>Its not your call really, he can make that decision when hes adult himself.<br><br>Why should any parent have a right to mutilate their children.<br><br>Only arabs and Americans do this essentially.<br>Religious habit that is now rationalized with poor excuses about deceases, which is hardly a real reason.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I lived 22 years without circuncisión and 3 circumcised.<br><br>For me, is better a full penis, not a half penis.</br></br>  <br>Why were you circumcised when you were 19?</br>  <br> less sensitive (gives the poor kid a chance with his first girl) <br> but ruins it for him with the rest of his life</br></br>  <br>I enjoy sex with a totally, legitimately, actually mutilated penis though.</br>  Uncircumcised forever. Women love the shiny dick look and I love the sensation of it. Do it for your kid.  Ameritards cutting their childrens penises.  <br>dont know if bait or retard but you are a piece of shit if you think your thoughts should be a reason to mutilate the genitals of an infant<br>7/10 made me post</br></br>  <br> Little to no dick-maintenance <br>same with uncircumcised</br></br>  <br>chtching what disease? wtf? being circ is more dangerous, foresking is there to protect+ HUUGE plus: fapping with foreskin is soo much better and easier.</br>  <br><br>You dumb mongoloid dick having nig. You have no idea what you are saying, just a knee jerk, don't make his dick look good and make him better with women all the while my son loves his dick because it looks good and is still sensitive as fuck.</br></br>  <br><br>now that we're on this topic, guys.. i have a serious question<br>I'm a teenager, I got my schlong mutilated when i was around 6-7.<br>I had my first time almost 2 weeks ago and had sex about maybe 5 or so to this day.<br>I can't cum. The first 3 times, my dick just went soft after 10-15 minutes of fucking and i later realized how to maintain fucking but I still can't cum.<br>I fucked my girl for about an hour or more and I still couldn't just flat out cum, maybe If i tried really hard and went rough as fuck I could.<br>Is it because im circumcised or because of masturbation habits, overwhelming, scared etc...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I once had some weird infection(uncut here) all it took was some weird creme on my head and was good to go. Was 3 or 4 or something. <br><br>That aside, Uncut has been fine. Im totally happy to not cut a chunk of my dick off.</br></br></br>  <br><br>The anteater dicks don't like to hear that we have more sex and it feels just as fucking good. It's really one the only things they can cling to and repeat over and over again.</br></br>  <br>He was circumcised at 22, and is now 25.

If he really wants it done he can do it himself when he reaches an age where he can make that decision.<br><br>Also the only thing he's (very) slightly more likely to catch is a UTI, which is easily cleared up via antibiotics within 2 - 3 days. It can also be easily prevented if you teach him proper cleanliness (aka, pull skin back when you are able to and wipe with a wet rag in the shower). As for the "quickshot" myth, uncut men usually last longer due to the increased sensitivity. They can better determine when they're about to orgasm, allowing them to control it better. <br><br>There is no pros to circumcising him aside from a slightly lowered HIV transmission risk, but consider that Female &gt; Male HIV transmission is super rare anyway along with the fact that a condom will also prevent HIV without needing to lop off a part of his dick he can never get back.</br></br></br></br>  <br>At 3-4 you shouldn't even be retracting your foreskin, it's intended to be fused to your glans, probably the reason you had an issue to begin with.</br>  <br> mutilate your body for health reason <br><br>if you can't survive having skin on your dick the way nature intended the child have shit genetics (yours) and was meant to catch those diseases to cull the herd<br><br>quit following a jewish practicion of mutilating penises</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You literally can't spell though.<br><br>http://www.medicinenet.com/circumci<wbr>sion_the_medical_pros_and_cons/arti<wbr>cle.htm<br><br><br>You'll get there.

I live in Australia, a country where almost everyone is uncircumcised, and yet I bet our rate of disease or std or lower than even the US. And if it really did cause disease, do you really think we'd still have foreskin? evolution would have ensured that either foreskin doesn't exist anymore, or there's be at least some people who are born without it. And the sex part, i'm uncircumcised, and I lasted about 30 mins my first time. (I blame that on nerves, second time I lasted maybe 10 seconds lol.) I typically last about 10 mins these days. <br><br>Also circumcision should be his choice! let him do it later if he wants to. I considering it so wrong that Americans usually circumcise. It's worse than cutting a puppy's tail off because it "looks better".</br></br></br>  <br> implying that Op won't have to pull back his son's foreskin and clean it, thus basically masturbating his son <br><br>All joking aside, why would you? The only thing you should care about is that your son has a healthy penis. He'll get made fun of either way, he'll be a quick shot either way, he'll be able to find people who like his dick either way.</br></br></br>  <br> I'm gonna have a son. Can you give me some legitimate pros and cons of circumcision? <br><br>The stories and information posted here are artistic works of fiction and falsehood.<br>Only a fool would take anything posted here as fact.</br></br></br></br>  Hey OP if you have a daughter are you going to give her tit implants and a labiaplasty from birth  <br>Oh...<br><br>...Well, I guess that answers that.</br></br></br>  <br> Little to no dick-maintenance <br>What. It takes like 3 seconds to clean your dick while showering. And if you are about to receive oral sex, you should wash yourself beforehand either way. <br> less chance of catching some serious diseases during childhood, <br>There's no real evidence for this<br> less sensitive (gives the poor kid a chance with his first girl) <br>I don't know if this is true or not, but it's hardly an argument for mutilating his dick in either case.<br><br>Let your son decide for himself when he's of age. To be honest, I think the practice of circumcision (specifically the ethical part of it) is absolutely disgusting, but I try ro refrain from polemics for the sake of civility.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Sorry but my foreskin protects the head of my penis, keeps it moist, I am in my 40s and my cock looks GREAT... I look at American men in porn with their dry old dicks... and I feel sorry for them, yeah you can get high on cocaine and fuck for hours, but real women don't really like that, I can make my Mrs cum in about 5 minutes of sex... There is no good reason to mutilate a babies penis...</br></br>  <br> Can you give me some legitimate pros and cons of circumcision? <br><br>The advantages of protection against HIV, penile cancer, and transmitting HPV to partners are only really significant on a population level.<br><br>The disadvantages are inflated by nutcases and are largely restricted to the risk of permanent injury from the procedure itself, which is exceptionally rare.<br><br>In short, do it if you have a cultural motivation for doing so, but I wouldn't worry about it otherwise.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Theres also the factor that circumcision as an infant tears the fusing of the foreskin and the glans which is supposed to separate during childhood and causes scar tissue on the glans. Circumcision as an adult doesn't do this, if they want to do it, do it as an adult.</br>  <br>it's bullshit!!!!<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=W6Z<wbr>D56C0aLc</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=8JV<wbr>SkDaG8K4</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>    <br> and fuck for hours, but real women don't really like that <br><br>Cause they end up sore as fuck, so do you usually tbh.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh yeah! forgot to mention CON: Circumcision can shorten the penis by up to an inch... imagine that! losing a whole inch of schlong..</br></br>  <br><br>Are you fucking joking? Go fuck yourself.</br></br>  <br> which is exceptionally rare. <br> Sixteen prospective studies evaluated complications following neonatal and infant circumcision. Most studies reported no severe adverse events (SAE), but two studies reported SAE frequency of 2%. The median frequency of any complication was 1.5% (range 0-16%). <br>So nah, not exceptionally rare. Uncommon</br></br></br>  <br> Little to no dick-maintenance <br> i am an lazy cunt who will also put that annoying piece of a son in front of some tv for "caring" <br><br>Animals like you shouldn't breed at all.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Little to no dick-maintenance <br> i am an lazy shit who will also put that annoying shitpiece of a son in front of some tv for "caring" <br><br>Animals like you shouldn't breed at all.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>that escalated quickly tee hee</br></br>  <br> Pros: Little to no dick-maintenance,  <br>Wrong, whn caring for a circumcised baby you have to take care of the wound. With an uncircumcised child it is like caring for any other part of the body. The foreskin isn't supposed to be pulled back until around puberty. This causes a high chance of the head not developing correctly.<br><br> less chance of catching some serious diseases during childhood <br>Wrong, it is very uncommon for serious complications to occur. EVERY child is born with phimosis, but most of the time it takes little effort around puberty to stretch it. <br><br> less sensitive <br>That isn't a plus. How would you like it if your clitoral hood was removed without your consent?<br><br>Let him decide. If he waits to get it removed at a later age it will have less of aa chance for complication.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know where all the hype about dick-maintenance and disease came from regarding this issue, but i can assure you being uncut has very little on penis health. I am uncut and i have not once in my life had a dirty penis or a disease because of my foreskin. Leave it on, it makes no sense to cut it off, if he really wants it done when he is old enough to ask himself them he can always do it later, cant stitch it back on though.</br>  <br>wow i was basically in the same situation; i had had sex maybe 7 or 8 times, but then a few days ago I had sex with this girl twice in a row and came both times. she was on top and I didn't have to work as hard. I think maybe it was harder for me to cum on top since I was basically exercising and I don't have any endurance.</br>  You're asking 4chan for whether or not your son should be circumcised? <br>Seriously how fucking retarded are you? And of all boards you chose /b/, kill yourself faggot.</br>  <br>This is how easy it is to fix phimosis on most people if it continues through puberty.</br>  <br>Uncut reporting for duty.<br><br>My first time I actually fucked for about 40 minutes and got too tired and didn't even finish. How long you last is more about your mental state and how often you jerk off, the cut/uncut thing probably doesn't change much because I know tons of cut guys who nut way too quick.<br><br>Also, the cleaning isn't that big of a problem if you're a normal person and shower at least once a day (it's faster/easier than putting soap in your ass crack tbh)<br><br>In regards to girls' opinions: I've had maybe one girl out of twenty ever say she's not a fan of uncut, but we still had sex regardless, she just prefers cut. Cut or uncut is not a girl's first priority when having sex with a dude unless they've got some issues. <br><br>With that said, sometimes I wish I was cut because I personally think it looks better but fuck going through that procedure.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Prevention &gt; fixing</br>  <br> You might get an ingrown toenail <br> better rip out your toenails so it can never happen </br></br>  <br>Well put!</br>  <br> So nah, not exceptionally rare. Uncommon <br><br>As you said, most studies reported NO severe adverse events. They happen, but mild complications are about as common as pathological phimosis, and significant complications are so rare as to be difficult to measure.<br><br>Medically speaking, this isn't an important issue (except in west Africa). Arguments about circumcision in the developed world are more about signifying values than health.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> you might get tooth decay <br> better rip out your teeth now while you are at it </br></br>  Why would you take a knife to a penis? Why would you let some insane old jewish tradition hack off the dick of your kid when you are not a jew?  I did it and let me tell you<br>My dick looks better</br>  <br>What are these "mild complications" you speak of, and can they be fixed as easily (aka, by the person at home without seeing a doctor) as most cases of phimosis?</br>  <br>Would you remove his eyelids?<br><br>The foreskin provide the exact some function, to protect, hydrate and lubricate.</br></br></br>  My stance is don't get your kid circumsized. When I was a kid my parents got me circumsized, and the doctor ended up mangling my cock. I needed two hypospadious repairs, just because of getting circumsized  <br>Your cock doesn't look better than this.</br>  <br> mild complications are about as common as pathological phimosis <br>This is true. As a gay person I have seen a lot of dicks. The ones of circumcised people who did it later in life look way healthier than those who had it done as a baby. Mine was done as a baby and has a lot of scar tissue. Some blood vessels were damaged causing a big sensitivity loss and grey patches. It can get a lot worse though, so I got off fairly easy.</br></br>  <br>Mild complications are those that have no permanent impact on sexual or urinary function, primarily mild wound infections that resolve with no sequelae after treatment, bleeding/oozing that persists for a short period beyond the procedure.</br>  Your comment about the quick shot isn't really true with being uncircumcised.<br><br>The foreskin is sensitive to allow pleasure during sex, and lets the owner feel a gradual increase in pleasure until they ejaculate - helping control and understand that sensation a little better.<br><br>With a circumcised penis there is minimal pleasure or sensation until orgasm and so premature ejaculation can remain a lifelong ordeal.<br><br>Correct me if I'm wrong, since I'm uncircumcised and only know half the story</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Most of them are permanent deformations that require going under the knife to fix. Such as the skin before the glans being rotated, skin bridges, etc. There are also unfixable complications such as nerve and blood vessel damage.</br>  <br>Is there a way to fix that? <br><br>AND FUCJING SHIT THANK YOU LORD! I've been wondering the hell was on my dick for years as the doctor only says "lol it's normal" shit...</br></br></br>  <br>How about let him decide, cause all cirumcision kids say its the best etc cuz of butthurt, but no person with a foreskin would want it gone, and those who do regret it. If your kid wants to get rid of it later, let him make the bad choice himself</br>  <br> With a circumcised penis there is minimal pleasure or sensation until orgasm and so premature ejaculation can remain a lifelong ordeal. <br><br>I've been both. There has been no noticeable difference in sexual sensation for me.</br></br></br>  <br>I can just second your statement. I was cut as a child and sex is near sensation-less for my dick until right before orgasm.</br>  <br> Might get a brain tumor </br>  <br>Circumcision is about as logical as chopping off someone's eyelids, it's there to protect sensitive skin, it's genital mutilation.</br>    Get him cut. Looks WAY better (foreskins are gross,) less maintenance, less risk of health problems, no real loss of sensitivity, etc.<br><br>Basically, a bunch of upside with no down.</br></br>  <br>I dunno man, maybe a constant regime of anti stretchmark cream and or moisturiser?</br>  <br>dont you want your son to get blowjobs??</br>  <br>You're wrong. I'm circumcised, and feel PLENTY of sensation prior to cumming.<br><br>There. You're corrected.</br></br></br>  <br> "lol it's normal" shit... <br>I know that feel. As a young kid I was almost obsessed about finding out what happened to my penis, because I could tell it wasn't supposed to be the way it was. It just looked too unnatural. Any time I asked my parents played stupid. I didn't find out until high school sex ed.</br></br>  I wouldn't circumcise him if I were you. Circumcision provides no functional or health benefits, and sometimes it can seriously damage the penis. Like sometimes they cut off too much skin wich makes erections extremely painful and makes intercourse difficult. The foreskin is also one of the most sensitive parts of the penis, although as a circumcised man, I think masturbating is still pretty pleasurable. I also think that circumcision is simply unnatural, and that masturbation is probably a lot easier if you're circumcised. I remember when I was a kid, before I even knew what circumcision was, I was masturbating, and thought that it would be a lot easier to masturbate if I had more skin around my shaft so that I could just slide the skin over the glans instead of having to use lotion. So obviously I was pretty annoyed when I got older and learned about circumcision. In short, from a physical point of view, circumcision is a bad idea.<br><br>There are really only two other possible reasons to circumcise your child: social and religious. <br><br>A lot of people have argued that even though circumcision provides no health benefits, it's still a good idea to circumcise your kid because if you don't he'll be mocked by other children for being uncircumcised. This is a stupid reason to mutilate your child's penis because foreskins are totally natural, and being uncircumcised is actually the norm in East Asia, many European countries and in many parts of Latin America. Also, kids make fun of other kids for all the time for all kinds of stupid things, so even if he was made fun of a little bit he'll get over it. It might make your son a little upset when he's a kid, but when he grows up he'll be thankful that you didn't mutilate his penis.<br><br>There aren't many religious reasons to circumcise. The only two religious groups that really have to circumcise their kids are Orthodox Jews and maybe Muslims, I'm not sure though.<br><br>tl;dr - don't circumcise your kid, it's just a really stupid idea</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It disgusts me that you would even think of that. Leave it up to him in the future because personally I would have hated it if I was circumcised as an infant without my consent</br>  <br>CON: he could have fucking phimosis and get too old to tell you and now he is a 24 year old virgin who probably cant have sex but he cant be sure<br>but in the event a miracle happens and he finds out he cant have sex he will have to go the doctor and tell him "yea doc i JUST noticed i cant have sex with this thing, fix it" by the way im 24 fucking years old</br></br>  you might as well remove all of your child's teeth in case he ever gets cavities while you're at it   Everyone with circumcision says it is good <br> They had no choice <br> They know no better <br> People who aren't circumised that decide to do it regret it <br> People still try to say its better <br> I kek all day long <br> Green text </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  sometimes they cut off too much skin wich makes erections extremely painful <br>I had this puberty was a painful experience until until about a year after my penis did most of it's length growth. It took about a year for me to stretch the skin so erections wouldn't hurt, but if I was uncut it would have been no time to stretch and fix phimosis from what I have heard.</br></br>  <br>Or you fucking check for that like a responsible fucking parent who isn't a lazy cunt or adhere to archaic bullshit like "oh no, it'd be taboo to ensure my son's penis isn't fucked"</br>  <br>I feel sorry for people like you, I love my dick, its not even big, 5 n half inch, but I would have it over an 8 inch circumcised dick. <br><br>I hope you get it fixed annon, it can be really hard when the "Man" part of you isn't doing its work. I wish you luck man. honestly</br></br></br>  <br>You had shitty parents who just didn't educate you or get you any proper medical exams.<br>see<br/></br></br>  <br>Why would it stop you having sex? Also wtf don't you do something about it? be that stretching with steroids or getting circumcised.</br>  <br>con.: It's not natural and protection will be lost</br>   creating a wound and making it sit in a shit and piss filled diaper until it heals <br>yep cut is definitely cleaner</br>  <br>im not sure that it actually does. the thought of it slipping down to far while thrusting is painful. like thinking about slowly pulling out a nail does.</br>  <br>Getting it as a baby and as an adult are different. Babies need it to protect the glans during development. When you wait until you are older it has time to develop.<br><br>Most uncut would never want it cut.</br></br></br>  <br>Sometimes I experience this problem myself and it gets harder now that I'm on antidepressants. You can either live with it and realize that you can/will last longer than most uncut people, or smoke weed to make it easier for you.</br>  <br>dude the whole cleanliness thing is a lie. Anyone genitals are gonna be fucking nasty if you haven't showered for a few days. Im uncut and have never had any sort of infection, just wash it like any other part of your body.</br>  <br>Just do it, I tore my frenulum on two separate occasions fucking, barely felt it when it happened. Hurt afterwards though.</br>  <br>Chicks dig the foreskin; that's been my experience</br>  <br><br>my gf literally tells me to hurry up during sex, like literally.... becasue she gets sore. and yes she is horny adn she likes it but her cunt is jsust not that lubricated on her own and even with lube its a bitch</br></br>  <br> Anyone genitals are gonna be fucking nasty if you haven't showered for a few days <br> this <br>No chick would blow a guy who hasn't showered in several days because it would be obvious either way. I'm cut and when I went camping, and I forgot to bring stuff to bath with, it got pretty funky down there.</br></br></br>  <br>Same here, no girls I've met have actually said they prefer it without, always find it odd people say they do</br>  <br>Yeap and then if you wanted sex in the next few days, good fucking luck with that.</br>  <br>  </br>  <br>At least you're considering the option whether to cut or not. Health wise you're risking serious complications from circumcision for what? to reduce the chance of an urinary infection? Just think about it for a minute, how would you feel knowing that your son could lose or seriously impair the use of his penis from this procedure? <br>Ultimately the choice should be made by the person whos gonna live with it, not you.</br></br>  <br>In america it's usually chicks in high school who say that because they haven't actually seen an uncut one and just go off what they hear. One chick was determined she wouldn't sleep with an uncut dude, but had no idea what they even looked like. When college rolls around most might learn otherwise if they didn't find a long term relationship by then.</br>  This is coming from an eurofag.<br>As child my foreskin was attached to my glans so I had to get operated. Doctors said circumcision was possible, parents denied it.<br>Operation hurt like a fuck bitch till days after and it put a scar on the bottom of my dick but I'm glad I still have my foreskin.<br>If I'd pull it back and post a pick none of you fags would be able to tell I'm not circumcised. <br>You Americans are the only faggots who cut dicks for no religious reason, retards.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah true that, chicks just follow what others say. Girls are meme's</br>  <br>But my benefits..</br>  So that's why America is always invading people for oil . They need lube for their jew dicks.  <br>Once I heard a chick parrot and stood by the fact that anal sex had no chance of spreading STDs, because her boyfriend told her so.</br>  <br>kek</br>  <br>You can always mutilate yourself later. You can't unmutilate yourself later.</br>  lol @ people who have to clean their dick <br>fags</br>  <br>GUURRRRRLLLLZZZZ PRRRRRFFFFFF<br><br>dumb as fuck</br></br></br>  <br> who have to clean their dick  <br>This is why you can't keep a girlfriend. They see your nasty unclean dick and run away. All guys need to clean their dicks.</br></br>    <br>I know! top kek at people who shower</br>  Leave the body alone, just like the almighty designed it.  Parents who circumcise their child (boy or girl) for non urgent medical reasons belong here.  <br>I believe he forgot the bazinga.</br>  i would never have sex with an disgusting cunt cheese, uncut vagina.<br>fucking disgusting.<br>cut vagina all the way.<br>also its aesthetic and most guys prefer it.</br></br></br>  <br>cheers</br>  I'm from a country in which maximum of 1% of the men are cut ( this is because of our culture and the history we have with muslims (the country is Bulgaria)). The main thing I want to tell you is that for sure we have a lower precentage of HIV occurances/man than the USA and up to date I've not heard of a single case of penile cancer. Blame it on my ignorance if yoy wish but cutting a piece of skin on top of the head of your penis can surely not fucking lower the chance of cancer. This is simply how cancer does NOT work.  <br>top kek picture</br>  <br> log </br>  <br>also kek at picture</br>  PROS:<br>- less smegma buildup<br>- notably lower chance of smeg-duct (forget what they're called) buildup, blockage, infections, cancer (not much chance)<br>- easier hygeine (a little)<br>- don't have extra skin acting like a built-in slippery-water-wigglie (pic related) when what you really want is friction<br>- very small chance of scarring, and chicks dig scars<br>- decrease in unpleasant feel when you've already nutted but she still suckin'<br><br><br>CONS:<br>- lessening of sensitivity in glans due to full-time exposure<br>- possibility of a less "pointed" or streamlined glans often preferred by bottoms<br>- no peasant (for some) aesthetic akin to anteater, third eye or Eskimo<br>- generally less to work with when doing amateur Puppetry of The Penis<br>- can't join the ranks of smug tumbler-like anti-circumcision-ists<br>- difficulty building up manly pheromones around cockular area<br>- far lower possibility of phimosis (popular with a certain niche crowd) and complications thereof<br>- no chance of scarring from circumcision procedure, and some chicks dig scars more than uncut cocks</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I know this post was bait to start a shitstorm, but I seriously hate that I was circumcised as a baby. Give your kid the choice and he will be very grateful. I wish i could have my foreskin back and see what it felt like.  <br>Penile cancer is a rare form anyway. You would have better luck removing limbs to reduce a chance of skin cancer.</br>  <br> pros <br> less sensitive </br></br>   less chance of catching some serious diseases during childhood <br><br>this is a fucking retarded and non-existant reason.</br></br>  circumcised = jew slave  Fcukign fagsts    <br> aerodynamics <br> aerodynamics <br> aerodynamics <br><br><br>Set him up for the helicopter dick</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> uncircumcised looks better. </br>  Are you a fucking jew? <br>Yes. Cut his whole little shmeckle off.<br>No. Don't cut your kids dick. It is there for a reason, otherwise, we wouldn't have evolved to have a foreskin.</br></br>  <br>Intact is better, just consider that the worst thing that can happen with intact penis is phimosis, and the worst thing that can happen with a bad phimosis is... circumcision. So basically circumcise someone as a child is like cutting an arm for avoiding possible arm amputations... nonsense</br>  - Reduces the chance of penis cancer the same way that being shorter reduces your overall chance of cancer. There are literally just less cells. If I chop my arms off I'd have less chance of getting skin cancer, why? Less skin.<br><br>- There are far more risks to having surgery than not having surgery. EVERY surgery, however minor, comes with risks. The wound could become infected and the penis ruined. It'd be safer to wait to see if there are problems with your childs penis before getting surgery. It's a completely unnecessary surgery. Plus I don't know what % of kids you think catch a "serious disease" from their uncut dicks, in reality it's probably not many.<br><br>- I think the idea of uncut dicks being dirty is an American thing. That idea doesn't exist here where people don't get cut all the time. It's not an issue, my dick isn't unclean. Again I wouldn't take my fingernails off because they get dirt under them, and my nails actually do get dirty under them, my foreskin doesn't.<br><br>- Reduces sensitivity. A) There are nerves in the foreskin. B) The head of the penis rubs agaisnt clothing, causing it to become dry and damages the nerves with all the constant rubbing.<br><br>I honestly can't understand why anyone would get their childs dick cut. It's disgusting.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  If you're not jew, don't do it. If you're jew go to Israel and go fuck yourself  <br>Let him decide. If you cut your son's dick you're basically a wanna be jew abusive parent.</br>  <br>If he wants to decrease his sexual satisfaction by having his dick mutilated he can make that decision for himself when he's an adult.</br>  It's a weird thing to do.. but whatever you do make sure it doesn't end up "two-toned", where you have 70% of the dick tan coloured and 30% pink.  For science I would like to see anyone who supports being uncircumcised dicks in this thread because I'm almost positive you guys are overweight virgins with excess skin  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>  muh mutilaaayshunn <br>  can't read it without hearing it in a deep south retard accent <br><br>I chuckled. Fucking tumbleroids.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>shalom faggot. Don't be mad cause your parent mutilated your tiny dick</br>  <br>two choices OP, technically it's just skin. Personally, I'm cut and I wouldn't have it any other way, consider I'm a dirty guy. I want to be able to not wash for 2 days without worrying about dick cheese.</br>  <br>Typical response from the anteater harborer</br>  <br>This is unintentionally a b8 thread so Ill just post this and leave. If done at a very early age the body adapts. High nerve density =/= pleasure. The cheek is arguably the most nerve dense external area on the human body with the exception of the clit. Don't know how many people can easily cum from that. Also there is a good reason why cutfags an average last just as long. If sensitivity was reduced by as much as some people imply then cutfags should last much, much longer. The final point is sex is 80+% mental. If you don't believe me jack it to the mental image of your mom eating your dad's shit. Or you know sex in the missionary position since this is /b/. <br><br><br>Cut = less chance of STDs, less maintenance. <br>However basic hygiene isn't that hard and condoms exist for a reason. So it doesn't really matter. But what ever you choose know that you chose it. If you don't get them cut and they need to for some reason later in life (VERY unlikely) you fucked them. If you choose to get them cut, obviously, there is no going back.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No swiss fag in fact. Still got plenty of that jew gold</br>  <br><br><br>I wonder if the anti crowd is a tumbler feminist raid? Not likely, but certainly possible.<br><br>And /b/ rises to feminist bait like no other.</br></br></br></br></br>  It's mutilation......nuff said  How about instead of forcing this on your son, allow him to decide for himself when he is an adult?  As nature intended or hacked off with a knife? I dunno man, that's a hard one!  Unnecessary cosmetic surgery thrust upon the genitals of newborns that desensitizes the most sensitive and pleasurable organ on the body. It's pretty fucking creepy actually.  <br>dat logical fallacy tho</br>  <br><br>Get out of the 3rd world shithole you are living in, where parents feel they have the right to to determine if they should circumcise they child or not. It´s not your decision to make faggot. If he feels the need to mutiliate his penor, your son is free to do so when he´s at the right age.</br></br>  <br>Teach your son how to wash his dick. That'll prevent those diseases better than circumcision. If he wants to get circumcised later in life, let him decide to.</br>  <br> health reasons <br>Yeah, because there are no risks to damage your health/body with circumsision.<br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David<wbr>_Reimer</wbr></br></br></br></br>  Behind my ear it gets smelly and greasy every fucking day even though I take thorough shower every morning. I wish my parents had done me the favor of cutting these fucking these off at birth.  <br>why the fuck would you want to mutilate your sons dick are you retarded ?</br>  <br>just keep it</br>  <br><br>You wot m8? my fallacy is as nature intended, who cares if some people thing a dried up prune cock is better than a lovely shiney moist purple sensitive dome like mine... ?? Stumps are cleaner and feet, but you wouldn't want them...</br></br>  <br> implying the odds of a complication are anything but negligible provided you don't do it in some back ally </br>  <br>yeah, even tho i take care of my hygiene every evening my teeth are moist and are basicially a breeding spot for bacteria.<br>i have to brush my teeth multiple times a day.<br>i wish my parents just did me a favor and cut of my lips.</br></br></br>  <br> actually said he used the appeal to nature fallacy in his defense <br> uses another logical fallacy while he's at it <br>Jesus christ man.</br></br></br>  <br>let him decide when he's 18 you faggot.</br>  I had the procedure done when I was 6. I however had to get it no matter what due to some medical issues. All I can say is later on in life you don't notice it as much and really it should be your son's choice when he is old/mature enough to decide for himself.  <br>Yes but how is mutilating your son´s penis for the odds of having a health problem because an uncircumsised penis better?<br>Except if you live in a hot or desertic country in africa or middle with poor hygene I don´t see why you should worry about health problems that never happen.</br></br>  Wait, you get more pleasure if you are uncircumsized?!?!?? Fuck my parents  Cons: There is literally no reason to do it. Let your son decide you loon  <br>It's not less sensitive. Don't buy that bullshit. When I'm jerking odd I don't grab and twist my fucking cock skin.<br><br>Circumcision was started by the Egyptians who found it made them more sexually sensitive and active.<br><br>Don't let your kid have a freakish anteater penis.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Dude, circumcision is BARBARIC MUTILATION.</br></br>  <br>They cut off literally the most sensitive part of your dick (Frenulum)</br>  <br>This was happening with my missus until she found out she had a yeast infection and a UTI.<br><br>I'm only 5" and any more than 5 minutes of fucking and she would get sore. <br><br>now after getting her problem sorted out I can pound her for much longer, which is nice because I take 10+ mins to cum most sessions. <br><br>And no i'm not bragging I wish I could be faster a lot of the time. <br>I'm uncut btw, my dad was cut and wanted me to be but my mum used to be a nurse and refused to let them touch me thank god.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> yet I bet our rate of disease or std or lower than even the US. <br>Not applicable. You have no american niggers. I presume aboriginals dont have three times the rate of HIV infection than the rest of the australian population</br></br>  <br>this<br><br>also most likely these complications happened when circumcision was done so young that it just heals itself wrong.<br><br>Wait until the boy can make his own mind and when there is less of a chance of complications. It's his cock.... not yours.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Your foreskin wasn't supposed to leave your glans until around puberty.</br>  <br>It really is rare. Both sides have negligible risks and benefits. It really doesn't matter.</br>    <br>Because <br>didn't spell it out for you, here:<br>https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/st<wbr>rawman<br>https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/ap<wbr>peal-to-nature</wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br>  Let your child decide later in life whether or not they want to be circumcised. Doing it as an infant can cause extreme damage and loss of sensitivity. There is no reason whatsoever to do that to your kid.  <br>Female circumcision is typically the removal of the clit, thus all external stimulation. The equivalent for males would be a penectomy.</br>  <br><br><br>¡Buy French Horn lessons, bitchies love a man whom can play the french horn!</br></br></br>  <br>If you do it later in life the loss of sexual pleasure if immense. Not matter what you choose, you choose it for them at birth.</br>  <br>Nope, that's a very rare and extreme form. It's usually removal of clitoral hood/Outer Labia</br>  alright faggots, here is the new thread<br>dubs decide</br>    C'mon OP  Cancerous whore!
