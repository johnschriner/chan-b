My generation kids were 50% playing ball outside, 50% vidyan games<br>Can't say much about my level of intelligence, it's for others to judge. But i know there are a lot of stupid people around. <br>Racist to a degree. I know a difference between "nigger and a dark coloured gentleman". Just seems like the former are highly over presented<br>Somewhat non-religious, I don't belong to any church.
