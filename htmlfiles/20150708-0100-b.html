What's her name?  <br>I knew this pic would show up eventually.</br>  <br>Good, good!

I swear to thee, that if I acquire an uncensored video of Naho Hazuki doing POV anal in HD, I shall NEVER sin again.  Good luck with that OP    <br>Yeah, I'm going straight to Hell.</br>  <br>Uhhhmm... fairly sure I know the one you mean, actually. The name escapes me... I'll let you know.</br>  <br>I dont mean specific one..<br>I know of only hitomi tanaka taht does it and has huge boobs<br>I am looking for someone new</br></br></br>  There needs to be some like savage ass Japanese camera man who records the Japanese porn actresses without censoring. And sells that shit to the states, he could make a fucking huge profit! But he'd be super fucked if he got caught.    does any1 know if there's any leaked uncensored mariposa pic's/video ? I failed my research  <br>Yeah, it's called caribbeancom<br><br>Seriously, just google that, all the JAV agencies here in Japan resell their stuff to the outside world, none of their vids have censoring.</br></br></br>  <br>What he could do is strike a deal to work in association with Brazzers or some shit. So they could use Jap models and do the recording in Japan, but then send them to America for release so that they can be released uncensored and in glorious HD.</br>  <br>Sadly, I'm too cheap to pay for my porn.</br>    <br><br><br>Oh, to add onto this, go to their Japanese language site if you wanna get the uncensored previous, their English site is shit and doesn't have anything.</br></br></br>    <br>previews*<br><br>Even if you have no money you can still get some decent preview videos</br></br></br>  <br>the actresses would be boycotted or break their contracts, and the cameraman would obviously be known since he's in the credits<br><br>its why hitomi only did softcore stuff when she came to the states</br></br></br>  <br>Who is she?</br>  <br>Lol and I ended up going to the English site too. I'll bookmark it for later.</br>      <br>Sauce?</br>  <br>Would be better with US men fucking them and teaching them to be more like US porn girls.<br><br>Seriously the whole japanese shy "eee eee eee" shit they do is annoying. Hot bodies, annoying acting.</br></br></br>  <br>so true</br>  <br>No fucking clue. Wish I knew.</br>  Got more Nano for you OP!  <br>Boner slowly becomes kill at that point</br>    <br><br><br>stfu amerilards. jap girls are perfects the way they are. we do not need more burgers and fries in every other shits</br></br></br>  <br>No thanks, american porn "actresses" always sound so angry. They all over act, let's just hope they learn to act better and/or try to be themselves</br>  Annnd another OP!<br> Mfw 90% sushi captchas in Asian threads. </br>  <br>1 : i'm not american<br>2 : they aren't natural at all while shooting scenes, they're pretending.</br></br>  <br><br><br>You fucking legend! And these CAPTCHAS are getting on my fucking nerves. They make dumping a bitch.</br></br></br>  <br>Not all jap girls sound bad.</br>  Well that escalated quickly  From personal experience, it's not acting in terms of the sounds they make per se. But you tune it out after awhile.<br><br>Though if she speaks really good English then she doesn't really do that.<br><br>OC for you guys because I'm in a good mood tonight.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The only other picture I 'ninja'd (huehuehue) of her. Trying to hook up with her again later this month, if so I'll probably post the new ones shortly after for you guys.</br>  <br>Yeah i just kinda drown it out if I have to. I don't mute the video.</br>  <br><br>May the force of the leaf village be with you anon. But i have a better idea:<br><br> prepare a cup of ramen <br> put ramen on the table <br> hide yourself in a shelf or something <br> sneak behind her <br> hit her head with something <br> take picture <br> ??? <br> profit </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Now that's a party.<br>Break out the sake so I don't blow my load after 33 seconds.</br></br>  B E S T S H A P E<br><br>why do some jap girls get crazy big busts? must be the radiation right</br></br>  <br><br><br>requestin her sorceress cosplay from dragonscrown or w/e<br><br>outfit is bonerific</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Including the girl I've been posting for the past hour or two.</br>  <br>Yep.<br>I'll take number 6, please.</br></br>  <br>4 plz</br>  <br>Dunno</br>  <br>Jesus</br>  My shitfuck tablet is being slow so there might be delay.

Who is she?</br>    Thanks Mr. Penis  Thanks Mr. Penis  Thanks Mr. Penis  <br>This image is the size of OPs dick. Get fucked cunt.</br>  Why is it okay to shame fat people?  You get skinny by not having enough to eat.<br><br>You're fat because not only do you have abundance to eat, you have no self control and become fat. You're only fat because you're a shitty person</br></br>  <br>Because being fat is a bad thing</br>  I don't consider fat people to be ordinary humans. I don't even think they should be classified as humans.  <br>Because fat people have a thick layer protecting their ability to feel ashamed.</br>  <br>being fat is unhealthy. end of story</br>  <br>tfw skinny bitch looks like skeletor lost weight</br>  <br>What should they be classified as then?</br>  Its okay to shame anyone imo<br>You all should feel ashamed.</br>  <br>Do you feel ashamed?</br>  <br> You get skinny by not having enough to eat. <br>that's not the only reason someone can be skinny<br> You're fat because not only do you have abundance to eat, you have no self control and become fat. <br>that's not the only reason someone can be fat<br> You're only fat because you're a shitty person <br>how do you make the jump from "poor self-control in regard to food" to "shitty person"?<br><br><br>so is being skinny</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>1. they let it hurt them even tho they are not losing weight<br>thats it. if you dont care about being fat you shouldnt be ashamed. if you care but rather keep stuffing your face, dont cry about people shaming you.<br>is it nice to shame fat people? no but if they werent fat they wouldnt get shamed</br></br></br>  <br>Nah, it's not so bad. It's just that the clothes are so loose.</br>  Theres no such thing as fat people. Theres fat, and theres people.  <br>I am above you</br>  <br>True that. Bitch needs to get a few quarter-pounders under her belt.</br>  i think most of them dont care anyways (thats why they are fat)<br>and those who say they care, but still are fat, lies. or atleast dont care hard enough.</br>  <br>Same as niggers. Animals.</br>  <br>I looked up and I can't see you. I think you're mistaken.</br>  <br> is it nice to gas jewish people? no but if they werent jewish they wouldnt get gassed <br>also wtf is wrong with you that you think someone with an eating problem deserves to be shamed by other people<br>what if people harassed you about your problems, like how uncontrollably you suck cocks and guzzle cum?</br></br></br>  <br>I don't see why people are so annoyed with fat shaming...<br>Fat shaming only works on people who are ashamed of their body. <br>Which they can either be depressed little cunts about, or they can use it as motivation to lose weight and achieve a body they're not ashamed of.<br><br>If you're not ashamed, then shaming techniques won't work.<br>If fat shaming techniques work, then they're obviously already ashamed of their body.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  As a fat guy myself, my answer is sure. Being fat is my choice considering how much I like eating food. It's pathetic and I realize what I am.<br><br>But I will say that any random fatty is kinda undeserving of a random walk-up-insult. It's the "don't fat shame accept me or else" tumblr-inas that deserve the hate. <br><br>That and people who blame being fat on anything but themselves. Besides, a fat guy like me needs an occasional discrimination to lose the weight.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sorry I didn't write a fucking essay about nutrition. My basic point still stands; being fat doesn't come from anything but the person's inability to regulate what they eat and how much they exercise. Genetically predisposed to weight gain? Diet and exercise. Fucked up thyroid? Medication, diet, and exercise.<br><br>Literally just diet and exercise and in extreme cases medication. I'm not sorry you're a fat fuck because of your poor life choices</br></br></br>  <br>is that how you deal with fatness, by distorting how health looks?</br>  <br>I like your attitude anon</br>    <br>Do you feel ashamed now?</br>  <br><br><br>You are literally what is wrong with this world. If you walked in her shoes for ONE minute, you would know how horrible it feels to be fat shamed daily, and that losing weight is physiologically impossible for some people</br></br></br>  <br>Lol, oh you!</br>  <br> Losing weight is physiologically impossible for some people. <br><br>Tried not eating?</br></br></br>  <br>Lardass detected.</br>  fat people are gross<br>nothing more to it</br>  <br>Can we see a picture of you?<br>Maybe b/ can help you and give u some motivation.</br></br>  <br> you would know how horrible it feels to be fat shamed daily <br>if she feels horrible daily because of <br>it, maybe she should lose weight</br></br></br>  <br> and those who say they care, but still are fat, lies. or atleast dont care hard enough. <br>yeah, this anon totally knows human psychology<br>if you care a lot about a problem you have, it becomes solved<br>this is how humans work<br> hello is this psychologists? yeah you can stop researching human behavior and motivation, this dude on 4chan figured it all out. turns out it's just about "caring hard enough". yeah who knew right? oh, what to do if someone doesn't "care hard enough" but still needs the problem fixed? well in that case fuck it, right? lol! who cares about people anyway </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Bullshit, It takes work but you just have to find what it is that is driving you to an early death.<br><br>It's like saying everybody is smoker-shaming. You are willfully doing something leading to an early death and should be encouraged away for the betterment of your life.</br></br></br>  <br><br>That's like 99% of the reason people are fat. Shut up, fatty.</br></br>  <br>thyroid problems can prevent weight loss</br>  <br>Actually there is a lot to it, a lot of fat....</br>  <br>i don't even thing they could walk a minute in their own shoes</br>  <br>this. put under glass and put it under my bed</br>  <br>You can shame fatties because they don't have any feelings because they ate them all.</br>  <br>if you're serious about this you are an amazingly unintelligent person</br>  <br>Its okay to shame everyone not just landwhales</br>  <br>LOL!</br>  <br>becuase it is unhealthy... 30 - 40 years ago you didnt shame people for smoking but now it all over because of how unhealthy it is for you. soon enough it will be the same way with fat people we know the horrible health conditions that come along with being obese and it isnt any different. fat shaming will be normal soon. progression always wins</br>  <br>source on that statistic? your ass? oh ok</br>  <br>nah, sorry but it's not going to happen<br><br>I accept who I am since it's my fault but I am ashamed of my body. I pretty much know what I need to do.</br></br></br>  <br> muh genetics breaks law of consevation of energy or otherwise produces fat from thin air <br><br>Kek is this what tumbrites actually believe?</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>I am fat and It is unhealthy. end of story</br></br></br></br>  <br>Walking in someone's shoes means to have the same experiences as that person...<br>If I had to walk for one minute experiencing the same stuff as her I fear my ankles would break.</br></br>  <br> if they weren't fat they wouldn't get shamed <br>*the wouldn't get shamed for being fat<br>people are dogs and they'll bite whatever bone is most accessible to them, sometimes that's body weight<br>best thing to do is to give the dogs something to bite, like a stupid hat, because at the end of the day, you can painlessly take that hat off</br></br></br></br>  <br>They only affect 5-10 lbs.</br>  <br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/tumblr/</br></br>  <br>gonna try that on some overweight girls</br>  <br>because they are fat</br>    <br>wow. this is like an... intelligent post. could it be real? not even copypasta?</br>  <br>Pffft like you know any girls, stop lying.</br>  <br><br>ye what he said. And even then, thyroid problems can be solved via medication to stimulate it. And once again, its fat people's problems.</br></br>  <br><br>because they are diffident and gross</br></br>  <br> Why is it okay to shame fat people? <br><br>Define shame.<br><br>Telling them being fat is unhealthy isn't shaming them.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd fuck the guts out of the fat girl this this picture</br>  <br>Why don't you define shame then smart ass?</br>  <br>you didn't answer the most important question<br> how do you make the jump from "poor self-control in regard to food" to "shitty person"? <br>also i happen to be skinny but i'd rather be fat than a fucking idiot like you</br></br></br>    <br>Shut up fatass. Bet you can't even see your dick.</br>  <br>haha! you get what i mean atleast.</br>  <br>Because its their fault that they are fat.<br>I would never laugh at a mentally handicapped person or a cripple for example. (exept on /b/).<br>Laughing at fat people is fine.</br></br></br>  <br>I suppose I was mistaken. I don't give a fuck anyways im 5 foot 9 155lbs so suck it landwhales</br>  <br>Because I'm not the one stating that fat shaming isn't ok. You state something ? You define it.</br>  <br> physiologically impossible for some people <br>Yes, for less than 1% of the population. Obesity rates are now eclipsing those for overweight, so how exactly are the majority of fatties justified in using the "it's my biology" excuse?<br><br> obvious b8 is obvious <br>2/10, made me reply</br></br></br></br></br>  I would never talk to a fat person willingly so they are free from shame from me.  <br><br>Cause im a smoker</br></br>    <br><br>What statistic? I said Like 99%". Google won't save you here, fatty. <br><br>Fat people are gross and need to lose weight and stop eating so much.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If you aren't actively taking care of yourself and striving to improve in all aspects of your life (mental, physical, emotional, etc), you are a shitty person.<br><br>Fat people aren't taking care of themselves physically.</br></br></br>  We should put all fat people on a island and see how they evolve  <br>Well it's simple the treatment of obesity cost a lot of money, they are people in this world that deserve much more health-care than your lazy ass.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>daniellukebarth</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yes, for less than 1% of the population. <br>Not even.<br><br>Stop eating, you'll lose weight. Absolutely NOBODY is unable to lose weight. This is just harder for some people than for others.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because it's unhealthy, it's a sign of poor self control as well. <br><br>If they try to justify/defend it or argue that it's good that makes them even shittier. that shows that they have no impulse control, they have no discipline, and they don't give a fuck enough to even maintain their own body. Fuck that. <br><br><br> Because fat people have a thick layer protecting their ability to feel ashamed. <br><br>I like to call a supersized bowl of denial.<br><br><br>this</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well done anon, I actually lol'd</br>  <br>Really?<br>If you're not ashamed of your body, then shaming tactics won't work. <br>Fat shaming is used to make people ashamed of being fat. So it's pretty simple to understand that if you're not ashamed, shaming tactics won't work.<br><br>If you are ashamed, then why not do something about it?<br>It is never 100% impossible for someone lose fat. But people give up because it's easier that way.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   ITT   <br><br>No. Literally everyone can lose weight. Period.</br></br>  <br><br>Pretty good idea, but may I suggest we drop them in the middle of Atlantic ocean instead of an Island ?</br></br>  <br>whats a stone in kilos</br>  <br>who the fuck cares if it's unhealthy?<br>upwards of 90% of us probably sit on our asses most of the day, eat shitty food, stare at monitors way more than is good for our eyes, etc. etc. etc.<br>as a general rule, people do not deserve to be "shamed" for doing unhealthy things<br>disagreeing with that is literally psychopathic</br></br></br></br>  <br>They would just form an island by themselves if we drop enough kek</br>  Why is it shallow to not be attracted to fat people?  <br>True</br>  <br>Because if you're fat (Poor self control), you cause a ton of health problems for yourself such as heart disease, higher risk of cancer, a myriad of weight related disease, lower life expectancy, etc. This makes you a shitty person; to ignore all of these awful health problems because it didn't have enough butter.<br><br>Think of your family once lard-ass? Or the taxpayers, or the doctors who have to operate on your dumbass, or if your house has a fire and you can't get out or are injured? You know how hard it is to lift 400lbs of person out of a burning building? You risk everyone because you want to be fat.</br></br></br>  are you skinny/normal guys always hungry?  <br> people do not deserve to be "shamed" for doing unhealthy things <br>When it costs me $$ and lowers the quality of society, it's absolutely worth shaming.</br></br>  <br>its 133kg</br>  <br>It's a misidentification thing, fat people aren't people.</br>  <br>No self respecting level headed individual let's them selves turn into a greaseball</br>  <br> still ugly beta even though </br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>All think Diet Mountain Dew is healthy. All are living life incorrectly. Together weigh over a ton.<br>Fat is wrong. Captcha pics of steak</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The Island would sink</br>  <br>Fat people like eating so much they even fall for bait :3</br>  <br>Then explain to me how I tried dieting and walking for a month and GAINED four pounds?...<br><br>Right, you cant</br></br></br>  <br>134kg ish</br>  <br>holy crap you are delusionsed. everyone deals with hate every day fat people are no different. not to mention 90% of the fat people who get shamed are those ungodly fat people who say they are healthy and pretty to everyone. <br><br>also it is not impossible for someone to loose weight, sure it can get harder but it is all control. you dont even need to give up tons of foods. i am loosing weight even though almost all of my diet is meat, cheese, and pork rinds and i eat a crap ton perday. why because i know how health works and dont make excuses of what i cant loose weight even if i am on multiple medications that cause weight loss to be almost impossible.</br></br></br>  <br>im not skinny, im just little boned<br><br>except my cock</br></br></br>  <br>1 stone = 6.35029318 kilograms</br>  <br>nope, not a copypasta<br><br>If the picture gives a troll feeling, it's because I don't have anything else saved on my laptop.<br><br>I know what I am and accept the consequences because I had the motivation to lose a lot of weight a few years ago in my senior year of highschool. I buckled down, and dieted and exercised for a whole year. All the work I put into dieting was to finally get the attention of some girls I liked. <br><br>I lost the weight and maintained the weight for a year and a half, trying to get into a relationship. I failed and felt unhappy. All my work got me nothing. So I decided to let myself go and enjoyed food again.<br><br>Shit sucks but I tried and it's my fault. So I'm ok with it.<br><br><br>nah, I can see it and jerk off just fine. I'm over six feet tall so the fat isn't concentrated in a small area</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Because its funny you fat fuck  <br>clever boy</br>    People are shamed for drinking too much, smoking too much, doing too many drugs, etc. But as soon as they are getting shamed for stuffing their faces or sitting on their ass all day, there's a problem. Most fat shaming is the 350+ lb lardasses that devour food, not slightly overweight or "chubby" people.  <br> The Island would sink <br><br>And that would be bad because...?</br></br></br>  <br> trying to be funny <br> didn't think about his joke <br> mfw </br></br></br>  <br>do it like the germans did it in 1944, and you will be skinny in no time</br>  <br>lets see there are multiple reasons, muscle gain, starvation mode so body wasnt burning the food you were putting in, constipation, water weight, you not knowing how to actually diet or how to work out.</br>  <br>your social/emotional/empathic intelligence is through the floor, dude<br>let's say everything in your post is true (which it obviously isn't; you can certainly BECOME ashamed of something by being shamed for it even if you weren't ashamed already -- I don't know how you managed to swing not knowing that, but there it is)<br>still, how the fuck do you make the giant leap of logic from there to the normative/moral conclusion that "there's no reason to be annoyed with fat shaming"?<br>it's not annoyance, you douchebag, it's actual moral outrage<br>shaming someone for living an unhealthy lifestyle is in almost all cases morally insane<br>every person with a normally functioning empathic brain knows that instinctively<br>what's your excuse? do you have diagnosed autism or anti-social personality disorder or something?<br> btw im a skinny fuck with no fat friends or acquaintances <br> i have no horse in this race, just pointing out the obvious </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you walked 24 hrs a day for a month you would lose pounds. Your problem is you never reach optimal heart rate to burn your fat ass away.</br>  <br>no john doe is actually that impactful to society</br>  <br>lazy fucker even eatin in the bed</br>  <br> shaming someone for living an unhealthy lifestyle is in almost all cases morally insane <br>that statement is insane<br>shaming bad lifestyles is totally sane</br></br></br>  <br> I tried dieting and walking for a month <br> A WHOLE MONTH <br> welp guess I'll give up <br><br>Enjoy your extra wide coffin tubbo</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm hungry pretty often, I'm about 155 and 6' tall.<br><br>But I'm also hungry because I bike to work and back every night, ad my job is 30h/w physical labor.</br></br></br>  <br>Walking? Woah holy fuck slow down that's Olympic grade shit. Don't overdo it like that, no wonder you didn't see results.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Bm2<wbr>PvqGA8g8</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>The reason why it's okay - no - NECESSARY to shame fat people is right in this video.<br><br>Can you imagine if our whole society was only fat fucks that can't even fucking move out of their bed?<br>No? Good.<br><br>Fat shaming makes it so that people would feel ASHAMED to end up like this.<br>There is no excuse to be fat. All you need is to move your ass and not stuff it every day.<br>If every human was eating 5 times what they need like you fat fucks our planet would be already drained within a year.<br><br>And get the fuck out with thyroid and genetic problems. <br>If I'd put you on a deserted island for a month you'd be thin as paper unless you eat all the trees.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  fat shaming is good because otherwise fat chicks get too confident, and then I would have to put effort in to fucking them.  <br>have you looked up ANY science on this point?<br>just curious<br>any at all?</br></br></br>  <br> I like to call a supersized bowl of denial. <br><br>Have you got their number?</br></br></br>  <br> walking <br>HAHAHAHAHAHA HOLY SHIT MY INNER /fit/ CANT HANDLE THIS<br><br>You're irredeemable. Maybe instead of walking tried lifting your arms, thats a workout in itself</br></br></br></br>  <br>Collapse whatever...</br>  <br>fuck off Shamu</br>  <br>For the exact same reason it's ok to shame smokers.<br><br>If you're ok with one and not the other you're retarded.</br></br></br>  <br>you were not on a 100% vegetable and water diet. <br>you did not walk at least 3 miles every day</br></br>  <br>Did you by any chance walk to the nearby burger shop?</br>  <br>gr8 b8</br>  <br>Is this sarcasm or the fat just got to your brain?</br>  <br>Are you ashamed for posting too much?</br>  <br>you could probably make an argument that all the unhealthy things I mentioned and that you can think of "cost you $$" and "lower the quality of society"<br>how have you not thought about how your points can be generalized?</br></br>  <br>daang u "worked out" for a WHOLE MONTH?<br>shieeeeeeee. hardcore son.</br></br>  <br>WHAT IN THE FUCK IS CUTE IN THAT?<br>THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH FACEBOOK??</br></br>  this is what i dont get about the whole "its hard to lose weight" argument: i started at 310 lbs, decided to bike to and from work; casually lost 20-25 lbs. enjoyed the biking so i biked more until i was in good enough shape to bike at jimmy johns, now i am at 255 lbs, my resting heart rate is 39; though im still large i still get hit on since im not a mouth breather. <br><br>i guess my whole point is if you are at a high weight you simply need to find exercize you enjoy and stick to it, otherwise the lack of discipline you already have in regards to food will come back and bite you in the ass. p.s. diet &gt;cardio&gt;weights but all 3 make you look and feel great. also more exercise means more energy</br></br>  <br> walked for a month <br>by walk do you mean walk to the fridge?</br></br>  The OP's question can be asked in reverse.<br>Shaming is a social construct to keep people in line.<br><br>So, OP, why the fuck should unhealthy lifestyles be considered socially acceptable?</br></br></br>  <br>Proof: the most radical method is a surgery to decrease the volume of the stomach. Results are a massive loss in weight</br>  <br>Sure I can, you simply weren't burning as much energy as you were taking in. This is simple physics. It's going to take work to get results. You don't lose 10 pounds over a couple days unless something is seriously wrong or you're trying something incredibly unhealthy. <br><br>Also, muscle weighs more than fat, you may have lost some leg fat and gotten some muscle from walking, though you aren't going to lose any significant weight if you don't do full body workouts to trim down all parts of your body.</br></br></br>  <br>people do get shamed for bad lifestyles<br>deservedly so</br></br>  <br>that is the exact opposite image you should have used. way to fucking go you raging troglodyte.</br>  <br>why</br>  <br>just her "friends" tryin to be nice.</br>  yes  <br><br>If walking is what you consider exercise, you need a lot more help, fatty.</br></br>  <br>unfortunately not, but i'm sure I could find random numbers in a phonebook to call and harass instead if I wanted.</br>  <br>Because they are not in control of the most valued commodity. They are on the far side of what we aspire to be, which is a strong and healthy collective of a species.

I don’t have good poops very often. They’re &gt;usually broken up into multiple small shits a &gt;day; hard enough to pass, but not large &gt;enough to be any fun. So yesterday while at &gt;Target, I was very pleasantly surprised by my &gt;bowels. The urge to poop just fell on me and &gt;I knew I wouldn’t be able to hold it long, so I &gt;made a beeline for the ladies’ room and &gt;plopped down as fast as I could, fearing the &gt;worst. The turd was firm and came out as &gt;one log, but wasn’t so hard that it hurt to &gt;actually poop it. It took a good 30-40 seconds &gt;to squelch the whole thing out, and I could &gt;feel my cheeks blushing when I saw what I &gt;had left behind! It was definitely one of those &gt;“so good, it sticks with you all day” poops   <br>Thy made a show out of the ur a squid now ur a kid now ?</br>   I’ve been mulling it over for the past few weeks now, and clearly I haven’t been too attentive to you all for the last few months. And I’m sorry for that, but after a year of every single person’s story about their shit, or the fucked up things happening during someone’s period, I just can’t do it anymore guys. It’s just so taxing to sift through all these asks, especially when 60% of the time they were the same submission just reworded. Now, we’ve had our good times, and also had quite a few regulars here submitting their stories, which I loved like you couldn’t believe. A handful of you were such great writers that I was laughing my ass off. It was nice to be a part of this while it was good, but it doesn’t seem like it’s that way anymore.Almost all the submissions are the same, and they just annoy me to see now. I was talking to Dana today, and realized the only shits I want to know about are mine, and my friends if they’re pretty awesome. And I’m really fucking sick and tired of all the shit-fetish blogs that were flooding the inbox, either wanting to get to know the girls who would post, or wanting to submit their graphic sexual shit stories. Especially after I said multiple times that I want nothing to do with that. I think you all can understand why that would get on my nerves and cause me to grow tired of this. <br><br>So, what I’m going to do is this. I’m not deleting the blog or anything, but I am going to turn off the ask box, and turn off submissions. Should I decide to come back, so be it, but don’t count on it either. Man of conviction, blah blah blah.Anyways though, if you should need some advice on something digestive or otherwise related, I’m right here willing to give a shot. But if it’s something serious, medical wise, just fucking go to a doctor. They’ll do so much better than I.</br></br>  <br>I feel you</br>  <br>That is such troll b8 itself.<br>Topkek</br></br>  <br> she starts coming over more often <br> she discovered some of foam nerf swords that i have <br> We sword fight most of the days she comes over <br> either that or play minecraft/cod <br> still making our comic, we've advanced the plot <br> new characters etc <br> she's more creative than me <br> i draw better <br> we make a habit of turning everything into friendly competition <br> I know I should ask her out, but I just can't bring myself to do it <br> She kept coming over and we had loads of fun with the swords and stuff <br> You know how at the end of Monsters Inc they discover laughter is the best power source?

It has one of the country's  <br> most promising love theme of the century,  <br> Bobby Andrews and Wowie De Guzman. The  <br> said balut vendor is selling sampaguita  <br> covered in flower crackers which people call  <br> chicharong bulaklak. It is wearing a yellow  <br> vest with polka dot stripes all over the dress  <br> designed by Andrew Cunanan Versace  <br> having vital statistics 75-11-93 centimeters. It  <br> was sold by 50 centavos per kilo. <br> One day, when I bought sampaguita from  <br> him, I suddenly noticed that he has a vial of  <br> anti-rabies on the tables which made me  <br> thisnk he was cheating on me. When I turned  <br> on my back, I opened my mirror and looked  <br> at him. He was injecting contraceptives to his  <br> items which made them heavier than the  <br> normal height. I called 911 and they  <br> responded immediately. They even gave me  <br> their autographs and sang love sensation for  <br> me. They also sang to the vendor which  <br> made the vendor's head jump over the moon  <br> and stars and the planets and the earth and  <br> the galaxy and lastly, Bundok Arirang inside  <br> Muntinlupa Palace, which is said to be bigger  <br> thatn Palasio Iglesia ni Cristo and Sta. Lucia  <br> South Grand Prize. The removed his arms  <br> because they were given orders to unarm the  <br> suspect if ever they have firecrackers. <br> The last place I saw the vendor was inside  <br> the court house beside tagamuchi restaurant  <br> in Bundok Talifangfang. He was sentenced to  <br> death by giving him a bayh eith soap and  <br> water. He died four tears after because he  <br> committed a mistake, a very deadly mistake.  <br> He accidentally drank insecticide instead of  <br> poison because he was supposed to commit  <br> suicide. <br> At present, I regularly visit his grave behind  <br> his old store. I tell him everything that I gave  <br> learned from him, when committing suicide,  <br> one must be careful because one might die if  <br> he did something wrong. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah you bosses that junkie bitch.
