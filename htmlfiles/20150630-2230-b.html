[ whats /b/ think of my gf"s ass?  Give me your best con against veganism. I'm arguing with a bitch online.  <br>It's way more expensive and other food is cheaper. Vegans agree with this.</br>  hitler was a vegan and look at what happened to that asshole  <br><br>No, you CAN eat at a budget, that's one of the great things about veganism.</br></br>  <br>You will cut short your own life expectancy in the ultimate irony because of nutritional and vitamin/mineral deficiencies</br>  <br><br>Vegans get ALL their nutrients from plants. This is factually incorrect actually.</br></br>  <br>Stupid af</br>  New study shows plants feel pain. Some more than humans or animals on the pain scale.<br>Being vegan is no better than eating sweet juicy bacon.</br>  <br>Vegans eat all the animal's food.</br>  <br>Who cares if some bitch thinks she's a herbivore? More meat for you.</br>  <br> New study shows plants feel pain. <br><br>Post study</br></br></br>  <br>Not really. Vegan food is disgusting for the most part, only good thing is the expensive shit rather the shitty generic shit which actually matters in this case. <br><br>Also some foods are not supported in some areas so at times you need to drives hours to a store that actually supports vegan foods. Mostly the case for country places.<br><br>So gas+shitty expensive vegan food= not worth. to save some animals that'd be slaughtered regardless? Okay lol.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A huge chunk of the shit grown to feed animals could go directly to feeding humans instead of being used inefficiently on feeding cattle.</br>  <br> Vegans eat all the animal's food. </br>  <br>It's not proven to be healthier than vegetarianism. If they think it's benefiting the welfare of animals they're fucking retarded and forget that all life exists by killing and eating other organisms. Billions of bacteria died in the process of making her kale smoothie. Plus agriculture is driving habitat loss and mass extinction. Tell your friend to kill herself.</br>  <br>You know beans are vegan right? Rice, veggies, and a huge portion of everything else? Wtf is vegan food? Tofurky? If you're a vegan and feeding off fake meats you're probably a dumb shit anyway.</br>  <br><br>You don't get to eat meat<br><br>Veganism is usually an indicator of culinary unsohpistication</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Studies show plants react to stimuli in order to protect themselves. Very different from having emotions and feeling actual pain as we perceive it.</br></br>  <br> rice and beans <br>muh nigga<br>99% of my diet is rice and beans</br></br></br>  <br><br>As opposed to meat eaters that eat the same rehashed steak/burger + fries/rice every single meal.</br></br>  <br><br>Animals don't perceive pain as we do either.</br></br>  <br><br>As opposed to omnivores that eat everything we were meant to, stupid.</br></br>  <br><br>Not my fault you choose to eat junk food<br><br>Try some Foie Gras or Steak Tartare</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>They cry, they scream, they run away from things they perceive as dangerous, they long for their offspring when they're taken away from them, some show mourning behaviors.</br></br>  <br><br>So how does that disprove what I just said?</br></br>  <br>This isn't the 1800's you fucking dumb fuck. You think I'm going to live off of beans and rice? You must be a dumb shit to do that for animals who will die regardless.<br><br>Killing animals is unnatural and savagery? So what about other animals who kill other animals just because or for food? Don't call anybody a fucking retard if you're going to be spewing your bull shit on 4chan you fucking redditor.</br></br></br>  <br><br>please elaborate your opinion on how exactly and scientifically proven that is</br></br>  <br><br>The whole "but muh origins" bs is a cheap cop-out. Flying isn't natural, neither is prosthetic limbs or the internet. We've adapted and evolved past so much but you retards will keep going back to the whole "but it's naturalllll" shit just so you can feel good about stuffing your mouth holes with more burgers.</br></br>  <br>Not while staying healthy</br>  <br><br>See:<br><br> <br><br>You're not a lion out in the wild, you're a manlet in your mom's basement. The only thing you're hunting is pop tarts off your freezer.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>In the end, you are a faggot for trying to save animals that will die regardless. Nobody gives a shit about vegans.</br>  <br><br>If you get a knife and cut yourself and then cut an animal that animals doesn't perceive or feel the pain as you do. <br><br><br><br>The cheap "cop out" is your bullshit thinking eating vegan is healthier and not eating animals is morally superior. <br><br>You're comparing millions of years of evolution with the fucking internet or a prosthetic limb? Not eating meat IS unnatural, that's a fact. We are omnivores and that's the end of it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>http://www.thehealthyhomeeconomist.<wbr>com/baby-breastfed-by-vegan-mother-<wbr>dies/</wbr></wbr></br>  <br><br>Prove otherwise. The only thing you need to supplement as a vegan is B12 which is dirt cheap. Beans, rice, veggies, etc are generally cheap, and a lot of the costs are also offset by the savings in health costs.</br></br>  http://www.iflscience. com/plants-and-animals/plants-can-h<wbr>ear-themselves-being-eaten<br>http://www.iflscience. com/plants-and-animals/ordering-veg<wbr>etarian-meal-there-s-more-animal-bl<wbr>ood-your-hands</wbr></wbr></br></wbr>  <br><br>Maybe add a link to info on all the meat/dairy-consumption-related heart attacks each year to contrast that one death?</br></br>  <br>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/art<wbr>icle-1371172/French-vegan-couple-fa<wbr>ce-jail-child-neglect-baby-died-vit<wbr>amin-deficiency.html</wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>what's really the point of living if you don't enjoy the little things? I'd rather live 5 less years and actually enjoy what I eat than live longer and hate all of it.</br>  <br><br>It's almost impossible to get the same level of proteins from plants. You'd have to eat all day to do it. <br><br>And if you think eating 10 pounds of fucking lettuce like the bitch OP's pic. and getting all the nutrients that 10 pounds of lettuce has you're an idiot. You're not designed to eat like that and your body will only get a fraction of the nutrients from it.<br><br>Here's the bitch eating 10 pounds of fucking lettuce. <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=DNg<wbr>A06xE_Ng</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>How is NOT eating meat unnatural? And even if it is unnatural, why do you feel the need to care about what's natural or not in this day and age? Do you seriously concern yourself about that in any other facet of your life?</br></br>  <br>Kek</br>  <br> If you get a knife and cut yourself and then cut an animal that animals doesn't perceive or feel the pain as you do. <br><br>oh my god are you really that stupid? that is literally the most stupid thing i have ever heard. like, i feel stupid because i cannot comprehend how someone can be so stupid.</br></br></br>  Vegans are douchy but if you look at dieting objectively as currently possible. Putting the learning curve aside. It is superior<br><br>I am a meat eater btw<br><br>1. Environment: Green house gases is produced by animal farts. (seriously). Ending the mass production meat industry would help the environment<br><br>2. Health: Animal product diets show much more concern for disease than a vegan diet on many levels.<br><br>3. Morality: Though some can kill and eat their meat. Most of us are detached from the things we eat. Many people stop eating animal products after seeing animals get slaughtered in person</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What makes you think I don't enjoy my life? Stuffing my face with dead animals isn't a pleasure for me, I maybe get to live longer and spend more time doing the other shit I enjoy doing, and regardless I at least lived with some confidence that I did the best I could and was consistent in my actions and morals.</br>  All living creatures are beautiful creations. My mashed potatoes are the perfect accent.  <br>reacting to stimuli is what plants do</br>  <br>B12.</br>  <br>Veganism is just one expression of weakness.<br><br>Tey are teens who can't handle te toughness of life. Life in unfair, life is hard. Animals kill other animals, we all die, we all suffer, we have to accept the deal.<br><br>Vegan can't because they lack strength.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Look up the starch solution, healthy vegan diet at an affordable 3 dollars a day.</br>  <br>4. Economy: Our tax payer dollars are going toward helping fat fucks slamming quarter pounders down their throats everyday</br>  <br><br> Sentience in plants = sentience in pigs <br><br>Nope.avi</br></br></br></br>  <br>thats the only nutrient that requires sumplementation. its so cheap tho</br>  <br>Holy shit if you're a vegan you are a fucking troll hypocrite.</br>  <br> How is NOT eating meat unnatural? <br><br>We were designed to eat meat, that's what we've been eating since our ancestors. We were ALWAYS omnivores. <br><br>What part of this doesn't make sense to you? <br><br> And even if it is unnatural, why do you feel the need to care about what's natural or not in this day and age?  <br><br>I feel the need to eat meat because that's how my body works. It's a great source of nutrients especially protein and it taste fucking godawesome. Like the angel Gabriel touching my cheeks and whispering sweet poems in my ears. <br><br>It's not only us humans, all animals eat meat, even herbivores are opportunistic carnivores.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Absolutely haram. You should kill yourself and your mother now before it's too late.</br></br>  <br>Actually no, you can only get complete proteins from animal flesh. Humans are omnivorous for a reason and depriving yourself of these proteins will cause allot of health issues. Veaganism is far more about the politics rather than the actual health benefits of which their are scant few. Paleo is a far superior diet IMO but everyone is different. <br><br> Been working in the health industry for 5 years. Vegans all wonder why they skelly's with no energy or gains.  <br> bu-bu mah veagan body builders. They, like any body builders, are juice monkey's usually trying to sell you something. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Also<br><br>TEETH.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Being vegan is being consistent with your morals and as a human, towards others and the environment, and making sacrifices to support your position.<br><br>Eating meat isn't manly or a show of strength, you're just eating something someone else killed for you, heavily subsidized by the government thanks to powerful lobbies.<br><br>You're not out in the wild hunting for your meal, you're just another fat diabetic fuck looking for cheap burgers at Walmart.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> So what about other animals who kill other animals just because or for food? <br>When was the last time you saw a human being chase down, beat the fuck out of and eat raw an animal? Our teeth can't even tear through raw flesh. Lions need meat to survive, literally a necessity for them, not for us.</br></br>  The only argument that non-vegans can come up with that is actually true is that it can be slightly inconvenient but even that is only sort of true. It's like switching from a shit diet to a balanced diet, once you got it down it's not hard at all.  <br>Have you tried ripping through raw animal flesh with your teeth? Tell me how that goes nignog.</br>  <br><br>We were arguably not made to eat meat. That's why high cholesterol is an issue, that's why meat-consumption-related cancers are an issue. Our teeth aren't the right type, our intestines are way too long to process meat safely.</br></br>  <br>That's why you heat it up you fucking imbecile. Even then, they weren't as retarded as you fucking nigger.</br>  <br>if you don't enjoy shoveling dead meat into your face, there's obviously something wrong with you.</br>  <br>Not sure, but don't vegans need non GMO shit? I'm guessing most shit in normal grocery stores have plenty of GMOs</br>  <br><br>If we are talking about nature, meat consumption is much lower and life expectancies are also much lower so these aren't really problems for a human in the state of nature. You could say we aren't designed to consume as much meat as we do though.</br></br>  <br>You fucking idiot. <br><br>Our teeth are designed for being an omnivore, and out intestines are long BECAUSE we eat meat. <br><br>Pandas intestines are long too. You know what they spend most of their time doing? Eating vegetables their bodies can barely digest because they were an omnivore whose supply of meat was driven to extinction. <br><br>Pandas are forced to be vegans too. They're dying out.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> I am vegan therefor I am moral <br><br>Stupid vegan buying their iPhone that get built in Chinese factories by child slaves.</br></br></br></br>  <br>youre straight</br>  <br><br>Everything else aside, getting protein on a vegan diet is a non-issue. Non-vegans focus on that shit for some reason but it's literally one of the easiest parts of being vegan. I reach my daily target with zero effort.<br><br>B12 needs to be supplemented, that's the only thing I need to care about with my diet, and even then it's a cheap ass strawberry-flavored pill that I'll take occasionally and be done with it.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> vegans need non GMO shit? <br><br>Why do you think this is a thing?</br></br></br></br>  <br> We were arguably not made to eat meat. <br><br>Are you an idiot?<br><br> That's why high cholesterol is an issue, that's why meat-consumption-related cancers are an issue. Our teeth aren't the right type, our intestines are way too long to process meat safely. <br><br>All the problems arise from abuse. Eating too much animal fat. <br><br>What's wrong with your teeth that you can't eat meat?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  been working in abattoirs for nigh on 10 years now. its traumatic for the animals, no doubt. but mass consumption requires mass production.<br><br>besides, if everyone went vegan, what would we do with all the animals? virtually all domestic animals have been bred solely for what they produce... few would survive outside of a domestic enviroment. most would suffer excruiating deaths if simply released.</br></br>  <br><br>Well, I'm doing something, what are you doing? Do we not do anything just because we can't do everything at once?<br><br>"Oh, there's 10 people drowning over there but our boat only fits 5, better turn back to shore"<br><br>Smart</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>High carb diets lead to obesity and diabeetus</br>  <br>it not gud</br>  <br><br>I don't argue we can't eat meat, but we're definitely not optimized for it as some people here seem to think ("herr durr im carnivore"), and most people should agree we eat way too much meat in general, and it's at the root of a bunch of issues from health to the environment.</br></br>  <br>The strength isn't a physical strength that you need to kill the animal. Stop being so trivial...<br><br>The strength vegans lack is the one you need to accept that life implies dead, that we have to kill to live. That's the deal. It's hard, but it's how it works.<br><br>Thinking this has anything to deal with MORAL is the main mistake made by vegans. Life isn't about moral. The moral doesn't rule the world. Nature does. We are part of it and have to accept the rules, and especially the fact that they aren't moral.<br><br>And for your concern, I'm not an americunt, so I eat real food, never burgers.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> being vegan is about being a special snowflake <br>You can argue that industrialized butchers are fucked up. A point Ill cede, why not just buy from regular butches or pick up hunting? That's what I do. Abstinence doesn't really solve much and only hurts you.<br><br>Humans have been using tools since they could walk. This argument is retarded.<br><br>No, your just so busy smelling your own self righteous farts to realize how fucking stupid you are. Your not actually interested in seeing a different point of view, your just looking for confirmation bias. <br><br>Humans all around the world to this day eat raw meat. Cooking meat however, is healthier and tastier, and as tool users we picked up the practice. <br><br>Run your thumb across your teeth, feel all them points? those weren't made for chewing plants.<br><br> ITT faggot vegan tries to be better than everyone. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>  if everyone went vegan <br><br>This isn't going to happen overnight.<br><br> what would we do with all the animals? <br><br>Less demand would mean less animals being produced strictly for the purpose.<br><br> few would survive outside of a domestic enviroment. most would suffer excruiating deaths if simply released. <br><br>No need to release the ones that already exist, just stop the production of them for food purposes and again if everyone went vegan it would be a long process over a long span of time.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  There's no con.<br>Stop judging people based on opposite beliefs.<br>Accept the fact that people are different than you.</br></br>  <br> GMO <br>No, I don't care about GMOs and at least around the vegans I know it's not a concern either. Fad-diet soccer moms and retards might be scared of GMOs but it's not a vegan thing, actually a lot of vegans look forward to some of the work in that area.</br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, I know. I'm a vegetarian/aspiring vegan. Just clarifying.</br></br>  <br>just let people eat what they want immature faggot</br>  <br>Rice and beans are fucking delicious.</br>  Isn't the obvious answer "I enjoy eating flesh, I'd thank you to keep your unwanted opinion to yourself."  <br><br>Don't shovel your face with everything in sight like a retard then, my blood work is perfect and I'm at my target weight and body build.</br></br>  <br><br>Vegans can eat stuff dat not gud, as long as there are no animal products in it.</br></br>  The only vegans i've ever seen are skeletor spooky manginas or ugly sickly tattoo'd girls like you posted.<br><br>That alone is enough to make me steer clear.</br></br>  Bacon.  <br><br> No, your just so busy smelling your own self righteous farts to realize how fucking stupid you are. Your not actually interested in seeing a different point of view, your just looking for confirmation bias. <br><br>Give me an argument that makes sense. I fucking love meat. I'd love to not feel any ethical pangs when I eat it.</br></br></br></br>    <br>also if those animals hadn't been domesticated they would likely be facing extinction</br>  ask that bitch if she sleeps on down pillows, pillows full of dead duck  <br>Go outside then</br>  <br>confirmed latino</br>  <br>Man, you're fucking retarded.</br>  <br><br>I'm sure the cow in the abattoir is glad his species hasn't gone extinct and that they exist in the abattoir.</br></br>  A lack of vitamin B12, which can cause severe psychosis and dementia.  <br><br>According to you it's perfectly fine for animals to die horribly in nature, being killed, dying of starvation or dying or suffering and dying of horrible diseases but it's NOT OK to keep animals in a safe environment, away from predators, away from diseases, with plenty of food and then kill them humanely. <br><br>That's the vegans' stupid mentality.</br></br></br></br>  <br>see<br><br>Not to mention a number of other naturally occuring vitamins and minerals you can only get through consumption of animal flesh. (or through a mountain of pills but that kind of defeats the purpose)<br><br>If you really need a special snowflake diet I would recommend paelleo.</br></br></br></br></br>  MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM  <br>How old are you?</br>  <br>There is none</br>  <br>I find uncooked meat disgusting, why?</br>  <br>Fellow wetback.</br>  I can't stand vegans, but my great uncle is a 58 year old vegan with a 22 y/o 9/10 mixed girlfriend he's been dating for three years who still thinks he's in his early 40s. Man has dark hair, minimal wrinkles and never wears a shirt since he has a gym body.  <br><br><br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=fGL<wbr>ABm7jJ-Y</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>http://www.pri.org/stories/2014-01-<wbr>09/new-research-plant-intelligence-<wbr>may-forever-change-how-you-think-ab<wbr>out-plants<br><br>Need moar?</br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tell her vegans are awesome and more ppl should be vegans, then they wont eat our bacon.</br>  <br><br>Except there are plenty of vegan sources of protein that are more than sufficient. Again, got any good arguments? Literally the only vitamin that needs supplementing is b12 and that is easy af to get.</br></br>  <br><br>  Eating animals is natural! <br>  Vegans want us to let animals live out their lives as nature intended! Stupid vegans!! <br><br>That logic. Pick a fucking story and stick to it, you can't have both.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> af <br><br>Nigger detected. No Tyrone, fried chicken is not vegan.</br></br></br>  MMMMMMMMMMMM  <br><br>You can get them in fucking gummi bear form for a couple bucks/60</br></br>  <br><br>If she's truly vegan then she shouldn't accept antibiotics since bacteria are alive just like cows and pigs and sheep. Or anything created by bacterial processes since it's the same as milk or eggs.</br></br>  We can be whatever we want. So why don't eat animal also? I won't reduce my possibility just for some screaming hippies  <br>How about the fact that most vegan food either tastes terrible, has a texture like grainy shit, or a combination of both? <br><br>Veggies are fine but when you start trying to substitute ingredients to imitate something it's aweful. I would rather have someone else eat the real version of somthing, vomit it back up, and then let me eat it than eat a vegan imitation.</br></br></br>  <br> vegan sources of protein that are more than sufficient <br><br>provide examples</br></br></br>  <br><br>  Thread about vegans <br>  Ill post pictures of meat it'll be so edge maybe senpai will love me this time </br></br></br>  there are no cons  <br>too much sauce</br>  I hate the fucking meat eaters who are like, mm delicious cow, delicious pig. They hear about Chinese eating dog and cat for a special event and flip out OH SHIT THEY CAN'T DO THAT. <br><br>meat eaters are fucking two-faced morons.</br></br>  <br>yes fucking americans</br>  <br>tell the cow on the open range that gets to live a long life free from predators that it would be better off if it was extinct</br>  <br><br>Butthurt vegan detected</br></br>  Animals kill other animals for survival. We are animals. We kill other animals for survival. The only difference is the way we kill them. We are more humane than animals. Take the giant cat family for example. They kill by jumping into their prey and biting their neck. The ones that don't die instantly are alive while being eaten. Then eventually die from pain. The way we kill them. Death is instant, they don't feel a thing.  <br><br>Fuck that - I'd eat dog or cat</br></br>  <br>I don't give a fuck about that yellow people. For what regard me they could eat each other. They are not completely human 'cause they are yellow</br>  <br><br>Peas, nuts, rice and beans, tofu, leafy greens, seeds, some non-dairy milks, quinoa, etc etc etc. There's an obsession with protein but it's mostly a fucking non-issue and most people get too much anyway.</br></br>  <br>I guess because most people think of dogs and cats as domesticated aninals. In other words, they think of cats and dogs as family.</br>  <br>nice full house<br>but what if they start outlawing meat??</br></br>    <br>or kiss anyone as you ingest some of their cells</br>  <br>I fucking hate vegans who are like, ooh new iPhone, sweet pair of Levis, fresh shoes, etc, prolonging the suffering of millions of humans. When it comes to animals they are like "ooh no I don't eat my chicken friends I respect all forms of life equally and would hate to purchase products that cause their suffering"<br><br>Vegans are fucking two-faced morons</br></br></br>  <br>The only real excuse for following a vegan diet would be if your religion demands it... beyond that veganism is nothing more than another form of "LOOK AT ME! LOOK AT ME! I'M SO SPECIAL, I REQUIRE A SPECIAL AND 'SUPERIOR' DIET! PLEASE LOOK AT ME!!!!"<br><br> The whiney little attention whore can eat dog-shit sandwiches for all I care...  <br><br> just don't try to push your "special" diet onto me </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>if there was no threat of diseases I'd be ok with soilent</br>  <br><br>Think again.<br>Read this fuckers. <br> However, eliminating all animal products from the diet increases the risk of certain nutritional deficiencies.  <br><br>http://m.ajcn.nutrition.org/content<wbr>/89/5/1627S.full</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Except many/most/all vegans wouldn't have a problem with this because it is a consenting participant.</br></br>  <br>OP, my head is shaking. You're being such a fool right now.<br><br>She's a vegan because she wants to be a self-righteous attention whore. It's got NOTHING to do with health or morality or anything else. Making any kind of rational argument will gain you nothing and only waste your time.<br><br>Tell her so and then end the conversation. For your own sake.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>they were bred to die.<br>you think that carrot wanted to be uprooted and cooked? plants are living organisms as well.</br></br>  Here's the only thing that matters when it comes to this bullshit: Whatever you, as an individual, think tastes good.  <br>I am an licensed ships officer and it is possible that I, yes, I, may be in command of this life boat. All I can tell you is that it sucks to no be aboard because I'm setting a course for safety and if you're not on it... To bad.</br>  <br><br> http://m.ajcn.nutrition.org/conten<wbr>t/89/5/1627S.full</wbr> <br> Unless vegans regularly consume foods that are fortified with these nutrients, appropriate supplements should be consumed. <br><br>Did you even get through the abstract? It's piss easy to get this shit into your vegan diet. If a vegan isn't, then they are stupid it's like someone being malnourished in America because they eat cheeseburgers all day and wondering why.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>what people think, and what is are two different things. maybe in china cows are domesticated, in India they're worshiped. So, we should respect them and not eat cow?</br>  <br><br> Plant sentience = Animal sentience <br> I am retarded and therefore I am right </br></br></br>  <br><br>But all the known risks associated with animal product consumption are fine, including heart disease which is strongly related and the biggest killer in the US. Take a multi-vitamin.</br></br>  <br><br>A major chunk of agriculture and related habitat loss goes into feeding cattle which is then killed and eaten at a cost of otherwise usable crop. Kill yourself for being retarded.</br></br>   Do you own a cat or dog? <br> What you feed them? <br><br>Either they answer "No I don't own them" then you wreck them how they kill one of them because it wasn't adopted or they say "Yes." and you wreck them how they feed them meat anyways or if they make their pets vegan they are abusing animals. 100% n00b proof, even for faggot OP</br></br></br>  <br>plant and animal sentience is the same but who cares? Every organism on earth has to die someday, if humans kill it fast and painlessly, then it's better than waiting for the animal or plant to die slow deaths of age or other animals. Humans eating things is actually merciful.</br>  You dont get to eat delicious bacon.<br> inb4 someone posts the pic with different kinds of vegan bacon <br>Pro tip: they taste like shit</br></br>  <br>if you tried to save the 5, all 10 would try to board and sink the vessel</br>  <br>  retarded therefore i am right <br><br>at last, something we agree on. but prove plants have no sentience.<br>for thousands of years we considered animals as dumb brutes without thought or feeling too.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>And what do you do?</br></br>  <br>if cattle are raised on an open range there is substantially less habitat destruction that there is for farming crops for vegans</br>  <br>prove that anyone else has a conscious awareness, prove that you are not just having some elaborate dream, prove that you are not the only one with a conscious awareness. <br>Pro tip: You can't</br></br>  <br><br>  Waiting for the animal to die slow deaths of age <br>  slow deaths of age <br>  deaths of age <br><br>You mean living a full life? Holy fucking shit how retarded are you</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Are we going to follow this logic to it's conclusion? Should we just kill everything? I mean humans are going to die, why not just destroy the planet. No sentience = no suffering.</br></br>  <br>yes, I do believe so. If everything was dead, nothing can be born, no suffering is perfection.</br>  <br>a full life, it's a fucking animal. good god 10/10</br>  <br>This shit fucks with me all the time.</br>  <br>protip: you're right. unfortunately, that makes you a figment of my imagination... therefore you are irrelevant and I'm insane for arguing with myself.</br>  Animal's are at least somewhat sentient, fully capable of pain and fear, deserve empathy, and slaughtering them for meat is undeniably cruel. But you know what? Life is cruel and unfair, it is not an idealistic perfect system where all can live in harmony, life on this planet is based on survival of the fittest and consumption of the weak and regardless of where were are now culturally our species and our bodies were also shaped by this enviroment and are thus designed to eat meat if it is to be healthy.<br><br> The natural world is a brutal place and we are part of it, your options are to man up and accept that fact and or to let your heart bleed and blood spill over something that can't and won't be changed.</br></br>  <br><br>Open range meat is extremely unscalable and it only exists because of two-faced retards who want to feel good about themselves without any effort. If you want to produce meat at the current scale it has to be done in farms, and the animals fed with highly subsidized corn and soy (about 70% of what is grown in the US goes to livestock). Add water and polution costs on top of that.</br></br>  Taste  <br> killing animals is wrong because they have sentience <br> eat plants instead <br>but plants have been shown to have some sentience<br> but its not at the same level <br>so you get to decide what is ok to kill??</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Ok, then you can sit in the corner with your dunce cap.</br></br>  <br><br>Better kill all dogs, pigs, cows, human babies, and plants at birth so they don't risk living their lives and dying years later of old age, wouldn't want that to happen. See, meat eaters are more humane than vegans.</br></br>  <br>I don't do anything nor do I claim to or care to. I wake up every day, I make money, I eat animals and I eat healthy, and I come home and fuck my girlfriend and I exercise. I don't live in a fucking fantasy world where I get to pick and choose what morals I choose to obey or not. It's all or nothing you skinny hippy fuck, go rub some patchouli oil in your smelly beard and rub one out to yourself in the mirror you pretentious little shit</br>  <br><br>I do for me, yes. I'm not forcing this on anyone and in reality, I'm vegan for environmental reasons not to mitigate suffering.</br></br>  <br><br>Hey, at least when people say they don't give a fuck and just like the taste, they're not making up retard excuses to avoid actually thinking about what they're doing.</br></br>  <br>most people aren't animal equalists, I'm not sure why you vegans always assume everyone gives the same value to every different type of animal.</br>  <br>Ausfag here, and our beef is open range</br>  <br>Then why the fuck do you care if vegans are two faced you inconsistent little fuck?</br>  <br>Veganism <br><br>PROS- While it's true that mankind evolved eating meat, industrialized society eats waaay more meat than is healthy, making calories, fats, saturated fats, cholesterol and sodium; higher than it should be for many Americans.<br><br>Also, before the industrial age, many people had iron and protein difficiency, now we get too much if anything. Being vegan is a good way of restoring the balance in a modern era.<br><br>CONS - Veganism is costly. Veganism honestly works better for females. Meat builds testosterone levels, while soy builds estrogen in the body. <br><br>I've known many beautiful vegan females while any male vegan I know is very trim with very little muscles mass.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It is somewhat retarded of the meat eaters who act like there is something morally bankrupt in eating dogs though.</br></br>  <br><br>Australia also has factory farms.</br></br>  <br><br>FYI you don't have to eat soy as a vegan.</br></br>  <br>thats only valid in some areas</br>  HEY GUYS I FOUND SOMETHING AWESOME<br><br>you probably know vegans have to supplement themselves with B12 vitamin, as recommended by big vegan organisations (and that is truely needed).<br><br>Do you know how the B12 in the supplements is produced ? It's synthesized by mass cultured bacteria, like Propinobacterium.<br><br>DO YOU KNOW WHAT IS IN THE CELL CULTURE MEDIA ?<br>Meat. https://www.atcc.org/~/ps/11827.ash<wbr>x<br><br>i can't stop laughing right now</br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>What is?</br></br>  <br> industrialized society eats waaay more meat than is healthy, making calories, fats, saturated fats, cholesterol and sodium; higher than it should be for many Americans. <br><br>Meat doesn't do that. Processed foods do. And reality check: most vegan foods are processed as fuck. Example: Tofu</br></br></br>  <br>mainly chicken and pig. they also get slammed in the media and are shut down or ordered to stop production every other week.<br><br>australia is remarkably good to its animals. but we have a buttload of space for them to run around in i guess.</br></br></br>  ex-vegan here<br>PETA kills way more animals than it saves with it's kill shelters and brainwashes the impressionable in the same way that they claim the evil food industry has brainwashed the world.<br><br>Also, no matter how much a vegan claims something tastes "exactly like" its non-vegan counterpart, it doesn't. Fake meat is bearable and gets you through meat cravings, but it's not the same. That's just what they try to make themselves believe.</br></br></br>  <br>about vegan organization recommending the use of B12 supplements<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitam<wbr>in_B12#cite_note-21 (note 21, 22, 23)<br><br>a source for Propinobacterium http://www.google.com/patents/US649<wbr>2141<br>others bacteria are used but it's the same shit</br></wbr></br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>It is not pain, it is a chemical reaction that it transmitted around the plant to tell it where to start healing.</br>  Okay, just tell her this:<br><br>As an omnivore, you can eat ANYTHING she can eat. But as a vegan, she is very limited to her options. You have all of the potential to have an infinitely healthier diet than her at lower cost, because you're not limiting your nutrient sources.</br></br>  <br><br>  Most vegan foods <br><br>You mean most vegan processed foods. Rice and beans and legumes and seeds and a bunch of other shit is vegan and unprocessed. I've never had tofurkey in my life and I don't really like Tofu.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not really, most westerners like dogs and we associate dogs with friends and companions, to see them get eaten is disturbing to us, chickens not so much.</br>  <br>there is also a growing free range movement for them</br>  <br><br>Literally no vegan ever has worried about that. The array of cheap, healthy, good vegan foods is so wide it's literally only a problem for anti-vegan circle jerks.</br></br>  <br><br>As a vegan, I think veganism would be better off with PETA. They are the terrorists of the vegan movement and get all the attention because of it. <br><br>I think any vegan that eats products that are supposed to taste like or be like meat, they are retarded and either beleive it because they have forgotten how great meat is or never had meat in the first place.</br></br></br></br>  The reason I'm not a vegan is simple, I truly do not care about self righteousness or ethics, I get by on whatever is convenient, legal, and enjoyable. I'm a hedonist, I don't care about saving the world.  <br> being this petty <br>who the fuck cares what strangers do</br></br>  <br>Yeah no vegan in the history of mankind has ever worried about eating healthier or saving money on food.</br>  <br><br>Why waste your time with that broad ... go fuckin' make something of yourself</br></br>  <br>*tips m'fedora*</br>  <br>true. but free range is generally half the product for 3 times the price. it's not practical for everyone.</br>  <br><br>Yeah, but there is nothing morally bankrupt in someone not sharing your preference for dogs and acting like there is any inherent difference between dog and pig consumption is absurd.</br></br>  <br>yeah, and the amount of soy in a vegan diet is actually dangerous. most people who go vegan don't know what the fuck they're doing or what's actually in their fake meat, and become really unhealthy as a result. Asians eat a ton of soy, but they also eat a ton of sea vegetables which balance out the shit in soy somehow. The average vegan has never even heard that soy can be dangerous when consumed in large quantities.</br>  <br>I figured it out. Show her this.</br>  <br>*tips back at you* come back to my place to watch netflix and chill.. bro</br>  <br><br>I respect your honesty unlike the rest of the faggots in here who think that eating meat is defensible.</br></br>  <br>All the vegans I know are aware of the possible dangers of consuming too much soy. Some of the soy shit even says it right on the labels. Also if you have a vegan diet solely based on fake meats and soy products and whatnot you'd probably be fucked regardless of your diet.</br>  <br>What the main focus wasn't on the cost you dildo</br>  <br> defensible <br>how are you that stupid?</br></br>  1)because meat is delicious <br>2) animals =/= humans <br>3)because animals eat animals too</br></br>  <br> I'm arguing with a bitch online. <br> arguing with a bitch online. <br> arguing with a bitch <br> arguing <br> online <br><br>you're such a hardcore internet gangster</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How many animals did you hunt and kill with your bare hands recently</br>  They need supplements.  <br>there isn't objectively, but to us there is. I personally don't think what other countries eat is any westerners business. But it's completely reasonable for a westerner to be disturbed by the thought of eating a dog</br>  <br> I think any vegan that eats products that are supposed to taste like or be like meat, they are retarded <br>I agree. Sadly that's the norm, as you probably know. When I was vegan I had veggie burgers and chik'n patties in my freezer all the time. And that was well into my third year of it. I still had some left on the night I ran out to McDonald's and got a real cheeseburger.</br></br>  <br><br>Coming in a bit late there bud</br></br>  <br>  McDonald's <br>  real cheeseburger </br></br>  <br>underrated post<br>  tl;dr every single vegan is eating animal products </br></br>  <br><br>Apparently I am, because I still don't know what my mistake was.</br></br>  <br>Honestly, anybody living in a modern society needs to take supplements to maintain proper body function. That is unless you've got endless supplies of cash and are active pretty much every waking moment.<br><br>Disclaimer: I hate veganism</br></br></br>  <br><br> to be disturbed <br><br>With you there, but the moral angle is retarded. That's all I'm saying.</br></br></br></br>  <br>All the vegans I know aren't.</br>  <br><br>I meant real in the sense that it isn't a vegan burger.</br></br>  <br> because i dont hunt i can't eat meat <br> being this retarded </br></br>  <br>How many nuts and berries have you gathered lately?</br>  <br>That's cooked some. I like my meat rare because it's juicier and has more flavor in my opinion. Just not a big fan of dry meat.</br>  <br>Do you HONESTLY believe the animals would get slaughtered if nobody bought their meat? Are you fucking dense?</br>  <br><br><br>Except bacteria aren't animals you sperglords.</br></br></br>  <br> All the vegans I know are aware <br>That's good, but how many of them are 13 year old girls with a "fuck you, mom and dad! I'm a VEGAN now and you have to pander to my dietary needs" mentality? Or unhealthy people who heard that this guy's friend of a friend lost a lot of weight and lowered his cholesterol by being vegan? I'm sure the vegans you know are the good vegans that have made the decision based on a lot of research and experience, but you have to admit there are a lot of people who go vegan without the proper knowledge.<br>These are also the types of people who do not pay attention to warning labels.</br></br></br>   I'm healthier than every vegan I have ever known <br> mfw </br>  <br>vegans don't eat animal products at all. bacteria from an animal source is pushing the boundaries a lot... dick.</br>  <br>Nothing wrong with eating what you want, but both vegans and steak eaters always have to let everybody know that they have inferior tastes.<br><br>News flash: nobody gives a shit about the fact that you don't eat meat, and there are more ways than one to prepare a palatable steak.</br></br></br>  <br>Even if one were to accept that as true then you would still be eating an animal byproduct at the very least seeing as how the are saying the culture is grown using meat.</br>  <br><br>Solid argument, dumbass.</br></br>  <br>Oh, I see you didn't read the PDF. Those bacteria are made with the blood of sheep</br>  <br>you're the first person who actually understood that. I like you.</br>    just a thought.... mass-produced vegetables are grown using fertilizer. commercial fertilizers are primarily made of animal products.<br><br>soooo... vegetables are consuming nutrients from animal sources. is consuming animal products and byproducts second-hand a problem for the average vegan?</br></br>  If animals could (even dogs), they would eat us.  That truth is that veganism is much more sustainable. It take like 15 pounds of grain to create 1 pound of meat. Meat production is just very inefficient.

I am a white non Jewish straight guy so they shouldn't give a fuck about me, and I bet they are more pleasant hairy hours in the sense that they won't play loud shitty music and just general niggery stuff. Also, the black guys are more likely to commit crime and they probably won't look after the area and will trash it. <br> pic related </br>    <br> i bet they are more pleasant neighbours*  <br>No idea what the fuck happened there</br></br>  <br>Can I take both teams for great justice?</br>  <br> believing moot  <br>Fucking summer</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;624926762 <br>Spike looks dissapointed</br>  Skinheads<br><br>Atleast they'll be quiet and wont try to kill me. Might try to recruit me because i am a filthy blonde hair blue eyed retard too, might see a few race wars too<br><br>it also assumes ill have a house, therefore i can live comfortably now</br></br></br></br>  blacks of course  <br> 3 year old image  <br> moot </br></br>  <br>Obviously the skinheads, at least they wouldn't steal my shit or chimp out at every opportunity.</br>  <br>The Skinheads because I'm a large white man and they would protect me and my children from the increasing nigger threat.</br>  Where there's a few niggers there will soon be hundreds. <br>The area would probably become a ghetto in no time.</br>  <br>My name is shake zula, the mic rula, the old-schoola; you wanna trip? I'll bring it to ya.</br>  <br>You child is a little piece of shit faggot</br>  <br>Fucking based farage</br>  <br>Probably, but I love them anyway.</br>  <br>Found the nigger</br>  <br>Pedo fag?</br>    <br>How does loving my children make me a pedo?</br>  <br><br>The niggers. I neonazi skinheads are even below niggers.</br></br>  <br>Noice</br>  <br>You white... The whites are pedos</br>  <br>Are you autistic or something?</br>  They're both retarded but I am a white german, i would prefer the naziparty. Lesser chances to get robbed and murdered in the middle of the night.  no niggers..  <br>You can barely speak english. Stop you're embarrassing yourself.</br>  The thing is both are trash. I would choose skinheads because I'm white, and they would prob leave my house alone.  <br>Just because your dad walked out on you doesn't mean every caring parent wants to fuck their kids.</br>  Left because i'm white<br>And you're a retard</br>  <br> I neonazi skinheads are even below niggers. <br><br>And anyway if you think NIGGERS are better than any group of white people than you are delusional. My roomate is black and I love that guy, his family is awesome too. But that is because he is black, not NIGGER.</br></br></br>  <br><br>in africa they rape 3 yr olds in gangs for fun.</br></br>  White trash  <br><br>Nazi's actually try to better themself and progress the human race.
