[ S/Fur S-Fur  If you're gonna OP, gotta do it right, otherwise we can't party all night.     My download works fine, my upload is fucked.   SFUR?   let's see if I can post.  I'm just gonna stay the fuck away from making threads and instead just focus on delivering the good stuff.  What're yall in the mood for?        dragon this shit up nigga    post your absolute best stuff that even you go   hnnghh  over.       http://vocaroo.com/i/s1AboAZ1WXhz  I will rape you with cuddles.        i wanna talk about GTA fuck these fur fagogos       spas 12   drawn correctly   too small  so fuckin close, saved anyway        Starting with the dragons then what I like the best     maybe if you are a good boy  lets talk gta then go         Because nipple piercings have the lowest rejection rate, and causes more stimulation in nipples, making them fun to play with. They're also easily hidden under a shirt. Before people get nipple piercings, they're afraid they'll feel weird or painful, but pretty much everyone feels comfortable with it after getting a nipple piercing. I'm definitely planning on getting some myself. I'm also thinking about eyebrow piercings, but I'm not sure about that. Depends on how successful and formal I plan to be.       maybe shark grill is just big that's what i would assume she looks like she might be a big badass  good shit nigga        nigger go to /v/ they fucking love GTA.

I'm getting an idea.       because you faggots will argue about anything  OP is a faggot  Depends. Are those vertical beams made of steel?   Mythbusters busted this shit already   After thinking about it for many minutes, I have concluded that OP is a faggot.   What do you mean does it take off? is this even a real question    Theoretically, if the plane were travelling fast enough, it could generate enough lift for the treadmill as well.   There is no chance for inertia, so no.   Why wouldn't it?    Yes, the wheels provide nothing but a platform for the plane to rest on until the plane gets, enough airspeed.   Just like how the wheels provide nothing but a platform for the plane to rest on for when it lands.     No. A plane takes of by the effects of LIFT, which is caused by a differenze of pressure over and under the wings. LIFT only happens if the air is moving, if there in so wind, like in this case, the plane wont get up.   Obviously it's not the wheels spinning that make an airplane fly but the air under the wings so no it wouldn't take off because it's stationary..    No air current on the wings needed for lift.    It takes of and lands in your mother's vagina.     this  everyone who says otherwise was publicly schooled     *if there is no wind    How bout you watch a fucking episode of mythbusters. More specially the one where they proved it would take off    it fucking doesnt. whether a plane takes off or not isnt dependent on how fast the wheels are turning   Nope, won't take off.  If the wings aren't moving relative to the air, no lift would be generated.    The treadmill wouldn't keep it stationary because the engines (in the wings) push against the air, not the ground.  So yes it would accelerate normally and take off, assuming the wings don't get ripped off as it tries to go through the front part of that giant treadmill.    No, the pilot would have to be about 2 inches tall.   I think we can all agree OP is a faggot    Because i know physics ;) seeya    The fact they needed to still makes me cringe   It won't because the fucking bars on the treadmill are too narrow for the wings to pass through, don't need a degree in aerodynamics just to figure that out   he means DOES IT LIFT?   DOES MYTHBUSTERS MEAN NOTHING TO YOU GODDAMN FAGGOTS?? IT WILL TAKE OFF!!!! IT WILL!!!!!   What airport is this?     The engines push the plane forward, so once there is enough thrust to overcome the friction on the wheels the plane would start to take off normally.  No. There is no treadmill this big, to carry a plane. The wings will collapse in the side - thingies of the treadmill.      DOES MYTHBUSTERS MEAN NOTHING TO YOU GODDAMN FAGGOTS   No, I didn't get my education in physics from some prime time pop science hacks.       https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ECq<wbr>xmfmp6gU</wbr>  [ ]    The wings do move dipshits. The plane would still travel forward even on a treadmill because it's being propelled by jets, not the wheels. The wheels would just be spinning twice as fast due to the tradmill, but the force being generated is by the air forced out of the engines, not a motor spinning the wheels. Replace the jet with a rocketship laying sideways on wheels and you'll get the picture.  probably not, although the engines can rev the plane and air are pretty much stationary next to eachother, so it's like trying to take off with intact engines and broken wings as there won't be the lifting current.   the same episode where they state the concept of the experiment is flawed? the plane delivers thrust through its engines, the wheels are unpowered.  its almost impossible for a plane to stay completely still in this situation, the calculations are astronomically difficult to get everything to match.  in mythbusters the ultralight aircraft they used moved forward slightly during the experiment which may have given it enough lift to get off the ground. ramp the experiment up to a liner, which requires 1000 times more lift.... chances are it won't work        Mythbusters   I can't believe they fired that fine bitch with the nice ass.      Noooooo!! Not Tory!!    being this retarded.    Guys, the treadmill IS the wheel. As the treadmill itself accelerates (not talking about the belt, I'm talking about the entire device. Think how a tank moves) the plane will eventually generate enough lift     Jet fuel doesn't melt steel beams.   If you blow on it hard enough, yes.  It depends, are the engines on and moving?   post vid   You're all missing the obvious point here. The wings are wider then the treadmill's arm so it's not going anywhere.   Is this Heathrow? Looks like something the Brits would build.   If the plane remains stationary in relativity to the ground, with the wheels rolling at the same speed, causing the plane to move at 0mph, simply with wheels spinning, it will NOT take off.  If the plane is gaining forward thrust and moving forward by its own propelling means, then the plane gains the needed air-thrust under and over the wings for takeoff, simply for the fact that it is moving forward RELATIVE to the ground, like a normal plane, and will take off.  The question is flawed in that it describes neither needed factor of it the plane is stationary because of powered wheels, or if it is moving forward because of a propeller giving it proper air thrust.  Again, powered wheels keeping it at 0mph relative to the ground beneath the treadmill, it will not take off. If the plane is on free-wheels and being propelled by a proper engine, it will move forward, and WILL take off.  Science.            mfw people still argue about this   just attack at night     You are supposed to ignore that or pretend it is wide enough. Nerd rules apply.   Several possibilities.  Both the plane and treadmill move forward, with sufficient airspeed it'll take off.   The treadmill moves so fast that it'll speed up air above the belt. The airplane will lift up (you'll need a really fast belt)   The engines draft so much air that there will be air flowing with sufficient speed under the wings.   The engines are slightly pointed upwards, might lift off   There might be some more, as long as its theoretically possible. If you want to talk about if it'd really work, that would be complete bullshit and a waste of time        See<br/>    lol, nope. to take off a plane needs to be moving forward not relative to the ground but to the air. air has to actually be flowing around the wings for it to get proper lift. that's the way the wings are designed. either way this plane is going nowhere. it can't take off. if it could they wouldn't have slingshots for planes on battleships, just big ass treadmills.    So is a plane on a runway, are you saying planes can't fly?    that's what I was saying. It was implied that because its moving relative to the ground, that its also moving relative to the air around it. If the engines are what's propelling the plane, then it will move forward despite the treadmill and will take off like any normal plane. If its the wheels powering it and the plane has no means of lift other than moving fast enough because of said powered wheels, it won't go anywhere.      does air flow around you when you run on a treadmill? no, because you're not moving relative to the air.    of course not... jesus fucking christ... the wingspan and the width of the treadmills arms are insignificant to this equation.   No. Ground speed doesnt say anything. The air speed is what matters. Check the video of a small plane lifting off with a strong headwind. Zero groundspeed but high airspeed    It does. Friction of the treadmill with the air causes air to move. Not a lot, but there is some    everything you pointed out there is wrong    What part of Lift force=0.5 *density of medium* airspeed^2* Area of surface* dimension coefficient Cl am I violating?    No, but i'm not talking about that you tard. If the plane is being powered by propellers, then the wheels are free-flowing and have no effect on the plane. the propeller pulls the plane forward like any normal plane does, with the wheels doing nothing but supporting it. The plane is then moving forward relative to the ground and to the air, like a NORMAL PLANE. The treadmill has NO EFFECT if its free-flowing wheels. Again, the plane will take off because the propellers are pulling it forward, ignoring the treadmill.         not even close to enough for a plane to take off. the speed that the treadmill would have to spin to get that much air is astronomical. i highly doubt there's any way physically possible to get the treadmill going fast enough to whip up winds for a plane to take off.    Hello I am 28 years old. I've read "what did you just say about me you little bitch..", "hello my name is john and I hate every single one of you", and even "sleep tight pupper"  But this right here... This is the most autistic thing I have EVER read in my entire life. It's clear from this post that you are entertained by jangling keys, throw uncontrolled tantrums, and put your toys in straight lines. You have won, and well deserved, the 2015 triple platinum autism of the year award. I'd give it to you, but you'd probably just chew on it so I will give it to your parents to hang in your room in their basement. You are officially the most autistic person in the world.      Depends on the treadmill and the plane, nothing else was specified. It is physically possible so why would it be wrong? To seriously consider this you'd need a lot of specs and thats just silly.      haha, i can't tell if you're trolling or if you're actually this retarded. the plane is not moving relative to the air. go ahead, get running on a treadmill and stick your arms out to the sides. feel any airflow? no. now do one better, get on a chair with wheels or something, get on a treadmill and hold yourself while the wheels flow freely beneath you, would you feel any airflow? no. and if you try to say yes then you simply don't know how things work and i can;t help you      if you wanna get technical then yea, maybe there's some way to get a treadmill going that ridiculously fast without disintegrating, not to mention the wheels of the plane too. if there's a way to do that then sure.    Aircraft carriers need slingshots because the runway isnt large enough for a jet to get enough speed to take off, so the slingshot is there to help get it fast enough to take off. Because its not large enough. This has nothing to do with treadmills.    You really don't know physics. Its the propellers pulling the plane forward, not the wheels. The propellers ignore the treadmill and the ground, pulling the plane forward because of air thrust. The treadmill has no effect on the plane at all. Running on a treadmill is like powered wheels being the source of movement for the plane, so of course its not going to get lift THAT WAY. I'm talking about if the wheels are free-flowing and its the propellers being the source of movement for the plane, NOT the wheels. If its the propellers, the plane moves forward relative to the unmoving ground, ignoring the treadmill, moving forward like a normal plane, gaining air lift, and taking off. For your situation, imagine stepping OFF the treadmill and running forward with your arms out. You are moving forward relative to the ground and the air, and you WILL feel the air on your arms as YOU move. If you still don't get it, you're retarded. If you were a troll and baiting, shit I fell for it. Nice job. Either way, you're still wrong and a dipshit.          since 2006 this fucking shit right here  its bad enough i'm not a robot and i select all "all the food" but you cock suckers cant come up with a new god damn idea for a thread than the god fucking plane on the treadmill OF COURSE IT WOULD FLY this is how AIRCRAFT CARRIERS WORK attack at night no shit these fucking plebians      exactly, it needs the air under its wings, and there's not enough room to get it by speeding up. so they sling it off and it's got the speed and air to keep lift.   Uh, no. It obviously doesn't fit through there.  If it did fit though, it would take off. The engines provide thrust which propels the aircraft forward. The wings provide lift which lifts the plane. The wheels are free spinning, so they don't affect thrust or lift. It might be easier to look at it this way: You have a toy car, with no motor and free spinning wheels. You hold the car on the treadmill with your hand. You can push the car forward on the treadmill and the car will move forward.     Rekt    oh, so you just don't know how things work. it doesn't matter how the plane is keeping up with the treadmill, either by wheels or by thrust. what matters is if the plane is getting lift. and the way a plane gets lift, say it with me, WINGS. no matter how the plane keeps up with the treadmill there's no wind underneath its wings, and no take off. the engines, propellers, or anything else doesn't put wind beneath its wings, it just keeps it rolling with the treadmill. kinda like our legs keep us going on treadmills     the treadmill has no effect on the plane at all  That is were you are wron,faggot. If the threadmill runs with the required speed for the plane to take off BUTT IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION,the plane would need double the acceleration from the engines.       planes can't melt treadmills so you're completely wrong with every point  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=qt0<wbr>9gM58Adw</wbr>  [ ]       Again, the propeller causes the plane to move forward, ignoring the treadmill you colossal faggot. Moving forward causes it to gain the pressure under the wings. To simplify it for your tiny-brain: If the plane is powered by propellers, it ignores the treadmill, and is a normal plane. It pretends the treadmill isn't there at all. It takes off like a normal plane. If you even try to argue with that, you'd be literally saying that planes can't take off, and they can, and do, every fucking day. Suck a nigger.  You're just being retarded. Go watch mythbusters. Its honestly the best way to explain the proper situation to retards. Sciencefag out, because you autists are giving me a headache.  Fucking retards, all of you.                Read this:<br/>        OP what will your mom take off in this thread?    Physics major here to ruin the fun. No, it won't. A plane takes off because the pressure above the wings is lower than the pressure beneath. This is achieved by moving at speed (and because of the shape of the wing). If it isn't accelerating (treadmill is counteracting the acceleration), the pressure above and below the wings will be equal, just as though it were stationary. GG, well played.   hahahahahaha, it's even worse than i thought. you're missing the entire point of the post! what do treadmills do? they keep you stationary while they roll underneath you. which is the question we're all debating dipshit. assuming the plane could gain forward momentum against the treadmill then sure it'll take off. that's why, just because it has a propeller or an engine doesn't magically make it able to take off. but while the treadmill is keeping pace with it, it'll stay right where it is.    i dont think your puny brain understands. the plane cant move forward, if it were, then the treadmill would be moving slower than the wheels. it doesnt matter how hard the propellers blow, the treadmill will push it back with equal force    welp, that's that ok kids, time for bed     It all depends on the speed of the threadmill and the acceleration of the jet engines. If they are equal,the plane isn't going anywhere If the threadmill is going faster the plane would be thrown off the threadmill If the acceleration is bigger than the speed the plane will take off It doesn't get simpler than this.        exactly, that's what he's not getting    It will fucking take off, if even only for a second just to have the wings clipped by the support bars of the treadmill. Unless you can find a treadmill with the soul purpose of outrunning an airplane, it's gonna take off. The whole "it's not moving so it can't gain thrust" is bs. Sure on a larger scale if the runway can run backwards at, at least the same speed the plane is moving forward. BUT ITS A FUCKING TREADMILL. You wanna run on an exercise equipment at 400 mph. Go ahead you autists   Holy fuck it's retards galore in here. The wheels do not provide thrust, the engines do. so the wheels will spin freely under the plane and the treadmill will do nothing. the air around the plane is not affected by the treadmill, as soon as the engines get cranking the plane will move forward, propelled through the air even though it is on the ground. The key factor here is that the wheels do nothing. it will move forwards regardless of the treadmill, and will still generate lift. Not sticking around to read replies, only post because so many retards.   He is too arrogant to actually read what we post and stop to think about it.     That's some hard samefagging you got going on there.    You dumb fucks.  The wheels and treadmill are completely irrelevant. They are simply there to provide support until lift forces take over. The plane will begin to accelerate, the wheels will spin twice as fast as it is matching the treadmill, and eventually take off (assuming a long enough treadmill).  The treadmill is irrelevant.       Incorrect.  The pull of the plane's engines would create enough pull to lower the mass giving the plane the ability to take off as if it's on an actual runway.      I think you should quit studying physics if you don't understand why you're wrong. The wheels are free spinning.      the wheels do nothing  I stopped reading there.    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=S37<wbr>7HwOthjo</wbr>  [ ] Faggots can't science     Ok, Physics major again here because you guys seem to think that I don't understand how planes work. Yes, the propeller/engines are what drives the plane but what you're basically saying is that landing gear brakes don't work because they're not what drives the plane. If the conveyor belt is 100% matching the speed of the wheels, the plane would not roll and therefore the plane would not be able to speed up. The plane wouldn't be speeding up relative to the ground or the air, only the treadmill, which is stationary.. just like the plane. Bloody morons.   But nowhere in that post did he say that.     yes it will    Yes. The engines are exerting a force on the surrounding static air, not the ground like a car. It would still be pushed forwards, and eventually have enough lift to take off.     Do you think the turbine engines mounted on the wings power the wheels? And that it gets enough momentum on the ground to "jump" to where it is flying to? Ok, picture standing in a pool, and the ground is moving under you in one direction, but you want to move the other way. Swim with your arms. notice how you move forwards? Same principle. The plane uses air for thrust, not the tarmac.   mfw people are actually arguing about it   Exactly this. It all depends on the speed of the threadmill.      624095247  Yes there is. The plane is been driven by wheels on the belt, it's pushing against the air, it would move forwards at the same speed, just the wheels would be moving twice as fast.     OMFG,read the fucking post before you reply.    If the treadmill keeps up with the wheel speed at all times, then the plane remains stationary. If the treadmill locks at one speed, the initial speed of the moving wheels, and stays at that speed, then the plane will eventually move forward. Kind of depends on if the treadmill matches speed of the wheels at all times, or just the initial speed.     Mythbusters proved the plane takes off   faggots keep arguing     they did it wrong    Thread closed! Replying after this post get you cancer.       OP what will your mom take off in this thread?  OP what will your mom take off in this thread?  OP what will your mom take off in this thread?  OP what will your mom take off in this thread?  OP what will your mom take off in this thread?  OP what will your mom take off in this thread?                Assuming the wheels were frictionless, so you could spin the wheels as fast as you wanted on the treadmill, and the plane wouldn't move backwards, it would just stay there. Turn on the engines, they push against the static air behind them. They're exerting force on something static, not the backwards moving belt. So it would be pushed forward. The plane would speed up just as much, but the wheels would just have to compensate by turning twice as fast.    BUT THE WHEELS SPIN FREELY.  They will not slow down the plane. The engines will pull the plane through the air, the wheels just stop it from falling through the earth. Like the other faggot said, you are not very good at physics.  If this is too difficult for you, imagine being in a shopping trolly, with a very powerful fan in your hands. The fan will make you move in whatever direction you want. How mill the floor beneath you moving make any difference, save the miniscule resistance from imperfect bearings?      Physics major again. Getting sick of this myth busters shit. The cloth they dragged behind to simulate the conveyor belt was not flat, it was lumpy and also on an incline. It was also sliding along the tarmac. There is no way that it could simulate a conveyor belt or match the speed of the plane 100%. Mythbusters are constantly performing bad science and the reason for this is that they are not scientists. They're special effects gurus.     BUT THE WHEELS SPIN FREELY.  This. Fucking this.     If you want the goddamn plane to lift you need it to move at a specific speed.Speed requires wheels because the plane isn't a helicopter.  FOR THE LOVE OF GOD THE MOTHERFUCKING WHEELS MATTER!    The plane cant accelerate if the wheels and treadmill move at the same speed. If the treadmill is locked in at one speed it will move. The plane pushes on air but in order to accelerate through the air it has to cover distance to create lift, which it can't cover on a treadmill moving at the same speed as the wheels.   It's not driven by the wheels, it's driven the by engines, which exert force on the static air, not moving ground. The wheels move freely. If the ground was moving backwards underneath the wheels, they'd just turn as if the plane was moving at that speed forward on static ground. We're of course assuming that the wheels are ideal and frictionless.    Yes you need lift, from forwards movement. Explain how free spinning wheels affect the movement of the plane. What stops it from moving forwards? The treadmill doesn't, because as it moves, the wheels spin to accomodate the motion, keeping the plane immobile until the engines kick in and move it forwards.  Captchas are bullshit i can't even tell what half these foods are.      This.     until the engines kick in and move it forwards  It wont move forwards if the treadmill moves at the same speed. How is a plane going to move forwards when the ground is moving backwards at the same speed it moves forward at? The plan will generate force to move forward but the treadmill matches this so the plan goes nowhere causing no air to flow to create lift.     See Its literally this simple.     Dude,just get your fingers out of your ears and listen. A plane won't lift until high-speed air gets under it's wings.The only way for high-speed air to get under the wings is for the plane to move at a specific speed. You need the bloody wheels because before the plane can fly it needs to gain speed so the high-speed air gets under the wings.It's not a helicopter,it can't lift off standing motionless. Now the only question I have is:What's the speed of the threadmill?And if it changes?       It's not a car that's been driven by pushing against the ground, it's driven by jet engines that push against the air behind them, so they still propel the plane forward, irrespective of what the ground is doing.     Because the engines of the plane will move the plane forward in the air. The speed that the treadmill is moving at is irrelevant because the wheels are not what are pushing the plane forward, they are merely holding the plane off the ground. So the engines will pull the plane forward in the air normally and eventually the plane will gain enough airspeed to take off.    No freedoms to destroy Does no fly    The engines propel THROUGH THE AIR, not from the ground. so in a vacuum, you would be correct, but outside of a vacuum, you are missing the point. The problem here is that I agreed with you for a long time until my dad explained it to me, it took a lot of arguing but i finally saw the light. The treadmill does not affect the movement of the plane. At all. If it was a car with wings, you would also be correct, because a car uses the ground for thrust, not the air. I'm trying not to just scream autist at everyone because i want a few people to make that mental click of understanding. The ground is irrelevant. The wheels are irrelevant. What if a plane took off from a frictionless surface? It would be the same, because the air is all that matters.   if hitler killed muslims he would have been a fucking hero.  an hero  he did. stupid op, but there werent that much    f for Kenshiro, Dokuro, Carl Sagan, Noriako and Estellise   That boy ain't right, and Shia is not letting his dreams stay dreams, and is just DOING IT    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;624104153  So you admit I'm happier than you?

HOW'S EVERYONE DOING?   Said what?      I did say I am going to leave because I had problems IRL and IC also. I got tired of King.  I already told this once. I got a lot of work to do in these next weeks and I could not do anything else in my free time but HG.  And I realised that retiring King was a useless and stupid thing to do, you can call it Dimitriing or anything I do not care.        It's me Teddie.No doubt about it!  It's good to see you here.      Bla bla I will take it as a yes. My classic answer is "K"     What's wrong with love?    Perhaps I should be quite now... I've caused a stir...    A drink sounds lovely, thank you!

Retarded muslims doing another trivial act of 'terror'?    Live no but I can translate the news.   So apparently they used a car to ram the entrance to a company that produces gaz cans, triggering an explosion. They found a body that has been severed of it's head inside, and they apparently oppened a few gaz cans. Antiterrorism has been called, and they apparently got one of the suspects.      the head of the victim have been found on the fence of some french society    Used this source.   A TV news channel said it isn't the head of someone working there though. So wtf is happening        Daesh dude with islamist flag came into french society with bomb. he made a big explosions, killed some ppl and beheaded one   1 confirmed death 1 confirmed arrest   damn son   This happen in France every other week now  Its hardly a prediction      the fuck    top kek is this real?

Just an isolated incident. This has nothing to do with islam and their pedophile prophet    I was thinking just that with that racist who killed the black people in America and some muslims came out and said "we don't see white people apologizing for what he's done".  Completely not realizing that being white isn't an ideology or a group people subscribe to. If me and him were part of the same BMX group and he murdered someone in the name of cross-terrain biking i sure as shit would clear my own name.         http://www.nu.nl/buitenland/4076125<wbr>/liveblog-aanslag-in-frankrijk.html<wbr>  live blog in dutch though  </wbr></wbr>    Dumb fuck just die will you     Honestly the fucking guardian depresses me, it is full of self-hating white cucks who literally cannot wait to alleviate their shame of not being picked for a sports team by opening their assholes to a polyqueer muslim overlord.    http://www.euronews.com/2015/06/26/<wbr>france-explosion-at-factory/  english live ticker.  </wbr>  Islam is a religion of peace, just pay your jiyza and give us your women and we will all live side by side. But don't openly flout anything non muslim or perform scientific research as this is declaring war on allah and then its your fault we will have to kill you.       Go and check them out, Dutchfags =)!         I get some peace from it by knowing that in their blind, retarded fit of hating their parents and everything our ancestors have done, they cannot see that islam is far more reactionary and conservative.  The white, middle-class men they hate so much will probably actually do alright in a muslim country, it is the SJWs who will be thrown out and stoned within a week.       They don't believe they are a part of the same group though. These ISIS guys destroy mosques (even planning to destroy the black cube) and ban some very old traditions.    nice trips though     *Though obviously when this happens they will wet themselves and start squealing that it is the white-middle class' fault that this all happened and our responsibility to fix it.    I just wonder, where do ISIS get all the orange jumpsuits?!?  Leftovers from Guantanamo???     lol just some random head    My guess is that it's just a matter of time before something happens in this city   Meanwhile, in France...   why don't we kill all those fucking islamists    what does omelette du fromage mean ?     there are actually groups of white people that say "white guys suck im sorry"      They both consciously subscribe and swear themselves to the same religion, they obviously interpret it differently (ISIS at least sticks to the teachings), but that is exactly why they should feel the drive to apologize and distance themselves - they have openly and actively subscribed to the same movement and someone else who is part of it is doing awful things.     Jezus Christ they're screwed over there.   Can any Frenchfag explain why you and your people accept these dogs to ruin your country?      it means fuck my pussy    They are our brothers. Respect their singularity and costumes      crying     nice trips   <br/>   France is the only place to Ban the Burka you retard.     NICE SINGELS BROAH      It's the same people who say humans are the most evil animal, when really we're the only animal with enough moral sensitivity to reflect on what we do and think it may be harmful. Other animals do the exact same shit and just don't give a fuck.  Our culture is literally the only one that allows for people to criticize it and reflect on its negatives - so morons start to think it is the most evil one.....   The only real issue nowadays is that social media is giving the previously irrelevant idiots of society some sway.        http://m.smh.com.au/world/islamist-<wbr>flag-found-after-man-killed-in-atta<wbr>ck-in-france-20150626-ghyyou.html  Aussie news groups are over this  </wbr></wbr>   you be mean :(    Dutch did it as well, but banning a fucking BURKA doesn't mean SHIT if they can still roam your streets like this, RETARD!  Fuck you guys are pussies...   banning burka   feeling tough          you big cuck    You are aware that religious leaders and even common folk have spoken against these attacks, right? It really shouldn't be their responsibility though, people can claim to be a part of any group.     I don't think restricting freedoms is the right approach to this, it's what England is doing too, saying we should monitor all communications.  We should heavily reinforce freedom, invest in a police force that can protect cartoonists who want to draw muhammed and if necessary close borders until the national community supports freedom.      THAT'S RACIST!    Created by Seth MacFarlane  I'd be more concerned that it's shit.      I'd be more concerned that it's shit.   Ah, so by targeting the funniest cleverest writer working on TV, you think you can make yourself look like da man.      funniest cleverest writer working on TV  I tried watching Family Guy. I lasted about 4 mins before reaching the conclusion that "This was written by people who laugh at their own jokes. All of them," and switched over.   Also, up early aren't you, Seth?        Get out, grandpa    Keep churning it out. I'm sure someone will watch.    A parody is not racist, the flag itself means racism.     FLAG ITSELF MEANS RACISM.  are you retarded the north had just as many slaves as the south when the civil war broke out. the Confederacy stood for state rights and for the government to shut the fuck up and get out of their business. im not saying slavery is good im saying to say something stand for something else even though you have no idea what it stood for in the first place.      slavery was banned in the north though      someone who stole everything from the simpsons   clever   chose one       Yep.

Gonna post the best shit.                       The ass was fat   k  I didn't pay much attention to pic related before. But now, I'm enlightened.  I watched the whole series, and read the manga for some parts after. It all makes sense now.      Damn right   some crazy shit for yall     Cool.                                                       Convince me that there isn't going to be a mass extinction in our life times /b/  i never see bees anymore.  i dont see honeybees around, but i do see bumblebees, but not nearly the amount as there used to be     no point because we are in the middle of it already      same when I was like 12 there were so many bees during the summer. Now I see honeybees less than I see bumblebees      pretty much. Literally every form of life on this planet is in decline except for humans   i have a theory what if... the amount of lifeforms on earth are a fixed amount, and animal numbers are declining, because human numbers are going up...       mind blown   I live in a pretty isolated area. There was literally a cloud of surprisingly peaceful honeybees that hung out around our pond. I didn't notice that they aren't around anymore until I saw this image. Holy shit.  I feel like I'm about to be extinct but it's all good  I have had a man-made honeycomb in my backyard really far out from everything else.  Ever year there would be bees making honey but that number declined quickly     Haha I actually had a similar theory about gays. More faggots exist today because the earth is becoming over populated and they can't reproduce    i hope i die soon i just dont want it to be painful       We cant.   I realized I literally haven't seen a bee in about 4-5 years. Damn we are truly fucked.  RIP humans. Basically fucked over every other species on the planet. We had the intelligence for potential but we are too immature   Really sad humans don't see what's going on...      Not expecting a catastrophic disaster in the next years   It's been too long since the last massive death, war, genocide... It's just a matter of time the history repeats again.    I blame the niggers   They are actually one of the post industrial population controls, as the traditional malthusian ones no longer are present     Yes but earth hasn't seen a max extinction in a long time. In the realm of humanity genocide is just routine   To bee or not to bee...   if you really did expect a catastrophic disaster, within a comprehensible future, you wouldn't be in here posting. You'd be robbing a bank, fucking whores and beating up your old teacher/boss/grade-school bully or whatever.  you know this.  please.       Who cares, humans aren't going anywhere and the shitty animals that can't keep up need to lrn 2 evolution.  it's going to be subtle and over good amount of time, humanity has an annoying habit of patchwork engineering mother nature along with mother nature counter acting the developments of humanity. this shouldnt be taken lightly a lot of things are likely to occur during this period, but will brushed along as the current human condition in popularity is measured in seconds, self deluding conduits, hivemind comforts and ever more inventive conditioning.    of course the talking monkey variant of homo sapiens is responsible. always is.    we're fucked..... no really          Literally the only downside for us is that we might have to grow animal tissue in labs for meat, but i can live with that.     they heard about that god awful movie and killed themselves     kek could see this becoming fb popular    its all this hormones we are eating in meat, soon we are being sterile and then the earth will die    denial   Humans are fucked. There is no possible way we can continue with this infinite growth paradigm we call capitalism. our planet has finite resources, capitalism requires infinite resources. All life on this planet is in decline, we are destroying our environment. 10 years ago were I live it literally did not get hotter than 80 degrees in the summer and it didn't even snow last winter and it is supposed to be 110 degrees on saturday and sunday. WE ARE FUCKED       Red meat actually boosts test so don't know what you're eating. It's water and plastics that are giving you that oest.    I reckon it's because we're taking to much nutrients and eating them from the soil, none of the crops we eat produce pollen so the bees die, and then the other plantes die, so every animal then dies. It's pretty horrific to think about it.    Soon as you mentioned capitalism as the source of evil it became obvious you are not clever.     A friend got killed by bees last week    then explain why testosterone levels have been declining.    they are likely going to be spread over time affecting various regions with their impact on humanity gradual....the idea of a hollywood blockbuster global event is unrealistic....and yet there exist a few events that go beyond what the hollywood imagination can dream up.    Blame anyone you want, it doesn't matter, the corporations are just using this earth up completely, thinking that they can make it better when worst comes to worst. They're wrong man.     They always say the foodchain is delicate but then again we always hear about species going extinct day in day out and I still get to eat my 6 chicken breasts a day so who cares. It's a foodweb, we can lose a few things and be A-ok.    "ELE"  Extinction Level Event ain'tgoing to be a sudden big rock slamming into the earth nor a large crack opening up and polluting the air we breathe.  It will be a slow decline into irrelevence from bees trying to pollinate and survive from the nectar of GMO plants.  ...but of course you won't here any of that in the corporatocracy that is the U$A.         why are people testoterone levels decreasing then mate?    This is correct    You can see this exact result in some species. I'm sure this is true.    bees 1 friend 0     I did, plastics and water supply. Though I will agree that non-red meats could do it as well.     Care for a rebuttal or are you just going to use childish ad hominem. Corruption is inevitable in capitalism. Look up "planned obsolescence"    It's not just that. It's the pesticides we use as well and all the crap Monsanto has done to try and control the food chain. It's scary shit that more people need to be aware of. There has been prescription drugs that have been getting dumped in the ocean by the tons. There have been fish that have been found with clinical doses of anti depressants in their systems.    I know, yes. And yes, I AM in denial. As I wrote, id I wasn't (and if you weren't), we'd be out there tearing up shit going full YIHAA right now.  we can discuss this on an academic level, we can even KNOW this on an intellectual level, but.... we cannot comprehend, let alone believe. No one can. If we could, we'd have averted this long ago. We'd have banned the internal combustion engine, coal, oil, war.. the works.  but we didn't.  because, denial.          so u mean memory limitation ?  God didnt upgrade earth since y2k.     You could post an image of anything with any info, it wouldn't make it true. Where are your sources? You could write that all the bees are extinct or that bees transformed into elephants, if you don't quote your sources, what you say don't worth anything. Especially on this site.       Why wouldn't you see proportionally more faggots in places with higher populations?     dude this is just hype from the media to get people to buy more tv dinners.  im a bee scientist at the bee institute and i can tell you now all the bee'tists that are in the know, know that there is no decline or mass extinction.   relax, and have a tv dinner.        Keyensian capitalism perhaps, but capitalism according to the Austrian school requires only progress in knowledge/technology, as the reallocation and recycling of resources, while bad in short term, is vital     I never knew Albert Einstein is really a stupid faggot and should stick to knowing what he knows best, destroying Hiroshima.   This would create new jobs for humans to take, instead of bees polinating flowers it would open a whole new job market, there would be more jobs, less suffering.       Yeah but its the animals and plants that depend on each other that really matter, and those are the ones going extinct, don't you see whats going on?    do some research yourself if you question it for fucks sake     muh free market  capitalism runs the globe, bro. The globe is saying bye-bye. Whatever the capitalism did, didn't work.  deal with it.       Test decreases with weight and we have been getting fatter...   jews. they'll do anything for money, including destroying our fucking planet. wish they'd fuck off back to their own.   Plastics, gmos, emf, sedentary lifestyle    Have you been outside in the past year? Dude there are like NO fucking bees.    livestock is already at a maximum which is why you see things like artificial meats based off of plants and insects growing in interest. make no mistake, what is coming should not at all be taken lightly as there exists no situation in the history of this planet that be drawn from the likely future we are going to encounter, if that doesnt frighten you even a little bit then perhaps you should do some research on the planets and theories as to why they exist as they do now.   I don't care about bees, just give me my honey already.    what you don't know is that the tv dinners are made from bees. it's not really mashed potatoes, it's bees. it's not really carrots, it's bees with possum anus secretions.    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ox8<wbr>kouz86ww</wbr>  [ ]   Nope, it's not my job to verify all the troll or propaganda posts you see on this site.  I already heard about the bees problem, but the numbers could be made up and writing random things with an image doesn't make it true.     Let it all burn.  everything from bacteria to humans are being snuffed by crapitalism. profit is apparently more important than the ability to be alive.  handrubbingintensifies.exe      I can't be convinced because nobody has seen this extinction level.   According to Arabs, their god will simply provide.     Bumblebee population has grown, and it's extremely abnormal. They used to be hard to find.   It's honestly like they're the only ones badass enough to take on hornets and African bees. I'm finding them in my house constantly now. Hell I found one laying the smackdown on a hornet queen.   No joke.               Capitalism is where parties exchange goods under semistable conditions, aka what we have been doing since the Romans...    im not saying to verify it for the thread but for yourself  ive heard about it also and the numbers make sense but yea they could easily be wrong  BUT i can look that correct information up accordingly        Just deny it all man, that'll make it go away.     behave, you     I can do that.  Male gender bender chemicals called phlates and bisphenol A,B &amp; C consumed by pregnant women.  Soy and its derivatives are an estrogen (female hormone) mimic. If a mother feeds soy based infant formula to the newborn male then there is a very good chance that the baby will grow up to be effeminate (aka: one foot in the faggot camp).  Soy is bad for males and testosterone.           If you actually look at it intelligence is a pretty good predictor of extinction. The more intelligent a life form is, the less likely it is that it will survive.     The mass extinction has already begun and has been happening for years. There was a recent study that proved we're offically in the sixth mass extinction.   Our only hope  dont know if its been posted yet, but the next mass extinction is already happening.  researchers say that our next two generations will see 75% of the earths species go extinct. assuming that humans are part of the 25% that survive that is. which i doubt.     Except faggots now think they're literally entitled to have a child of their own as a pet and they mix their jizz together and artificially inseminate a woman and then raise the child without her, the biological mother, because breastfeeding and motherhood are a social construct.     behave...     im not saying to verify it for the thread but for yourself  ive heard about it also and the numbers make sense but yea they could easily be wrong  BUT i can look that correct information up accordingly rrr       Resource based economy is the only way /b/rethrens   Human beings are higher thinking, can move and self segregate http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/art<wbr>icles/PMC2636191/</wbr>     no one said they were evenly distributed    The worlds been fucking up since civilization started, I wonder how many animals there would still be alive today if not for us.    LMAO!! maybe you need to learn how the world works first.     you see things like artificial meats based off of plants and insects growing in interest.  That's because of vegetarians, foodies, and like minded assholes     http://www.nrdc.org/wildlife/animal<wbr>s/bees.asp http://www.ars.usda.gov/News/docs.h<wbr>tm?docid=15572</wbr> </wbr>     underrated toast     this is a classic speech of a basement faggot who didnt had any travels around the world , you stupid do you really think that the world is this little? do you ever had the decency to travel in places like the great forests of canada? morocco? europe?the steppes? the world is fucking huge and it will take a LOT of years before we overpopulate it and consume all the resources    my post about something true in this thread has gone unnoticed while faggots argue about whose more intelligent.   just fuckng google holecene extinction. its happening already you dumbasses      oh really that means we need to have the same paradigm!!   I used to see these beautiful creates all the time 10-15 years ago. Now i'll be lucky to see any during the summer. At least we still have cool looking moths.   well every civilization has failed since the romans.  maybe we should try switching it up.       ssuming that humans are part of the 25% that survive that is. which i doubt.  even if we don't get wiped out by a natural disaster, everyone's ready to wipe each other out. everyday people grow more and more hostile and I think we're nearing the boiling point where people are just going to start killing/raping each other.     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phtha<wbr>late  soy: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soybe<wbr>an https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soy_p<wbr>rotein  read this second: http://articles.mercola.com/sites/a<wbr>rticles/archive/2010/11/18/research<wbr>-proves-genderbending-chemicals-aff<wbr>ect-reproduction.aspx  then this: http://www.treehugger.com/green-foo<wbr>d/are-boys-disappearing-because-of-<wbr>gender-bender-chemicals.html  and: http://www.justmindpower.com/Soy.ht<wbr>ml  -- http://www.scientificamerican.com/a<wbr>rticle/food-additives-mimic-hormone<wbr>s/ http://www.environmentalhealthnews.<wbr>org/ehs/newscience/low-level-EEs-al<wbr>ter-dopamine-from-brain-cells  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisph<wbr>enol_A https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/to<wbr>pics/agents/sya-bpa/</wbr> </wbr>  </wbr></wbr> </wbr></wbr>   </wbr>   </wbr></wbr>   </wbr></wbr></wbr>   </wbr> </wbr>   </wbr>  mead maker in my area says there's no bee shortage that he knows of. think he would know more than anyone else, really   I live in canada you fucking faggot.   consume all the resources   Recources don't decline in a linear fashion. a famine can come out of nowhere. If bees were wiped off this planet we would be done with. We would hit a genetic bottle neck and we would imbreed to death.        a year ago, millions of butterflies migrated over my town. it was amazing. ive been living here for 20+ years and ive never seen anything like it.   i hope they come back this year      Dude you live in ellensburg calling it 100%     decline   ma man.      Why do we need them again? All they do is just sting. Good riddance I say.      Meat consumption per capita has been steadily declining in the past 10 years., close to 15 in some parts. Dunno what you're trying to make reference to      what i think is that every possible scenario will happen. nuclear war will break out global disasters will happen all the economies will collapse  literally every end all scenario will happen simultaneously. and i think the USA will be hit the hardest since its pretty much our fault.         Good luck with that friend, as soon as Monsanto's GM crops reach your town, those beautiful butterflies will be dead.    Not sure if b8 or autistic     Nope, I'm Jewish.   People take on public administration, fuckface everything up and then wonder why it collapses. Like it wouldn't when you do everything by your own feelings and not for the public reason and trust.       its really hard to pollinate flowers by hand      they pollinate most of the worlds crops dude. without bees we will all starve to death.     If you get off on bees stinging your dick, that's fine. But keep that shit to yourself and don't let these fuckers anywhere near me.  What the fuck do you need flowers for?     Well California is basically turning into a desert rn.     breastfeeding is important for children    but it's not important enough for women to be able to do it in public       You're acting like 70% of the population of the world hasn't already read or seen this, it's in the mainstream news for fucks sake.  High Horse You  please do this.          last monday, there was fucking saharan desert dust in my town from fucking 5000 miles away.  let that sink in for a little bit.     People saw it   assuming humans are part of the 25% that survive. which I doubt  you're ignored for being a edgelord       a woman can excuse herself to the bathroom to breastfeed      This would create new jobs for humans to take, instead of bees polinating flowers it would open a whole new job market, there would be more jobs, less suffering.   Do your research faggot. They are already doing this in China.       You're acting like 70% of the population of the world hasn't already read or seen this  no im acting like 100% of the retards on /b/ havnt seen this.       They pollinate one third of the worlds crops   Without them we'd have to use more non-bee pollinated food sources       I too have a diet of plastic and water   i just killed a bee..../b/   no one gives a fuck. People are too busy worrying about the next iPhone or the superbowl.    yeah, and we all talking about celebrities      imblying i said that    not knowing how to greentext      ready for some GMO superbee's?  Super Killer Bee's can't bee Stopped, will be the newspaper headlines.  Not even fire can slow them down, not to mention pesticides.        I'd hate to see skinny me as I've been told I needed a sandwich one too many times.      Let's change the subject      1lb of red beef doesn't consume 2,500 gallons of water   it's all based off of freshwater and everything to food production to transportation. every drop is going to count, california is a prime example of the impending dliemma facing humanity.     Why isn't there a hashtag about this? You'd think the survival of our species would be more important than Ariana Grande's birthday.   What the movie 'Evolution', there's a brilliant quote in it goes like this, "Life finds a way".    many fruits and planets we depend on start off as flowers and need to be cross pollinated to turn into food. plus flowers are nice.      still acting though     beautiful said.    thanks for clearing it up. i get my info from biased news sources here in texas      Nah dude. 7 billion humans is nothing compared to the hundreds of trillions of insects. Our population doesn't even make 0.1% of the life forms on earth.     All I ever see are mosquitos and mother fucking hornets. Fuck them both. Nicholas Cage should be happy to have bees on his face.     Too obvious     Totally agree    Most plants use flowers in order to create seeds.  No pollination = no plant sex = no seeds.       just kept the same terminology.  would it even matter if i said i wasnt acting?       plus flowers are nice.  They're not, unless you're gay or a dumb wimin.   many fruits and planets we depend on start off as flowers and need to be cross pollinated to turn into food  Many, not all of them. Bees might as well go extinct, we don't fucking need them.      theres like 7 countries with their nukes pointed at us here in the United States. but our government has us distracted with race  lel.      This is true and I don't think humans would go out 100%. We would still have straggling civilizations here and there but this would be after the collapse which would kill most. It's not just about the food, you also have to keep in mind the wars and conflict that would arise from all this.     Why would most people give a fuck? It's not going to significantly affect anyone for long past they're dead so of course they don't care.      talking down on the Superb Owl   Fucking casual   REEREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEE</wbr></wbr>       You don't know that. The US is slipping into totalitarianism as we speak.     planets    for all the retards saying GMO's are the problem, kill yourselves...you would be starving without this technological achievement, furthmore i will agree a monopoly on GMO technology is not at all a good thing, however to dismiss GMO's all together is very ignornant. we are creatures that patchwork never ending crisis we create intentionally/unintentionaly as a result ever growing technological achievements.    we're going to spend 6 trillion on iraq. we'd spend 20 trillion fucking up anyone that nuked us. we have no money but we can summon more money than god. no one will ever touch us.     Implying wind and some insects can't do the same.     That has exactly 0 to do with the current mass extinction event.     All these started off as flowers. If it wasn't for the intergalactic bees that pollinated these planets they wouldn't be there today    Tell dumbasses in California to stop trying to grow crops and have green yards in a semi arid environment. It's not a prime example, India is far worse. Its do to over population, not cattle.     *Domestic bee population has declined. Wild bee populations are unaffected.   You have exactly 10 seconds to explain why you don't go to the gym to painstakingly develop and reach your maximum evolutionary potential and to attain a perfect aesthetic physique like this naturally athletic alpha.   Pic related      I'm not a faggot like OP   do u even lift /b/ra XDDD  Because i don't care to.   because zyzz died and im boycotting lifting    I don't have time to waste at the gym when i can be shitposting on the chonz   not worth it  because I hurt my shoulder and took a week off to smoke weed and hang out with my friends for the first time in 6 months  jeff pls go   because I really don't give a fuck how I look.  I do cardio (jogging, biking, etc.) to keep my weight reasonable, but only because my family history of obesity and heart disease demands I do this.    Because doing sports 3 times a week is enough for me  My hip hurts! I'm in the middle of cooking a turkey! I have warranty cards to fill out! I'm not just making excuses! Alright I'll go!

I'm not fat, but I'm not a model either.   I probably get better pussy because these woman will fuck you like their lives depend on it. Also I hate white girls now, Absolut worst lays of my life.

I'm lazy   Cancer, chronic fatigue, a solid 7.5/10 fiance who loves my body for what it is.   cause i'm lazy as shit   maximum evolutionary potential  Yeah, if only anon. In an actual fight, muscles are actually one of the smallest factors in it. And if you think those muscles of yours are going to do shit against a wild animal, gun, or knife, youre dead wrong. Also, a bear tier aesthetic is a actual strong person. Ripped just means you are a gym rat who spends a insane amount of time in the gym to justify his shitty personality.   I took the bait, and I took it well.      triggered    faggggg    I have no self control, and zero discipline     educating the children =/= taking the bait     Yeah but, two bitches at the same time. That's like fucking a 14/10    peak physical condition 10 years ago   worked out every day   training to be navy seal   lined up with seal PT coordinators    signed navy seal contract   abandoned it all for a girl   went to call the girl the moment i got back    she was already talking with another man   she cheated on me for 2+ years with him             why you don't go to the gym to painstakingly develop and reach your maximum evolutionary potential and to attain a perfect aesthetic physique like this naturally athletic alpha.    maximum evolutionary potential   I laugh every time       I'm lazy  Also I got a nice dick and have enough personality and confidence to get laid while being a 6/10 at best      own company   fucked by countries regulations   power   keep dreaming bout that paper at the end it's still paper :^)        Have actual interests.    abandoning anything for a girl  True beta, but i hope you have learned. The moment you abandon anything for a girl, she leaves you, because she got you. No fun in that.      i'd lick his butthole too  you're just like me        It's insane to me the amount of pathetic fucking losers on here. "I don't care to." Fuck you. Good. Being out of shape negatively effects every aspect of your life. Your girlfriend, if you get one, will be uglier because you are too stupid/lazy/unconfident/tragic to go to the gym four fucking hours a week. You will have a shittier job because no one fucking respects fat people. You will never be promoted to your potential or get you dream position because we view you as lazy. You have less fun, you fuck worse, your hygiene is worse, you die quicker (thank god), you are literally a lazy asshole that makes excuses and your lives will never be as fun as mine. FUCK YOU.   <br/>          have no girlfriend     Because lifting and getting "shredded" requires going to the gym 5 times a week, eating lots of protein(which is costly) and all for nothing.  Get sick for 3 weeks for break a leg and it's all gone to waste. A month is all it takes to look like you looked when you started lifting   2015   failing to realise this    lifting for girls         Lol, OP reached his "evolutionary peak" to fuck 6's.

Because lifting and getting "shredded" requires going to the gym 5 times a week   You can't work out for 45 mins a day but can spend more time on 4chan?   eating lots of protein(which is costly)   1. Protein is delicious 2. Get a job   Get sick for 3 weeks for break a leg and it's all gone to waste. A month is all it takes to look like you looked when you started lifting   A month? topkek. Confirmed for never having muscles.  Cute excuses. Stay pleb.                  CUCKOLD! :D     I'd rather not look like that..... Looking like a total douche and having my underage sisters stand next to me and pretend like they are my girls? Nah I'll pass  Ps. This guy looks like Adam from workaholics is probably just as annoying to      1. I dont have a gym in my fucking living room 2. Protein is expensive, I already have a job and im not gonna waste 25% of my salary on protein shakes 3. A month, two months tops  Not to mention, bigger muscles need more blood.  More blood to muscles -&gt; less blood to the brain. A few of my friends actually got retarded this way            OP is a b8ing master, he is not only challenging people for not doing something we all know is productive, he is doing so based on false premises! OP you bastard! They can't take it!       I already have a job and im not gonna waste 25% of my salary on protein shakes   25% of my salary   Maybe you should quit working casual at McDonalds and get a real job.   Not to mention, bigger muscles need more blood. More blood to muscles -&gt; less blood to the brain.   I don't think you'd get any more stupid than you currently are now.
