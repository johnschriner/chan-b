I want to pull its pants down and devour whatever is in there.    <br>I'm gonna need you to reel in that faggotry you fucking faggy faggot.</br>  Looks like somebody sprayed diarrhea on it  thats a strange looking androgynous thing  A faggot who gets beaten by his father every night until he loses all sense of gender identity, slowly deluding himself into thinking that his X and Y chromosomes do not factor into any part of his life.  <br>extended version of that</br>  <br>Mate that's Kat, he's on tumblr</br>  <br>He's fucked up in the head but still attractive.</br>  <br>Kat's father would never beat Kat</br>  <br>kek</br>  Is cute, I don't care if is a boy or a girl :P  <br> attractive </br>  <br> the look of complete and total disappointment. </br>  <br>D-did I fu- fuck- fucking studder, b-bitch?</br>  <br>What ever this thing is, it has serious mental issues.</br>  <br>Agreed :3</br>    <br>Who is this beauty ? Need a name pls</br>  <br><br>What about them is messed up in the head</br></br>  <br>Pretty much</br>  <br><br>it has a cawk</br></br>  <br>It's Kat. Kat makes a very convincing female when he wants to.</br>  <br>I couldn't tell you his tumblr name, but it's like "the adventures of Dave something" but on it, he role plays a girl who sometimes pretends to be a man. Kid obviously had issues. I'd still be happy to make him my woman though.</br>  <br><br>still leaves two holes to fuck.</br></br>  <br><br>probably because he hasnt hit puberty just yet<br><br>basically if you're into this your a pedofaggot</br></br></br></br>  <br>Here, he doesn't want to.</br>  <br>Oh god, I used to work with that guy. I didn't even know he had a kid. Damn. That's awkward</br>  <br>Not the faggoty looking dude idgaf about his stank ass I care about that other girl named Kat.</br>  <br>He actually has 4 sons. Only this one is fucked up. You should see some of his family's Facebook photos, very cringey. It's obvious how weird kat is.</br>  Anyone have the tumblr?  she looks like Stannis' daughter lmfao  <br> implying he'll even experience puberty after taking female hormones at a young age and fucking up his biological and psychological imperatives for the rest of his life. </br>  <br>It's the same person you shit lord. He's fucked up in the head, role plays a chick.</br>  <br>Is it wrong I actually found him attractive? I'll go sit in a corner and rethink my sexuality... And I'm taking that picture with me... ):</br>      <br><br>nigtard</br></br>  <br>Nothing wrong with it. If he wants to pretend to be a woman then fine, you just treat him like a girl. Fuck him like a girl.</br>  those are the ugliest looking freckles ive ever seen<br><br>they are brown, looks like shit splatter</br></br>  <br>post. it.</br>  <br>That's because they're not real... he paints them on</br>  <br>Yeah, if you're into damaged faggots with daddy issues</br>  <br><br>  like a girl <br>  fuck him like a girl <br><br>has no vagina, therefore you cannot fuck HIM like a girl, dipshit</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not once did he mention his family at work. I never would have guessed. If it wasn't for the ring, I'd have never known he was married. He worked really hard, though.</br>  <br>it's a faggot...faggot</br>  <br>Sorry bro I didn't save it. You'll have to just look around, but they're out there.</br>  How do I find this...thing? Need more pics for science...  this faggot doesnt even look that good. there are much better looking fags out there. and those fake freckles are disgusting.  <br>That is Kat, newfriend.</br>  I've been looking for video  http://godtechturninheads.tumblr.co<wbr>m/tagged/myself<br><br>here you go</br></br></wbr>  <br>glad to see ya again</br>  <br>It kind of looks like a pig.</br>  <br>Kat is sneaky sneaky</br>  <br><br>srly? those are contacts too for sure<br><br><br>what is the fucking thing? ive seen the photos a few times on /b/ <br><br><br>shit is weird<br>freaks fascinate me in a way</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This nigga is gay as fuck. I was hoping it would be some hot as emo scene chick.Time to drown myself in lesbian porn.</br>  <br>Oh but I am. Especially the really feminine ones.</br>  <br>Kat still has a fuckhole m8</br>  <br>Top Kek</br>  <br>There's no way that's a guy. I don't fap to men.</br>  <br> He actually has 4 sons <br>11 and OP is one of them</br></br>  <br>Thanks for joining us tonight, Bill</br>  <br>That's the face of a man who contemplates murder/suicide at any given moment</br>  <br>That's the only cute picture of her.</br>  <br>If you fapped to Kat you fapped to a man/boy.</br>  <br>Thank you so much</br>  <br> http://godtechturninheads.tumblr.c<wbr>om/tagged/myself</wbr> <br><br><br>you mean the one that literally has feces pouring out of it on the daily</br></br></br></br>  <br>no, there's no way <br>I'm engaged to be married</br></br>    <br>No need to be ashamed, anon. We all fap to Kat, as well as many other traps. It's okay to fap to traps as long as they're feminine looking. It's not even gay or bi. Don't stress about it.</br>  This thread is great  /bump  thread pls don't kill    <br>FUCKING STOP IT WITH THIS SHIT OP.</br>  <br>Such an angsty teenager</br>  <br>Glorious anon, you have saved the thread from imminent 404</br>  <br>Fuck off Kat. Go back to tumblr you stupid fucking abomination. Nobody here likes you.</br>  Its a girl you faggots.  /bump pic unrelated  So basically, it was a male, but was also daddy's little fukboy. He grew up knowing that males were supposed to be attracted to females, so she changed his gender, to be his daddy's fukboy    <br>His daddy's fukgirl</br>  <br>Believe me when I say it's a dude. He role plays as a woman, and there are family Facebook photos about the father having 4 sons, including Kat.</br>  <br>You actaully believe everything a tumblrtard puts on their tumblr? You're just as retarded as they are.</br>  <br>He can put whatever she wants to on the internet</br>  <br>I dunno.

After seeking advice online how to initiate, she began flirting with me, which I didn't pick up on for awhile. Eventually she asked me to rub her pussy during a back rub and I conceded. At first I resisted and there was some shame, but it went away after a couple weeks, maybe less. Almost like we were "pretending" to feel guilty, so as to not upset the other. We had several long talks about it, and eventually admitted that neither of us cared.

Each ship has a removable sail, two trigger-action side panels, and a huge spring-driven cannon. Players take turns moving forward along a prescribed track and shooting bean bags at their opponent's ship. A hit on one of the side panels will force it to pop off and give the player a free shot at the other side; a hit forcing the sail off becalms the ship for a turn.<br><br>To add to the pirate flavor, each player also has an eye patch. Wearing these will slightly affect depth perception and add a marginal bit of sport to the shooting.<br><br>This game retailed for the somewhat impressive sum of $16 back in 1962. With its huge plastic ships (close to a foot long), giant vinyl play mat, and the eye patches, it may well stand as one of the more overproduced games of the early 1960s.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Trips...

Closest the U.S ever was to a truly socialist system. Best years the economy ever had besides the roaring 20s. And ya know, the warnings of the military industrial complex, and in the interstate highway act which changed the country.  <br>Kek</br>  <br> hostages were literally on the plane when reagan took office </br>  <br>Don't listen to /pol/acks<br>Ignore /pol/acks<br>Sage /pol/acks<br><br> Closest the U.S ever was to a truly socialist system <br>Lol you believe that<br>and you think it's related to this<br> Best years the economy ever had besides the roaring 20s <br>topkek</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  As you may guess, I'm a democrat. Bleedin' heart liberal on most issues.  <br>m8... fdr was legit socialist <br>tried to push a cap on salaries</br></br>  <br>truth</br>  <br>actually i take that back. how could I forget the one and only</br>  <br> implying johnson isnt literally the bottom of the barrel shit-tier president </br>  <br>This FDR once contemplated a 99.5% top marginal tax rate.</br>  Kennedy is a fucking legend.  I liked Stephen Comora. The strides he and Vince Lazaro made in civil and historic rights are the greatest in the 20th century, after FDR.  <br>Just want to point out that if Carter had actually helped the Shah stay in power, the Middle East wouldn't have gone to shit as bad as it has.</br>  <br>Does it bother that the biggest liberal presidents are also the biggest liars?</br>    <br><br>completely agree. Stevec forever!</br></br>  <br>Yes this is true, Eisenhower did the same thing, and the upper top tier of the income Brackett were taxed at 70%, and still were millionaires after the taxes, which were used for many programs we still use today to strengthen the majority of the country's people, the middle class. Pushed for universal single payer Healthcare too. Only us, and new guinea, do not have universal healthcare.</br>  Honestly.. I think the chimp has done a pretty good job  <br>I thought I was the only one who thought this</br>  <br>Indeed. So many "If A had done X the middle wouldn't be as bad as it now." situations, many of them involving Jimmy.</br>  <br>ahhhh johnson, the only president to actually kill another president</br>  <br>Forgot to mention I'm Democrat</br>  <br><br>ayyyy he supports the guy who sold weapons in return for hostages</br></br>  <br>marlene morrow, circa 1974. he had returned from vietnam as a POW and became a celebrity-hero type. its well known and documented that he cheated on his first wife after returning and doing the media circus, and its a long held myth that he never denied about how he banged a playboy centrefold. my old man once told me it was marlene morrow he was like 13 back then so i guess he would know. ive attached a google pic of her and if i was john mccain in 1974 id have banged her</br>  <br>And I agree fully with this. Shame he died before it could come to fruition..</br>  <br>ignore this bait.<br><br>Never heard of Singapore</br></br></br>  <br>James K Polk. Did everything he said he was gonna do and didnt look for re-election.</br>  <br>There was no good president choice for 2008 or 2012. We all lost on that one, regardless of who won.<br><br>However, Mccain would have been better than Obama any day</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br> tfw "Calvin Coolidge? Wat niggers?" <br><br> pic also only reasonable choice. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i thought it was 90%? i know kennedy wanted to lower em to 70% but i think johnson was the one who actually signed it into law</br>  <br>your knowledge of history is as poor as your knowledge of economics.<br><br>Go McCain! My opinion of him has gone up!</br></br></br>  <br>we already assumed fdr faggot</br>  <br><br>Which McCain? Based McCain or Republitard McCain?</br></br>  <br>Read Amity Shlaes' book on Coolidge and my posts on overrated TR</br>  <br>obama has done a good job, just calling him a chimp shows how immature the poster is</br>  <br>Totally serious. He was thrust into a pretty shit situation and I think he's done a relatively good job, especially dealing with the shit congress we have</br>  <br>as illegal and unconstitutional his bench stacking was just to get the new deal bills passed (not saying that they didnt help the country, just dont agree that the ends justify the means) he really was our best war-time president and WWII wouldve been a hell of a lot harder without him. he really was americas churchill</br>    Graduate from Rutgers here with a degree in Polysci. I must say, in the midst of all the stupid things I have read in this thread, there has been a few informed remarks. Eisenhower had it at almost 90% and it worked. But it only could work for so long until everything started to crack. FDR is my personal choice though. Even wrote my masters thesis on him. Andrew Jackson was...well, he was Andrew Jackson haha. TR was a great man, but also drank 12 cups of coffee a day and was a little crazy toward the end. He was the real Mccoy. And in 20 years when the history books talk about the Obama presidency, I believe they will be fairly positive rather than negative.  <br>As shitty as it was of him to put his pals in the supreme court, he did it to pass necessary legislature that the laissez faire republicans would never have allowed</br>  <br>I get that it was exactly what the country needed. Doesn't make it any less of a dick move though.</br>  <br>wait, what was bad about what he did? there were open seats and he appointed judges he knew were liberal<br>that always happens with both parties</br></br>  <br>do you have a job in political science? I am dual majoring in it along with economics. have any tips on any presidential books to read to know each and all of the presidents' policies better?</br>  <br> had control of congress for two years <br> congress that doesn't agree with him for the other 6 is "shit" </br></br>  <br>i swear, it's like morons think presidents are given a blank slate when they enter office</br>  <br>Ah yes the "It was all Bush's fault maymay"</br>  <br>I recommend doing what I did, it helped me a lot. Read their memoirs. Gives you a real insight from their own minds. Find some good historians and get in contact with them.</br>  <br>ah yes, the ol' "the economy wasn't losing 800k jobs a month and the unemployment rate wasn't 8%" maymay</br>  <br>does every president have memoirs?<br><br>i also can't find out which biographies (besides autobiographies) are best for each president</br></br></br>  <br>And to your other question, yes I do. I recently graduated and I am currently working in Washington</br>  <br>Ah yes the "Even though this is the most pathetic "recovery" in decades remember that everything good that happens in the economy is Obama's doing" maymay.</br>  <br>he did jack</br>  Grover Cleveland.  John Quincy Adams though mainly for his post-presidency.  ...    <br>My government professor will always bring up how the founding fathers were slave owners but every time he turns around and says "EXCEPT JOHN ADAMS"</br>  <br>And Ben Franklin, and Hamilton, and Washington freed his slaves</br>    <br>We covered him.</br>  <br><br> Fucking LBJ <br><br>Kill yourself.</br></br></br></br>  <br>maybe so, but no one treated their slaves as nicely as Jefferson</br>  <br>Definitely in the top tier. Trickle down economics does not work, but he did reignite the economy from the late 70s slump.</br>  <br>Yeah man, mccain was a badass the republicans marketed him wrong. they tried for the wise grandpa and everyone freaked out he would die and leave sarah palin in charge. they should have come out and said this man is fucking indestructable. He was a maverick republican (appealed to older democrats) and an elder statesman (way more experience than obeezy), but also a genuine badass. he signed up for vietnam, not running away from a draft board but signed up. he was pilot who already had a rep among military guys for being efficient and reliable in combat (basically the biggest compliment they give). He was a POW, tortured and held till mid73 (when most americans had long gone). When he came come they thought he would never walk again, he defied the odds and by 74 he was not only walking he was delivering speeches on war and was famous. he banged chicks left and right and never turned down a beer or a shot. The whole time he worked his ass off, and when he remarried he was loyal, became rich, and was by most accounts a great dad. Just saying he was the best candidate but the american voters took jew stewarts word and brought on a mix-race liberal academic.</br>  <br>i typed a bunch of shit out but my page fucking refreshed so i lost everything<br><br>just look at this shit, it should cover most of it<br><br> http://www.factcheck.org/2015/01/o<wbr>bamas-numbers-january-2015-update/</wbr> </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Good choice, got us involved in Vietnam and couldn't keep the commies out of China.</br>  <br>:S</br>  <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=l7i<wbr>VsdRbhnc</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Long-term unemployed and food stamp recipients up, even by your own argument it's not looking that great.</br>  <br> hates uppity niggers <br>id vote for him</br></br>  <br>This is so Inaccurate it hurts.</br>  <br>Agreed.
