That's why I can't sleep.<br><br>Why can't you sleep?</br></br>  <br>That's really just a statement of fact<br>Sorry to hear it, though<br><br><br>That's dependent on why you're sad in the first place<br>Why are you sad?<br><br><br>I dunno, really.<br>Probably because I slept all day.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Bump  <br><br>Because i don't know if it's my dependence on drugs making me depressed or if i've always been unexplainably depressed and this lead me to drugs. <br>What came first</br></br></br>  <br>I am in the process of acquiring the hardware to commit suicide (Nitrogen tank and pressure regulator).<br><br>Can you dissuade me?</br></br></br>  <br>Hard to say without knowing about the circumstances of your life, but addiction is usually indicative of emotional issues. It's likely that your emotional issues predate your addiction.</br>  <br>Well why do you feel the need to commit suicide?</br>  <br>Because I have found no good reason to keep surviving.</br>  I feel perpetually lonely.<br><br>I mean yes I have a girlfriend but even after not seeing her all summer my insecurities get the best of me. I feel like she will break up with me like all the rest have because i'm not good enough or because she is sick of my shit. I know i'm not acting clingy to her or anything but i feel constantly haunted by those worries. <br><br>I feel like I can only get love from romantic partners. I think that is my problem. Sure friends and family are great but I feel like their love means nothing. I wan't to feel like I am a real part of someones life that matters to them, but I always feel that the people who I wan't to be closest to become the most distant. Does everyone feel this? Am I being paranoid? Why can't i feel like I have any substance to anyone other than being temporarily amusing or a minor annoyance?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Surviving is not an active decision, though. Suicide is.<br>Nobody simply wakes up one day and decides there's nothing to survive for. <br>There is something motivating you to make this decision. What is it?</br></br></br>  <br>I can't set myself free.<br>I live in an apartment with the gf on workdays not far from my hometown. But every weekend I drive home to help her with the household and garden... it's been going on for a few years now, every weekend.<br>I was planing on going for a semester abroad (attending university btw.) but don't know if I should, because not being able to come back home ever weekend.<br>Damn it sucks so hard and I know that it is kinda the wrong way, but I feel like it's my responsibility to do this.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ugh, I had a big long response to you that my tablet flipped out and deleted. Give me a minute.</br>  <br>Your insecurity that your girlfriend will break up with you is valid. Most relationships end. You need to accept this as an inevitability of life and not take it personally. Just because a relationship doesn't work out doesn't mean it's necessarily your fault.<br><br>Of course you take platonic attachments for granted and overvalue romantic ones. This is pretty common: we have a culture/media that glorifies and obsesses over romantic relationships. I think awareness of this is a big part of overcoming it. Just continually remind yourself that your value isn't entirely based in romantic relationships, that you matter to people and that's important. It's pretty common.</br></br></br>  <br>I wake up every weekday and go to work, so that I can earn money to pay rent and buy food, i.e. I survive.<br><br>This is unpleasant and I am out of reasons to keep doing it.<br>What is the alternative if not suicide?</br></br></br></br>  <br>This is completely a matter a preference. Personally, the idea of missing out on something amazing like going abroad just for some boring domestic bullshit you can do for the rest of your life sounds lame as hell, but that's just me. You might like that. What you have to decide is what's most important to you. You only get one life. What would you rather spend it doing?</br>  <br>but thats not even it, I feel this way every time a girl is just too busy to talk to me; or anyone for that matter. Even if someone is busy and needs to have their time, or just doesn't respond to a message, I get this anxiety thats telling me they hate me or I'm annoying them in some way. People have told me my perception of other people's feelings towards me is far more negative than it actually is, but that doesn't change the fact that underneath it all I am plagued by feelings of inadequacy.</br>  <br>There's about a million different things you could change besides suicide. There are plenty of alternatives. Ask yourself, if your life were perfect, what would it be like? What would you rather be doing instead? Because while being dead may be preferable to what you're doing now, I doubt its the greatest thing you can imagine.</br>  I want to make sweet love to my dog, wtf is wrong with me?  <br>Nigga</br>  <br>Do you think it would be ok to eat 3 whole family size bag of the potato chip with an tub of fatty dipping cream?</br>  <br>I visualize conversations with people because I can't think when socializing. Also, this way I know they won't have any rude thoughts about me. Plus, not distractions.<br><br>Is this norm8?</br></br></br>  <br>Set yourself free.<br><br>If you are shy, just go be the confident guy for once. If you are unhealthy, go rock climb or something. What I'm saying is that you need to add a texture to your life that makes it less dull. Living is like cooking, if you don't add all the spices and seasonings, it will always be bland. <br><br>Personally i'd say go learn an instrument: bass is easy<br>Go get into an activity: I love to rock climb and I can spend hours in the gym just climbing<br>Meet new people: Go take a class or just go to any function and be social, especially with people who you may never see again. Low risk social experimentation can lead to some of the most interesting experiences.<br><br>There is life outside your apartment /b/ro, you just gotta open the door</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yes</br>  <br>Not needing to work or worry about anything.<br>Having a beautiful woman who loves me no matter what.<br>Being able to do whatever I want whenever I want without any regard to consequence.</br></br></br>  Why can't I stop jerking it to Minecraft porn?  <br> mfw <br>That's the weirdest fetish i've heard about. No offense. I just found it curious.</br></br>  <br>Well you answered your own question there. It's an issue of self-esteem. You worry your girlfriend is going to break up with you because you feel youre not good enough for her to begin with. Why do you think you feel this way?</br>  <br>I've played guitar and drums for years.<br>I've recently learned to, and subsequently abandoned, paragliding.<br>I don't like people or socializing.</br></br></br>  <br>please<br><br>answer my god dammit question</br></br></br>  <br>No it's ok, it's fucked I know, I just dont know what to do about it, every time I mention it on here, I get called a troll, so I'm hoping you guys actually believe me</br>  <br> That's really just a statement of fact <br>Yes, the fact is that is a problem and you can't solve shit because you are just a fraud pretending to be a fraud.</br></br>  <br>god i know this all too well. im complete shit with other people but when im alone i work out and imagine all these social circumstances in my head. its like im in a movie sometimes, everything seems so perfect and easy. when the time actually comes to say something i completely blank the fuck out and start misspeaking and making an ass of myself. idk how to help, but your not alone. texting helps a bit since it gives me time to think but its like im a completely different person.</br>  <br>We've all got our weird shit that gets us hot.<br>Are you attracted to women too, or just dogs? All dogs or just your dog?</br></br>  <br>I was just kidding, help out the fucker that gets off to minecraft</br>  <br>I'm not a medical doctor but probably not, fat ass.</br>  <br>I prefer girls half my height with short hair (like kate beckinsale in underworld)<br>Problem? (also i fool around with children half my age, got one drunk last weekend and that was a blast)</br></br>  <br>Yeah of course. Really, if you don't think about what you're going to say before you say it, you're probably an asshole. Pretty normal.</br>  <br> There's about a million different things you could change besides suicide. <br>I thought you said continuing on was not an active decision, now you are saying it requires millions of unnecessary active decisions?</br></br>  <br>Bless your kind heart</br>  <br>Well you'll never be able to act without consequence. Every reaction has an equal and opposite reaction.<br>A beautiful woman who loves you is an attainable goal, however. Certainly not something you can get while dead.</br></br>  <br>Im turned on, is that normal?</br>  <br>ive been trying really hard to stretch my foreskin over my head and i havent been getting any luck. Im trying to fit my entire head in the flaps of it like a bag in a way. not sure if i want to suffocate myself in my crusty dick cheesed skin bag hood or not.</br>  <br>Like I said to the dog guy, everyone's got their weird shit.</br>    <br>Is this reaction equal and opposite to your reaction?<br><br>Do you know what naturalistic fallacy means?</br></br></br>  <br>If you expect me to wave a magic wand and make everything better, of course it's not going to happen.</br>  <br>No?<br>Compared to Minecraft and dogs, that's healthy as shit.<br>Gold star for you!</br></br></br>  <br>Tablet posted before I was done. Fucker.<br>How young are we talking?</br></br>  How to I show assertiveness<br><br>here's five cents for you</br></br>  <br>Newton's laws? Are you serious?<br>And my not believing that a beautiful woman can find me and love me makes it a self-fulfilling prophecy.</br></br>  <br> attainable goal <br>What about the whole no matter what bit and I assume that means she will stay beautiful no matter what as well because why would you want some Mila Kunis type who will immediately turn into the Evil Queen the day she turns 40.</br></br>  <br>Wow im doing great for a 20 year old!<br>Tyanks doc!</br></br>  <br>You misunderstand. I'm saying if you are unhappy with your current situation, there's millions of things you could do.<br>Continuing on requires no change.<br>But if you aren't happy continuing on, then you need to change something.</br></br></br>  <br>You said it in your OP not me, at least you agree that psychology is on the same level as magic and the mental hand waving won't directly solve shit.</br>  <br>Not a medical doctor<br>Have you considered circumcision?</br></br>  <br>why do i do nothing but look at gore and drink beer</br>  <br>Well, why aren't you showing assertiveness to begin with? Fear? Apathy?</br>  <br>I'm not worried about not being good enough for her. I made her dinner one time (were new) and I'm doing all that shit. The way she looked at me (its been a while since i've seen her, traveling and all) definitely held some weight. What I'm worried about id disappointing her, or boring her; I'm worried that I'm not the fantasy she thinks I would be and will break up with me for that. I mean rationally thinking I think I'm safe, I just can't let the insecurities go sometimes.</br>  <br>Which actively requires millions of active decisions and if you just stop actively maintaining the facade society forces upon you, you will end up in prison quickly.</br>  <br>You're right about it being a self-fulfilling prophecy, but your lack of belief is wrong. Why do you think a beautiful woman couldn't love you?</br>  <br>But change always requires will and effort, effort is unpleasant, therefore things would have to get worst before they (could but probably wouldn't) get better.<br><br>But we are beating around the bush here.<br>I still haven't been given a satisfactory answer to why shouldn't I commit suicide.<br><br>Away for a few minutes due to survival (work).</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fear of being shut down/making a fool of myself. Never had a chance to stand up for myself as a kid. Older sister/Dad</br>  I can't even OP<br>I care about nothing in this world, what am I supposed to do with my life? I don't even know what my interests are, I hate everything. I don't get along with people.</br>  <br>The fuck are you babbling about?</br>  <br>So those aren't your things, oh well, you just gotta keep trying. Also I'll be curt here and say having a steady relationship really helped me get out of my darker places. I know my advice sucks and seems insecure but the first step to truly living starts with you and the way you choose to perceive the world. That and dumping all the boring and inconvenient shit from your life.</br>  <br>Thats like saying diet and exercise are magic-tier because it takes a few months to lose the weight</br>  <br>Depends.<br>Are you drinking to the point of drunkenness, or is it just a couple beers a day?</br></br>  <br>You said something was attainable by ignoring half of the requirements.</br>  <br>If you're worried about not meeting her fantasy, then that is worrying about not being good enough for her. And you're right that you aren't the fantasy she thinks you would be. And that's okay, no one is ever the idealized person their partner thought they were getting. If she breaks up with you because she realizes you're not perfect, then she's a cunt. And some girls are cunts, yeah. What you really need is to develop faith in her that she's not a cunt. How long have you been together?</br>  <br>You can directly measure weight, food particles, exercise effects, and time.<br><br>Nobody has every directly observed a psyche and you can't take measurements of psychological metrics, you can only think the way you feel about it and guess what number that probably equals.</br></br></br>  <br>We'll we met at a battle of the band we were both playing about 3 months ago. She goes to another university across town so we only got to hang out twice before we left on summer. First time we chilled at her place, kissed and shit nothing happened. Second time was at my place and I made food and shit but nothing past second base went on. Seeing as were both virgins and young and conservative and all that shit. So after that its been under 2 months since i've seen her and we've been relying on sporadic messaging.</br>  <br>So basically you think life should just hand you things? Yes you have to put in effort, boo-fucking-hoo<br><br>I guess that as an aspiring therapist, I have a moral obligation to talk you out of suicide, but I'm not thrilled by the idea at this point of keeping a spoiled manchild alive.<br><br>Why shouldn't you kill yourself? Because there are clearly things that you want from life, and they're things you can have. But you need to get over yourself and actually put in some effort.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, in what situations do you typically find yourself in which you'd like to show assertiveness? What are your goals?</br>  <br>It sounds to me like you need to do some exploration.<br>What have your life experiences been like?</br></br>  <br>I never react with emotion. I have to force everything and I feel like I'm missing something<br>Is there some way to fix this? Like pills or something? Im pretty bummed about it<br><br>Also I started noticing I get the urge to either kill or damage someone (emotionally and physically) when I get a chance to do so.<br>For example, during sex I'll put my hands over the girl's throat playfully, then suddenly I'm fighting the urge to completely strangle her.<br>It's not just women, but with every chance that i think i can at least escape before anyone notices<br><br>Is there any way to stop these urges? I think i might lose control eventually</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What is your fucking problem asshole?</br>  <br>im 465 lbs and too injured to work</br>  <br>That's weak.</br>  <br>Weight is just an arbitrary number, a measure of gravity pulling on your body. It wouldn't be impossible to come up with a similar measure of psychological metrics. It's done all the time in studies of things like memory and learning. It's just not terribly useful in this situation.</br>  <br>Obesity isnt an injured, its a lifestyle.<br>There are many treatments, from lipo to a gun</br></br>  <br>You don't know what arbitrary means.</br>  Can't sleep very well, can't remember anything or try, only thing I do anymore is play on the comp to talk with ppl, not addicted yet it's the only thing to do, can't do anything on school, I love to learn I just find it useless to memorize then forget, depressed yet I have a decent life a cute gf, great friends, nice enough family yet a little poor, what's wrong with me? Lack of inspiration? Lack of drive, that burning passion to acheve?  Im in love with a girl ive never met and we were in a long distance relationship for a bit and it broke off but i still want to be with her. I feel like she still has strong feelings but shes going through stuff and i dont wanna feel like im adding to her ongoing problems. I love her so much help me  <br>:O oh sheeeeet</br>  <br><br> therapist <br> can't sleep  <br><br>Great!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You two barely have a relationship at this point. In the coming weeks, you're gonna find shit about her you dont like just like she'll find shit about you she doesn't like. So in a sense your fear is justified, but this is a natural progression in all relationships. You're not going to match her fantasy. If she dumps you for not being perfect, she's a cunt and you're better off.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Gg</br></br></br></br>  Everything angers me because I'm lonely, confused and unhappy. What should I do?  <br>Go to a party where theres lots of alcohol, find a girl who might like you.<br>Rubadubdub faggot</br></br>  <br>Shut up Danny</br>  <br>I need some more context. When did you first become aware of these feelings(or lack thereof)? Are there any experiences that have particularly triggered them, or are exceptions to them?<br>Also, I'm assuming you don't like them since you're asking to be "fixed". Is this true? Why or why not?</br></br>  <br>I bought a shitty tablet.</br>  <br>my knees broke thats an injury faggot</br>  <br>I'm not a medical doctor.<br>Get some welfare/medicare/medicaid/whatever and go as a medical doctor what to do.</br></br>  <br>ive been denied multiple times my countrys healthcare is run by thieves and idiots</br>  <br>I doubt there's a singular thing "wrong," you're a complex person and there's many different factors at work.<br>Do you have any goals, either short term or long term?</br></br>  <br>Don't you feel like a bad person?<br>You're asking people to tell you all their problems when you're not yet qualified to help in any meaningful way (and of course it's debatable whether anyone can ever be truly qualified to do this).<br>You're clearly some kind of emotional tourist. Why do you think this is ok?</br></br></br>  <br>Because you were fat as fuck, faggot.</br>   &gt; 631614259 # <br>Not really recently<br>All I have is competitive TF2 practice and drawing and frankly I have no cofidence when I draw unlike a couple years ago</br></br>  <br>"It broke off" is a deliciously vague phrase.<br>Who broke it off? What are the circumstances surrounding this?</br></br>  I'm fucking pathetic /b/. I am so attached to my girlfriend. All my happiness is dependent on her. If we broke up I would be near suicidal. I hate how attached I am. I love her so much. I am her first boyfriend. We have been dating for 4+ years....<br><br>posted in a diff thread as well.</br></br>  <br>Since i was a child.

Why? What are you hoping to achieve?</br></br>  <br>His gf said it was ok for you to have cheesecake for dessert after having seconds on taco night and he drew a line</br>  <br>When I was in middle school, some kid decided he wanted to fight me at the bus arrival point before school. So I let him get on top of me and punch me as much as he wanted. I laughed the entire time.<br>The spectators decided I'd had enough, so they pulled him off. So I got up, walked over, and jabbed him in the jugular. Right after that I stomped on his balls. He punched like a girl and acted tough, so I decided he wasn't worthy of reproducing. Then I shook my head so the blood from my nose covered him. I was wearing a hoodie, so I took it off and wiped my face.<br>He couldn't get on the bus for whatever reason, so that was fun.</br></br></br>  <br>Getting your ass kicked sure showed that bully who's boss!</br>  <br>I really want help. <br><br>I've had depression for a while because my mother had it and she got off work for it, so I saw this as an opportunity to get off high school (I was 15 at this time, I am now 19). I've dug myself this pit of depression and I can't climb out, not even with the help and support of my family. <br>That's not the main problem though. The main problem is my relationship. I've been with a girl since late December and we've broken up a few times. She's my first girlfriend. We're back together now, and have been for a week, but I already feels things starting to go downhill. I get too jealous and when she even so much as speaks to a male, I get insanely jealous. Not only that, when she speaks to her female friends, I get jealous. I try not to let her see this but she's aware, I'm just not sure of what extent she knows it. <br><br>It's tearing me apart though. I want a relationship, I am lonely as fuck without a relationship and, I'll say it now, I do not have any friends. I shut everyone away. <br><br>How do I be more acceptant of what she does in her own time, how do I stop expecting everything, how do I stop being so clingy?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>People are like video games. There's a reason things like levels and achievements exist. We like the feeling of progress. Your issue I think is that there's no real markers of progress in your life, so you just kind of stop trying.<br>Where do you see yourself in ten years?</br></br>  <br>We profit off doing things people are too stupid to do themselves.<br>It's no different than any other profession.</br></br>  <br>Nah I'm a pretty sweet deal.</br>  <br>Fun note: I didn't even get bruised.<br>The 'bully' stayed home the next week.<br>Everyone avoided me tho. Huge win, I got to sit in my own seat and clear my mind.<br><br>He was a "black pride" kinda kid, and I'm white. So I got to stomp an ignorant nigger's balls in, and all I had to do was bleed a little. (Not racist, but he earned the label m8)</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not in college, probably living with my friends, one of them already own a house (rich white family) and me and a couple other bros might move in at 18 and stay there together for a while, I'll most likely have a minimum wage job unless I do like I normally do and bullshit my way though life like I do, I know how to manipulate people though I don't enjoy it, it's easy to make money off the ignorant and stupid.</br>  <br>Yeah, you've got to accept that she has other things eating up her resources so to speak at the moment, and that may not change.

Da Vinci, Mozart, Shakespeare, all of these men look down upon you from the after life with terrible shame. You sicken me you god damned pussy.</br></br>   She probably hates me   <br><br>I woke up this morning to her calling me and telling me she might have a foursome with her friends (all girls). She told me a week ago that she was uncomfortable with having sex outside of marriage, even though we had sex approximately 15 times, and that's why I haven't been able to get laid for the last month.<br><br>dude fuck this bitch</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>After going through all those girls I now realized that I'm happier by myself than I ever was before. But I fall for people easily so I pretty much chose a new girl every month, never make a move though not making anymore stupid mistakes.</br></br>    Never talked to her but fell in love. I think about her every day.  <br>Underrated post.<br><br>As for me, she's on a business trip right now. I miss her.</br></br></br>  <br>Better to be alone anon. Can't get hurt.</br>  <br><br>there is no one anymore. there hasn't been for a while.<br><br>the only one i cared about moved to Portland after we graduated. she married and has a kid now. and seeing as how i have no interest in either of those things right now, i'd say i dodged a major bullet in hindsight.</br></br></br></br>  <br>kek seriously?<br> Da Vinci, Mozart, Shakespeare <br> Acting like you have anything to do with these people <br>Nice job proving yourself to be a real asshole in this thread.<br>If you like those guys so much, tell us what you do for the world again<br><br>btw i'm not OP I just hate people who think they actually stack up to mozart and shit when they really just sit on their ass</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Say what you want faggot but woman whether young or old can have an extreme effect on a man just by her beautiful or cute looks, back in the days even the most based Kings could be humble by a simple cute woman. We were created to care and protect woman and they will always be a part of men.</br>  <br>Pic related</br>  <br>Of course she wants to see you, go see her</br>  <br>life is too short to not go for it man. Trust me. I had my chance and I spent so much time trying to decide whether or not to take the chance that by the time I did, it was too late.</br>  Allot of people need to realize that most girls just love to fuck, and that's okay  <br>Can say same thing heard stories from my mates of long lost friends being reunited 15-20 years later. You'll never know unless you try</br>  <br>Go for it Anon, don't hesitate a second. You could lose something special there.</br>  <br>Does she live in Chicago?</br>  <br><br>My most rare pepe for you</br></br>  She's the fucking best thing that has ever happened to me and she will always be :)  Well how about this, I don't fucking have a her, it fucking blows. <br>I broke up with my girlfriend of three years last winter and I haven't meet anyone that I was remotely interested in since then. My collage was like 80% dudes and I was working too hard to go out (that and I am a fucking introvert pussy) but I'm transfusing to a new school with way more females this fall so I'm hoping.<br><br>But for real, revel in that infatuation because trust me, you fucking miss it when its gone. Wanting and not having is better than the emotionless pit that is having no one you can even dream of.</br></br></br>  <br>No. Alabama.</br>  <br>You said it. I'm living as a lonewolf now can't get hurt anymore, but the old wounds never heal</br>  <br>Still together, have been for 1 and a half years. Had rough periods but she's getting better, she didn't have the best childhood and had various terrible relationships in the past. First gf, life is pretty good.</br>  <br>And yet I want to be in a relationship for the rest of my life. I don't want to jump from person to person trying to reassure myself that people love me.<br><br>What's so wrong about that?<br><br>Why does society think it's strange to be in a relationship for any significant amount of time?<br><br>Why do I even bother...?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Where do I begin? <br>She's wonderful, one of those people that carries a sort of light with her and has a way of making people smiling A way of making me smile at that.<br>She's a wonderful person and wherever she is right now in the world; I hope that she's happy.<br>I really want to see her go places with her life and I know that she has the potential to do great things.<br>She truly is 1 in 5 billion and I'm lucky to have her in my life.<br><br>I'm sure a bunch of pessimistic popcorn farts will try to shit all over what I said but I can't help the fact that you suck</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Story 2.<br> the year or so before I move out of state <br> girl from 1st story and I are friends, not super close <br> Girl #2 is this athletic blonde chick on my street <br> We're both 14 when we meet. I'm a few months older  <br> I met her through a friend of my brother whom we hung out with almost daily <br> we start talking separate from the group, she definitely likes me.  <br> a couple weeks after meeting her we are making out at a park near our neighborhood <br> I get handsy on her tits <br> shes into it <br> I start to play with her waistband <br> "No, I'm not ready for that" <br> fair enough <br> get home. older brother's phone is on the kitchen counter (he is 17 at the time) <br> he gets a text almost immediately as I walk into my house <br> It's her, talking about how she wants to see him or some shit <br> turns out she has been sneaking around with him  <br> worst part is I spent the next couple weeks trying to win her over. I don't think ive ever had less respect for myself than when I realized what I was doing.  <br><br><br><br>All too common story, my friend. Imagine how often it happens without being discovered.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>She doesn't like me, I don't like me</br></br>  <br>Happy for you dubs dubs man<br><br> checked </br></br></br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br><br>what the fuck are you talking about dude</br></br>  That fucking phone call... <br><br>"Hey where are you?"<br> &gt;Hey babe. Just going to class. What's up? <br>Long silence. Gets uneasy.<br> &gt;Just say it. <br>More silence.<br> &gt;Still there? <br>"I don't love you anymore."<br><br>I wasn't on my way to class. I was on my way to her parents house with a ring.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  lol, if you're living your life around a woman, you're already fucking up. Be independent, your own man. Make your own money, have your own shit. That way you can have whatever relationship you want and when shit goes sour, you tell the bitch to get to steppin' from YOUR abode. Fuck this 50/50 bullshit. Have the lease or mortgage in your name, your own vehicle, your own clothing and furniture. Your own bank account. Total independence. The power you will have over cunts in such instances is invigorating. Sure, let them live with you, if you so chose. But when shit gets stale, they leave from YOUR home. Fuck the drawn our court battles. This kind of power will make women positively kneel before you. Because they know their place. They know who is in charge and who calls the shots. When they suck your cock they won't suck it, they will WORSHIP it. They will actually go out of their way to please you, because they know you are a big-dick alpha with his own life and his own shit.  after the first several girlfriends, i found out that i invariably alienate and ruin anyone that i give a shit about. so i'd rather just wait it out and drink and smoke and fuck escorts. then i'll die early and spare myself the extra three decades or so of garbage. <br><br>i'm fucked in the head. i can't afford to have a "her".</br></br>  <br><br>oh man</br></br>  HIM*<br>I don't know where to start<br>I feel like he isn't attracted to me, I'm a 4-5/10 and he's a 7/10 when he tries and knows chicks who are far more better looking or easier to talk to then I am.<br>I want to ask him if he's really with me because he likes me or because he feels sorry for me, but I'm actually scared of the response that I'll get. <br><br>Besides all that when we're together I like the conversations we have, they're really upbeat and always put me in a good mood and make me think it the box. There's always something for us to talk about and its not just me talking to the air like it is with most people.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Know why you had a ring m8? Coz you're a fairy</br>   seems easy going <br> I'm a social fuck </br>  <br>I have never found her. No girl has ever felt right. Oh well, I still have my jalapeño poppers!</br>  <br>I still don't know what it was. Perfectly fine one day. Just something about her voice told me everything I needed to know. Oh well bro. What ails you tonight?</br>  <br>And jesus christ, whatever you fucking do, DO NOT have kids. A kid is an unbreakable chain chaining you to that kid's mother for at least the next 21 years, likely even life. And the kicker? There is a damn good chance you won't even get to see the kid if the mother doesn't want you to. You'll just have to fork over half your paycheck or go to jail while the kid's mother ingrains what a scumbag daddy is into the kid's head.</br>  <br>Should have gone with hobbit.</br>   Meet in class <br> Cool as fuck <br> End up hanging out <br> Asks if we should go steady <br> Week later she tells me she's gonna be busy <br> "Then why did you ask me out?" <br> Breaks up with me months later <br> Everyone tells me to just get over it <br><br>Liked her a lot but apparently she didn't want to<br>date someone when she was busy.<br>Which I still don't understand, when she knew<br>she was going to be busy before dating me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's in love with my best friend who treats her like shit, i love her, she is amazing and relates to me so well. I spend every day with her, but she is still with him and i don't know if she knows that i love her.</br>  <br>You were an experiment. Sorry bro.</br>  I fucked up.   dated off and on for a year and a half <br> I kept cheating on her and she kept taking me back <br> one night she saw texts from another girl and wanted to see my phone <br> raped her because she wouldn't let me fuck <br> she was so wet <br>We haven't talked since but I still throw some of her instagram pictures likes</br></br></br></br></br>  I almost hate her. <br> be 18 <br> Failing math class, falling out with best friend <br> feelsbadman.gif <br> Go to a dance class <br> Too fucking early; didn't start until Wednesday of that week <br> Waiting at bus stop <br> See cute girl <br> Tattoos, piercings, headphones <br> Basically my type of girl <br> Years of social anxiety and low self-esteem are suddenly forgotten as I approach her <br> Get her phone number <br> Feel alpha for the first time in my entire life <br> Meet up on Friday that week <br> Find out she's fucking some other guy <br> Figure it's just competition <br>Oh, how wrong I was<br> Starts getting bitchy and ignoring my texts <br> Decide I had enough and delete her number <br> A month later <br> Sends me a text stating how much she missed me <br> Start chatting with her again <br> She's now with the guy she was fucking  <br> Slightly surprised, but shouldn't have been <br> Go to concert with her and boyfriend <br> Choose that moment to realize I've fallen for her <br> Eight months of torment <br> Would spend hours daydreaming about how awesome our lives would be together, then would snap out of it <br> This would be the equivalent to having a happy dinner with your family just to wake up and remember that your sister died and your parents are abusive <br> Eventually decide just friendship is enough <br> I've been a best friend to her <br> I've had acquaintances-no, enemies who've done more for me than she ever had <br>I think I'm going to just stop contacting her altogether and let our friendship just wither away; it was doomed from the start.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Your mistake is trying to rationalize the thought-process or emotions of a woman. Don't do that. You will lose. Women serve one purpose and one purpose only; sexual gratification. That is it. Literally everything else in life can be done with male friends. DO NOT under any circumstances attempt to form an emotional bond with a female. I know it sounds harsh and I am not trying to sound edgy, but you will be infinitely happier in life when you learn to treat females as sex objects and absolutely nothing more.</br>  We're dating. She's pretty much one oft the best things to ever happen to me guys.   She's Chinese, living in mainland China. <br> we meet on a year abroad exchange in Japan.  <br> we everything together, date spots, movies, and she cooks bento boxes for us all <br> all my friends thing were dating  <br> I decide not to be a pussy and ask her out 5 months in. <br> sorry anon I have a boyfriend.  <br><br>The worst part is is that I fell for this girl, I'm going all the way to China next Sunday to see her even though it makes me feel empty knowing she has someone else.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>With that mindset you will be a failure for life. Stop basing your self-worth around some cunt. YOU need to be the best thing to ever happen to you.</br>  <br>Posted this in another thread but fuck it. <br><br> be 21 <br> maybe 8/10 in looks <br> girlfriend of 2 years dumps me via text <br> feelsbadman.jpeg <br> depression worsens <br> don’t go out and hardly talk to anyone <br> have to go to counselling  <br> cool bro at work says he will hook me up with a babe <br> sceptical because socially awkward and co workers don’t really like me <br> fuck it nothing to lose <br> give him my number to give to said babe  <br> 2 days later get text <br> ”hey anon, its blah blah blah want to get coffee”? <br> say sure because feeling good about it and nothing better to do <br> decide today would work best for our schedules  <br> talk and have decent conversations for never meeting <br> no nothing about this chick so just roll with whatever she says <br> try to play it cool because lonely and I tend to spill spaghetti </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  This is a story from middle school to the summer before high school, fucked me up.<br><br> be me, fatass, but im apparently funny so I have a good amount of decent friends <br> Three best friends, lets call them Jim, Steven, and Hannah. <br> Hannah was beautiful; blonde, tall, and a pretty face. <br> she dated around and even used to date Jim <br> She had just broken up with a guy that I hated <br> Little did I know she broke up with him so she could date me <br><br>should i cont?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Freshman year? been almost a year?<br>underage b&amp; MODS!!!!!!!!</br></br>  lol so fucking teenager in this thread.  <br>fast forward to today<br> 3 hours ago <br> get to said coffee shop we agreed on <br> super nervous because no idea what she looks like <br> on /b/ just trying to calm down  <br> out of peripherals see big object <br> I look up <br> see a mass come into the cafe  <br> oh lord please help me now.  <br> land whale morphs over to my table huffing and puffing <br> ”are you anon?” <br> "y-yes Im anon" <br> "where is my coffee?” <br> I.. um I-  <br> she starts to raise her voice <br> ”what the hell.

Befriend one of the other delivery guys who joined just a few weeks after me. A year or so later his girlfriend turns 18 and wants to deliver Pizza, too. <br> most beautiful piece of human in this world. My dream, from the first day on <br>Get super close with both of them, every evening at his house for beer and talking. She tells me about how loveless he is and how he never listens and so on. Listen to her, saying that in the end everything will turn out to be great for them both. <br>A few months later my dreamgirl and I fuck like rabbits for at least three days without getting out of my bed exept for eating and some stuff. Was like an outburst on both sides. She eventually breaks up with him and I have the luckiest six months of my life. <br>End of the story: she goes back to him because she misses her dog and their old friends... Not a word of him. A few weeks later I see her and ask if we could just talk a last time. And she looks me in the eyes and says, her feelings are none of my business, tells me to fuck off and that she hates me for whatever reason. I die inside. <br><br>I still miss her like crazy. But I came to the point where I just want to show her what she's missing. So I'm starting to work out and begin to study mechanical engineering in october. Her new old bf makes just about 1400€ per months. I don't know if I would take her back</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>shes the only good person in my life right now</br>  Knew her for 6 years now.<br>first love.<br>the first year she wasn't single i took my chance and all i ever get is "I dont know if i like you"<br>i cant stop thinking about her and havent given up yet.<br>I wish i got my chance to be with her but now shes in the Air Force and college so now i'm here.

Cause you look like you're 30." <br> Stunned and start handing her my I.D. <br> She starts counting on her fingers and says "Ok, you're 24, good." <br> Putting I.D. away, I apologize and explain. <br> She nods and explains that she's been getting men that are way older or way younger than their profiles and is also looking for love. <br> We spend all say talking with our cold coffee's, went to a petting zoo, and to a comic shop. <br>I am absolutely in love with this girl and it's been 2 years, I'm thinking about asking her to move in.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I'll never work up the courage to ask her out.  <br> anyways being with her is getting real hard <br> but still doesn't suppress my love for her <br> it started with a haunted house <br> I was with her and some of her church friends <br> kept trying to hold her hand put she was pulling away <br> you don't know what that feels like <br> but every time her friends looked away she whisper yelled at me "not hear" <br>Just to clarify we are like 5 months after we met at this moment<br> So we go through the haunted house and we all go home <br> I text her that night <br> "that was the hardest thing I've ever had to do" <br> "I'm so sorry anon" <br> "yeah I know it's not your fault" <br> we hang out like a lot after that some alone some with her friends <br> end up having a relatively similar convo after every time we hang out with her friends <br> she texts me  <br> "I'm hurting you to much anon" <br> "no your fine" <br> "no I'm hurting you and it's hurting me seeing you like this. I believe we can be together and I understand it's hard but I can't stand to see you like this anymore.

And the November before, I randomly bought her flowers. So beta lol, I was so dumb. <br>  We always went on fake dates, doing couple things as friends. It was stupid, I wanted more. <br>  April 2014 I cut her off, had a talk with her in my car (which was talk #2 or 3...) about some things I was stressing about, and eventually brought up her and told her I'd like to just stop hanging out for a bit <br>  She was upset, but I deleted her off FB/number/everything. April 2013 - August I didn't talk to her. After our initial texting after the talk, the only time she sent me a text was when my grandma died. Told me she was thinking of me and just wanted to let me know, yada yada some paragraph. <br>  Eventually send her a text in August 2013 to reconnect, she accidentally texts me after that "Anon sent me a text", she tried to play it off. <br>  Started hanging out again, but it's been awkward ever since. Horribly awkward. <br>Contd</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I dreamed of her last night.

She called the cops saying that I was beating the shit out of her (I dont hit women). Didnt break her shit anyhow that shit was solid.<br>If you wanna whitekngiht her though find her</br></br>  <br>Part 2:<br>  We hang out occasionally now <br>  She never texts me first or responds fast when I text, but she'll always make time for me. <br>  We've been clubbing twice, but my friends hate bringing her or her friends. T <br>  She's given me a lot of sweet compliments when we're dt. <br>  When we had our old talk in April 2013, we both confessed we were taking antidepressants and had bad depression. It's an inside joke now. <br>  We danced a bit dt, but I'm usually tipsy and she's anxious (because of me?) <br>  Last time we went out, it was horribly awkward. She told me she had fun near the end of the night (it was boring AF), and asked if I wanted to go to a new club the next week. She said it'll be fun, there's dancing and a bar <br>  At this point I'm too tired to see if she's asking me out, I'm tired of all of this bs <br>  Texted her the next day about a band she might like, just to get a convo going.  <br>  She responded with something boring and sounded like it was the end of the convo. Never texted her after that, it's been almost 2 months. <br>  I can't even talk about girls in front of her, I was seeing this girl for fun and she acted jealous and bitchy. She never talks about guys, guess it's fair. <br>  I thought I was over her, but I can never tell. I just had a dream about her, like wtf. <br><br>What do I even do? This is stupid as fuck.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She is my reason to be alive, my everything, she is really the one</br>  <br>Said the guy on 4chan.</br>  The main mistake I made was letting one single person mean everything to me. <br>When that person leaves, breaks your heart, does whatever, your life will feel empty and meaningless, period. <br>Honestly wish I could choose when to fall in love with someone, so I can make sure she's the one.</br></br>  <br>Huntsville?</br>  <br>She's right next to me. Just blew my load all up inside her. She's currently leaking my cum out all over a washcloth.</br>  she was a friend of mine<br>dating this dude we didnt know<br>dude turns out to be cool, awsome, nice, always wanted to help others<br>she was his first gf, she had atleast 20 guys<br>we tell him shes kinda a slut, he doesnt mind<br>they were together for quite a long, we thought that she changed<br>NOPE<br>they broke up <br>he tells us that she was rude, when they fought she cut herself so that he would feel bad, she didnt want him around her house because he was ''a waste of money'', even cheated on him<br>then she started being rude to other people<br>now we're ignoring her and hanging out with him because hes cool</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Classmate in commuity college <br> Never really close until we went to karaoke with other classmates and I drove her home <br> got so closes, people thought we are dating <br> although never stated implicitly, we both know we like each other <br> mfw I already had girlfriend that I don't really like <br> mfw gf got preggo and I had to marry her <br> Told my classmate that I'm going to marry my gf (but I didn't tell her why) <br> then-gf got miscarriage, it's too late to cancel the wedding <br> texting with her the night before my wedding <br> "this would be the last time for us, Anon" <br> few months later, she text me <br> "I miss how close we used to be" <br> texting with her until dawn <br> I finally said I like her more than friend <br> she said she like me too but it's impossible for us to be together at this point <br> mfw when I finally love a girl that love me too <br> mfw I can't be together with her </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt; At a party <br> &gt; See F <br>When I realized what was happening</br></br></br>  <br>Better question is why do most people get uncomfortable when you don't want that</br>    Got out of extremely long relationship, so long it's like you're starting your life over with a first love. Gay, but true.  <br>  Met this amazingly hot girl. So far out of my league it's not even funny, also almost half my age.  <br>  Love, dating, all that shit goes on for a year or so.  <br>  Find out she's fucking around, tells me how she's a piece of shit and she loves me but has a head full of bad wiring. <br>  Bail out, can't stand to deal with her.  <br>  She begs me to come back, fucks me behind her new bf's back whenever she can but I can barely stand to be in her presence any longer than to nut in her.  <br>  Try to move on, been years, but she still consumes my thoughts and I fucking hate it.  <br>  Fuck </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I met a girl online I've been talking to for several months regularly. She lives about 2 hours away, we've never met. We have very similar interests. The problem is, she's insecure. That has its ups and downs. Since she doesn't respect herself, she is willing to do anything sexual in order to please me. But long term, I don't see much of a future with her. There is also the factor I'm autistic and it's difficult to find a girl alright with that. Wat do?  <br>hey faggot, i dunno if you know this or not but you're on here too. you live for someone when you're old enough. you're probably just some faggot that's like "muh girlfriend is the only 1 for me hurrdurr" fuck off.</br>  Hot chick who plays in a band. She's really fucking good at it. 8/10 body, 8/10 face. God she's a babe.  She's black  <br><br>Post it all, anon.</br></br>  <br>I did</br>  <br>That was it???</br>  <br>yes</br>  I knew this girl named Victoria all my life. Her parents and my parents were neighbors and besties. Only she was five years older than me. Our families seem to do everything together, even a number of Christmases! <br><br>When I was in middle school I had to stop by her place for the night, since my parents wanted a night out by themselves but didn't trust me alone... I had downloaded a shit-ton of porn but didn't think to erase the history.<br><br>Her parents happened to be out too. I was just watching TV that night, lounging on the couch, when she comes out of the shower in a tight fitting, mid-drift showing tank top and form fitting as fuck bike shorts.<br><br>Holy fuck the shape of those legs, the slight bounce of her heavy tits, the tightness of her stomach. I had never noticed before. I watched as she went to the fridge and bent over to grab something far in. Oh god, how her muscles moved. She played soccer so she really was fit. <br><br>She caught me staring before I thought to look away. She asked "What is it Anon?" and I just blurted out, "Got any sodas in there?"<br><br>"Yeah, just a sec." And she turns and shows me her bent over ass again!" I was much more careful when sneaking peeks at her. I made excuses to come over more often. And made stupid chit chat with her whenever I could.<br><br>During high school she would sometimes drive me to school in the mornings or pick me up, if her schedule allowed. And I was so fucking thrilled just to spend that time with her. Oh! And during those times I would ask if we could stop some place to grab some food before heading home. Or if we could make a short trip to pick up a game or movie or something. Anything to stall for time to be with her that much longer.<br><br>She actually gave me her old car when she got a new one, and I could haul my own ass around. Then she got a boyfriend, and I couldn't have been more jealous. He was such a prick too, made fun of everyone's flaws, always made excuses up for himself, groping her in public (cont)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Known a girl my whole life. Doesn't want to "risk the friendship". Fuck the friendship. Can't take this bullshit, why do chicks leave guys on the hook?  <br>Here's all of them<br><br><br><br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> she was my first (and only) girlfriend <br> i broke up with her because she was a bit flirty with guys, and always had some type of drama to start <br>  but she would tell me when she was acting flirty with people and would apologize a lot <br> i know she didnt do anything with the guys cus my chick friend would hang out with her and she would tell me she was acting flirty after my gf already told me  <br> but never did she say that she kissed them or anything <br> i broke up with her anyways because of stupid pride <br> i regret my decision a year later bc we stayed friends and kept talking and i realized how much she's changed <br> like mentally and physically, her ass grew three times its size out of nowhere <br> she doesnt seem to be so dramatic anymore and rn i asked her if we can hang out tomorrow <br> ... she said yes, wish me luck /b/ im getting my girl back </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  met in highschool. <br>her brother was one of my best friends.<br>friend dates my sister<br>I date his sister just because<br>she was 14 i was 17.<br>did not give a fuck.<br>fast forward 6 years, we get married. two years later we are having a sweet baby girl. yep life is good. now /b/ tell me your excuse for being a dweller</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Im about to pour whatever the fuck i have left out to /b/ sorry for being an emotional fag i havent taken my meds in weeks<br> Met her right aftet crazy ex  <br> she calmed me down and seemed to really like me <br> I told her i liked her one day after she did this cute pout thing ill never forget <br> Went out with het for a few months <br> I had alot of bad childhood stuff brought up <br> trusted her with my life and hung out with her friends who eventually became mine <br> We started disagreeing alot and fighting <br> Thought it was just a rough patch <br> Still loved every part of this girl <br> She wants a break im devastated  <br> i try it out <br> she wins best photo at school art thing and im so fucking proud of her because i kept telling her she would <br> i went up to her but then remembered we were on break <br> told her congrats and acted happy but deep down i was sad i couldnt kiss her and hug her <br> when we did fight friends were always on my side <br> She breaks up with me <br> I try to kill myself when i found out she hung out with a guy a day after <br> pillsdidntwork.jpg <br> Friends no longer talk to me <br> fully alone <br> Went out with her for a year and a half so many reminders <br> I hit my wall if i even see a picture of her <br> im trying with other girls nothing is happening <br> guy she made out with apologized to me she lied to him <br> She is with someone else now  <br> Did alot of drugs by myself <br> Sleep schedule is totally fucked <br> i try tweeting things that are going on so maybe someone talks to me <br>  </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>None of them know i tried to kill myself. I asked one if she would help me out because she has been in my position but she said she didnt want to get inbetween us. Yet she hangs out with her...</br>   Three fucking years. <br> took me summer after high school. <br> helped me get on my feet in the world. <br> both new to sex <br> barely did it <br> lived with her for last year <br> breaks it up one day out of nowhere <br> five days later bangs best friend <br> best friend is roommate in a month <br> three years down the hole <br> 21 had sex four times <br> three with girlfirend of three years </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Get on the feels train.  <br>Thats actually very nice, glad for you anon</br>  <br>Does she only fuck you on your birthday ?</br>  <br>despite her telling him off for it all the time. Oh, I should mention her room window was visible from mine. And I could see when he was over. And that he was probably fucking her just a couple dozen feet away. <br><br>I was a Jr. in high school when this dick got on my case and tried to pick a fight with me. My car needed repairs so Victoria offered to pick me up and drop me off for the next couple of days. Then the boyfriend saw us leaving and coming back to her place together and got in my face about it. I looked this shit right in the eye and cracked a smarmy little smirk, then acted like something did happen but he wasn't worth my time to tell him so. So he asked her if she was being a "cheating whore" with me. This made them get into a fight.<br><br>I decided to remain as her support. She eventually shouted over him that he needed to leave if he thought of her that way. He actually said if she got to fuck other guys then he was going to fuck other bitches.<br><br>He shoved past me and knocked me into a cabinet, making me hit the back of my head before he stormed out.<br><br>After getting some ice for me Victoria was trying her best not to cry. She had a feeling he was cheating on her, and this just proved it to her. Then, getting a little brave, I told her if that was the case then she could do way better than that jerk.<br><br>I hung out with her a little more after the break up with the shit head. And we got closer. We talked all the time, and joked, and sat close... well, when neither of us had work or school.<br><br>I was falling hard for her. I wanted her so bad! I knew I had to make a move soon too, before some other dick came along. And in my mind I knew she was going to finish up college soon, then get a proper job and move away.<br><br>So one night, late, I asked if I could come over. She seemed puzzled but I told her it couldn't wait until tomorrow. She eventually agreed and in a couple minutes I was over. And she was in that same outfit again! Tanktop and bike shorts!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I wish I could post something meaningful in these threads. But since I get violent when I have a clear line of sight on who ever has wronged me. I dont want to get in a relationship in fear that she will do something really bad and ill hurt her beyond repair. If a girl ever cheated on me id seriously fuck her up, and if the guy knew she was in a relationship with me, i think id castrate him.  <br>An anon gets me....</br>  I met her through one of my friends because he said that we would get along. I didn't think that we would have that much in common, but shes the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. I've never felt like I had such a connection with someone else.  <br>I knew her since 6th grade. She's a grade older than I. All throughout elementary school, I was bullied to shit. Sure I was a bit awkward, but honestly was just trying to be left alone. She were the first two people beyond my parents to treat me like a human being. They built the basis for all the friends I made after.<br><br>I lost touch with her after 7th grade. It wasn't until 11th grade that I got back in touch with her. There were a few times I had encounters with her, but I was a cringemaster during the early years of High School, so they didn't end well. But I had noticed she changed. Much more subdued.<br><br>In 11th grade, we had a class together. So I took the plunge and started talking to her again. We really hit it off. I found her again. But after that, she graduated. And we just dropped again.<br><br>I asked her why, and she said that she thought we were just classmates. And she didn't want anything more than that.<br><br>Over that span of time, I had done some horrible things to some good people. and some really horrible things for horrible people. I'm a fucking monster. But with her. When I'm talking to her, I feel like myself. She made me feel like someone cared. She made me feel like there's a good person still left in me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you will fucking regret it if you dont.</br>  Perfect for me, but I fucked up several times  <br>I love you, anon.</br>  She's rich as fuck and traveling the world why I'm poor as fuck trying to make money for bills, I haven't heard from her in months...  <br>I don't know even now where I had found the courage to ask her if we could speak alone in her room, where her parent's wouldn't come by and over hear anything. She shrugged and invited me in. I took a seat on her bed and she sat next to me.<br><br>I told her that I needed help with something, that something had come up and I just couldn't figure out what to do about it. How to figure it out. She told me to stop being vague. So much for set up.<br><br>I looked her right in the eye and told her, "Look, you are smart, and funny, and talented and all that... So..."<br><br>"Oh no... Anon, I don't-"<br><br>"Please, hear me out Vicky."<br><br>She bit her lower lip, but didn't interrupt. I sighed and continued, "I have known you practically all my life. You are just so... so brilliant! That's why I have to ask you something, and I need you to think about it and be completely honest... OK?"<br><br>She took a deep sigh now, then nodded. She still looked apprehensive though. But I had no where else to turn to with this. I had to press forward.It was now or never! "So, please, can you see why kids love the taste of Cinnamon Toast Crunch(tm)?!"<br><br>She shut her eyes and shook her head, "Oh, damn it Anon! I don't know!"<br><br>SHE WHAT?! How? "Are you serious? Its simple! Kids love the cinnamon swirls covering every bite!"<br><br>I stood up, pissed beyond belief! This was the woman I had crushed on for years! So beautiful, and talented, and I looked up to her for her smarts to. Or so I thought! I stormed out of her room, making sure to slam her door. Though I saw her sobbing into her hands just before I did. Fuck my life! Why are all women such stupid cunts?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Gym class <br> in college <br><br>Yeah ok summerfag</br></br></br></br>  <br>There's never been a her, I've always been alone.</br>   grill transferred to my school <br> instantly thought she was cute <br> learned that she was fucking smart and religious <br> also learned that she and i were neighbors for years (i didn't get out much) <br> falls in love the more i know her <br> cringecoreflirting.png <br> eventually learned that she liked this other guy <br> feelsbadman.jpg <br> didn't stop flirting with her <br> later found out that she didn't like the guy anymore <br> feelsgoodman.webm <br> Christmas break came <br> missed her so fucking much <br> decided not to waste any more time and just be honest with her <br> couple months later she confessed that she loved me <br> been together ever since  <br><br>Her mom's kinda okay with me but her dad hates my guts.

A random butt dial here, random butt dial there. Laughing while I'm withering. <br> She said she loved me. <br> She lied. <br><br>Her<br> She was the person I should've dated. <br> She hung around but I barely noticed her. <br> She's intelligent, talented, beautiful, but down to earth. <br> The person that should have told her those things never did. <br> Instead she dated asshole after asshole. <br> Now she's a recluse and I'm afraid I'll never get the chance. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>THANK YOU GIANTESS</br>  It's been five years. I know she doesn't care about me as I do her. I am an attached idiot.  Why the fuck is this happening to us guys? I mean this suffering just seems so fucking common its strange...  I don't even have one.<br><br>Its that bad.</br></br>  Borderline Personality Disorder. Didn't know until after we had split up. I have to wonder how many times what I thought was consensual sex was actually unwanted. The worst part is that I think she got an abortion to break up with another guy because she thought we'd get back together over it.  <br>messaged her.<br>She never replied back.</br></br>  Met her in class a few years ago. Didn't say much to her. There was something different about her. I couldn't talk to one person in the class, and it was her. I didn't want to come across as some retard with; I wanted to do something right. I talk to her every once in awhile and the conversations are long and worthwhile. I found someone that I could enjoy being with. I loosened up and relaxed. We enjoy each other's company.<br><br>She's leaving for 4 months to travel abroad and I want to tell her how much I love her and how I think she's a brilliant woman who I'm willing to risk it all for. She's talented, intelligent, kindhearted, and fucking beautiful. Her eyes, her flowing ebony hair, her everything. I want to hold her and tell her how much I appreciate everything that's happened so far in this friendship and that I want to be with her. I know I'm not at that point yet in her eyes though. We don't share the same feeling. I have a month left to build this bond a little more before she leaves. I might aswell try to do something rather than do nothing while I'm still alive and breathing.</br></br>  <br>Because when your life is empty you tend to cling to whatever thing you got left ... that's why faggots like us get so attached to people, in the first panel life is empty, there's no reason for you to live, in the second one it's finally good and you've finally found meaning to your shitty life, the thing that all of us search... but we're not in those two anymore, most of us are in the last one, desperation. The last one is different from the first because it keeps you from becoming anhero. You can't kill yourself yet, you've tasted paradise unlike the unlucky bastards from the first one and still believe a miracle will come and you'll get back to her someday.</br>   NOT BEING MGTOW   <br>If thats her she's a hambeast and was probably just spinning a web so that she can devour you like the rest of her pray <br><br>I wouldn't lose any sleep anon, you lived to tell the tale</br></br></br>  <br>They say significant others are supposed to be treated like icing on a cake.<br><br>She was the entire fucking cake and the platter holding it.</br></br></br>  <br> MGTOW <br>Faggiest religion I've ever heard of.<br>Yes, it's a religion.
