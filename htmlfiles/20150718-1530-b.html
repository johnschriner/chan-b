What in the fuck? Is he inducing the sneezes? When he goes to the bathroom, he hammers his fucking way down the hallway and stands outside my room for ages, then fucks off downstairs to turn the lights on, then off, then back upstairs. Twenty fucking minutes go by and he's doing the same fucking thing, every fucking night.<br><br>I'm going to fucking waste this cunt.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  In a relationship that is bound to end in 7weeks, since we are going to study in different countries. She says im the only one she will ever want, but i dont believe in long distance love. Im looking for a way to break it off, since im too big of a fag to tell her i dont want it or im just so afraid of hurting her, since her life was really shitty up to the time we started dating - after that everything was awesome. She is my 1st, i an her 2nd. I dont think i can commit to my 1st relationship this much. I am litteraly lost...  I went on a date tonight and it went really well! She's beautiful, smart, sweet and funny. We're going to a Dinosaur Jr. concert together Sunday and I'm really excited.   22 <br> NEET <br> kissless virgin <br> dropped out of college twice <br> had one friend in my entire life <br> he hasn't spoken to me for 4 years <br> crush on qt3.14 cousin that dislikes me <br> so lonely <br><br>idk why I'm still alive</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>make sure to get a picture of their pedals bro</br>  <br>I was actually being more literal. At what point does shooting up heroin seem like a good idea. I've just never seen shooting up as appealing and heroin is known as the worst drug out there yet show how this shit is so prevalent. <br><br>Where in PA?

We live about 6 hours away from each other and we're not even officially dating. I think I love her. She's great. I'm hoping I get to see her soon. I don't know how this well end though, so while I feel extremely happy when I talk to her, my downs can go quite low when I start to think about the situation. Long-distance is hard. I wouldn't recommend it but I think this girl is worth it  <br>You're not a failure, you just suffer from depression. See a psychiatrist and they'll help you get better.</br>  <br>I haven't really been around girls in the last 10 years<br>unless college counts..<br>first time: lasted 18 months, 0 girls in my class<br>second: lasted 6 months, 3 in my class</br></br></br></br>  <br>can i ask why you dropped out? im 18. i was supposed to go to college this fall with all my friends but i dont know what to study and im just scared i wont make it or something</br>  <br>barely slept, so tired all the time even if I did sleep fine</br>  <br>What is your real story? <br>How are you a virgin, why haven't you been around girls, why don't you have friends, why have you dropped out of school twice?</br></br>  <br>*may I</br>  I was reflecting earlier today and remembered something cool that happened to me a while back.

I really want to go back but I'm not sure how I can make it happen. Any Czech friends here who might have advice? For what it's worth, I have Czech/Austrian/Polish heritage. I really fit right in as far as appearance. The Czech language is interesting. I can speak good German and this is how I interacted with some Czech people. My main question would be: What should I try to do as far as work goes?<br><br>Thanks in advance. I desperately want to move over to Central Europe.</br></br>  <br>boys boarding school<br>people just don't like me<br>only one person ever talked to me after I left.. until about 6 months later<br>see </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Porn Scout.</br></br>  If this thread stays bumped, ill greentext my current situation. Currently on my phone taking a shit while doing laundry.<br><br>you dont know true luxury until you shit in the same room your laundry gets done</br></br>  <br>Why don't people like you? <br>Something is missing. <br>Are you deformed, obese, a raging autistic asshole?<br>You're leaving out a very important piece of the puzzle</br></br></br></br>  Well fuck you faggots too  <br>did you cry? i wouldve</br>  <br>haha</br>  <br>you need a cat in your life, bro.</br>  <br>if only someone told me<br>no, no, and no<br>yes, I'm an autism, but people would never know unless someone told them</br></br></br>  <br><br>This is definitely an option but probably one I wouldn't take right away. I dabble in stock trading and was thinking that maybe once I build up enough in my brokerage I can turn it into a full time gig. Just not sure if there are any regulatory implications in that.</br></br>  <br>you're not lost, you're just a pussy. you know what you want and you're too afraid to tell her how you feel.</br>   be me  <br> dated this girl and completely fell for her <br> everything about her was absoultey perfect <br> we have a normal relationship for the first couple of weeks shit made me happy <br> for the first time in a long time I was content with the quality of my life <br> shit went south <br> we started arguing daily over stupid shit  <br> she wanted an out and tried to blame everything on me <br> I tried to work out issues, I tried to fix the relationship.  <br> she wasn't having it  <br> we've been broken up for over a month <br> she's dating a new guy <br> I just want her to be happy and if he does that for her than I wouldn't want to stop it.  <br>I've thought about it and I wouldn't change how it went down because she'll be better off and I learned you shouldn't take people you care about for granted because you never know when your time with them will be up.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I work at a call center for Verizon, I make 15 bucks an hour. My job sucks my car is falling apart on me, and money is really tight. I'm in the middle of moving with my wife and my friends in the same house. My credit is fucked and I just want to have enough not to worry about things.<br><br>top things i need I cant afford yet: A new car, a honeymoon, the ability to pay off my credit burdens and live a little easier.<br><br>lifes hard sometimes<br><br>Ge</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Actually it makes me sad that such loyal creatures live in this fucked up world</br>  I was homeless around 7 months ago.<br>Got a job with my dad as a car mechanic.<br>Get a apartment.<br>Get paid nigger wage for complex job.<br>Can pay for apartment somewhat, get food stamps cause i work 52 ours a week on salary.<br>Let a friend stay here because he was going to be homeless like i was after marines.<br>Boss is a muslim who dosnt know his shit and when we dont make money means he dosnt have 10k cash, literally. <br>Only staying at current job for dad.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No. It wasn't really sad, just a combination of crazy and happy. It was great seeing Clancy again, and knowing he was alright.</br>  Went to one of those shitty class reunions. My crush from those days seemed like she has not changed a bit in the 5 years which have transpired.<br>We all assumed our old roles and acted like we were still in school where I was the silent retard with my eyes plastered on my crush's face.<br><br>Ty for reading, just had to get that said.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Ideally they should be exemplars. Their duty is to protect and serve.</br></br>  I'm a young person working on following my passion of writing. I write sometime (maybe an hour a day), not nearly enough. At the same time I am attempting to get into better shape (been fat all my life). What's happening right now is I'm going through the transitional stage that every adolescent grapples with, this comes along with the expected existential issues. I lean towards the Camus ideology that life is absurd, that life is not special, and life ends permanently. One hand this allows me to understand that I need to live each day passionately and for what I value. While at the same time it also takes an exhausting toll on my emotional state.<br>I work hard and push away anything (except video games, working on it) that doesn't help me accomplish what I want. To live with purpose and create beauty through art.<br>it'll get better</br></br>  <br>Pussy? I wouldn't say so. This girl has been torn by life and I will just feel terrible if i make it worse for her. I dont want to do that, but i dont want to ruin my life aswell.</br>  <br>ur a faget</br>  <br> life in india sucks. <br><br>good, fuck you habeeb.</br></br></br>  <br>I feel ya bro</br>  <br>You don't agree?! You know that you don't want to be in a relationship with her but you're too afraid to say it. How isn't that cowardly? You think being deceitful and worming your way out of the relationship is superior to being honest with her.</br>  <br>habeeb idf please go</br>  I miss her. Or i miss the love. Either way i miss it. I cant tell how i feel any more other than empty. I just wish i could feel anything again.  <br>OK bubba</br>  I've ruined every relationship I've ever had. I've fought with good friends and none of them talk to me anymore. I've ruined every relationship with girlfriends I've ever had. I've had 2 year relationships with gfs for the past 14 years or so now. I always fuck them up for no apparent reason. I always speak before I think, which is trouble. And I've always gotten out of control with my drinking. I want to move to the west coast and start all over, but I have to sell my friggin house first. Which I have to remodel somewhat first. Riding motorcycles has been an amazing outlet and I've met some really fantastic people doing that, but they're single serving friends. When I move west, I'll cut out the drinking completely and just smoke pot. Pot's always done me well. But I'll have to get a new job and will have to worry about background checks with my criminal history. Life sure as hell aint easy, but I'm doing my best.  <br>I never said anything about being deceitful. I want her to be happy. Most of the time im happy too. I just have a feeling i wont be able to keep it going for too long. Deffinately not as long as she expects. You think its easy being completely honest - good for you. I wont be able to live with myself after i've witnessed her reaction to my honesty.</br>  trap thread<br><br>unconvincing preferred</br></br>              Shit teir trap, reporting for booty again!<br><br>Kik: skittykid</br></br>    <br><br>moar booty pls</br></br>    <br>dont stop</br>  <br>would there be a name for this one?</br>  lol men<br><br>im glad to see some of you recognise that womyn are superior</br></br>    <br> trap <br> unconvincing <br>Pick one.

It is insanity that they should have to derive most of their income from tips.</br>  <br>Are we really going there? People in Seattle have a $15 an hour wage.<br><br>$15/hr= No tip.</br></br></br>  <br> Minimum wage needs to be raised to $15 and these waiters and waitresses should be paid minimum wage. It is insanity that they should have to derive most of their income from tips. <br>okay, then tipping culture must end.</br></br>  <br>They could always choose a different profession.<br><br>I don't get tips. What makes them such special snowflakes?</br></br></br>  <br>Agreed. Customers paying employees directly is bullshit.<br><br>Customer pays business pays employee.<br><br>Even when you're self employed, you don't just pocket the cash you're paid, so why the fuck should tips work that way?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I got stupid Japes who are forcing me to wait for my table if I have to complain, minimum wage sucks, but I don't like minimum wage, because stupid ass Japes do shit jobs and expect to get a paycheck.<br><br>Pic unrelated, call all people crazy for thinking they should get tips.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Waiters and waitresses are payed lower than minimum wage. But it's supposedly "all-right" because they "could" get tips. That's why all these people are bitching, because this is a profession that does not put bread on the table.</br>  <br>They should definitely be paid more, but that is between them and their employer, and if they don't like it they can leave.</br>  <br>Then don't go into that profession.<br>Done.</br></br>  <br>Exactly.</br>  <br> Waiters and waitresses are payed lower than minimum wage. <br>Substantiate that claim.<br><br>Any business doing such is in violation of long standing existing law. Changing the minimum wage will not fix such problems of not paying the minimum wage in the first place.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Waitresses get shit from their employer and the law sucks on them, and in capitalistic countries like fucking America, they don't care who they use for their gain. There is no equality.<br><br>Hence there's a reason why I live in European countries far east, cause I disapprove of Capitalist way on wages.<br><br>Wish people stop using others for their own gain and cheat them out.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Then what would you rather be? Capitalist or Socialist?</br></br>  <br>Your question is irrelevant to the challenge made.</br>  <br>Hope you enjoy cum in your food.</br>  <br><br>ooooh, someone watched Reservoir Dogs.</br></br>  I only tip strippers. And thats if she opens up her ass good, and gives me a smile.  <br>You actually think I would go to eat food at a place where all the employees are "special" enough to bitch about tips? Fuck that. I cook better food for cheaper at home, and I don't have to put up with whiny ass servers to boot...</br>  <br><br>Then tell me... What do you believe in when it comes to minimum wage if you were in that position?<br><br>Getting minimum wage as a waiter with no tips, or getting the same job with a good paycheck, based upon how well you work with everyone around you, to the best your ability?<br><br>There's your challenge, now answer it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, at least you're being consistent. The type of people who go out to eat/drink all the time and whine like they're in auschwitz about tipping are who fucking piss me off.<br><br>Don't go out and take a stand, hypocrites!</br></br></br>  I thought I would never agree with someone against tipping op but... I make 15 an hour for what I do (delivery on bicycle) and 15 is a fair wage... not to say that these people might need more for rent; but that's a completely different problem that can be taken up with the city council  <br>Then we have no waitors. That's the most retarded fucking argument.</br>  <br>tipping is and always has been about showing youre status. its showing you are a benevolent higher class who can afford to provide their servers with an extra amount of compensation. so, youre basically going around advertising to everyone, especially those you expect to provide you a service, that you are a classless hick, and thats fine, its your choice, just dont expect anyone to treat you any better than the low brow peice of shit you advertise that you are to the world. stay pleb poor fag, you choose to live this way.</br>   628669677 <br> There's your challenge, now answer it. <br>Not until I get an answer to the challenge to substantiate the following claim...<br><br> Waiters and waitresses are payed lower than minimum wage. </br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not illegal. If you're working a job with "expected tips" they can lower your hourly wage as far as they want, then if your tips+that lower wage don't meet minimum wage then they have to pay you the difference. So technically you have to get at least minimum but he's right, on most waitors paychecks, they earn about ≈$1.50 an hour</br>  Idiots still really think raising minimum wage will greatly increase the costs of consumer products?<br><br>Takes 30 seconds to look at minimum wage per state and look at the average menial price differences per retail product. An example would be increasing the minimum wage at Wal-Mart to over $10 would increase the costs of DVD's by 1 cent. Plenty other studies available for research, based on historical data.<br><br>Sorry, but this is not how "economics" works. Thanks for the "lesson" though.</br></br></br></br>  <br> let me google that for you you lazy faggot <br>http://www.dol.gov/whd/state/tipped<wbr>.htm</wbr></br></br>  <br> Substantiate that claim. <br><br> Section 3(m) of the FLSA permits an employer to take a tip credit toward its minimum wage obligation for tipped employees equal to the difference between the required cash wage (which must be at least $2.13) and the federal minimum wage. Thus, the maximum tip credit that an employer can currently claim under the FLSA is $5.12 per hour (the minimum wage of $7.25 minus the minimum required cash wage of $2.13).  <br><br>Check the department of labor's website if you don't believe me. It is legal to pay under minimum wage for food staff who can receive tips but no lower then $2.13 cents an hour. Much like delivery drivers don't have to be paid for the gas they use delivering. Employers should pay these expenses and tipping should cease.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But if so the whole tipping thing needs to end. At least for waiters and waitresses</br>  <br>So they're not truly earning less than minimum wage per hour worked; only in compensation classified as 'wages'.</br>  <br>see<br/></br>  <br><br> Waiters and waitresses are payed lower than minimum wage.&lt; <br><br>Say you get a job, working at some simple restaurant where you bring food out in your country (fuck I'm Eurofag, not Amerifag like you).<br><br>Look about those who have to work so hard, and the minimum the political government pays them is a dollar or a little over two to three per hour, and the only way to compensate their ass is to give them a fucking tip depending on their ability.<br><br>Tips compensates for the shitty country your little waitress friends live in, cause the government allows their employers to use them for their own gain.<br><br>Look at the other countries, hence I live in a fucking socialist country, if I was to work in that position, would I expect to make that much?<br><br>Not unless I do a shit job at being one, which is very easy.<br><br>There's your claimed evidence and political opinion, dumbass.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I agree, depending on the country you live in. Every country and law is different.</br></br>  Apparently the guy who received this card is all butthurt because he only gets $11 an hour now - it will take four years for the minimum to get to $15.<br>I realize that no one is going to get rich on $400 a week, but its enough that he shouldn't get extra for just serving a drink without spilling it.</br>  <br>No. They're earning at least minimum. If they got no tips their whole pay period, they're employer would have to pay them the minimum wage for whatever state/city theyre in.<br><br>There are some places that pay minimum AND tips like I know Ruby's pays servers the minimum wage and tips are just extra on top of it</br></br></br>  <br><br>There's the answer. Clear evidence, even for a eurofag who knows economics and lives in a country that doesn't run on capitalism.</br></br>  <br>Pretty much everywhere you go people are fucking with your food ~10% of the time anyways so why bother tipping ever, they alreaded farted on your meatloaf right before you put it in your mouth<br><br>  source: waiter on and off for 10 years </br></br></br>  <br> but its enough that he shouldn't get extra for just serving a drink without spilling it. <br>then he gets paid t<br>he same if he does spill it so he has no incentive not to "accidentally" spill it on you</br></br></br>  <br>Not my fucking problem, I have no need for waiters. I don't tip. Simple as that. If you're a waiter and you're not making as much money as you'd like, that is literally not my fucking problem. You're not in there working for my company, you're in there working for your employer. I don't tip the lady at the gas station for handing me my pack of cigarettes and change, I don't tip the guy that takes money for food at the grocery store. Most importantly, nobody tips me for doing my fucking job either, so to ask me (expect me) to fucking pay extra because servers are entitled little shits is especially insulting. Deal with it.</br>  <br>lol, if you dont tip then why the fuck would you go to a place where its common to tip. what a fucking retard.</br>  <br> There's your claimed evidence and political opinion, dumbass. <br>Are your jimmies rustled, dumbass?<br><br>At least for the state I'm in, WA of USA, they're not earning less than the minimum wage. You're response seems to admit this, even if it's happening in a way that you don't approve of.<br><br><br> If they got no tips their whole pay period, they're employer would have to pay them the minimum wage for whatever state/city theyre in. <br>Yep.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Psssst - guess what, you'll be paying more for your mcdoubles if that happens.<br>Why?<br>Costs more for employees, so guess who covered the pay increase. You.<br>How?<br>Food costs (and everything else) increases so not only do they cover payroll but they keep the same a out of profit for the business.<br>Oh, and it won't be just a little increase - every fucking thing will go up because of that mandatory minimum wage.<br>So - since you're now making more, you have more right?<br>No - your cost of living has increased as well so you are no better off than before, and the people who were making $15 an hour now are doing much worse off now.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>By federal law, any tipped employee who does not make enough in tips each week to equate to federal minimum wage has to have the difference made up by the employer.<br>Furthermore, tipped employees are suppose to keep a record of their tips and report it to their employer for proper taxation to the IRS and for unemployment purposes.</br></br>  Let's increase the minimum wage to soak up the excess dollars pumped into the economy by "quantitative easing". This will control the way inflation comes on and placate the plebs who don't understand the core problem we have with just printing dollars and the shell game of the Treasury buying its own bonds.  When I do tip, I try to tip in cash. When I do, I tell the server to pocket the cash and tell the Feds that I'm a bad tipper. But if food prices go up on me because of the minimum wage shenanigans, I won't be doing that anymore.  <br><br>underrated post.</br></br>  <br>Haha waiters are tax dodgers. The best part is they want their tip percentage based off your bill, sales tax included.</br>  <br>Well, how about the incentive of not getting fired?</br>  <br>Agreed, but servers who can't consistantly make more than the min wage do not end up being employed for long. And most tipped employees don't claim all of their tips on their taxes, why would they?<br><br>If servers in Seattle are making 15$ /hr I wouldn't tip there either.</br></br></br>  <br>Tipped employees automatically have 15% of their reported wages count as untaxed wages - that means it is subjected to a special tax that covers the costs that the employer would have covered for Medicare and social security plus the employees cost for those as well.<br>So, it's best off in the long run if tipped employees report all their tips so employers can properly report and pay their share of social security and Medicare taxation.</br></br>  <br>Minimum wage is not intended to sustain a person for life. It's meant to give unskilled laborers a place to start (teenagers in highschool) or a supplemental income for those who need it (elderly on fixed income still capable of light physical labor).<br><br>Raising the minimum wage as a means of increasing your income (giving yourself a raise) impacts the whole economy and forces it to change around an artificially altered low end. All that raising the minimum wage does is increase the costs for everyone else forcing employers to drive up the prices they charge thus leading the rest of the economy to either wither or artificially raise all other wages. In the end the minimum wage will still provide a wage that is incapable of increasing a person's wealth</br></br></br>  <br>And they pay for it in the long run - see  as to why.</br>  <br>See  as to why they should report their tips.</br>    Never tipped, never will, never have to.  <br>Ah I see, thanks</br>  <br>This</br>  <br> It's meant to give unskilled laborers a place to start (teenagers in highschool) <br>What exactly makes you think this is a fact?</br></br>  <br>Except for he's right.<br>A single person cannot support themselves on 40 hours a week working minimum wage anywhere in the country according to HUD. <br>The cheapest state to live in requires 67 hours a week at minimum wage to afford a nominal apartment and cover weekly living expenses.</br></br></br>  <br>because its known you don't stay at mcdonalds for life frying fries expecting to have a nice life and retirement, well maybe you do nigger</br>  <br>Economically braindead "I've got mine" conservatrash faggot detected.<br><br>Would throw bricks at until squishy red puddle is achieved.</br></br></br>  <br>Seeing you at your McJob with that sexy hair net nigger.<br><br>Mother fucker are you saying a burger flipper should have wage parity with Sous Chef?</br></br></br>  <br>Dumbass libtard "actor"/waiter detected.<br>Would laugh at and give wedgies too until he left crying home to momma - just like in school.</br></br>  <br>Considering that the reason modern tipping culture exists is because wait staff weren't making a living wage I'd say, no.

It's meant to be tied to cost of living by reflecting a value roughly equal to that of Inflation. Minimum wage is currently about 3.5x lower than inflation has increased (remained the same as Inflation devalued the dollar 3.5 times over time). So PROPER, mathematically determined minimum wage should be approximately $21.75. That is, so long as the average value/cost as percentage of earnings that staples and rent accrue is about the same (which it is).</br></br></br></br>  I think the Tampa Bay Buccaneers should be paid the same as the New England Patriots.

Unless it's a Chilli's where the shit is heat and serve. Then I'll tip at the bar.</br>  <br>Koptek</br>  <br>No, it's about inflation actually, you fucking retard. We all know $15 is too much, but $7.25 isn't enough unless you're in high school.</br>  <br>this. you're all dumb niggers if you believe waiters/waitresses are actually earning minimum wage.</br>  I make about 9 dollars and cannot accept tips at my starbucks location. Of course I can't live on my own, but that is why I live with the person I love. I wish I made 10 dollars an hour and I would be happier. This is coming from a white male with a BA and half of a BS. I wish I could complete my B, but I can only support myself. I don't think the minimum wage should be increased to 15 dollars because I would have to pay more money to survive. Please dont hate me.  Ok. Not touching the minimum wage, I wanna talk about tipping.<br><br>As far as I know, if you are paid the federal minimum tipped wage, if you don't get to minimum wage with tips, employer must cover the difference. So tip or not, the employee will make minwage. I do tip in restaurants, where they are most likely getting that wage.<br><br>Now what I think is bullshit is places like Starbucks and others with their tip bucket. Taxis are others that expect tip. Last time I flew I was in the Southwest counter to check in my luggages and it says tipping is encouraged. We are heading to a time where everybody will expect a fucking tip!</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, that's how much it was worth before inflation, why should that price change? You're saying they should get less money for the same service.</br>    <br>In first world countries tipping is only practiced when the service has merited it.</br>  <br>Just wanted to add an anecdotal fact.<br>Most intelligent adolescents are taught by the most liberal of liberals, teachers. Therefore, they know no better than to guzzle that liberal semen. So you wind up with a bunch of smart kids with their heads up their asses.</br></br>  <br> not caring <br> still responding <br>that means you care cuck.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Obviously good will toward others. Probably thankful to even have old age. Sees waiters as brand new kids and knows from years of life that it's a damn shame to have to deal with the public as a waiter/waitress.<br><br>This pussified generation better reflect on how shit is as comfortable as it is. It wasn't you little pussified generation entitled faggots that set this up. You think you deserve to have fiber optic world wide access to argue about feminist cunts and faggot shit?<br><br> up hill, both ways, in the snow <br><br> get off my lawn </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This right here. As the minimum wage gets raised, there will come a point where it is no longer profitable NOT to replace them with automated systems. One way or another, the Real World is not going to be cheated - NO ONE is going to pay you $15 to flip burgers for long.</br>  <br><br>Again "assumed worth" is not the goal of Minimum Wage. It seems like a lot of money because during an influential time in your life, it once was. The important thing in terms of the health of the economy that minimum wage is meant to accomplish is to be the living wage for staples and a meager single-person rent/expenses support. When was the last time you heard the FMW referred to as the "Living Wage"? It's been some time, hasn't it? That's because the scumbag hypercapitalists know it's not an amount people can survive on for any length of time anymore.<br><br>McJobs are no longer held as supplementary income for teenagers. They're lifelong positions vied for by poor, uneducated workers. Before, they could pay what they wanted because very few of the kids who worked there had to use the money to SUPPORT THEMSELVES. That has changed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>McDonalds has the perfect solution to socialistfags like you.<br><br>Kiosks replace counter help. They don't require vacations or benefits.<br><br>And go back to school, Keynes, your theories don't work in the real world.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You got me. Damn your smoother than a niggers forehead</br>  <br>My first job was in fast food and i've stuck around for a few years so I make $9.00/hr as a manager and am barely able to support my family. I've had job offers for better jobs, I just haven't taken any yet. I want to make sure my next job is something I'll enjoy. If I were making minimum wage though, there's no fucking way we could stay afloat. We can accept tips though, that's bullshit man.</br>  This thread is dildos.  <br>You don't tip? That's okay. However, if you feel morally obligated not to tip, then inform your server as soon as you are seated. Otherwise, they're working harder under the expectation that they'll be getting a tip for excellent service, as opposed to the minimum level of service required for minimum wage. Or you could just, you know, not eat out.<br><br>I start off at a place with a number in mind depending on the average price of the meal--usually anywhere between $20 on the high end and $10 on the low end. If the service is excellent, they get the full tip amount. Every time they fuck up, every time it takes more than five minutes for the server to notice the glasses at my table are more than half empty, I start deducting from that maximum.<br><br>There is a secret to always getting fantastic service, however--it works in restaurants you frequent often enough for them to know your face and bars with the same stipulation. Start with a high tip, ridiculously high, minimum $30. If they've been great at the end of the night, tell the server/bartender so and give them that massive tip. Next time you come in, try to get the same person. They'll remember the last time. This time, give them slightly less than last time by 25% to 30%. They'll wonder what they did wrong and try harder next time and every time after that.<br><br>But if you don't tip, and you don't tell your server, bartender, or otherwise first, then you're a piece of shit taking advantage of someone in a bad situation and fuck your goddamn morals because you shouldn't support the establishment at all if you're opposed to the idea of tipping.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm saying they should get paid the fair market value. If it's going to cost me $21.75 to get my shoes shined, I'm going to do it myself. Or start marketing automated machines on street corners that will do it for half the price.<br><br>Increasing his pay to beyond what the market will pay will run him out of a job.</br></br></br>  <br> Otherwise, they're working harder under the expectation that they'll be getting a tip <br><br>Thats the point</br></br></br>  <br> not understanding the use of an apostrophe can represent either a contraction or claiming <br> not knowing what a run-on sentence is <br><br>Typical /b/tard argument.
