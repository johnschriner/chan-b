FB fap thread  who do you want to see more of?  <br>holy shit moar</br>    Apparently the Chinese government is really butthurt over this simple sex tape. Already have 5 arrested.<br><br>WTF?</br></br>  <br>sauce?</br>  <br>Porn is illegal in China. It's kinda like Kinder Surprise in the USA... stupid laws to put more people in jail so they can work for corporations for free.</br>  Forgot sauce<br>http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=f04_<wbr>1437310046&amp;use_old_player=0</wbr></br>  "Call me husband"<br>  Chinese sexy talk </br>  <br> Porn is illegal in China <br><br>Then may we hope that they never conquer the planet.</br></br></br>  Jebus, looks like hanging out at that store is now a great place to meet grils!  <br> Already have 5 arrested. <br>Man, even chinese people think chinese people look chinese people.</br></br>  <br>who'd they arrest the couple or the people who distributed it?<br><br>What's the history of that law?</br></br></br>  <br>kek pao chicken.</br>  <br>Yeah, both were arrested. The store and its parent company were (are?) freaking out hoping they don't get implicated.</br>  <br><br>I am fucking happy to see that the Chinese government work in order to erase this occidental decandency.<br>I mean you do not have the right to have sex in a fucking public place where there are god damn children and families<br><br>White governments are dominated by women who work to apply degeneracy and they are encouraged to be sluts and to spred their whorish behaviour whereas the Chinese are fucking shitting on these bitches and apply the strict fucking rules</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> What's the history of that law? <br><br>They believe that porn destroys the morals of men and women and harms marriage.</br></br></br>  go chinese pipo, go chinese peepo, go!  I wonder if when you fuck a chineese FOB, are you horny again in two hours?   this again   <br>1/10 troll but if the punishment should fit the crime, what do you recommend?</br>  <br>You think that deserves a 1? <br><br>Truly is summer in here.</br></br></br>  <br>kinder eggs aren't illegal in the USA you retard</br>  <br>I know but shouldn't everyone deserve some sort of award?<br> special snowflakes everywhere! </br></br>  <br><br>Dude i'm not trolling, i mean look at the Alexis Frulling, a white whore so proud to show to the world that she had a threesome in order to have tickets for a festival in Canada, she declared that she doesn't give a fuck to be used a sex toy and is proud to be do whatever she wants as a woman. Look at her instagram and you'll be convinced that the white woman have gone way too far.<br><br>The Chinese consider this kind of tapes as a shame and punish these infringements.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes they are</br>  <br>Saw the vid, it wasnt even porn by my standards</br>  <br><br><br> kinder eggs aren't illegal in the USA you retard <br><br>They aren't illegal; but they can't sell ones with toys inside in case some retarded kid crams the whole thing in their mouth and chokes to death.<br><br>That's natural selection in action if you ask me; but lawyers have made a business out of protecting stupid people from the consequences of their stupidity.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They are, its a $2500 fine if you're caught importing them. (Choking hazard in candy.) <br>Stupid, but you know, america.</br></br>  <br>I doubt it was porn by anyone on /b/s standards</br>  <br>I try to smuggle them in non-stop from Canada and customs always seizes them. They are illegal. So is fresh bamboo.</br>  <br>Never got a fine. It's probably for large quantities only, not just 2.</br>  <br>The ones with the toy in them are completely illegal in the U.S. because American kids will shove any piece of food in their mouth without thinking twice.</br>  <br>timetofap.jpg</br>  <br> fresh bamboo <br>euphemism for the sex traffic of Chinese minors</br></br>  <br>Im just repeating what i've read, but as someone else posted you will have them seized.</br>  <br>If you want to get kids in for sex traffic, all you need is money and it's easier than importing drugs.</br>  <br><br>As an American I'm far more perturbed by the illegality of non pasteurized cheese.</br></br>  <br><br>The Chineese consider human rights a shame and punish those infringements too.<br><br>Alexis Frulling is like an ignorance test for the masses. If you have a problem with her you're probably a fucking hypocrite. You want women to fuck you but no one else and in no way that you can't appreciate. <br><br>The problem isn't Alexis Frulling, the problem is people like you. You'd rather see people treated like inhuman cattle in the human-rights-abuse-capital of the fucking world than see a woman do what she wants.<br><br>Still not convinced you're an asshole? Ask yourself this: where's your righteous indignation about the two dudes she fucked? Morally they are just as corrupt as she is but nobody is upset about that. That's where the problem is, in the double standard. And that's what makes you an asshole.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> women act like whores <br> get applauded <br> man tried to pay for sex <br> thrown in jail and life ruined <br><br>Yeah no. The hypocrites aren't the men in this global scheme of bullshit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tell us more!</br>  <br>You made sincerely laugh, you are the typical emasculated white individual like in Sweden. Not being offended to see women having less and less moral values.<br><br>But also, you made me sick, i prefer people to be punished like the Chinese did with these two lovers, and a woman do not have to accept to appear as a naked on a video.<br><br>I agree with you that men could be corrupt but the women don't say no and profit from having a whorish behavior, in married couples, women are more likely to cheat on their husbands. So yeah white women are more corrupt, and should be more restricted in their acts <br><br>Deal with it</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>the shittiest part is when she has kids or finally locks down some cock sucking cuck, she'll blame it on society or some other bullshit and get away with it. what pisses me off is the lack of accountability woman have of themselves and then blame men with untrue accusations of how there's no equality. <br><br>At least some countries have women who can actually count how many partners they've had on their hands</br></br></br></br>  <br>Found the feminist.</br>  it's because asian cultures are shit tier. the only thing they're good for is slave labor.    <br>MY SIDES THEY ARE LEAVING<br><br>KEK</br></br></br>  <br><br> a female professor fucks one of her students &gt;probably raises the kids grades <br>no one gives two shits<br><br> male professor does same thing (with female) <br> gets national attention <br> gets fired <br> life ruined  <br><br>kill yourself and your double standards</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i lived in china for a while and had a shop. while porn is illegal, 'massage parlors' are perfectly fine.<br> <br> have store with gf in china <br> near our store there's a 'feet massage' shop aka brothel  <br> one night having a ciggy outside store <br> see a whole bunch of cops and other dudes with batons walking towards the brothel <br> they all file in <br> half an hour later they leave <br> some were still zipping their pants on their way out <br> great cops <br><br>shop was never shut down</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  As someone who has been to China, here's something a lot of you don't understand.<br><br>The Government regulates everything and I do mean everything.

I never cheated on her, she actually cheated on me with this fucking pig. And has since accused me of rape because she said the night I asked her out she was drunk. Not really much of a leg to stand on, and I can represent myself I court, but that still just takes up time I could be doing my job that I always loved more then that whore. The only reason I'm miserable is because she is doing everything in her power to fucking discredit and ruin my work as well as life. I'd like to think I fucking radiat game.

I got a nice house a nice car and a nice truck and even if the land ran out i have enough to cut back to a decent house in the burbs and retire. Honestly at my age i should be fucking happy but nothing the docs give me helps. All medicine either makes me a zombie on autopilot which just means i go through the motions midlessly while my depression just gets worse in the back of my head or they give me severely negative side effects like reduced bone density or crippling migraines.

Life's pretty mundane most of the time as a poor student but gotta enjoy the small things in life.</br></br></br>   21 <br>  like $13k/year ish <br> complacent  <br>still recovering from a couple years of really stupid, juvenile criminal behavior so court gets most of my money for the next year or so</br></br></br>   23 <br> 0$ unemployed <br> $70k debt <br> girlfriend pays for everything <br> i'd say i'm relatively content but ask me again in a few months when i have to start paying my loans off, </br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck that shit yo. Don't let the fucking man take your money. Fuck some shit up, make some money off the books if you know what i mean bro</br>  <br>Ok OP how have you not thought of this<br>You are rich<br> implying youre not a lying faggot <br>their are life coaches, social coaches, professionals that teach people social skills fucking find someone and hire them</br></br></br></br>  <br>Haha fair enough man, sounds like you got a plan. <br><br>Might be worth staying out there. I'm from Boston so I'm one of those annoying people who ignores everything in the middle of the country. <br><br>It's mainly because I'm jealous of the home prices. My 3 bedroom single family outside of Boston proper still went for half a million. It's nothing amazing either. Updated and nice enough, but it wouldn't make you blink. Then I look at some bumfuck town in middle America and fucking gorgeous mansions are going for 200k. makes me furious. <br><br>the fuck am I going on about...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How tf you make two mil a year as a fucking ortho in a city of 5000 people. Do you live in fucking England anon, where everyone's teeth look like a marble chess board that someone dropped off a cliff and then set up the pieces for a game</br>  <br>See<br/></br>  <br>I think I've heard of this before, I think I understand the core of what you are saying. It is pretty interesting, what really gets me is the possibility of developing AI to the point where there is an identifiable consciousness. I bet it is not going to be clear cut, it is gonna be vaguer like a continuum.<br><br>My skill is definitely something logical, I am naturally inclined in that direction but I do have some social skills I manage to muster on occasion. I think I should be in some lower tier STEM job that is mostly logical but I can do some social stuff that is probably higher than your skills.<br>What I fear is that I know I'm not that smart like 115 IQ tops or something, and I worry about struggling and failing if I switch back to Comp. Sci. Anyways I am an accounting major right now with a year left and feel like I wasted so much time, effort, and financial aid. But I definitely think I should switch.<br><br>Thank you for talking to me. Really appreciate it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   27 <br> 70k <br> 7/10 <br><br>I have mostly emo existential woes though, and no current gf I guess.</br></br></br></br>   28 <br> 70000 <br> DEVGRU <br> Could not imagine living any other life </br></br></br>   21 <br> ~$19000 <br> Unhappy </br></br>  <br>oh and i should add that i have a fucking massive crater in my leg that looks horrendous(can post pics if interest), decently bad acne (which, by the way, will the scarring and shit disperse after awhile?), i have gynecomastia and misophonia. also cannot eat any nuts because i'll asphyxiate. fuck man.</br>  <br>inb4themindsi<br>inb4strangeloop</br></br>  <br>Different anon same situation. That doesn't stop the pain man. I've tried all that and lived what most would consider exciting. Depression isn't sadness. Its just the inability to feel happy and all the stress and emotional fallout that comes with it. Sadness is a side effect not the cause. Adrenaline rushed don't do anything cause all it feels like is the actual adrenaline but no emotional rush with it which is actually pretty stressful.</br>  <br>hah.. senior level IT. I'm a bit overpaid tbh but they didn't want me to leave. Job market is nuts out here lately. I get 2-15 recruiters sending me jobs every week. . Makes it easy to feel secure and not worry about pleasing bosses and stuff. I just make it about the work and set a precedent that I'm not here to punch clocks. Everyone just accepted it. I'm not some badass so I don't mean it to come off like that... just reasonably skilled and extremely easy to get along with... seems to have paid off</br>  <br>$100 for a decent looking stripper whore. You don't want to fall in love with your first fuck.</br>  <br>I bought my 5 bedroom 6.5 bath for that</br>  <br> will the scarring and shit disperse after awhile? <br>Yes, if you take steps to help it<br>sucks on the gynecomastia, hormones then surgery<br>latex allergy + asthma, know your pain man.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Haha son of a bitch. well you should have at least witnessed my trips if you were gonna rub it in my face.</br>  <br>I would like my first time to be sentimental. I would rather stay a virgin than have meaningless sex with a whore.</br>   28 <br> $65,000 <br> not happy but not sad <br><br>never been a materialistic guy. I have enough to get by and am able to go crazy every once in a while.<br><br>I'm slowly but surely getting my shit together after a really important relationship ending and fucking me up mentally. self worth was nonexistent. doing better now. <br><br>one day at a time, my friends. one day at a time...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you won't think that in a couple of years</br>    <br>It's a city in northern Ontario with mostly aboriginal people. They get almost everything here paid off for them, so they don't care much about getting all sorts of crowns and partials. 5k people distributed among 3 dentistry businesses in the whole city still gives our 8 employees a lot of work, given that none of us are in every day.</br>  <br>Maybe realestate isn't the best over in the east though. It's fucking huge out here. I just fucking hate it here because in the winter I work from home and shovel dickloads of snow off my rear wheel drive car while driving a truck I hate but any other truck is fucking horrendous (ford raptor). And I need to get out of this fucking redneck town. I'm buying a fucking fiat just to prove how much I hate trucks.<br> Eco fag alert </br></br>    <br>I've gone 28 years without my opinion chasing, I doubt it.</br>   18 <br> $14 an hr for one job, $4 plus tips for another <br> sad <br>I have friends and get laid and shit, just nothing seems to make me happy.</br></br></br>  <br>Your story sounds like a coming-of-age story, if people came of age at 25.<br><br>I'd write a book or something if I were you.</br></br></br>   23 <br> 0 <br> pretty content <br><br>Hoping to start working soon, I'm living at home so I'll be saving every penny until I find some real estate that I'm interested in.</br></br></br></br>  <br>nah you wouldn't. this is a common misconception of what sex actually is that almost all virgins think. your first time will probably be embarrassing for you. sex is not as big of a deal as it has become since it's been building up for every day that passes where you feel 'it should have happened by now'. <br><br>do the escort thing. most of them are actually very sweet to nice guys because they deal with so many gross pieces of shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, because emotions make you gay.</br>  <br>It's not about the sex though. I can get off by just jacking off; I don't need sexual release, I need to connect with someone.</br>     20 <br> unpaid worker for family's landscaping business (my father and I are the only two people that make up the business) <br> shit's rough, but I'm still mostly happy <br><br>For anyone who wants to know: <br><br>I have been unpaid for the past two years because we struggle to make rent and basic bills every month. My dad used to have a great job, but was laid off right before the company tanked during the financial crisis. We were able to survive off of savings, college funds, and unemployment for a few years, during which time my dad kept looking, and looking, and looking for a new job, with no luck anywhere. Finally, our house was foreclosed on, and we were kicked out. We moved into a much smaller house that we somehow managed to find for cheaper rent than any of the other apartment complexes around us. That's when we started this business, and I've been doing this for two years with no pay, because they simply can't afford to. I've missed out on college and other opportunities just so we can stay afloat.<br><br>And you know what? I don't mind. It's been a humbling experience, to say the least. Through the foreclosed house, repo'd cars, and having to sell a large number of our possessions, I've learned to appreciate what little I have left. <br><br>I recently just started a music production business out of my room. Thankfully, I have quite a lot of equipment that I've found for very cheap from pawn shops over the years (MOST of which I got before our finances went south), most of which I've refurbished myself. I've only taken in a couple of clients so far, but it's good to finally get a start on the dream I'm pursuing. I'll be using the money I make from that to go to college...better late than never.<br><br>I feel alright about the whole experience, through thick and thin, and it's helped me grow immensely as a person.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>so much this. my first time was with my friends sister who is not attractive and i don't like at 4am while drunk as fuck. do not regret it to this day.</br>   21 <br> 13000 a year <br> fucking misrable  <br> only person I love is my daughter <br> she'll hate me eventually because I fail as a provider <br>  I just want to make her happy /b/ </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>if you're counting on someone to get you to 10/10, you've already failed.</br>  <br>Not to mention I don't just fix teeth. I myself do repairs of basically the entire face. We get a ton of car accident and especially motorcycle accident patients in here.</br>   33 <br> $0 <br>  30k debt <br><br>finishing university on august 10th, have to move out of residence by aug 24th. have $900 in my bank account. sometime between now and aug 24th I need to get a job and earn at least another $500-600 to be able to put first+last down on a shitty apartment to move into by the 24th. if I can't find a job, I'll have to move home temporarily to the middle of bumfuck nowhere, which will be an issue since there is no transportation there and I don't have a car. im fucked /b/</br></br></br></br>   20 <br> Move bricks <br> ~$750k <br> happy as fuck </br></br></br>  <br>Get a fucking job nathan</br>    <br>Do you have a chemical imbalance?<br>Have you ever taken pure Molly or tried LSD?<br>British scientist are have success in trials with curing depression in terminally ill cancer patients using those drugs.</br></br></br>  <br>easy to get a girl. just find someone mildly attractive. lower your standards bruh</br>  <br>nigga earning 260k a year you can buy me as your companion<br><br> 21 <br> no job <br>  8/10 in happiness scale </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah but sex isn't going to be about that by itself anyways. You just need to become familiar with the flow of it outside of pornography. <br><br>You want a friend, a date, and when that happens (I'm sure it will anon) you'll probably not want to have the awkward strange 'I'm a virgin' talk then stumble through some awful first attempt. You want to be light hearted and confident when it's time to bed this chick you 'connected with'. Or at least one of those two.<br><br>Trust me on this. Sex is not connection, it's sex. Get the mechanics down.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I get what you are saying but I'm guessing that you feel anxious in social situations. By doing this you would become acclimated to more intimate situations that trying with a real girl wouldn't be as intimidating.<br><br>Hell, if I was in your situation I would just pay girls to spend time with me, practice socializing with them until I get use to it.</br></br></br>  <br>Just realized that I said "most of which" two times in a row. I'm tired, didn't catch that haha.</br>  <br>26<br>$25,000<br><br>graduated in 07 before the economy crashed, did 4 years in the army, currently on the gi bill and working part time and barely being able to support my wife and baby. shitsucks/fucking miserable/fuck the USA</br></br></br></br>   24 <br> ~$100,000 <br> 5/10 </br></br>  <br> visited North Korea last September for their independence day. <br>Where you from faggot ?</br></br>    <br>Honestly, most of the time sex is physical, even with someone you have a connection with. People get use to each other and the sex you had at first that was really intimate and you felt a connection goes away fast.<br> tldr sex is physical, don't put it on a pedastal </br></br>   20 <br> 0 <br> very content </br></br>  <br>Yes. Its a serotonin imbalance. I've taken SSRI's that were supposed to be miracle cures that just gave me crippling headaches or made it so my bones snapped lifting 40lbs. I've taken molly, lsd, cocaine, and heroine. All just made me twitchy and anxious and molly made me emotional but no actual good feelings.</br>  <br>I'm American. Americans are allowed, even encouraged to visit, you just gotta fly to China first.</br>  23<br>41k<br>8/10</br></br>  <br>This just breaks my heart anon. Best of luck to you moving forward.</br>  <br>I bet you like broing down wit yo boys and drinkin some goose and mixers too fgt</br>  <br>Move out here m8. Nice scenery. Virtually no people. No one yelling "Eh I'm walking here". Hope you don't mind working in fucking coal mines/ oilfield unless you have a special skill Doctor/lawyer/realestate agent. Oilfeild doesn't pay bad though, justdepends on the gas prices. But it's fucking shit teir hours 3 weeks away from all friends and family. Then 3 weeks being a poorfag sitting around with your thumb up your ass. And coal mines are fucking disgusting piles of trash that only the extremely desperate should ever even consider doing 14-16 hours days with no brakes. Also if you want any quality food you have to either<br> cook it <br> search around downtown until you find a not shit tier place, which is like finding a grain of rice in a swimming pool of raisens. </br></br></br>  <br>How do you make that kind of bank with no social skills?</br>  <br>yea didn't lurk first my bad</br>  <br>It does, faggot. It's scientifically proven.</br>  <br>I work in a research lab. I study knowledge representation in robots.</br>  <br>Fair enough. Everyone here just clogs all business with realestate and fucking oilfield bs, the ortho offices we do have are atrocious and I would rather put a crown in myself with a toothpick and an icepick then even ask them for a price</br>  <br> 25 <br> 20k <br> Shit </br></br></br>  <br><br>Holy shit.<br><br>We are extremely similar. My salary this year is $150k, + a "liquidity event" for my stock options worth $300k (had the fun experience of depositing that cheque at a bank). So I should end up around $350k pretax for the year.<br><br>I'm in my late twenties, and a virgin. Looking at me, maybe you'd guess. I'm a little fat, shorter than average. <br><br>I think I'm gay, I don't know. Maybe the porn has just fucked my mind up. I won't admit anything to myself. Well, other than there's no way in hell I'll ever be with anyone.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How long until I can stick my consciousness in a robot?<br>If that is too much, how long till we have AI comparable to like a dolphin.</br></br>   18 <br> unpredictable, $200 a month if i'm lucky <br> not miserable, but uncertain, anxious, overwhelmed, and pressured by the adult world. </br></br>  <br>Never.</br>  <br>We are a long way from putting your consciousness in a robot. What do you mean by "comparable" to a dolphin? Comparable in what way?</br>  <br>An AI that is capable of functioning at a level just below people. Maybe a level of a person with mild retardation.</br>  <br>Sex was the most disappointing thing I ever did, i was 23 so you know late at it, but when it happened with a gf i liked i thought, oh is that it, what's the big fuss.<br><br>Its fun (later gf's were better too) but its not the fucking huge deal everyone makes it out to be.</br></br></br>  <br> 21 <br> 0 <br> numb </br></br></br>  <br>It doesn't really make sense to say "functioning at a level below people". Functioning in what way? Computer vision? Unsupervised learning? Adaptability? Knowledge representation?</br>  <br>Considering OP is such a social retard why is he trying to make robots like him, gonna end up with stuttering fedora wearing crying robot engineer robots.</br>  Rolling<br> am nigger </br>  <br>I assumed functioning meant all of things at once. It is what we do so I'd like an AI at that level.</br>  <br>An AI capable of doing everything a human can do is several decades away, if ever. We are no where close to it unfortunately.</br>  <br>23k a year?<br>I make 70k a year at 22 years old.. Running a forklift..</br></br>  <br><br>what do you think of memristors? quantum computing? also, i'm 32 and have been single for several years, after a 6-7 year relationship. could have dated some but chose not to. i am quite happy, mainly from spiritual practice / meditation. i work for myself and mostly do consulting / programming / security auditing type work in itsec. my income varies, but sometimes i take very little work just so i have a lot of time off to hike, cycle, and just enjoy nature and travelling. i don't make a ton but i have my own place, own car, and some nice stuff.<br><br>i think to find a truly healthy companionship, you first have to figure out how to be happy by yourself / being single. relationships that are based around dependency / co-dependency just don't work out. so, find your happiness within yourself, and then girls will naturally pick up on that, and the confidence that comes from it. otherwise, it's hard not to come off as desperate or depressed. i would recommend meditation / spiritual practice ( i practice buddhist meditation ).<br><br>whatever your "hobbies" are.. find one where you have more opportunity to socialize with girls. meditation and spiritual practice can really help with social issues. gl op</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you believe you'll ever not be depressed, get a gf, have sex?</br>  You wanna be with a dude? I may not be gay but I'm on 4chan so obviously I'm a faggot. Hit me up OP, we'll be hella gay.    mfw every neckbeard on here makes 150k+ a year  <br> mfw they are actually pumping my gas </br>  <br>I can see why you run a forklift and don't work with numbers.</br>  <br>So compare it to the intelligence of an currently living organism.

It's a Taurus 617; 357. 7 round capacity. $430-ish<br><br>Any gun owners on here want to weigh in?</br></br></br></br>  It's a brazilian piece of shit. Enjoy your paperweight in under a hundred rounds.  <br>SW500 or don't bother</br>  Decent reliable home protector. I have the .38 snub in my night stand. Like the idea of no jam and no pump, just pull...  <br>Ever heard of /k/?</br>  <br>If you're going for taurus get a raging judge. fires .410, .45, and 12 gauge buckshot. Honestly it shouldn't even be legal considering it's basically a revolving sawed off shotgun.</br>  <br>garbage m8, just get a good old glock, they work all the time and have a high cartridge count,</br>  Tek9 or mac10 ftw  <br><br>This. There are only a handful of gun brands you don't want, and Taurus is #1 on that list.</br></br>  <br>Who buys a snub revolver for 500+ rounds? That's just ignorant and not what it's used for</br>  <br>.410 and 45 long colt. NOT 12 gauge you gaylord.</br>  <br>gtfo tec9 is garbage and mac 10? no one uses subs to inaccurate, go back to csgo m9</br>  <br>There is no 4chan only b</br>  <br>no way, they're great, almost as good as a Mac11 (also known as a BigMac)</br>  <br>Taurus makes decent revolvers, but you should really think about looking at Colt, S&amp;W, or Ruger first, especially if you're thinking higher caliber. An extra hundred dollars or so will get you a nice piece that you can give your son one day. A Taurus will need a new barrel after about 1000 rnds.</br>  <br>Enjoy your jam when they kick in the door. A POS revolver is better than any clipped gun in that situation.</br>  Secret Thread: ITT we post secrets that we wouldn't dare tell anyone. If you get TRIPS you have to tell the person you would be most shamed to spill your guts to.  <br>I sometimes eat my own semen cuz I'm too lazy to clean.</br>  I let my babysitters bf finger me in the ass for ice-cream on more than 1 occasion...  <br>you're a nigger</br>  <br>still never told anyone</br>  <br> mfw this happened to me too (except it was the babysitter) <br> mfw no face </br></br>  <br>f or m sitter?</br>  I sent my ex-grillfriends nudes and ass gaping pics to her mum and they're a very christian family.<br><br>lol</br></br>  At my work there was a notorious lunch stealer from the fridge. I added a healthy squirt of semen to a homemade salad dressing and added to a salad and left it in a carryout container in the fridge for a week.<br><br>On Thursday the container disappeared. They only have themselves to blame.</br></br>  <br><br>long time ago paid my niece to give me head. later she offered to do it again. It was fun while it lasted never got to fuck her.</br></br>  <br>Did you ever give the head back? Ever get any tail?</br>  I once had this very close friend she was a chick, very fucking hot, had 2 sisters and all hot as fuck as well as her mum, hot as FUCK. So this whole family is hot and her dad died when she was like 3, they all went to church this sunday morning and asked if it was okay If I stayed at their place If I didn't want to go (slept over saturday night) I wake up after they've left, go through all their panties sniffing, fapping, licking, end up cumming while half-dressed in the mums clothes, I cum a HUGE amount, scoop it up and smear it into their ice cream. <br><br>Jesus christ I'm an animal, no one knows this</br></br>  <br>At recess. older graders wanted me to play a new game. Proud to have cool friends. Next 3 days getting buttfucked in the handball courts by 5-6 at a time. Ass sore on the buss. start teasing me for being gay.. just wanted friends</br>  <br>Good. Fuck the cocksuckers that steal lunches.</br>  <br>Nah never happen it was just her giving me a few blowjob.</br>  I'm addicted to and obsessed with raping drunk women from the bar. <br><br>The scariest moment I had was when I drug a girl behind a dumpster and she started swinging on me and tried to reach for something in her purse. I put her in a rear naked choke hold and choked her as hard as I could until she went unconscious and then I raped her. She wasn't there in the morning so I assume she was alright.<br><br>I message random women on the internet asking them to wrestle or hop into a body of water and try to drown each other. I can't stop. All I want to do is rape and drown women.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Too great.</br>  i think jet fuel can melt steel beams.  <br>How old was she?</br>  <br>No. I never got to, it was never brought up.</br>  I sniffed my step sisters feet a weeks ago when she was sleeping on the couch  <br>:\</br>  <br>i humped both my dog and cat when i was young</br>  I once convinced my 8 year old nephew to put on a pair of granny panties (over his regular clothes) and walk out into our driveway and ask a worker who was siding our detached garage if they were "burning hot and needed to cool down" while holding a glass of ice water.<br><br>I did record the whole thing from a window. I'm sort of an ass as an uncle.</br></br>  <br><br>How do you go about getting them?</br></br>  <br>This was long time ago she was 19. maybe like 10 years ago I would say.</br>  when i was maybe 9 or 10, my friend and I molested my little sister; she would have been 6 or 7. im not even sure we knew what we were doing. it wasnt even really sexual.<br><br>we convinced her to lay down and close her eyes, then we took her pants off and played with her vag. sometimes i wonder if she remembers that at all.<br><br> maybe it explains my latent desire to fap to wincest </br></br></br></br>  I wrestled with my 15 year old cousin when I was 25. <br><br> She's wearing short shorts up to her ass and a tank top <br> At a boring get together <br> We're alone in the game room <br> Joke around with wrestling her saying she couldn't win <br> She mounts me, lays down on top of me, wraps her legs around my legs and pins my hands down above my head <br> Roll her over, run my hand up her leg, try to go for a kiss and dry hump her <br> She freaks out, screams and runs out of the room calling for her dad <br> I leave out the window <br> Never talk to him again </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I lost my virginity at the age of seven to an 8 year old girl.</br>  This happened less than a month ago<br> Asian massage place easy walking distance from my house <br> $40 for an hour long body massage <br> Had helped my brother move and my back was killing me <br> Decided to get a massage <br> Honest to god thought "happy endings" were a racist myth <br> I've only had one massage before. I tipped the lady $20 then, so that's what I tipped this time <br> Asian lady, probably early 40s, 6/10 takes me back to a sectioned off "room" with walls that almost reached the ceiling and a door  <br> Tells me "everything off. towel. right back" <br>hold on for more.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Watched my bro wipe his ass balls and taint with my female cousins cotton candy. Then watch ger eat it saying how good it was  <br>You just left town and all?</br>  <br>Good job dumbass. You realize you can get arrested</br>  <br>Go on...</br>  <br><br>I let my bf play with the little girl I babysat.</br></br>  <br>Nice</br>  <br>Didn't that hurt? how many times a day were you doing it?</br>    <br><br>same fucking thing happened to me. thinking it was just a stereotype, i was not expecting her to pull the towel off and get busy.<br><br>nor could i understand a god damn gook word she was saying.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I sent dick pics and videos to my 8/10 big titted sister in law from a fake account, she rated it 8.5/10</br>  <br> I strip and lay face down on the bed with the towel covering my naked ass, feeling somewhat exposed.  <br> About 5 minutes later, the lady returns and rubs me without oil for a minute or two <br> she gets some oil, and starts rubbing my back, and almost immediately takes the towel off of me <br> she's rubbing my back, but she's rubbing all the way down to my ass. Its more of an ass rub than a back rub. <br> Massages my back, returning to my butt every 5 minutes or so.  <br> moves over to my head, and climbs up on the table so she is stradling my head while I'm face down, and starts rubbing from the top of my back down to my ass </br></br></br></br></br></br>  I have told my secrets to someone already, but the most shameful one is probably me sucking a dick and fucking some guys ass when I was 11  <br>Ya I'm pretty sure she was letting him. he used to always try to show me her ass too and they would giggle that i had a boner</br>  <br>I'm dangerously attracted to a 18 doll, which is the sis of my wife.<br><br>She comes to sleep tomorrow, what is the best way to see her naked.<br><br>I was thinking of hidden cam in bathroom, and nice sleeping pills for the late night grope.<br><br>Any suggestions welcome to make her sleep deeply enough for a grope party ?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Challenge her to wrestle you in a playful way.</br>  In the boys locker room I used to wear smaller underwear to make my dick look bigger trying to get a guys attention, but it only caught the P.E teachers attention and he gave me a detention and when I showed up he made me suck his dick.  <br>The first few of the day hurt. then it just felt weird and slippery. We did it at recesses and sometimes if i got to school early someone would take me into the bathroom. so 3-4 times a day</br>  <br>She was bad like me. What'd they do to your lil boner anon?</br>  <br>what did you let him do? did you do any?</br>  <br> I'm getting a little "omg, I might a get a handjob" at this point <br> she finishes with that, and moves around to my feet <br> starts rubbing my feet, and works her way up my legs <br> what starts as thing rub becomes an inner thigh rub where she's brushing my balls to "yep, she has my balls in her hand and is rolling them around" <br> She does this ball/thigh/ass massage for honestly 10 minutes. my boner could not be bonerer by the time she asks me to flip over <br> Somewhat embarrassed by the fact that I have a raging hard on, because for some insane reason I'm thinking that maybe I'm misreading the situation and she wasn't rubbing my balls on purpose -which is clearly not true.  <br> She rolls me over, covers me with the towel again, and comes around and starts on my chest/stomach <br> is working her way down to my thigh, which my rock hard dick is covering <br> grabs dick like it ain't no thing and gently moves it over to the other side <br> no flinch, no fucks given straight dick-in-hand contact <br> I'm totally getting a hand job </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Planning on dropping my ex from all of her college classes on the last registration<br> (she cheated)</br>  <br>I hear voices in my head sometimes, they change, but it's usually 2 men of a woman. Happens when I'm trying to sleep/waking up. One occasion I heard 2 men yelling at me and telling me to kill myself. Spooky stuff yo</br>  <br>I do it too.</br>  <br>nothing really. she would flick it and laugh. sometimes she would pull my pants down to see it and laugh hysterically</br>  <br>I did lots. He licked. And fucked.</br>  I think I am in love with my best friend Sarah. We say we are friends, but I have a feeling we both want to be something more. <br><br>inb4 anon is a faggot</br></br>  <br>how old were they? anal or vag?</br>  <br>Poor boy. How old were you?</br>  <br>please tell her dude<br>please</br></br>  I wrote my Bachelor Thesis in one day and copied from a another one  <br>I was high on E and Speed and I jerked off so hard once my dick got super Fucking swollen, purple, and leaked puss. I didn't go to the hospital. This was 2 years ago, my dick still hurts when ever I have an erection and leaks even now and then.</br>  <br> thigh massage becomes thigh/front side ball massage <br> she does this for about a minute, and I'm spread out giving her all the room she needs to get at whatever she wants <br> she cups my balls in one hand, pulls the towel completely off me with the other, and starts stroking my dick <br> handjob lasts about 5 minutes, and she catches my cum in a tissue that must have come from her pocket, bra or something because I didn't see her pull it out it was like magic <br> Massage was surprisingly good: 7/10. Handjob was easily 9/10 and I came buckets. That woman was talented.  <br> Have never told anyone </br></br></br></br></br></br>  yo tengo sexo con la novia de mi mejor amigo, casi todos los dias gracias a los horarios de la universidad<br>Si esta en español... por que? Por que puedo!</br>  <br>16 and much too young for her tiny lil pussy getting fucked by his dick.</br>  <br>I have PTSD to the point when i hear a noise a night I instantly think someone is breaking in and i grab my gun and clear all rooms.. it happens every fucking night i can't sleep and my wife left can't sleep and refuse to go to the VA for help but whiskey is always available.</br>  <br>there you go<br>couple that with a little bit of shame and you now know what its like to get a happy ending.</br></br>  I sometimes get a little horny when my dog starts licking my feet/legs. I don't want to fuck him, I just feel tingles and imagine girls doing it.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;629360867 <br>So like 7? Noice anon. Tell me more.</br>  When I was like 8 I rubbed my wang against my best friend at the times dick. As far as I know neither of us are gay, but I still look back and wonder what the hell we were thinking.<br><br>Jokes aside... is this at least somewhat normal? Or am I a fucking freak?</br></br>  <br>already told it all. her bf fingered my ass on more than one occasion.. thats about it</br>  <br>Raped a drunken milf at her place. Or she was passed out, some of yall call it 'rape'.</br>  I like My little pony,<br><br>Yeah that's right, my big secret is that I like ponies</br></br>  <br>Me too.

I still function, go to work, spend time with my wife and child, but all I ever want to do is lay in bed. I have hidden it for so long now that I'm afraid it will be too much at some point and I don't know what will happen if I lose control.  I'm a 52 year old man who duped a 19 year old girl to send me nudes through PSN 2 years ago. It was... nice. <br><br>I will miss you PSN Home.</br></br>  The chavvening<br>    ▲ <br>  ▲ ▲ </br></br>  <br>Dead man walking. Speak now or forever hold you peace.<br>Or not, I'm just spouting shit.</br></br>  <br>playstation network? man you old motherfucker got weird style.</br>  <br>Post. POST</br>  I shared pictures my girlfriend sent when she was 16 multiple times  <br><br>im in love with my best friend's gf. she lives with us, and her and I have been spending a lot of time together recently because he's never around and honestly treats her like a fucking child. she told me she has feelings for me too.<br><br>two nights ago I drove up to her cabin on the lake to be with her and her one other friend. alcohol and bonfires happened...<br><br> we got naked and went swimming <br> the attraction was real <br> we fucked <br><br>he now knows we have feelings for each other, but we both agreed to not tell him that we did the freak. im a horrible friend, but i still love her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Keep sharing</br>  <br>Bitch those Asians massage parlors are crazy. They're always average to ugly though. I had one trying to get me to cum, then she started fingerings my asshole. I was drunk and let her do it, I didn't enjoy it but I was like wtv. The next morning I was like "man. I let a 40 year old Asian woman finger my asshole, I need to stop drinking."</br>  <br>I've lied about so much that I've created false memories about the things I've lied about. I secretly want to commit suicide but I'm afraid of the disappointment from my parents and loved ones.</br>  <br>And I know people have been saving/ reposting her in those " favorites you bed saved from other anons " threads</br>  I really wanna fuck Leena kalla  <br>honestly i'd say somewhat normal, most guys are pretty curious about their wing wangs when their young and usually don't realize something they're doing is gay</br>  at my workplace i would always drop officers food and spit in it bc fuck 12  <br>It's still rape if they're passed out, Fucking autism</br>  i get extremely turned on when a chick gains a ton of weight. no idea why.  When I was 12 and my sister was 11 we started having sex. We did it for about three years a few times a week. We just stopped one day. We haven't talked about it since but are still very close.  <br>I wanna commit suicide all the time, only thing stopping me is the thought that I'd miss something cool if I died.</br>  <br><br>i have this problem too, anon. except im an alcoholic so I say shit while im drunk and then don't remember saying it until someone brings it up, and then i have to create the story in real time to not sound like a total faggot</br></br>  I was molested as a kid. Lost my virginity when I was 9. I've had severe depression and been suicidal several times since then. I can't trust anyone and only look out for myself despite being married now and having a kid. I feel guilty, but not guilty enough to try and change.    <br>Right? Like what if you commit suicide and tomorrow we discover alien life? Is it worth it to miss a massive advancement in human history? I'm the same way anon</br>  I can't fucking cry even if a orphan's kitten is being crushed to death because he have autism and can't act well with the other orphan. Therefore, he's alway lonely and his kitten was his sole friend. Even if there's Fur Elise or other classical shit playing the same time.  <br>The idea of being dead is so... dull.</br>  <br>holy shit, same here</br>  <br>Ill make your mom cry</br>      I once crushed a kitten for pure pleasure  Futanari is my favorite fetish, and I regularly jerk it to trannies, although I doubt I'd actually fuck one. No homo.  <br>I'd fuck a tranny in an instant. If I ever find one in Oregon, I'd be on their cock within hours.</br>  <br><br>Oh fuck, I'm dying here. Those reactions.</br></br>  I frequently jack off to pictures of myself  I love licking people hands, even if they're complete stranger.  <br>I'm more scared of being nothing. <br>Existing is alright with me.</br></br>  <br><br>I had sex with a tranny hooker.<br><br>Best blow job ever.<br><br>Super fun night.<br><br>No ragrets.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Get medicated. It sounds scary but your life is way better.</br>  <br>I raped a girl freshmen year of college... Will green text if you would like me to elaborate</br>  I've cheated on my girlfriend once with a gay dude who posted about his gloryhole over craigslist. I went there and he honestly gave better head than her and I came so hard. Thinking about doing it again...  <br>Naw, I like the idea of not existing and have wished I hadn't been born since about 9 years old. I just always think "Fuck, what is something really amazing happens in the world, I'd like to see it." Or sometimes I think, "Well maybe one day I'll be in a life situation that makes me change my views."</br>  <br>Kek</br>  <br>I'm not sure if I'm capable of love again, and have been feeling like I'm faking it for the last 8 months.
