Hello /b/<br>I'm an Afro-American activist for the rights of colored people <br>I'm here to ask, what do you think about our movement?, Why do you support black people?<br><br>http://blacklivesmatter.com/<br><br>Please<br>This is a serious thread so avoid racial slurs ot ati-social attitudes, please and thanks</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I support niggers going back to Africa</br>  <br>niggers are cool as long as they stay away from my wife</br>  <br>OK, I'll bite. Why did you assholes interrupt Bernie Sanders at the Netroots Nation town hall and heckle him until he walked out even though he supports civil rights and opposes police brutality more than any other candidate? Are you really that stupid, or are you just doing it all for the attention?<br><br>Also, why do you chimp out whenever someone says "all lives matter?"</br></br></br>  <br>Black lives will matter when Blacks do pic related</br>  <br>the only reason that alot of people are racist towards black people is because black people are cronically racially offended and call us racist. im sick and god dam tired of black people playing the race card and being racist towards me because of some fucked up kid shooting people. i have litterally never met a black person in my live that wast HYPERsensitive to racial topics or thought that someone was being racist towards them when they werent. <br><br>long story short, blacks are just paranoid and hypersensitive when it comes to race, not whites...</br></br></br>  As another minority, you guys should embrace some of the good things you have and stop listing your skin color as one of your main traits. Your personality and overall intellect defines who you are, not your skin color.<br><br>The only thing that I could really support is probably the police brutality issue, and even then, it can be statistically justified (not morally, of course)<br><br>So just chill out and start focusing on improving yourselves and stop blaming your personal failures on your skin color.</br></br></br></br>  All lives matter not just black's  <br>Fuck out of here!</br>      Chimp out! Lol that's hilarious. Also Google thinks your gorillas!    You cannot overcome racial prejudice until you learn to respect your community, your neighbors, the law and yourself. No-one said this would be easy or fair but that is the way it is. Start working on it...  here is the reason for the police problem<br>fix your house before you tell us to fix ours<br> FFS! </br></br>  Try helping the problem of black on black crime first instead of claiming white man is at the root of all your problems and you might get somewhere. Also blacks are more racist to whites than whites are to them, no denying that.  <br>Hello Black Activist<br>I'm white, but not an activist. I have rights too though. What do you think about my pride? Do you support white-only movements? If niggers get to rally and start exclusivist bullshit 'organisations' and sub societies and shit, so do we, that's what equality is about. AND YET... I say I'm proud, spades call me racist; you say you're proud, and if I DON'T accept it, I'm an elitist kracker-ass Jimmy-roundeye whip-cracking' imperialist pig dog. SOUND FAMILIAR? Yeah. Fuck you and your vindictive, sanctimonious shite. Right up your unrest-causing ass.</br></br>    <br>Ok sir<br>Fist of all I think the term "chimping out" or whatever you call it is offensive <br>We did what we did because freedom of speach <br><br><br>Well <br>First of all you need to understant black people <br>We have been abused and treated literally like animals since we were forced to come to this country <br>If black people sometimes act a little bit more violent is because history and economically and police opression <br><br>Is ok to feel sensitive about our history in America</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Simply, perfectly explained.<br>/thread</br></br>  Hate incoming  <br>trips up in here</br>    <br><br> using slavery as an excuse <br><br>There's another one of your problems</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Only people who act like animals are treated like animals.<br><br>Oh...</br></br></br></br>  <br>/b/ has nothing against people of color<br>i for one just hate just about everybody including myself that doesn't mean i don't respect them. we all need to live togther after all, something that jews won't fucking understand</br></br>  <br> What do you think of our movement? <br>You already have your rights. Modern black rights movements are just niggers wanting to be treated specially and catered to more than everyone else.<br> Why do you support black people? <br>Nice leading question</br></br></br></br>    <br>its our fault is it,<br>lets have a look at what black people have done where white man is not involved</br></br>  <br><br>#BlacksDontMatter<br><br>word son</br></br></br></br>    I support blacks, just not niggers.  <br>You people ruin everything go away</br>    <br><br>I have a question as well. It seems you support the thought black people are equally intelligent to white people. Also "chimping out" - as in a reference to new world apes - loosk to be offensive to you. Why then do you write and speak like uneducated humans that seem to very much mirror their evolutionary predecessors? And why can't we name you the way nature made you? Aren't you pushing for diversity? Don't be ashamed of your animalistic image!<br><br>You seem to also not be very fluent in your native english - why is that?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>So if every black dysfunction is the fault of whitey why aren't you mongs crying for segregation? Here's a tip, we don't need you and we don't want you and the only reason you're around us is as parasites forced on us by a Marxist government.<br><br>This is a pretty pathetic toll by the way.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Blacks need to stop crying out racism every chance they get. Use that card in the right places at the right time and more people will listen. It's like the boy who cried wolf right now. And stop starting a race war because you will all end up in jail or dead and we will have marshall law -- which is exactly what the feds want.</br>  <br>This.<br>Now stop being a shitb8ing faggot.</br></br>    The only people holding black people down are themselves.<br><br>The media, the politicians, the workforce, the school system, EVERYONE bends over backwards for these morons. You'd think they would have "caught up" by now.<br><br>Fuck niggers. Seriously</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>This.<br><br>Just take Alabama and make it your home. No one needs that state anyways.</br></br></br></br>        <br>"institutional racisms fault those streets are shitty" <br>says SJW</br></br>  <br> We did what we did because freedom of speach  <br> we did because freedom of speach  <br> freedom of speach  <br> speach </br></br></br></br>  <br>Kek</br>  <br>Fuck you ape piece of shit<br>You're not black, you are a nigger!, a God damn fucking nigger!<br><br>I'm black and people like you make me fucking sick<br>Go back to Africa if you don't like America</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i support this also.</br>    <br>this</br>  <br>The illusion of being "separate" between races it is absolutely ridiculous, you cannot be accepted or loved by everyone, regardless of their ethnicity. You need to focus on your closest people and more important with yourself.</br>  <br>I support this as well #backtoafrica</br>    <br>a thing of beauty</br>  You guys fight for equality but you spam "BlackLivesMatter" instead of all lives matter. The fuck is this?  <br>fucking yes</br>  <br>shows the lack of intellectual ability</br>      <br>#blacktoafrica</br>  <br>gr8b8m8ir81488</br>  <br> rights of colored people <br><br>As a colored person myself what rights are you fighting for? I mean, the fuck, we're not slaves or anything. It's just that other people fuck it up for the rest giving the rest also a bad rep.<br><br>Instead of crying and shouting at the white man, how about we fucking sort our shit out first?</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Black people in big African cities like Harare live better than African-Americans<br><br>Like what?<br><br>Stop the opression <br><br>Yes, the goverment don't care about black people <br><br>We don't like Uncle Toms<br><br>Whites are not being slaughtered in the streets by police <br>Why can white officers like the murderers of Eric Garner and Michael Brown go away? What about justice 4 Traybon Martin?, Zimmerman still free</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I support the fact that we should have picked our own cotton and left you niggers to kill yourselves in your trash country.</br>  <br>NIGGA NIGGA NIGGA NIGGA NIGGA NIGGA NIGGA<br> why you eat so much chicken? </br></br>    Cringe Thread.

One implies they're different the normal, this is positive in that they may not be cunts like the average, but negative in that they might be SUPER cunts unlike the average.<br><br>Both just guarantees that she's fucking crazy and probably annoying as fuck.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you think 4 months is a long time for an actual trial? if no one is being held in jail during that time, it can take WAY longer than that.</br>  <br> worried that her blonde hair looked yellow <br>Fuck me...</br></br>  <br>kekage</br>  <br> Hugo Boss <br>Nazi uniforms are sexy as fuck, that's one thing you have to give them no matter how much you might disagree with their ideology.</br></br>  <br>'triggered' by a made up thing, you really should be on tubler m8</br>  <br>lmao she even replied to the wrong account</br>    <br> ew his height starts with 5' <br>Fine. I'll take them.<br>The shorter the guy, the bigger my dick is in comparison.</br></br></br>  <br>This is why /b/ should have a fucking age limit</br>  anybody else miss the old bionicles<br>not like this current shit thats just two piece of plastic<br>general bionicle thread?</br></br>  <br><br>Those aren't even the originals. They're ones made from other parts with the masks and weapons from the firsts.<br><br>The originals didn't have bendable knees or elbows, which the ones in your pic can do.</br></br></br></br>  <br>oh well these are the ones i grew up with way cooler in my opinion than the shitty ones your talking about</br>  <br>underage <br>i grew up with the originals and i'm only 18</br></br>  <br>im 18 too?</br>  <br>They're designed for children and to convince their parents to buy them. If you're not a child who wants to play with them then no one cares what you like or don't like.</br>  <br>well then you grew up with the originals not these</br>  <br><br>Yeah my dad used to buy me these im 21<br>i dont recall them having bendable knees</br></br></br>  <br>no i grew up with these</br>  and these  <br>anon pls, these are not the originals</br>  <br>Based Bohroks.<br>Long Live Jaller and Gukko</br></br>  <br>i preferred the taller bad guys to these</br>  Because OP is an idiot, and obviously not a true fan, he didn't realize that those are not the originals. These are.  <br>yea i remember they are</br>  <br>You're a fucking retard. Those are different than the original picture you posted.</br>  <br>who's your fav? Mine was Opaka</br>  <br>what are you talking about they are the same i also remember getting the gold pieces as a kid</br>  <br>thankyou jesus</br>  Bionicle underwater was the true bionicle  <br>Ok, cool :).</br>  I was a huge fan of the originals but man the Toa Metru where the fucking shit.  this is all i could afford  Bump  <br>These were the one's I grew up with</br>  Personally, My favorite were the Rahkshi.<br>Coolest villans imo.</br>  <br>i still got all six. even in the movie they were badass</br>  <br>Yaaaas. Holy shit the Toa metru were the übermensch in terms of design. All the later generations joint mobility combined with the aesthetic of the originals.</br>  <br>Did those legit where my favorite</br>  the masks always got me hard  <br>these were my favorite. I made these fight the ones UP had. these ones were the bad guys</br>  <br>hnnnggggg</br>  mfw this thread  <br>bruh i forgot about these this just hit my nostalgia in the face</br>  I wish I could've had Makuta.  Is there such a thing as Bionicle Rule 34?  <br>Not bio enough.</br>  mfw i dont remember where are my 10+ bionicles ;___;  god even the original containers made me so happy  <br>I still have my Makuta but he's in pieces scattered throughout 3 different Lego boxes so rebuilding him has been kind of a pain. <br><br><br>Yes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>i saved up my shitty pocket money for weeks to get that shit</br>  <br> I'm pretty sure it exists, just not a lot of good ones.</br>  <br> mfw the Toa Nuva were released <br>Post yours</br></br>  this was my proudest achievement having them like this  <br>I always wanted to get them all...</br>  <br>I HAVE THIS!!!! I TOTALLY FORGOT ABOUT BIONICLE HOLY SHIT. THAT NIGGERS HANDS ARE FUCKINK MASKS DUDE</br>  <br>I had one of them! Badass. So many hours playing with it.</br>      <br>was it just me or was the brown one kinda shit</br>  anyone remember these?    <br>the black bionicle was always my favorite- nigga kept to himself and dug for minerals n shit and was in general a badass</br>  <br>i only like the brown one because it came with the rock</br>  <br>man, insta nostalgia<br><br>i had the black, the red and the green one. <br>i remember being a kid and visiting some great ancient roman ruins somewhere in italy, i didnt really give a fuck and played with hte bionicles all over the ruins<br>fuck</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do not speak of such dark times.</br>  I think some of the movies are on Netflix. Did anyone like the movies?  <br>mfw the advertisement for those!</br>  <br>dude i have the red one in my room right now.</br>  <br>The first two were baller af!</br>  <br>Oh, lawd. the commercials for those when I was a kid left me in awe. I never heard of the song either, so i spent like a month typing whatever the dude said.<br><br>Inaka showed me edgy park.</br></br></br>  <br>i hate the fucking heads and mask on these not as cool like the others</br>  <br>I wasn't even big into toys as a kid but god damn I loved those things.</br>  <br>Their design is the fucking tits, man. Sadly I only owned the red one.<br>I used to have a big ass tub filled with various parts from Bionicles I collected and whenever I'd put together a custom figure, I would always use him as the base. I could spend hours upon hours just sitting there coming up with crazy designs. Sold them all at one point due to moving house and not having the space for it anymore. Ah, regrets too late.</br></br>  These were probably my favorite.... Had every single one up until the Inika  <br>FAAAAACE ME! CLOSER TO REALITY, CLOSER TO THE EDGE</br>  <br>i loved the body armor on these</br>  anyone remember this video? <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=dpf<wbr>Nrl6RIvM</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>I remember Move Along by AAR.... XD Thy definitely got me hooked on that genre.</br>  all time fav  <br>UNITY</br>  <br>The new ones have more pieces and more functionality (More and better joints and what not)<br>However, I agree they don't have the same feeling to them as the old ones did.</br></br>  <br>DUTY</br>  <br>mask on this one was fucking great</br>  ok, shifting the game to the actual oldfags here  <br>DESTINY</br>  <br>I still remember how to build these without the manual.</br>  <br>1 &amp; 2 are fucking great. 3 was not as objectively good but still entertaining and I never saw legend reborn but it was done by a different studio an shit and I don't own any of the bionicles from the generation it was based off so I haven't really had much desire to watch it. Anyone seen bionicle 4 who can confirm or deny its shittiness?</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=oxo<wbr>uZkrrqUc</wbr>  [ ]<br>i was thinking of this</br></br>  <br>Shiiiiiiiiiiiit shout out to the Technics..... Damn</br>  <br>Needs more Franku</br>  <br> tfw I forgot the Vahki existed <br>I'm a terrible person.</br></br>  when they came out with the mini figs kek  <br>I had the two big guys and damn did I fucking battle wth those.... I'd play alone and fucking have matrix dodges and broken off limbs and everything.</br>  <br>Cool models, but they never had the same character as the Bohrok or the Rahi</br>  <br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/OZbCsJttSyE  [ ]<br><br>FOUND IT MFW</br></br></br></br>  <br>Me and a friend would spend hours building between ten and twenty different bionicles, both custom and vanilla, and then we'd have huge narrated battles which usually ended in all the ones we built in pieces. Then we rebuilt them and did it again.</br>  <br>Bruh I actually found this guy with all his pieces still in his can at goodwill about a month ago. Built him right there in my car . It was only $3, too. I honestly believe that there are thousands of people out there who could put together a lot of the OG Bionicle sets from memory and probably don't even realize it.</br>  <br>i always got the shit little ones</br>  <br>Finding the rubber mask-like things are even harder... Remember when they sold them separately like they do minifigs nowadays?</br>  When I was little, I would put the mask over my eye so I can see through their mask hole, making me the bionicle  <br>Always had to have Matoran to be saved or to turn into the Toa....</br>  <br>Fuuuuuu I still have some of these.</br>  <br>Based anon understands</br>  <br>kek<br> making me the bionicle </br></br>  Not even an entire room full of naked men dressed in assless chaps engaged in one giant, lubricated circle-assfucking, pounding away in time to "In The Navy", which is on constant loop, while "Brokeback Mountain" plays on a giant screen on one wall and DVDs of various musicals play on the other three and a slideshow of Liberace is projected onto the ceiling, until the room full of men simultaneously climax while hitting the highest note in any song from "Mama Mia" could be gayer than this thread.  <br>*slow clap*</br>  <br>oh god, I did this too.</br>    <br>tfw you had no childhood</br>  <br>Slizers was much better</br>  <br>had him and mask of light growing up. he's still together somewhere in the attic...</br>  <br>i guess someone didnt have a childhood</br>  <br>Got trips bro....</br>  <br>lul nostalgia is gay hur dur XD LOL as if you guyz realized you liked something haha lolol trololol</br>  <br>yes. ice dude was the shit.</br>  <br>Sorry, anon.</br>  <br>some real thought went into that one huh?</br>  <br> ice dude </br>  nostalgia pls  Anyone else have the comics? Those were the shit.    <br>I'll take it.</br>  <br> hit refresh button <br> r34 pops up <br> mfw </br></br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=rE3<wbr>oIXrnQWc</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>I just remember they had shitty mask that always fell off while playing</br>  check these  <br>Yes op.</br>  <br>These are tghe O.G <br>Damn i forgot those</br></br>  <br>damn, this is some realy old shit.</br>    I uses to have this big crate full of them. It's all I wanted for my birthday/Christmas and if I ever got money if spend it on these. Fucking loved them. Wish I didn't give them away  I've got most of them in my room. Everything that came in a set of six is there. I dont have the OG rahi and some of the bigger sets.  <br>This is where it's at.</br>  <br> bionicles <br> nicles <br> cles <br> s <br> triggered </br></br></br></br></br>  Did anyone own this guy? He was one of the baddest motherfuckers that I had, aside from custom creations. I used to use the cape in everything I made.  <br> realy old shit <br> barely 15 years old <br>mfw summer</br></br></br>    <br>Honestly the year previous to this set is when things started going downhill.</br>  <br>My nigga. I actually have a special edition version of the one on the far right. Had a bar code in the lower left corner. Got it from Toys R Us during some offer where if I get a Toa I get a free comic. Was like 13 fucking years ago.</br>  <br>Daily reminder that Bionicle was cancelled and the recent reboot is ass.</br>  <br>This nigga is thinkn about the mc Donald toy that they realease with the first movie/gen. They did have benable knees and elbows with the first release</br>  <br>These look like custom versions of the originals. Pretty cool, actually.</br>  <br>Pics + timestamp</br>  <br>Not really, have you seen the 2015 bionicles with the restart of the series the builds are pretty complex, its based off of the toa mata builds with gears.</br>  <br>Was subscribed to the Lego magazine way back in the day and would look forward to the day that the new magazine came with the new comic book. Thats how I got all of these.</br>  Anyone else get one of these from ancient happy meals?  <br>The Toa sets released in 2001 did not have bendable elbows or knees. They had shoulder and hip articulation, but the arm and leg pieces were a single solid mass.</br>  <br>mofucker these arent the taka nui</br>  I had 2 of these  <br>favorite series right here<br><br>the disc launchers were dumb though</br></br></br>  <br>Anyone read the books? I absolutely loved the part where Toa Nokama was fighting a fountaiin of energized protodermis.</br>  Y'all niggas check this out<br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/rPaYJwf1FVw  [ ]</br></br>  <br>POHATU POHATU IS THE BEST</br>  <br>Nope, getting too autistic in here now.</br>  <br>oh god the feel when you got cool wheels</br>  <br>Kopaka*</br>  <br>i actually won a raffle and got signed versions of these.</br>  <br>My nigga, I got one of those from Christmas from my Uncle when he thought I was still into it.<br>That shit was the last Bionicle I ever got until the new ones came out and I bought Kopaka.</br></br>  <br>Pohatu was awesome because of his upside-down chest. He was a unique mother fucker.</br>  <br>Did the same. I remember the Lego Magazine got thinner and thinner as my childhood withered away. Nobody remembers that Toys R Us event except me though.</br>  <br>hahah sorry i dont remember any of the names</br>  <br>bahrok's head action was the best :3</br>  <br>I liked Kopaka's mask, but my overall favorites were probably Onua and Gali. Gali's transparent Mask of Water-Breathing was awesome, and Onua's and Gali's claws were cool as well.</br>  I think why people hate the reboot is because it doesn't have anything close to a compelling story    <br>OMFG THROWBOTS OMFG I FORGOT</br>  <br>yoooooo my older brother has all of these</br>  <br>awh damn, been too long</br>  <br><br><br/></br></br>  <br>I was thinking about getting one of the new ones, are they worth it?</br>  <br>I did like Ice Dude (Matoro), but the rest of that set of Toa were shite. Stupid fucking faces.</br>    <br>I did. Read up to the third book. This thread is seriously giving me feels. I remember reading the books at home when it was raining.</br>  <br>Really? I felt it was the set after that. Those stupid squid launchers never worked.</br>  <br>Please tell me you guys remember on the old Lego website where they had the Bionicles adventure game.</br>  <br><br>I had this one, fucking OG</br></br>  <br>The sets kinda suck, too.</br>  POLL who was your favorite bionicle from each generation?<br><br>1.tahu<br>2.kopaka<br>3. nuju<br>4. hordika vakama<br>5. jaller<br>6. nuparu<br>7. phantoka- lewa<br> mistika - tahu<br>8. mata nui<br>9. new badass 2015 kopaka</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nope nope nope nope nope</br>  <br><br>It's amazing how some people managed to build with one hand.</br></br>  <br>Yes Yes I do; about a year ago i went back and had to really dig to find a copy of it anyone else have it?</br>  <br><br> putting this much effort into a shitpost </br></br>  Sup /b/, just got a coupon for <br><br>Warhammer 40K: Dawn of War<br><br>Too bad I already own it, and torrented all the standalones.
