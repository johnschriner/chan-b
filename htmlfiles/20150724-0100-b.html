Handed in the first of three thesises, now I have to find another one. But I'm going to take this week to relax and fix/ maintain all my shit here. Will need to work on the ancient family-desktop (new hdd and os needed).<br>The bike also needs to pass the safety inspection.

I'll just swap in a new harddrive (old one vibrates massively) and install linux. Hopefully no rocket science.<br><br>These inspections are mandatory each second years.

NIC, Sound Blaster, ATI Mach32 video card (on the incredibly odd yet incredibly fast VLB bus) and 16 megs of ram. The I/O card can handle four hard drives; I'll install DOS one one with plenty of games (I grabbed a torrent with [nearly] all DOS games ever made and it's time to nostalgia) and some sort of UNIX clone on the other(s). <br><br>Linux and its monolithic kernel aren't going to work, save for DSL linux. I love me some DSL. <br><br>NetBSD is also planned. NetBSD runs on pretty much anything, even such a low-spec machine. <br><br>The battery on the 486 still holds a charge.

True belief is the death of intelligence  <br>No, just more sinful</br>  Yes just saying the words "I'm atheist" raises your IQ by four points every time you interject it into a conversation that has nothing to do with religion.  <br>No<br><br><br>This, but with modifications.<br><br>True belief discourages the search for the truth, because it claims it is already found. The search for the truth is the process that improves intelligence.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>that question is retarded on so many levels.</br>  <br>only if god is real</br>  <br>So does using words like interject<br><br>Oh, excuse me for interjecting by the way, I'm an atheist.</br></br></br>  Yes  <br>What do you mean 'if'?<br><br>Westboro Baptist forever</br></br></br>  *Less deluded.  <br>That's so ironic.</br>  <br>Religion is a legal and accepted form of autism</br>  <br>not necessarily, less gullible though.</br>  <br>I don't actively pursue being an atheist, but the questions about god and the bible and jesus and all that shit are fucking exhausting, and I have a feeling it's all madeup, so I really don't preoccupy myself with thinking about them/discussion them. It's too much trouble. Maybe after I've watched every episode of Half in the Bag...</br>  <br><br>Pagans lived mediocre lives. Religion inspired man before it became tainted with politics.<br><br>Richard Dawkins is a faggot. All you're doing is advertising his literature. Nearly every "argument" ITT will be copypasta from the "God Delusion".<br><br>All arguments are invalid. Either side of this discussion is retarded.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No.<br><br>Beliefs have nothing to do with facts.</br></br></br>  Yes.  <br>No, it just means you don't believe in the existence of deities. Many intelligent people are religious, many idiots are atheists, and there are plenty of in-betweens, religious or not.</br>  <br>no. Being more intelligent usually makes you an atheist though.</br>  <br>Well you don't believe in imaginary people and places.<br><br>Am I more intelligent then my little sister because she believes Santa clause is real and lives in the North Pole?<br><br>I am more intelligent then her on the subject, yes.<br><br>So the answer is yes atheists are more intelligent then Christians, Jews, mudslime and other religions that believe in imaginary friends and places.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's the other way around</br>  <br>Is this new cancer? did i miss something?</br>  <br>In that you're using critical thinking and logic to question the existence of deities, sure</br>  <br>No. Being intelligent makes you an athiest.</br>  In the eyes of a statist and fellow Atheists, yes.  <br>You like this kind of cancer?</br>  <br><br>Catholic Monks kept beer/wine making recipes safe/secret during the dark ages.<br><br>Thank your fellow Catholic during the next toast you male friend.<br><br>:^)<br><br>Oh yea, the entirety of European civilization exists as it is because of Christianity.

So no.</br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br>Nope. <br><br>But being religious makes you more stupid.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't and it's a great example.<br><br>Please explain why you think it's a bad example</br></br></br>  <br><br>Satan is a product of the Bible. The concept of Lucifer is an Abrahamic delusion. He was a fallen angel.

Because they discard any beliefs, they are therefore not open to learn new things. Most importantly they created a barrier for themselves which makes it impossible to be touched and saved by Jesus Christ. In conclusion, they made it impossible to be rescued and enlightened because of their atheism. I personally can't think of anything more stupid then that. I wish you atheists out the good luck in Hell. So be it...</br></br>  <br>Looks to me like they're all pretty retarded. The scale starts at 60 and stops at 105. The "geniuses" in this survey are barely above the overall average</br>  No, being an Atheist does not make you more intelligent. This extends to all religions and beliefs.<br><br>Understanding what Atheism is however does make you more intelligent. This too extends to all religions and beliefs.</br></br>  <br>Claiming that you're more intelligent than your little sister because she believes in Santa...

Such a reductionist claim would have any historian worth a damn laughing at you.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>IQ is only an indication made of silly numbers that dumb humans invented. It means nothing. You could be way more retarded then someone with an IQ of 80. How can we really tell if an IQ of 160 is better then 80, when we invented both the scale and the numbers.</br>  <br>Wisdom and intelligence are different. Wise people are atheists. They also realize the Easter bunny and Santa are also made up</br>  <br> Mad because scored low </br>      <br>I think you need to re-read this chain of conversation</br>  <br><br>Pagans worshipped nothing but themselves.

That situation you described never occurs in nature, only in fantasy world. This is not World of Warcraft you raging autist. Median is just a fancy name for mean when the situation is so complex they have to have 2 indicators of the center because there really is no center.</br>  <br>You're still not making any sense whatsoever bro.. Maybe you should just stop typing</br>  <br> Paganism is a broad group of religions including modern pagan religions, indigenous religions and historical polytheistic religions. In a wider sense, paganism has also been understood to include any non-Abrahamic, folk, or ethnic religion. It is often taken to exclude monotheism, and to express a worldview that is pantheistic, polytheistic, or animistic, with some systems involving a supreme deity. <br><br> POLYTHEISTIC <br> PANTHEISTIC <br> SUPREME DEITY <br><br>now fuck off</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> WAHHH YOU COMPLETELY INVALIDATED MY ARGUMENT LOOK AT IT AGAIN SO I CAN LOOK LIKE AN EVEN BIGGER IDIOT </br></br>  <br> CultOfDusty </br>  <br><br>Fuck this shit, I'm out of this thread.</br></br>  <br>I knowit man.<br><br>This is making my morning.<br><br>Dafuq u from, m8?

It is highly logical to only believe in what can be empirically observed and reject the belief in something that is most likely a fantasy and superstition. <br><br>The absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.

What you're refering to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.<br><br>Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called Linux, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.<br><br>There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called Linux distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux!</br></br></br></br></br>   russia <br> nukes come <br> let's go underground <br> fighting over resources <br> Nazi's and Soviets come back <br> shit, black mutants <br> one guy nukes, the nuclear wasteland <br> kills "all" of the dark one <br> sequel </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Populous?</br>  <br>Battlefield?</br>  <br>Metro</br>   nuclear devistation <br> CHOPPER NOOOOOOO <br> chopper ruines a football game </br></br>  <br>metro</br>  <br>nah...payday has a DLC linked to the game</br>  <br>No</br>  <br>Nope.

Enjoy.</br>  <br>I like this</br>  It's a little off beat from what you're talking about, but if you like classic rock you should listen to Rival Sons.  <br>Shiiiiiiit<br>Remember seeing dfa live when I was like 16 and busting my nose open<br>Fuck they were good</br></br></br>  Somehow I've never heard of Royal Blood before this thread. I don't get why everyone in this thread is shitting on them, they're great.  http://www.music-map.com/queens+of+<wbr>the+stone+age.html</wbr>  <br><br>I'll have a go at it, ty</br></br>    <br><br>Pretty new I guess. They've been making waves across the UK and less-so into Europe. Considering the album they have out now is a debut I think they've done incredibly well.</br></br>  <br>What's wrong with Sabbath?

I'm not too much of a fan of that stuff but I'll let it pop up every now and then.</br></br>  <br>I went to go see Halestorm (shitty band, just went because concert with friends) and Royal Sons was one of the openers. They absolutely kicked ass. So much energy, great riffs, and the singer is genuinely fantastic. I wish they were playing the entire night. (Halestorm sucked major dick)<br><br>And the lead guitarist has awesome awesome facial follicles.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah the first two are just for if you're feeling particularly pumped or something but the last three you should definitely enjoy.</br>  <br>this</br>  <br>You have the music taste I had at about 9 years old</br>  <br>If you like QOTSA give Kyuss a go - that was Josh Homme's band before QOTSA. One of their better albums is Whitewater.

God dammit it's 5am, ignore that.</br></br>  <br><br>Don't forget BUSTED.</br></br>  Neutral Meme Hotel is good  <br>Yeah nickel back are pretty good. I listen to them whilst I cut.</br>  <br>And N Sync</br>  <br>Can't tell if bait or serious.

I'm a classic rock fan, and Black Sabbath is by no means my on my top list of favorites, but some of their songs aren't bad.

I'm gonna listen through it again, thanks for reminding me of it anon</br>  http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=popP<wbr>QmikR9w</wbr>  [ ]  You want the stone roses debut album  <br>But then if they keep repeating themselves and sticking to a certain sound would they still be innovative?</br>  <br>This image of a 40 year old woman who acts like a 15 year old girl is offensive to me</br>  <br>this is fucking awesome.</br>  <br> New Kids On The Block </br>  <br>Same guy, adding to list.<br> Def leopard <br> Blue Oyster cult <br> Rolling stones <br> The doors <br> The who <br> ZZ top <br> Eric Clapton <br> Pink Floyd <br> Guns n Roses <br> Metallica <br> Ozzy Osborne <br> Queen <br> Helix <br> Kiss <br> Journey <br> Bon Jovi </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That made me feel weird on the inside</br>  <br><br>You make a fair point.<br><br>I'm okay with a fair amount of deviation, I just hope they keep their heavy distorted bass as a theme.</br></br></br></br>  <br>So black Sabbath aren't in your best but ozzys solo career is worth making the list?<br>Are you perhaps still going through puberty?<br>Also &gt;kiss<br>I bet you take that shit seriously</br></br></br></br>  <br> Implying Aerosmith or GFR aren't for all ages <br>It isn't Satan's music, grandpa</br></br>  <br> implying you don't cuddle your Taylor Swift cushion every night. <br>Y-yeah me neither.</br></br>  Refused - New Noise  I have no idea what to call my taste<br> the stone roses <br> oasis <br> the smiths <br> ocean colour scene <br> the clash  <br> the arctic monkeys <br> the streets  <br> squeeze  <br> the stranglers <br> sex pistols  <br> joy division  <br> sleaford mods  <br><br>Anyone similar?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I have about 3 songs total from those too names (not each). Mainly van Halen and Aerosmith is what I enjoy</br>  <br>listen to Pavement, Pixies, maybe some Rolling Stones, Stone Roses, maybe Oasis as you like British Rock and Roll.<br>Personally I think Royal Blood are dreadful, not a creative song on the album but everyone hails them as innovators due to the fact they've brought out the biggest rock record for years.</br></br>  <br>What the fuck did I enjoy that?</br>  <br>Credence Clearwater Revival?</br>  <br>this</br>  Graveyard, Sasmara Blues Experiment, stoned Jesus, and Down  Biff Turkey  <br>I've heard of them, but haven't listened to them. I'm always looking for more to add though. I'll be sure to look into them, anon</br>  <br>yeah brah, not a streets fan though, arctics are great though people skip over them because of how big they've become. Check out their b-sides from their favourite worst nightmare singles, some great hidden gems</br>  <br>I wouldn't call them innovative at all... I just like the way it sounds. Lots of people do this shit it seems. Genuinely good bands are hard to come by.</br>  <br>First album got very different songs (favs are Out of the Black and Loose Change) so i think they are able to stick to there style, without making the same album.</br>  OP use http://wwwgnoosic.com/ that shit will recommend similar bands  <br>NO<br>and fuck those radiohead cucks in /mu/</br></br>  <br>Wait, waitwaitwait. Never heard of CCR? You've never heard fortunate son, down on the corner, Suzie Q, or through the grapevine? I promise you you've heard at least one of these sometime in your life.</br>  <br>Yeah I feel you, I can listen to them sometimes, but it's just too much of the same. Hole is a great track i'll give them that.<br><br>If you're looking for a GOOD British hard rock two piece, try Drenge's first album, great stuff, if maybe slightly samey.</br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=nK5<wbr>YjZ1UH1E</wbr>  [ ]  <br>this OP</br>  <br>I don't like eagles of death metal.

I've heard these before.</br>  <br>ok then this</br>  <br>Just go for Them Croked Vultures, perfect for you</br>  <br>Same dude here, if you're looking for newer(ish) punk/rock etc, try Parquet Courts, Baby Strange, The Libertines</br>  <br>You know the people who were listening to that shit when it was out would be the grandpa now?<br>It's just corporate pop music with a cool 'rockin' image, most people realise that by about 14</br></br>  <br>and this</br>  <br>Yeah, but everyone has heard the CCR versions at some point.

One of the best Manchester bands, Smiths too but they were already said.<br><br>Honestly, anyone who tries to say Definitely Maybe and What's The Story are bad albums is attention seeking, two absolutely brilliant albums (the rest is pretty bollocks I'll give you that)</br></br></br>  <br>I enjoy listening to what my great grandparents listened too<br>And some of the shit the kids are listening to these days</br></br>  <br>no thats a gay band 4 faga</br>  <br>Shit yeah forgot the fall, knew I was missing someone. Used to see mark e smith in town off his tits all the time<br>I think it's growing up in Manchester, I just can't stand listening to oasis, so sick of it. I live about 20 minutes walk from where they grew up so I hear it all the time<br>Like the smiths but Morrissey puts me off them<br>Like any of the acid house stuff or are you purely rock based?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'll have to give it a look, love the manc music evne though I'm nottingham myself</br>  <br>The strokes are great</br>  <br>Yeah rock based man, I get it can be pretty annoying growing up where they were from but those two albums are genius.</br>  <br>mah nig, fav album/songs?</br>  <br>My general music interest in rock pretty much stopped at the 90s and spans far back to grandparents as well. The farthest I deviate is with audioslave and rhcp because I grew up listening to that in the car.</br>  <br>OP, check out a band called Red Fang, two awesome songs are "Prehistoric Dog" and "Reverse Thunder".</br>  <br>First one was okay but really not my cuppa tea<br>Expand your mind though man! If you like new order you're already and the dance music side of the spectrum, stuff like voodoo ray is life changing music, best song to ever come out of Manchester imo<br>A lot of quality hip hop and hardcore punk around in manchester atm as well<br>Also check out wu lyf, they were huge a few years ago, still know the guys, you should like em</br></br></br></br>  <br>favorite album- is this it<br>favorite song- gotta be reptilia</br></br>  <br>woah, you know wu lyf?? big fan, thats mad. how do you know em?</br>  <br>I was like that for a long time but I branched out from only listening to rock music and it changed my life, some modern dance and hip hop is incredible if you don't listen to the radio and the charts, plus hardcore is thriving right now<br>I guess experimenting with new drugs was what got me into a lot of the music out now, always good to expand your horizons</br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=o0P<wbr>lLEqET_Y</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br> acting like wu lyf aren't well known </br>  <br>I'll consider that, but something about the older stuff is really appealing to me. Thanks.</br>  <br>My cousin was in those photo shoots they did on the roofs, some of em come out with us on the weekends, probably gonna see em tomorrow night<br>They broke it all off because the direction they were going was getting too pop</br></br>  I went to see a slightly faggy band called circa waves in nottingham not too long ago, but what caught my eye was the opening act, RAT BOY, I now can't stop listening to him, anyone else heard this guy? <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=XLZ<wbr>_ApnTw6o</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>he means he knows them in real life dickface, not just knowing the band</br>  <br>Well for me the biggest turning point was taking MDMA and listening to high contrast, totally changed my life<br>Also when I first listened to wu tang</br></br>  <br>Basically start listening to Aussie bands m8</br>  <br>hahahaha what the fuck dude, thats hilarious, he and his manager came to see my band a couple months back, nice guy, he's called Jordan. Circa Waves are ok too</br>  <br>When we was all filing out he was sorta stood there, shook his hand, seemed nice</br>  <br>thats sick man, that album is fuckin awesome</br>  <br>Also, circa waves were fairly good live</br>  <br>yeah we didn't know he was watching us till our guitarist saw he'd tweeted us a video of us playing which was a lil weird, he came to the pub with us and stayed at my bassists house because he was stranded in london</br>  <br>What's your band called?</br>  <br>Yeah I always thought they were good but I think they didn't like how popular they became, were hanging around with all the hardcore bands and they seemed mainstream in comparison. A few people around wanted to work on the success more but figured it was cheap so there's just loads of scattered hardcore and garage bands now</br>  <br>https://twitter(.)com/RATBOY/status<wbr>/602908745065181184</wbr></br>  <br>You should try "Brave Black Sea" &amp; "Them Crooked Vultures"</br>  <br>I'm gonna check more of your shit out, I like the sound</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=6dm<wbr>kpkJZna4</wbr>  [ ]  <br>cheers man, only got a couple demos out atm but hopefully big things to come</br>  <br>Got an almost punk vibe going on, very nice</br>  <br>everyone in /mu is a hipster faggot thus the reason that's why they're cunts</br>  <br>yeah like half of our stuff is punk half more indieish</br>  <br>have some real music OP</br>  Last two digits is how old your next girlfriend will be.  asd  What a stupid game.
