Primewire master race.  <br>The legit options offer lower quality video. It's not about the money. Private trackers offer the best quality I can get without driving to redbox. Also, privacy concerns.

If one uses multiple sites especially from folk that don't like each other then one can get decent quality, I'm not saying quick downloads or uploads, but quality yes, one verifies off the other.</br>  <br>Well maybe you shouldn't have used a public proxy on Netflix you pleb <br><br>INB4 you used a private one that was just as fucking bad</br></br></br>    <br>i live in naziland and needed a prxi to watch stuff in english</br>  <br>It's blu-ray rips.

And thats only for movies, if its a TV show then its 100% going to be a TV rip which guess what, is a stream rip in the same sense.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's not just Germany, friends in England cant access tpb or kat or much of anything, they've fucked off and let their government determine what they should or should not access. That's some seriously lame shit.</br>  <br>I said he shouldn't use a public proxy, not that he shouldn't use a proxy at all.<br>I use a proxy for netflix because NZ netflix has shit all to watch, and i don't get into any shit with my netflix account because i use a good VPN</br></br>  <br>wut?<br><br>You didn't say anything worth dealing with.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br/></br></br></br>  <br><br>░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░<wbr>░░░<br>░░░░░░░░░░░░▐░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░<wbr>░░<br>░░░░░░▄▄▄░░██▄░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░<wbr>░░░<br>░░░░░▐███▌░░▀█▄░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░<wbr>░░<br>░░░░░▐███▌░░░░█▄░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░<wbr>░░░<br>░░░░░░▀█▀░▄▄▄▄▀▀░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░<wbr>░░<br>░░░█▀▀███▀░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░<wbr>░░░<br>░░░░▀▄░██░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░<wbr>░░<br>░░░░░░█░██░░░▄░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░<wbr>░░░<br>░░░░░░░████▌░░▌░▄░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░<wbr>░░<br>░░░░░░█░▐██▌░░▌░░▌░▄ ▌░░▐█░░▐█░▄▀█░░░░░<br>░░░░░░█░█░░░░▀░░▀░░ ▐ ▀░░█░█░█░ ▌░▐▌░░░<br>░░░░▄█░▄█░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░█░░▀█░█▄▄▀░<wbr>░░░</wbr></br></br></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br>  <br> im mad that people get things for free </br>  <br>Ok here il simplify it<br><br>Downloading torrents of shows that are airing is the same as streaming, you dont get any better quality from downloading it because its literally the exact same fucking file<br>the only way downloading something is going to be better quality than a stream of the same thing is if the file you download is better quality, and the main way to get that is through a DVD or BDRIP<br><br>if you still don't understand what im saying then you don't understand torrenting nearly enough as you should</br></br></br></br></br></br>  　　　　　　　　　　▄█▀█▀█▄<br>　　　　　　　　▄█▀　　█　　▀█▄<br>　　　　　　　▄█▀　　　　　　　▀█▄<br>　　　　　　　█　　　　　　　　　　　█<br>　　　　　　　▀█▄▄　　█　　　▄█▀<br>　　　　　　　　　█　　▄▀▄　　█<br>　　　　　　　　　█　▀　　　▀　█<br>　　　　　　　　　█　　　　　　　█<br>　　　　　　　　　█　　　　　　　█<br>　　　　　　　　　█　　　　　　　█<br>　　　▄█▀▀█▄█　　　　　　　█▄█▀█▄<br>　▄█▀▀　　　　▀　　　　　　　　　　　　▀▀█<br>█▀　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　▀█<br>█　　　　　　　　　　　▄█▄　　　　　　　　　　█<br>▀█　　　　　　　　　█▀　▀█　　　　　　　　█▀<br>　▀█▄　　　　　　█▀　　　▀█　　　　　▄█▀<br>　　　▀█▄▄▄█▀　　　　　　▀█▄▄▄█▀<br>░░░░░▓▓░░░░░░░░░░░░▓▓<br>░░░░░▓▓▓░████████░▓▓▓<br>░░░░░▓▓░█▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓█░▓▓<br>░░░░░▓▓░░░██░░██░░░▓▓<br>░░░░░▓▓░░░▓▓░░▓▓░░░▓▓<br>░░░░░▓▓▓░░░░░░░░░░▓▓▓<br>░░░░░▓▓▓██░░▓▓░░██▓▓▓<br>░░░░░░▓▓███░▓▓░███▓▓<br>░░░░░░░████████████<br>░░░░░░░████▓▓▓▓████<br>░░░░░░░▓▓▓▓▓██▓▓▓▓▓<br>░░░░░░░████▓▓▓▓████<br>░░░░░░░████████████<br>░░░░░░░░▓▓▓░░░░▓▓▓</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tpb works fine, what are you talking about ?

In fact, the industry's typical response to pirates is one of them. When you create a system where it's more convenient to be a pirate than a legitimate consumer, the problem isn't the pirates, it's the system.<br><br>Not to say pirates aren't an issue. They are. And they'll always be a problem. But they're ultimately a symptom, not the cause.</br></br>  <br><br>HOW BUTTMAD ARE YOU THAT I PROVED PIRACY IS WRONG?<br><br>DONT BACKPEDAL I PROVED YOU ARE JUST A BUNCH OF THIEVING REBEL SCUM</br></br></br></br>  <br>also<br> &gt;thepiratebay.la </br></br>  <br><br>I NEED SAUCE!!!!!!</br></br>  <br> signing SOPA and PIPA to stop torrenting <br>thats like signing a death sentence to get rip of a cold</br></br>  <br><br>this<br><br>this thread proves that SOPA should have passed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You people who call us pirates are full of shit, people have been sharing music tapes and other things since the fuckin 1970's. Now faggits start whining about it because they're fagits and they should fuck the fuck off!</br>  <br>You didn't prove anything except that you're a fagit.</br>  <br>Still not gona pay for tv series <br>still not gona pay for softver <br>"literally proved nothing" <br>proved nothing<br>hmmmm</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Well, the victims in this are the industries being hurt. So yes, SOPA and PIPA were the solution to a very big problem. I've already contacted representatives to suggest they reintroduce more legislation geared towards what SOPA and PIPA was trying to achieve.</br></br>  <br>This.<br>Downloading music online is not different to putting a blank tape in your radio and recording the music, its literally the same shit</br></br>  I NEED SAUCE ON OP GOD DAMNIT!!!!!!!!!!  <br><br>It's stealing. There's no reason your internet should be free of restrictions keeping you from stealing. We need some kind of firewall to block you from torrenting.</br></br>  <br>this is not an englis site</br>  <br>Il pay for what i think deserves my money<br>unfortunately a lot of shit does not deserve my money</br></br>  I always use kickass torrents. Never got a letter, never got a virus. Still use it to this day  <br>I know that already, if I record something and share it with some friends so be it. People have been doing that since the 1970s.</br>  suprnova.org<br>isohunt.com<br>demonoid.com</br></br>  <br>You're a faggot that probably supports socialism from a shit government that can't defend itself.</br>  <br>Its almost like you think i was saying you were wrong when i was agreeing with your post</br>  <br>It's an American site where we speak English you fucking cocksucking fagit.</br>  <br>thats Capitalisam u idiot</br>  <br>You love me and you know it.<br>The Clash - Guns of Brixton<br>http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=qgfd<wbr>UzflEnw</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>SOPA and PIPA were not only about content piracy, they were about breaking internet privacy laws that are basic principles of free rights, they were basicly laws that removed free rights on the internet, thats the only part i didnt support<br><br>If they wanted to stop piracy there were a lot of different better solutions other than to police the internet</br></br></br>  <br>*fagot</br>  <br>You responded to the wrong person there.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Hello guys. Well just my 2 cents but I made some indie music and people like you took it from me. Without my music being successful I couldn't afford to marry my fiance, and he dumped me, and then I had to move back in with my parents, and had a nervous breakdown, and they kicked me out because of that, and so I had no money and had to go fake being nice to an ex boyfriend who's basically the biggest shitlord on earth, and I lived with him, but then he turned into an asshole saying I should pay rent or food bills, so I said fuck him and moved in with a friend.<br><br>the point is if you didnt take my music, my life would be very different now. its because of people like all of you who dont seem to care about supporting women like me (misogyny much?) and my music that Im not married and happy now.<br><br>so yeah... thats my 2 cents, and fuck you very much.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pirates will circumvent anything you throw at them. Many will be deterred initially, but eventually create systems to make it more efficient for those less experienced... like what we have now.<br><br>You can't get rid of them. The tactics used to protect industries from pirates shouldn't be wasting their time on them. Instead, they should focus on making it more convenient to be a legitimate consumer, something so many companies (especially those that use methods of DRM in their products) completely neglect. <br><br>Stripping us of rights is most not a solution to that problem. In fact, it's the opposite. But don't worry, I'm sure it'll go through eventually. Too much at stake. Then we'll see the consequences.</br></br></br></br></br>  What really sucks is that my friends in England can't get stuff because their shit government blocks torrent sites. That's downright weird and fucked up. <br><br>How can a cool nation such as England have simple stuff like the internet blocked for them? It's weird.</br></br>  <br><br>You shouldn't have any privacy if it allows you to torrent. SOPA and PIPA protect the rights that companies have to protect themselves against malicious internet users like many of you.<br><br>Look, their work and right to their work is more important than your right to torrent or hide behind your internet. Personally I think all internet users should have an ID and have their public identity completely open and in full view, connected to everything they do on the internet.<br><br>If you wouldn't steal a car, then you shouldn't be able to steal a song or a movie. End of story. We need SOPA and PIPA.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dont blame me, if there is a new artist that needs money to get better i will support them as much as i can, the only torrenting of music i support is of the ones that are used as brands and not used as bands, shit like pretty much and major rapper or hip hop artist (who are the ones having the biggest cry about it) dont get any of my money because the companies pay them enough already as living advertising content</br>  <br>Maybe your music sucked. If it was any good then you wouldn't have to worry about people that you accuse of doing shit that we didn't do. How about this. FUCK YOU and don't accuse me of shit that I didn't do, but do realize that your music sucks and nobody want's it in the first place let alone pirate it. You fuckin dumb ass chump.</br>  It's not about your music you arrogant fucks, it's about the spread of information and people speaking with each other. <br><br>Once you get that you might understand and not be eurofaggits.</br></br>  <br>The companies are the ones that are ripping off artists, not pirates.</br>  <br>newfag is both new and a fag</br>  <br><br><br><br>oh look how you assume its my fault that you took my songs??!?!?! i shouldnt have expected more from you than to be sexist pigs just because you dont respect female artists you think you can take my songs or my music isnt good<br><br>whatever. i dont need your stress. you're just bullying me because i didnt thank you for ruining my life</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> shut down <br> what are you talking about nigger<br>site is up and fine</br></br></br>  <br>Then don't contract with them you anarchist idiot. It's up to you to sign or not sign.</br>  <br> internet users should have an ID and have their public identity completely open and in full view, connected to everything they do on the internet. <br>...10years leter u have a chip</br></br>  KAT.PH<br><br>OP IS A FAG</br></br>  <br>I didn't take anything from you. I don't even know who the fuck you are. You do come across as a whiney nigger.</br>  *cough* what.cd *cough*  <br>My b8 senses are tingling.</br>  <br> oh look how you assume its my fault that you took my songs??!?!?! <br>i didnt.. i actually said the exact opposite, i said if the artist is a new artist and there music is something i like then i will support them, if i listed to your music and enjoyed it i would have bought an album, but i didnt listen to your music and i DIDNT DOWNLOAD YOUR FUCKING MUSIC<br><br>dont blame people that use torrenting as a way of sticking it to the companies that were going to fuck you in the ass anyway when the people you need to take it out on are the companies that are the reason people torrent music</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Rin Kajika / Ria Sakuragi<br><br>Search up the beach video on google</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You sound like some commie cunt.</br>  this tread become bad re#ed debate  You faggits should be so happy that "pirates" want to share your music. That's the new technology, deal with or be left in the dust you fucking whiney cunts.  <br>What does anarchy have to do with it? Companies aren't governments. <br><br>It seems you're essentially conceding that they're an issue. Then why support them?</br></br></br>  <br>Nor are pissy little cunts such as you. <br>Try your anarchist bullshit in NYC and get the shit beaten out of you.</br></br>  <br>Companies may not be governments<br>but most governments these days are treated as companies, and if its one company to another then the only thing that matters is money</br></br>  <br>#obamacare</br>  <br> TPB got shut down </br>  <br>I didn't vote for that crap.</br>   ░██████╗░██████╗░░░░░██╗███████╗░░<wbr>░░░█████╗░░░░░███████╗░█████╗░░████<wbr>██╗░░██████╗░░██████╗░████████╗</wbr></wbr> <br> ██╔═══██╗██╔══██╗░░░░██║██╔════╝░░<wbr>░░██╔══██╗░░░░██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔══<wbr>══╝░██╔════╝░██╔═══██╗╚══██╔══╝</wbr></wbr> <br>..██║░░░██║██████╔╝░░░░██║███████╗░<wbr>░░░███████║░░░░█████╗░░███████║██║░<wbr>░███╗██║░░███╗██║░░░██║░░░██║░░░<br> ██║░░░██║██╔═══╝░░░░░██║╚════██║░░<wbr>░░██╔══██║░░░░██╔══╝░░██╔══██║██║░░<wbr>░██║██║░░░██║██║░░░██║░░░██║░░░</wbr></wbr> <br>..╚██████╔╝██║░░░░░░░░░██║███████║░<wbr>░░░██║░░██║░░░░██║░░░░░██║░░██║╚███<wbr>███╔╝╚██████╔╝╚██████╔╝░░░██║░░░<br> ░╚═════╝░╚═╝░░░░░░░░░╚═╝╚══════╝░░<wbr>░░╚═╝░░╚═╝░░░░╚═╝░░░░░╚═╝░░╚═╝░╚═══<wbr>══╝░░╚═════╝░░╚═════╝░░░░╚═╝░░░</wbr></wbr> </br></wbr></wbr></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>and yet its saving peoples lives because they are no longer being forced into debt and bankruptc</br>  ..░██████╗░██████╗░░░░░██╗███████╗░<wbr>░░░░█████╗░░░░░███████╗░█████╗░░███<wbr>███╗░░██████╗░░██████╗░████████╗<br> ██╔═══██╗██╔══██╗░░░░██║██╔════╝░░<wbr>░░██╔══██╗░░░░██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔══<wbr>══╝░██╔════╝░██╔═══██╗╚══██╔══╝</wbr></wbr> <br>..██║░░░██║██████╔╝░░░░██║███████╗░<wbr>░░░███████║░░░░█████╗░░███████║██║░<wbr>░███╗██║░░███╗██║░░░██║░░░██║░░░<br> ██║░░░██║██╔═══╝░░░░░██║╚════██║░░<wbr>░░██╔══██║░░░░██╔══╝░░██╔══██║██║░░<wbr>░██║██║░░░██║██║░░░██║░░░██║░░░</wbr></wbr> <br> ╚██████╔╝██║░░░░░░░░░██║███████║░░<wbr>░░██║░░██║░░░░██║░░░░░██║░░██║╚████<wbr>██╔╝╚██████╔╝╚██████╔╝░░░██║░░░</wbr></wbr> <br> ░╚═════╝░╚═╝░░░░░░░░░╚═╝╚══════╝░░<wbr>░░╚═╝░░╚═╝░░░░╚═╝░░░░░╚═╝░░╚═╝░╚═══<wbr>══╝░░╚═════╝░░╚═════╝░░░░╚═╝░░░</wbr></wbr> </br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></wbr></wbr>  <br> using a proxy for streaming video </br>  <br>www demonoid ph<br>thepiratebay vg<br>kat cr<br><br>They all work now, are you a fagboi or something?</br></br></br></br></br>  kat.ph  <br>but u are living it ...also torrents as a way to escape the ....ahh nvm <br>USA THE BEST <br>HURR DURR FUCK U COMMIE IAM FREE</br></br></br>  <br>.cr m8 kat.cr</br>  <br>that was my point, cunt</br>  <br>When it comes to location locked content using a VPN proxy is fine in my book, but i still turn it off once the video starts loading because you no longer need it</br>  <br>I know shit's weird.</br>  <br> taking the comments point <br> using it as your own <br>what a fucking retard</br></br></br>  <br>You must be right you fucking cunt.

If you haven't worked them out by now, then the internet is not for you.  Honestly, pirating being a regular thing is sort of the more "commie" way of doing things. Everything is free and shared, of equal value regardless of its quality or quantity. In capitalism, you pay for everything, and decisions are based on choosing what is and isn't worth your money. Ideally in a pure ideal capitalist society, stealing isn't an option and what you have to spend is dependent on how much you contribute to society; how valuable you and your possessions are.<br><br>In a way, pirates support both total personal freedom AND communism.

Shota. It's called Shota, summerfag.  <br>I thought shota was on autosage?</br>  <br>Is this one even bumping?</br>  Bump                This Japanese text in the pictures is new.    <br>Do you mean the filenames? I think that's shotachan's fault</br>  <br><br> Shota autosages in first post.  <br> Use Sh0ta instead to please the reg fags. &gt;OP's posts dont bump a thread. Try to befriend your lurkers for bumps </br></br></br>  <br>That would explain it, though i havent tried yet.<br><br><br>All excellent advice. Although sometimes it's neccessary to change up the OP name for stealthiness.</br></br></br></br>  <br> hiding from something? <br>Why need so stealth?</br></br>  <br>General hooligans and ne're do wells.</br>  <br>Ah.... yes... those faggots</br>    <br>Tried earlier with Link but that was too ninja mode and specific.</br>  <br> Fairies <br>Gaaay<br> I love fairies </br></br></br>  <br>So no one got it.</br>  <br>I was wondering if that was a shota thread, i kind of figured, then other link guys popped up</br>  <br>Try some other cute sfw?</br>  <br>Yeah, and i felt bad since it was kind of a bait and switch who just wanted some wholesome Linkness.</br>  <br>Maybe, but i didnt know how clandestine i should get.</br>  <br> Implying people want "just wholesome Linkness" </br>  <br>He's khiuly.tumblr.com 's OC if you're curious<br>I think he likes to be sourced when his pictures are posted, so just saying it anyway</br></br>  <br>That one guy did at least, i think. Link crosses all borders being cool, cute, sexy, etc.</br>  <br>guess there's no good way to hide it in plain sight</br>  <br> not buying it </br>  <br>Trick is to do it just right, only when necessary of course. Takes practice i guess, hopefully it wont need to be done much.</br>    <br>its cute definitely<br><br><br>aw, well i enjoyed it anyway. And i loved that picture!</br></br></br></br>  <br>Guess so. Well i need to sleep. Good luck with this thread :)</br>  <br>Well mods arent here much anymore, or at least recently, so having these things on at all hours isnt too bad</br>        <br>I had some chores to do as well, if others keep it up or show up that would be great. If not than night everyone, till next time.</br>              <br>Always on the look out for good Links</br>          <br>There's plenty of other things to be wary of though.</br>  <br>Troll and shitposters?<br>Monsters abound here</br></br>  <br>that foot is horrifying...</br>  <br>Everywhere.

Most pawns are going to be at least half retarded though, that's true.</br>  <br>don't know why, but, this pic...... hnnnnggggggg..</br>  <br>sauce?</br>  <br>I feel exactly the same way</br>  <br>must have moar x.x</br>  <br>sorry. no, i saved it from one of these.</br>  <br>ehh, but, pawns. yes<br><br>Strangely before i was even done with the game, i had a couple very high-level pawns reoccurring in my game. One was a masquerade looking pawn boy, smaller so teenage looking, with a HUUGE greatsword, It was fun watching him cut down my monsters with ease. and even if he died, he always showed up wandering around my game again.</br></br></br>  <br>more in undies like this please</br>                <br>Ffft, you know what i thought of?<br> "Moon-chan, moon-chan, the chan that molds like dough" <br>Stupid Moon sand commercials!</br></br></br>    <br>dubs, yes.<br><br>Pawns. So sad. When i first played they were dumber than 4channers</br></br></br>        <br> Smoooooch <br> They're both completely asleep <br> They never talk about it again when they wake up. </br></br></br>      <br>Is it normal for boys to do this? Ive never done it. Or had a wet dream.</br>  <br> shrug </br>  <br>I just got into the game again, discovered the magic of the few lewd male clothing the game has.<br><br>Cassardi Hosen+ Cursed Kings Belt on a shota pawn is amazing.</br></br></br>    <br>I had a tendency to hug / molest the pillow when i was sleeping. Same with my brothers, usually woke up with them in a full hug with our legs wrapped around them.<br><br>I only ever got wet dreams when i went a few days without masturbating.</br></br></br>  <br>i would do it sometimes, why not?</br>    <br>Yeah, some of that clothing is very lewd. <br>After i found my favorite armor set, i gave my pawn better and better items.<br>He looked like a packmule.<br>It didnt help i was normally a sorcerer or magic archer, so he was like an apprentice</br></br></br></br>    <br>Did you make yourself the lewd shota or your pawn?<br><br>Because yeah bigger pawns make better pack mules for the higher encumbrance. Smaller shota arisen are really fast though so work well with the main character.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Just gets me every time</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>#TRIGGERED<br><br>SHE VOCALLY IDENTIFIES AS FEMALE IN THE ANIME!

Then aagain, i slept like a corpse. Flat on my back and unmoving. It freaked my mom out. I surrounded myself with pillows one time, like a coffin, i said.</br>  <br>fuck u nigga he kawaii as fuck</br>  <br>Sauce of the pic?</br>  <br>There's something about shotas and underwear that is just so magical, isnt there?<br><br>It's like boys and vidya. It's like a miracle of the universe they go together so perfectly.</br></br></br>  <br>SHE IS TRANS<br>REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE</wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>No, i made my pawn the shota, he was my hunter/assassin when i didnt need him as a magic-weilder.<br>Good magician, better assassin.<br> I only made him carry the important things i couldnt. Like fucktons of herbs and spring water.</br></br></br>  <br>Not sure, found it on /cm/. If you check it out, which you should be anyway for cute boys, they should have the sauce.</br>    <br>I slept pretty weird.<br><br>If i didnt have something in a full embrace with my legs wrapped around it i was sleeping with my legs crossed, as if i was sitting down. My parents even tried straightening out my legs as i slept but i just crossed them again later.</br></br></br>  <br>When I was about 8, my best friend who had a much deeper knowledge of sex (probably because he had a teenage brother) would fuck my ass. We called it "The Screw Lessons."</br>  <br>That always works too. with Sinew they still make decent item hoarders.</br>  <br>i have flexible ball-joints at the top of my legs so i sometimes sleep in this oddly-comfortable position with my left leg in an inverted V shape with the bottom of my right foot resting resting on my left side of my knee and the foreleg before the knee parallel to the bed. it props my blanket up like a tent.</br>  <br>It certainly is interesting how different everyone can be with that. Like i used to snore a lot too, but once i got my tonsils taken out i sleep so quietly. Made a huge difference.</br>  <br>After seeing a horror movie (i forget which), for a while i slept in a wierd 4 position</br>    <br>yay for diversity!<br> pic related <br><br> camera <br>please take a seat</br></br></br></br></br>      Armin Arlert                                <br>Young Marth molests shota Roy?</br>      <br>And....the picture reminded you of that?<br><br><br>Plus it just fit my own play style, he rushes in, draws the aaggro, i sweep the field <br><br><br>Eugh! Youre creepy!<br> Kidding of course, i had a friend would sleep with his legs open and feet together <br>Now that was weird to me</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Anon I got your back I think<br>http://yaoihavenreborn.com/doujinsh<wbr>i/ball-fetish<br>at least the same character maybe.</br></wbr></br></br>  <br>english<br>http://yaoihavenreborn.com/doujinsh<wbr>i/ball-fetish-english</wbr></br></br>  <br>Well, him and the warrior.
