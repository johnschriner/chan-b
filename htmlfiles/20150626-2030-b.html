[ You faggots will argue about anything.  Its obviously C what the fuck are you talking about   C. The same direction as the acceleration.   C  answer is A  force is always orthogonal to the tangent plane of the surface     you wot?    You are clearly the faggot, thinking we'll argue about tangents    Clearly A    Stop fucking this up for the rest of us   C   the fuck are you talking about    E   E  The smartest guy leaves without posting to this thread    It's obviously E you fetus fucking horsecunts  The centripetal force merely rotates the mud. The inertia at any given point is perpedicular to the center of the rotation. Removing the centripetal force stops rotation, and the mass continues with its momentum perpendicular to the center of rotation. C.   Everyone agree on C and OP's ruse will fail   this.  The answer is C.     P   Are you talking about normal reaction force? That seems wrong because the acceleration is more towards A    this. the answer is obviously E   The distance between the centre of the wheel and the point where the wheel touches the ground is a faggot.

HURR DURR I WORE THAT UNIFORM AND SO DID MY DED FWENDZ BOO-HOO.  Alright. Cool faggot. No one asked for you to join the army. Plenty of drop-outs and brain dead schmucks replenish recruitment every year. Just another societal fail-out crying over his precious army clan. Literally the equivalent of redditors and 4channers thinking their site(s) are secret/special. FUCK.      Do these ex-military just drive around and look for autists playing dress up to flex on?  What would be more entertaining is if they uploaded themselves getting chewed out by actual veterans. You know they have loads of video footage of them making mistakes.     I do it all the time to get discounts on meals and out of tickets. Its great and nothing wrong with it. But im smarter than these guys doing it.    Most of these ex-military are brainwashed meatheads, so they're just as bad as the autists pretending.  https://<span>youtu.be/Nf7x3zW67zE?t=2m39<wbr>s</wbr>  [ ]      This generation does.  What they're doing is illegal too, if I remember correctly. You're not supposed to be wearing your military uniform in public for any sort of demonstration of any kind.  And if I may borrow from that faggot Daniel Tosh, the physical aggression towards these fake military people is fucking assault.  As far as I know there's no law forbidding fat citizens from dressing like military.  Then again I'm not military myself.  But I'm way off point. This generation of military is more self-obsessed, entitled and worthless than any other generation we've ever had.  Even the fucking South in the Civil War conducted themselves with more dignity than these fucking losers.                glorious GI Bill tho    back in college days I used to keep the Marines recruitment folder in my car, which is basically the application   officer, please sir, I can't get a ticket because it will hurt my OCS candidacy   saved me hundreds of dollars, and I learned enough in college not to join military         yelling at someone is assault   ...right     Welcome to Walmart.    daniel tosh   faggot  good try        It's fucking lame. I bet after they tell some dumb guy with a military jacket to leave a public place and they turn off the camera, they high five each other (there's usually more than one of them) and immediately go find some light beer to celebrate and throw around the word 'bro'.   HUHUHUHUH SEE ME WHOOP HIS ASS, BRO?   YEAH BRO HUHUHUHUHUH   WE SHOWED HIM HOORAH   HOORAH BRO   *high five*   GOD BLESS 'MURICA            right? who would want to dress up like a child killing corporate automaton?   like the idiots that get pissed off by these dress up people more should do it! FUNNY AS FUCK   Stolen Valor Act  Anyway, pretty sure your "This generation is so self-centered" is just a case of "Kids these days!!!"  And yeah, it's not like vets are looking for it. But here's the thing; when you're military you are trained to examine every uniform you see so you can know who is who. So, when you're out and about and you see somebody wearing a uniform, and then you see them wearing a fucked up uniform, you know they're lying and trying to get attention for being something they're not.  It's like black people getting mad at the white bitch who said she was "Trans Darkie" because this white bitch is doing some stupid shit, this autist trying to get the attention for being in uniform is also doing some stupid shit.          yeah I'm talking about other vids that have been seen, some of these fucking military retards are shoving these people.     What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.     hmm.. something about those flapjack tits that's appealing to me..   Lets not forget how many women are raped in the military, and how many times it goes unreported, and all the fucking retards getting off the hook for raping the people in villages they're protecting or how about the guy who got in trouble for shooting some random dude in the ass with a sniper rifle for laughs.  I'd respect soldiers if they weren't such entitled faggots when they got back.  Not all of them are terrible, I understand that. But it's like the police force- the bad outshines the good.        Literally the equivalent of redditors and 4channers thinking their site(s) are secret/special.      I just find it hilarious to see these cringey doofuses getting caught playing dress-up  How is this different from real soldiers?     Because they're actually soldiers. That's a pretty retarded question to ask.   I don't know which is more pathetic, the fucking PVT's who served stateside and never saw any combat driving around all day until they find some dork pretending to be in the military, or the dorks themselves...   Dude your edges are showing! Sick burn brah!    Create a shitty flash RPG   no one downloads it, because shitty   go waste gas looking high and low for some LARPers   hit record on my phone and film me getting up in their faces telling them to take off their costumes because it's not real RP   I should know, I made a real game   MUH STOLEN MANA   It's that dumb.           ^ top of class navy seals, 300 confirmed kills. trained in gorilla warfare and top sniper in the entire US armed forces  Not realizing gorilla warfare was back in the 70's, also the most confirmed ever is less then 200  Tell me OP. how do you "confirm" you kill as a sniper or ground unit? your navy seal, but have full access to Marine Corps arsenal? Sounds to me you O-11!!! But even then O-11's can't have full access to marine's arsenal. Its different paper work  So as a navy seal the highest rank is O-5. So being a O-5 at top of class from E-6 but having O-11 clearing ....... Fuck you must own the Navy then right ? LMFAO!!  Go home New Fag, and if by chance your navy seal .. There's only a hand full of them , easy to track and i'll have you discharged and thrown in the brig for out lashing and terrorism against your country .           Well, he did point out that the guy was falsely wearing CIBs, which indeed could be found punishable under the Stolen Valor Act.  However, there's another aspect to that law, which is using those false badges to obtain "money, property, or other tangible benefit".  tangible benefit  Getting warm fuzzies from roleplaying as a veteran isn't a tangible benefit. The recorder has no proof that the guy used those badges for anything more. It's kind of sad that a soldier doesn't know the specifics of a law that directly affects him, or that he's cherry-picking parts of the law so he can shame some fatty in public, but I'm not surprised.       STOLEN VALOR!!!!  YOU DIDN'T SERVE, YOU PIECE OF SHIT  GET THE FUCK OUT OF THIS PUBLIC SPACE       being 12 yo, such as yourself, there isn't any difference    LOL    wasn't in the video, but the guy is at a mall, not inconceivable that he wore the camo pajamas to get discounts    This.    if it was illegal there wouldn't be military surplus stores in every shit town across America, and they CERTAINLY wouldn't sell that shit to civilians.    had me fooled until i saw the boots, those aren't regulation    Hey man, I just said that because I literally had nothing else to post on my computer right now, man. I swear I wasn't trying to offend you.    Your mom is illegal, fucking beaner.    10 fucking % big deal   Having spent 8 years getting brainwashed, I could give two fucks who wears any sort of uniform. I see you out, wearing a uniform, I sure as fuck am not going to strike upa convo with you. If it makes the dude feel good, helps him score a little ass or a free cheeseburger, more power to him.  well when us men and women go and fight for you rights , to lie and b.s online like your a fucking hardcore soldier . Ya, it bothers me and fellow soldiers and etc.   So get off your damn computer and stop being a fake punk ass cunt before you get hurt  *get out of here         This generation of military is more self-obsessed, entitled and worthless than any other generation we've ever had.   This generation of everything is more self-obsessed, entitled and worthless than any other generation we've ever had.  And they learned it from their shit-tier baby boomer parents. Parents that spent their lives raping the country of money so that they could buy bigger TV's and go on expensive vacations. And fuck whoever had to pay it back, it's not their problem. Of course, they taught their kids the exact same "values" while also sucking each other off over how "progressive" they were by not spanking their shithead offspring and this is what we get.        nice comeback retard.  Is that all you have to say in the face of the truth? why don't you masturbate to loli cuck traps or whatever the fuck you summerfags are obsesed with these fucking days.       Thanks for taking me back to 1985 with that vintage mom joke.   Stolen Valor Act of 2013 - Amends the federal criminal code to rewrite provisions relating to fraudulent claims about military service to subject to a fine, imprisonment for not more than one year, or both an individual who, with intent to obtain money, property, or other tangible benefit, fraudulently holds himself or herself out to be a recipient of:  a Congressional Medal of Honor, a distinguished-service cross, a Navy cross, an Air Force cross, a silver star, a Purple Heart, a Combat Infantryman's Badge, a Combat Action Badge, a Combat Medical Badge, a Combat Action Ribbon, a Combat Action Medal, or any replacement or duplicate medal for such medal as authorized by law.                 fight for you rights  Oh, you mean like escorting Halliburton oil trucks?  I feel safe as fuck.       I think we're missing the big picture here guys  who the fuck cares      I hope they fuckin lynch that kid. Little punk trying to steal my shine.    any fag that wears anything military related is a cringey doofus    I masturbate to your mom, faggot.     I SERVED MY COUNTRY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF DISCOUNTS, HOW DARE YOU SKIP A STEP      muh valur     i hate when anyone wears it in public just for benefits or fashion  very few people really deserve extra benefits for their service  and so when a fake dude is doing it that super lame and he should just get his ass kicked  no reason to get mad or anything just smack him around a bit          Pot calling the kettle black, the only newfag here is you   I'm gonna join the military so I can harass fat kids at malls who wear camo cargo shorts and chase them around with a camera screaming "STOLUN VALURR!"   why do you care? I have a few bdu blouses that I wear fishing. Bought them at the px in Baumholder long ago, but they are mosquito resistant (nothing is MN mosquito proof). Was asked about it, I have no rank or insignia on them, so fuck off. And if someone feels the need to impersonate asomeone, who am I or you to tell them no?    You should, it's your duty as an american to do so.    That guy in the video is a ranger, so hes definitely not stupid.     blouses  Either female, or gay     gotta love carlin      army is dumb   You can't get anywhere in the army without some form of higher education. You can't even reach Sargent without having at least a bachelors and even then that's the minimum. If you aren't going above what's asked of you then you can't expect to go to the board    drop outs  You need a highschool diploma to enlist.  You're totally right no one asked him to enlist that's why the dude is so passionate about it. He chose to put his life on the line.       Y u mad, faggot?  Anyone who was or is in the military is a little bitch with serious mental issues and mommy problems.  Kill yourself op       As opposed to shit talking on the Internet and doing nothing meaningful with your life.     Its like the police force the bad outshines the good.  Confirmed for retarded, most millitary and cops are pretty chill.      Sargent  Lol     ^^    I am not exactly a patriot but honestly you cannot compare this website to the military, thats ignorant. Those people did something special regardless of what you think about military involvement    neither.. they are called blouses. I know you are just trolling, but replied anyway as I am drunk. Off from today until 6 Jul.. good to be me    ^^ also     reading comprehension   0       Those people did something special regardless of what you think about military involvement  killing children with drones is now special  people who suck military dick are the biggest sheep faggots in the world      Real men EARN their medals.   pic related      Woopsies   Itt: butthurt psychopaths with legally owned assault weapons   They were so worthless and retarded that the only thing they could do with their lives were to join the military.   There is no noble sentiment behind this, other than to get some benefit from Uncle Sam, like muh free college.   Most of the people I know in the Army and whatnot spend most of their time dicking around on base and social media all day long.        Thats where you misunderstood me, I never said something honorable or totally despicable, thats up to your perception, perhaps "special" was not the correct word.     Those people did something special  In the Phillip K Dick sort of special   you have read "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep" Haven't you? or are you just a stupid faggot?       Awwww baby wants to cry about it? AWWWWWWWW come to daddy and cwy faw meeee   yfw, fucking gay bitch.       It's "guerrilla", not "gorilla". One is irregular warfare, and the other is an ape.    Coming from someone who's done plenty of things against Geneva like laze buildings and caves to get WP'd it'd really help your case if you didn't scream baby rapists at any possible serviceman.      vets are looking for it. But here's the thing; when you're military you are trained to examine every uniform you see so you can know who is who.   implying the majority of mil give a fuck what your uniform looks like.  Not to mention separate branches. Unless you're doing coalition shit. It's more fucking stupid of these people to wear a uniform out in public when they could just counterfeit a mil ID.  That's what cracks me up        My point exactly...now go use that assault rifle to shoot up a movie theatre and then an hero, for your country.    I know men and women who have joined the military with straight A's and I also know people who were complete fucking morons join. I never argued for or against them but comparing them to an image board is fucking stupid mate    I'll wait for you to go see the next MLP movie to do that, you fucking piece of shit.    It's not that you're looking for it, it's that you just automatically see it. If there's a uniform your reaction is to instantly see if you need to salute or something. That's why vets would even notice in the first place.    Last version of the Stolen Valor Act was invalidated by SCOTUS in United States v. Alvarez. I don't expect this one will fare any better.   I fight towelheads to protect the US Constitution    Arrest that scumbag for exercising his First Amendment rights.        You so mad right now kek    This.  The butthurt is strong in this generation.      I have read this book, I cannot say it made me smarter, What "special" are you referring to? (have not read it in a while just remember deckard? was a bounty hunter, deals with humanity and empathy and all that jazz)   either post more videos or shut the fuck up    Or what? XD     Awwwwwwwww how many niggers did you suck off today? HA! I'm fucking kekking my brains out right now, holy jesus you're a fucking bitch ass faggot. Get fucked by the taliban please :)))))   Jesus, these threads are more cringed than the videos.   People who have never served talking about the military is like 8 years olds arguing about calculus. I'm not saying this to be snooty, but Jesus do some fucking research before shitting opinions everywhere.      Fraud is protected by the first amendment.    Valor. Hah. Honor. Questionable. Douchebag? Yes.   Well, unless you yourself are in uniform, it doesn't really make a difference. But I can understand having a knee-jerk reaction to check for their rank and then noticing it blatantly being fucked.  Otherwise, officers and enlisted alike go out of their way to avoid saluting. As long as it isn't obvious     :^)   pls don't kill me in my sleep, Mr Vining     https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=RDs<wbr>ugXhWx_4</wbr>  [ ]  Probably the worst     "All I do is go out on missions."  Suuuuure, fatty, suuuuuure.   I don't care if some fatty want's to pretend to be a man and dress up like GI Joe, but it's when he opens his fat mouth is when he earns a bitchslap. Get a fucking life, fatass.   I used to go to a club in Oakland, where this pencil necked little geek would come in with a full cop outfit on, but without a gun. He'd have a soda, and stand in back against the wall and not talk to anyone. The bartender said he was harmless, the cops said as long as he doesnt say he's a cop, it's legal. He just wanted to wear a cop uniform. He was a wierdo, just like the guys who waddle around in army costumes.   Calling them out is funny. Fuck it. But if you'd rather be a faggot and cry about mean soldiers, have at it - that's legal too.              (SCOTUS) #   &gt;Fraud is protected by the first amendment.   Fixed that for you, monkey       Its truely sad that something so simplistic as a bully over the internet can anger you so much. Also your life is revolved around military shit like the taliban?  Sorry youre so messed up in the head bro.     this. pretending to in the US army is like pretending to be a wal-mart greeter.   What if the soldier is real and has P.T.S.D and this guy goes to give him this "test" and it makes the guy flip out? I don`t feel like this guy thinks this shit through very well, I also think he has no job.

My Nigga.     the video description "Found this hero in Pasadena California pretending to be a soldier. I learned more than I needed to." This is a sketch performed by two Veterans turned Actor/Comedians. Enjoy      this generation   this generation  Every time. Who's even talking about any generation in particular? With how needlessly aggressive you are, it almost seems like you're the butthurt one here.     Army Ranger here ask me anything   It a satire of stolen valor. This is fake toast bro.    This The army are pawns for the rich to use.        This generation  Because this isn't humanity throughout time and space in a nutshell...    Without getting into any politics Ill say this. Any veteran (combat or not) can spot a bullshitter a mile away.   Marine vet here. Iraq and Afghanistan. 1 CAR. These fakers prey on civilians who have no clue. I love seeing this shit.      Assuming he's military because his one comment invalidates your bullshit  This is great kek      Will you gift me Ark survival evolved on steam    Hilarious that all your "hard work" and "valor" lead you right back to 4chan.    Marine vets that campaigned in Iraq and Afghanistan go to 4chan?    Can I steal your valor? I want some free slices at sbarro's    It's a requirement that you browse 4chinz after you shoot towel heads.    No that game doesn't have wieners   Yes but make sure you wear fucking multicam so you don't look like a fucking idiot      You say that as if he is walking backwards... It's a fucking message board you knob goblin. If he wants to go here, he will go. The fuck does hard work and valor have to do with typing an address into a web browser?     message board    <br/>   lost it.... omfg    I sell propane and propane accessories, waht do you want from me?     my favorite part about serving is people like you i get paid (your tax dollars) to shoot things.  litereally they just hand me thousands of dollars of bullets  no other occupation could i have done the things i've done, the sense of pride when i put on the uniform is unmatched and you sit there with your code red and cheetos and i know you play COD pretending to be me while simultaneously talking shit on the internet.  well sir,  i may not agree with what you have to say but i will defend to the death your right to say it.

HURR DURR I WORE THAT UNIFORM AND SO DID MY DED FWENDZ BOO-HOO.  Alright. Cool faggot. No one asked for you to join the army. Plenty of drop-outs and brain dead schmucks replenish recruitment every year. Just another societal fail-out crying over his precious army clan. Literally the equivalent of redditors and 4channers thinking their site(s) are secret/special. FUCK.           When copy/paste goes WRONG    Fucking classic.    You're the type of soldier that needs to get his legs blown off.    actually i've thought about if that were to happen. wouldnt care.  id get myself some prosthetic legs. run marathons and raise money for vets.       What the fuck am I looking at?    To be honest, reddit is full of scumbags who receive karma and even fucking MONEY for something someone else posted. .     nigger     Not realizing gorilla warfare was back in the 70's   Not realizing gorilla warfare   gorilla   Go home New Fag, and if by chance your navy seal    what happened to this place....           step on a landmine. hell step on two for us. you're a pos and your commanding officer should just shoot you by "accident"     Carlos Hathcock (1942 – 1999), renowned United States Marine Corps sniper with 93 confirmed kills.

Whats the point of having them if no one else sees them?    That might be fake. It's a video on his channel. Unless it's real and he reposted it.      That's not Walmart    I'm currently serving in the Australian Army and I can say from a military perspective 90% of soldiers hate going out in their cams and only do it when there's no other option.   I understand the whole worshipping the troops in afghanistan thing is annoying. They don't fight for our freedom or rights but they do kill lots of assholes involved in extremist groups. I can't say I really care about civilian casualties, and you would be lying if you said you cared. Little achmed from a shitty rock house out in the middle of no where does not matter at all to you or me. period.    I wear my ex roommates Army fatigues all the time, he didn't pay rent one month so I took some of his uniforms. My favorite part is all the people who tell me "Thank You." and some of them even call me a hero. My exroommate was a real lazy shithead, who did horrible in Highschool and I can't believe at all the respect he gets for free just by wearing Camo in public.    The life expectancy in Afghanistan has risen 21 years since the us led invasion in 2001.    thank you for your service.     Once your here, your here forever.      FYI  The US military has a normal rate of suicide. Many aged 50+, Vets who were never in combat. Coincidently, the Army requires IQ testing, such as ASVAB during recruiting. These are the same idiots who do not make it to high ranks or high paying jobs such as jet mechanics or covert intel.  http://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/06/0<wbr>3/iq.men.suicide/  The highest suicide rates are males in all age groups, all whom tested low intelligence. Any time someone complains about military suicides, it has nothing to do with the military, but the fact that people with low IQs are failures in life and in death.  </wbr>       The US army also has high rates of RAPE. The AirForce as well as Marines rape many female soldiers. Google that up.   people on /k/ e-mailed him one time and he wrote back.     You don't operate, do you son?

I feel bad for his wife because even in the end she realizes how asinine he's acting.    Seriously. I fucking love my job. As an 11B my whole purpose is to shoot stuff and run around innawoods. And I get paid for it. It sucks at times, but I get to look at that flag on my shoulder and remember why I'm doing it.    underrated post    New boot detected.    That's so disgraceful. Thank god we have REAL heroes like the dude shouting obscenities around a bunch of 4-year-olds.    WHOS UR FUKIN STAFF SARGENT    He could get the dick    Yes actually. However guns were my hobby long before the military and I'm pretty damn sure I'll still have pride in my nation a long time from now. It'll always be worth it.      This. Only disgusting moralfags care.  inb4 newfags calling anyone edgy        Be careful where you swing those edges around, cunt.    As you said, most military/police are pretty cool, however they still have a bad reputation. Therefore, the small minority of shitty ones get more focus than the majority.

Do you laugh at your own posts all the time? Or just this thread.    Kek!!!   OP here. I'm not married nor old enough to have a kid.  Can someone please repost the pictures OP deleted?  what does /b/ drive &lt;pic related   Wow gay   How is an FD gay? Pretty cheap coming from someone who still uses public transport    Beautiful FD man. Ripped any mad skidz lately? here's my love machine    Honda all the way   How much did you pay for your fd anon?    its mad in the twisties m8   My car   Whoa how did you get it onto the ceiling    bout $16,000 usd    fucking aussie    Because most americans, like that guy, seem to think they are able to judge about cars. While the us hasn't produced anything other than a pile of dogshit for as long as mankind can remember.  but muh muscle car       Not sure honestly   2014 F150 King Ranch  CBR master race reporting in  Cars are sloooow   and 2007 Civic Si   legend 93   that a 1000?   2014 R/T Blacktop Edition.   just a 600    and 2013 Triumph Daytona 675R    Fuck.yes.    Genuine question. Why do people in the US insist on driving ridiculously large truck when they are living in the suburbs. It's not like you need to drive a mud path to work everyday.      alfa 147 its shit     still nice m8     rio  hey /b/  I'm rolling in a AW-11. my project is a Hachi-roku. before my aw-11, I had a miata I named Julia... I miss her   Beautiful FD. is it twin turboed?         U.S. Anon here. Honestly I don't know, they look like shit, and they kill their gas mileage, knows nothing about drag or aerodynamics. I hate duelies and lifted trucks.      Forgot to mention 2012 gt 5.0 litre    old picture now with new seat and white handlebar tape     Shelby  Don't just blindly hate, you sound like a brand sheep right now.     I don't know why everyone insists that my truck has to be beaten to shit and covered in mud all the time. I use it to haul my motorcycle around, and I work with semi trucks so I get to fuck around with a lot of big, heavy parts that won't fit in the trunk of my Civic.    Some of them use them for work. But it is typically pointless to have one. It's such a waste of gas. But I have one myself so whatever    Don't hate because import cars aren't economic unless you're driving an econo box civic    So how about that new Super Snake? Personally I think the price is ridiculous.    nah i switched to single turbo, better for power band   it's the only thing I could afford but it's kind of comfy  2006 BMW 330i, Bonestock but one of the few manual e90 3 series   Price is basically double for a shelby   You don't tug on super mans cape, you don't spit into the wind, you don't pull the mask of an old Lone Ranger and you don't mess around with Jim   That's not the point, it's that it's trashy and all for image. It's almost equivalent to people that rice their vehicles, it's completely pointless. There's no benefit to lifting a truck except to increase your rollover and look like an idiot (I'm talking about street people here, if you live in he mountainous or rocky regions out there, by all means, lift it, that at least serves a purpose)    Well then you have a reason. But 90% of the people who own one use it to bring their kids to school.     The us version looks awful, but still a nice car, with a nice engine    u wot m8    swanky. She looks clean, mate. do you slide with her?   also, my miata till I sold her :(      I'm curious if Saleen will step out and make a Mustang.     My '79   Ok appart from that one and maybe 2 or 3 others.   2010 honda accord. With all of the options, I really like it. What I don't like is the nigger that scratched my bumper and headlamp a few months ago.  70 Nova Hatchback   Trash miata it's a girl car    Nice car OP.  My 200sx      They just did one for the 2015 gt Slehby will do the 2016 edition next year hopefully     well kids are gay and I don't drive it when I don't need to because the bike and the civic both get over 30mpg. I will admit that the only reason I lifted it and put bigger tires on it was purely for aesthetics, just looked fucking horrible stock.    I think you might also be looking too narrow as well. A lot of American vehicles are great for the class that they're in. Sure muscle stand alone doesn't compete much with import tuner because they both have pros and cons, but many different muscles are great to see against each other, and also just for the love of the drive.    Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga I'll fuck yo ass up    yeah she likes to stick her hips out in the bends   sorry you had to part with her m8       No hatchbacks before 73     Yeah you might as well. Nothing looks more retarded then a truck with tiny wheels.    S2000   Pics of hachi pls    I fucking love s2k's     horizon absolute helmet  My nigga     thats an s15, mate.     K  :^)      Historically, my cars have been old enough to vote. But right now, I'm driving a 'hand me down' from my wife.  It's a kia rio, and since it slipped off the road one rainy day, about a foot of the rear bumper is missing. Also the driver door handle was ... mishandled? And now I have bright orange bailing twine wrapped around what's left of the door handle, slipped through the door, to a knot around the interior handle which still works. The seal on the trunk has failed so last winter, all the rain that made it into the spare-tire wheel well sloshed into the back and made the rear carpet wet enough to sustain grass, seeded by the two times I had to throw a bale of hay in the back seat  In short, I drive a mess.        Baby won't you come my wayyyy got something I want to sayyy   It's Australian delivered, her in aus it's a 200sx.     It's Australian delivered, her in aus it's a 200sx.    Love the FD.

I know you probably are running 300zx brakes no?    get some bigger rims and fatter rubber and that thing would be perfect    Not sure if its turbo but I'm willing to tune the shit out of it!

Stay driving, mate.    Forgot the photo, fuck.   Im gonna buy some acid soon /b. What do i need to know? What should I expect?  I took two hits of average quality acid for my first time. I felt very high. Like I felt like a weed high at first because I just had a huge laughing fit when it began to kick. Fuck it. Green text story time.   Be 19   Take LSD for the first time   Drop tabs at 8:30   Get smokes and go to bank and finally arrange for food   About 9:15 we begin Mario Kart while we waited for the 45 minute pizza buffet fiesta to arrive   Around 9:30 we were all set up and about to race   I start race   We begin then suddenly friend 1 says we forgot to plug in this psychedelic light and turn off the regular light   We can't get light to work   I feel tingly   Realize Mario is going on while we fucked with the lights   All three of us at starting line   LAUGHING FIT ENSUES                 15 minutes of pure indescribable Terror that you will remember for the rest of your lie   pro tip: Don't unless you're ready     Start with a normal dose (70-100 ug)  When it starts working you might feel tingly and funny and slowly the visuals start coming. You can expect visuals /hallucinations like seeing objects move/breathe, everything is more detailed and beautiful, your senses are working better. When the trip progresses you might think about life and stuff and philosophe (however its written) or you might just have tons of fun and laugh, enjoy everything. It will take about 8 hours in total. Don't be a controlfreak just let yourself go and become one with everything. I advice some nice music. If you are scared for a bad trip you can buy a benzodiazepine like xanax to be sure and take it when you lose yourself. Remember It's you who creates the feelings, acid is love. Have fun.     15 minutes?  Terror ?  Lol Please stfu. I've taken acid at least 15 times and sometimes at a high dosage and never had a bad trip. I had some difficult moments ofcourse but nothing traumatizing.        It almost felt like God was tickling my brain. I couldn't stop laughing at the fact this game has been going on for about 10 minutes now.   Try to play Mario Kart   All sense of urgency gone   We end up just zoning and talking  Suddenly pizza man  Maintain composure and go and pay for pizza   I dun did good   Listen to music and chill out for the peak   Go out and cruise the town on my longboard around 2 am   Didn't sleep, felt effected by it until 5-6am   Smoked weed to cook breakfast   Kicked back in and was feeling it again   The weed the day after made it feel like it was coming back on almost. This was a social expirence and I had little visuals.  Seeing colors in black and white photos   Lighting angles were changing wall colors in rooms (ie sitting on the left side of the coach, the room looked yellow and the further down you went it turned the walls yellow-orange-red)   Rings in the wood flooring were dancing around when I wasn't looking at them directly   Was out in the rain for a part of my trip, didn't even notice it was raining   Didn't realize until I came inside and everything was dry   Clouds were like super fucking 3D looking                       Search 'artificial intelligence dreams' ounce you enter the zone.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;624087103  related   When you are coming up (first hour or two after taking the acid) you will be super antsy and restless. Then BOOM.  spiders   One piece of advice that nobody gave me if don't smoke weed the first time you drop. I smoked like 4 bowls about 30 minutes after taking 2 hours my first time and had the worst 8 hours of my life after that     Also, I have HPPD and see visual snow or whatever you want to call it, and I was seeing complicated geometric shapes within the the staticy particles in my field of vision.     Good advice, im a regular smoker but smoking weed during acid makes me think more negative, more paranoid and generally ruins the trip.      Yeah same. I meant to say I smoked about 30 minutes after dropping 2 hits. After the last bowl the acid hit me like a ton of bricks. About 10 minutes of laughing at my cat for no reason then 4 out 5 hours of a bad trip. It was honestly the worst feeling I've ever had in my life.   Look at this picture while tripping and be amazed.  Most advice has been given already. Make sure it doesn't get to crowded around you and if you do it with friends make sure they dont fuck with you. It's all about peace, laughter and happiness man.   That sucks, after I've seen someone go bad and experience hell, i always bring 1 or 2 benzodiazepines with me just in case someone loses it.    Expect nothing you have ever experienced before (unless you've done similar psychedelic drugs). My advice: turn your cell phone off, do it with a small group of close friends and make sure you have nothing important to do the next day. If you don't live in in urban area, it may be fun to be outdoors, but I would avoid contact with other people not on it.    Agree    Still have it to this day (its been about 5 or 6 years), but it has cleared up substantially to where I don't even realize it most of the time   Thanks guys! Any trippy pictures I should look at?   Mm, i have that visual snow too. But it doesnt really bother me. Also when i stare at the ground for a minute i can make it move and breathe acid like. It doesn't conflict with my daily life at all though so It's more fun then annoying. I dont think It's really HPPD because people with HPPD tend to hate it right and it seems worse. Did you hate it at first?    Here is a gift for your first journey  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=fYd<wbr>aHaNRMKg</wbr>  [ ]       Is a good one.   I recommend beautiful nature pics. The acid will make it crazy beautiful anyway so you dont need over the top crazy ass pictures. Go outside and walk in nature if you live close to some green area.       I did and, although it didn't directly interfere with daily life, it caused me a great deal of anxiety for the first couple of months   question for anons with the know how, how the fuck do i get LSD? all the dealers I know dont know anyone who has it or are too fucking lazy to pick up. Now that silk road is a dead end, where can I get some acid? I really love mushrooms and want to try acid but for the love of me i cant get my hands on it   also checkem    Maybe you are kinda sensitive to LSD +weed. That combo is deadly, not literally, to a lot of people. I've also heard about people who did the combo that had flashbacks while smoking weed. Luckily i haven't experienced bad flashbacks or something. I only had a subtile and funny one while smoking weed, the visuals came back a little that was fun (2 weeks after dropping acid)      Where do you live? It depends so much on that. Here in Holland It's easy as taking a shit to find good LSD.      Watch Planet Earth, i swear to god i was in the fucking jungle the first time i dropped acid while watching that    Sorry man it's either you know someone or you dont. Odds are you have those dealers who only sell weed. I got lucky and have like 5 friends who can get me acid. Id advise that you ask around to see if your friends can hook you up. Thats the best you can do    Confirmed nice dubs    I live in alberta canada, its somewhat rare but not impossible to find i guess. All the connects I got are somewhat useless though    yeah that seems like the only way to go, thanks    I dunno then m8, id say find people who drop acid a lot and ask them. Here i can just send an e mail to a dealer i know and have it delivered to me by mail in an envelop.    Not that fag but I took acid about 15 times and never had a bad trip. Then I got some shit and took it by myself without knowing the potency, turned out to be the strongest acid ive ever done and I had a horrible trip. Give it time, play with the fire enough and you will get burned.    No one told me this before I first tripped a couple weeks ago. Buy gum, your ody is going to really tense the entire time and you might grind you teeth. And absolutely have a sitter, I thought I could take it alone, took two hits, and as soon as I felt it I instamtely got an extremely overwhelming sense of loneliness. But then I went outside and all was good. Do it outside, walk a forest preserve trail, you'll thank me.   is acid worth the risk of hppd? is it rare? can it be prevented somehow?   Beach tripping is epic, hands down the most beautiful and visually stunning trip I have ever had was walking the beach at 3am smoking a joint while frying on an lsd+mda combo.    Maybe but i always take it with respect and i go in with an attitude like even a bad trip can be positive in the sense it may learn me a lot about myself. We'll see how it turns out in the future.   listen to every mgmt song and you'll have an awesome time   you'll need a copy of this replay as necessary    Bring drunk and on acid is pretty fun. I would say that one can control, as silly as that may sound to some, the feelings or visual one has. If you are weak minded in the sense that you care what others think of you and their opinion, you can fall into a bad trip quite easily. A strong consciousness can greatly increase your trip and really have a profound effect on how you act and react to new things or ideas. I've done acid at least 5-6 times too and its usually chill as fuck. Dont go over board because you can easily do that.   Don't recognize that at all, in acid. Are you sure you didnt take mdma? Lol   Welp im going to sleep guys. Thanks for everything. Your advice really truly helped me and i wish I could smoke a bowl with all of you guys. Goodnight and again, thanks.   Dude acid is really fun man don't be scared to do too much you want the full effect but you should ask about its potency from the dealer. Took about 5 Lucy trips everyone of them fucking great, one with mdma which was stupid fun. Stay away from the shrooms, recently tried for the first time 2 weeks ago and I had a scary as trip, had myself convinced I was dying and I was about to call for help. Shrooms are bad news man specially if you take enough and are in a weird environment   Cringe Thread   I am very curious as to where you took this picture from      not OP but i saw this picture floating around about a year ago.. maybe 2 years ago.. dunno if its older then that or not   To be fair that girl is really fucking tall    ...no fucking way       LMFAOOOOOOOOOOO       I currently lave a 2.1 gpa   Ughhhh       2.1 GPA   Superior man here   Millions off my art   Don't you have any honor?
