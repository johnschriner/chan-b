A whole goddamn year she's been gone, and I've been in denial about it, thinking she just moved on from us and is busy as a chef which she finally became. I needed that picture, I even have it up on my fucking skype. And now she's gone, the world is without her cooking, her drawings, and her voice.

I'll start with some OC of my own.<br> 24, suffer with anxiety, depression, mild OCD, Tourettes, autism <br> basically nightmare fuel for being around people <br> moved last year to new province for work reasons <br> all friends, GF ,everything ive known for 13 years left behind <br> Spend most of a year trying and trying with people, manage to find a friend or two, get menial factory job, sucks, but it pays well, and helps me grow more confident in talking to people <br> Finally meet deccent girl,seems to see past the mental mess I am, spend time together, she still seems into me <br><br>fast forward to tonight<br> asked If she could stay over, we'd have a movie night with booze ect <br> happy as fuck, finally I get to fall asleep next to someone, instead of on my couch drunk as usual <br> spend most of day cleaning apartment top to bottom, go out and buy all kinds of munchies, booze ect <br> ask at 8 if shes coming <br> wont give me a straight answer, says she wants too, seemed like she was coming <br>well. its 1am now, and clearly she isn't coming. I understand if she dosent want to be mixed up with some skinny social reject. But how hard is it just to make up an excuse. I would have much prefered that, to sitting alone watching the clock tick off,feeling worse by the hour.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I just got into another argument with my girlfriend. She says she might leave for real this time. I can't handle that. We've both been depressed for years. All I do is try to make her happy because I can't make myself happy. Now I realize I cant do either. Maybe I'll just take all the pills left in the cabinet since I all I've ever done is upset people.  <br>I know the feel, btw. Made that up there before i read the OP because I'm a selfish asshole. Asperger's fucks you up.</br>  <br>Killing yourself wont solve a thing. Your problems or hers. Actually it'll just upset her more and probably send her over the edge with guilt. If things aren't working out then maybe its time to call it quits. Take some time for yourself. Enjoy your life day to day. Go out and meet some people.</br>  <br>But I can't do that. I've built up my life around her for the past 4 years. She was the first person, let alone a girl, to listen to me. And if I go out and try to meet new people, I'll just wind up having panic attacks in public.</br>    <br>I know how that is. I built my life around my best friends for a good 13 years, As messed up as I am, and believe me I was worse back then. Actually have some control over it now. Somehow managed to get laid a few times. Booze gives me confidence. But I lost the only stable base I had last year. Still haven't recovered from that. We all had issues, but we all stuck together , just a bunch of misfits who had fun together. Now im just alone. And I cant go back.</br>  <br><br>this was meant for you</br></br>  <br>But I'm scared of myself. I don't want to be alone.</br>  <br>This. Fucking. Gif.<br>Never cried so much 'till tonight</br></br>  <br> all self diagnosed </br>  <br>I didn't either. Through all the hurt and bullshit ive been through ive basically just become accustomed to it. Sort of prefer it now. Planning to get my truck licence and go long haul for awhile. Least ill be able to travel and make money while being alone. Maybe ill fit in there, since the industry is full of social rejects.</br>  I'll dump some  <br>I'm afraid I don't have complete control of my actions.

Perhaps this wasn't the one but you'll find one who will accept who you are eventually. As much as it seems counter-intuitive, don't worry about it. You are not a mess. You just have to get some things in your life straightened out before you can accept who the real you is. A factory job IS menial, but it allows you to see a different side of life and possibly move on to something more meaningful. Think of what you want to do. It may seem impossible now but you are capable of achieving it or motivate yourself to achieve new goals. Therapists may help, drugs definitely do, but the only thing that can help yourself is you. As an anon on the most hated part of the internet, I believe in you as much as that matters because I've been in your shoes.

Seeing some of these moments through a screen have been the hardest thing I've ever done in my life, but what really got me. What really hit me so hard I fell overboard was his first word was dad.

I've relapsed into my pitiful life before, and I feel like she can see it. I just don't have a will to go on.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I started have a beer after my workouts. It of course turned into 2...3...4 a night until I finally was going out to bars. Every night was some excuse...I started smoking cigs again. I made bar friends. I was getting in fights. I was fucking women. I was losing a lot of money at the casino. I was just plain fucking up. Still everyday I went on skype and acted like nothing was wrong. I get on there and act like nothing was happening behind the scenes. Then a detective shows up at my house. Someone claims I raped them....a women I had sex with a few weeks ago ended up being married and got caught by her husband. She crys rape. I'm under investigation. Unless I beat this thing 100% then there will be no chance of me going back to UK in the near future. I'm having withdraws from alcohol because I cold turkeyed it. I'm seeing things right now walking around. Just those words are going to haunt me forever. My son won't know unitl he's old enough. After all I was military man. Killed assholes, been blown up, I'm hard as fuck all. Who knew the words of a child, a butterfly even, could create a tsunami on the other side of the world.<br><br>con't</br></br></br></br>  <br>Bump. Anyone out there?</br>    <br>Bro,stop, I know those feels. Don't do it. Besides, how can you feel sad after seeing this...watch it. Its a good show. It always cheers me up.</br>  <br/>   went to feels thread <br> didn't get feels <br> realize these threads are like giving morphine to someone with joint problems <br>they help, for awhile anyway. However the loneliness will return, as usual, and you'll carry on until the next thread.<br><br>Its better to get out of the cycle. Get up, go talk to someone, go do something different with your life. Just do anything to get you out of the situation you're in right now.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>wanted to write my ex yesterday but didn't do it.<br><br>she is still my definition of a dream girl</br></br></br>  <br>fuxk</br>  <br>I fucking feel so great!<br>I am happy and things will get even better.</br></br>  <br>boost confidence?<br>no way.<br>man, exercising isn't about boosting confidence, it's about being healthy,<br>regulating your hormones, <br>actually caring about your life...<br><br>trust me, many of your depressed feelings will go away after a solid week of exercise... it can work wonders :)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>sure man</br>  At first, I was upset when I realized no one ever listened to me. Friends, family, hell, even fucking strangers I'd hold doors for. It was like I didn't even exist. What upsets me now is that I've just accepted it. The only people who might possibly listen to me are strangers on the internet. Why should I even bother anymore. There's no point in waking up anymore, /b/ros.  <br>Hey man, what's going on?</br>  <br>Still. I can't exercise anyway. If I want to regulate my hormones, my only options are drugs which I'm already on.</br>  <br>Damn /b/ro, that sucks. Girls are pro flakers. Distract yourself. Enjoy the rest of your night</br>  <br>If your life based on ego has failed, then it is time to give yourself wholly away from ego</br>  <br><br>This is my confession to you anon. I am the tree that's core has rotted. She never did anything to me except help. I have no excuse and I hope you can forgive me. If everything goes according to plan then it'll just be 3 more months until I make it home a few days before my boys 1st birthday. I won't think my wife will forgive me when I tell her everything and I don't blame her. All I ask is she let me be in his world. Fucking hell the human mind is weak. Spend our whole lives struggling to find strength against the odds. Whoever is worthy of life needs to take it because half of us are just wishing to die. <br><br>*fin</br></br></br></br>  <br>I just don't want to be alone for the rest of my life. I don't know what to do.</br>  <br>you can't exercise? what nonsense...<br>you're telling me you can do pushups, situps, handstands... you can't swim? you can't ride a bike... you can't jog (i guess you actually can't jog cause of the joint thing) you can't stretch.. yoga... so many things... wow</br></br>  <br>just fucking tell her that. jesus christ you really are autistic. don't be a dick but say you wanted to see her and would have appreciated a straight up no.</br>  <br>bump</br>  <br>On that list, the only thing I can do is ride a bike. Only problem is that I never learned how.</br>  <br>no, if this guy is feeling over this and posting it on /b/ than he really is an autistic loser.</br>  <br>Why not learn how? What do you have to lose?</br>  <br>God. This. Cried with a smile on my face.</br>    <br>I cried of happiness while reading the last line. <br>Then i cried of frustration knowing i won't meet anyone like this</br></br>  <br>Where would I learn and who would teach me? Not like can just go buy a bike and learn in my neighborhood. I already have social anxiety when i'm not doing something embarrassing.</br>  <br> Only problem is that I never learned how. <br>Phew, that's not much of a problem. You gonna learn how?</br></br>  <br>My life's meaningless. Got nothing going on this summer. No job, no school, nothing. Girlfriend's at her uncle's until like august. I was excited for a guys trip with some of my best friends, but most of them backed out. And to top it off, Idk who to talk to because nobody replies to my Facebook messages.</br>  <br>I'd hold your hand if I could.</br>  <br>reads like me trying to get into conversation with my ex a year ago.</br>  <br><br>In the game, your character has a "mother" that sends you letters periodically. It's automated. They are generated by a computer. <br><br>Filthy casuals.</br></br></br></br>  <br>OP I've always wanted a friend with tourettes if that helps any.</br>  <br>This fucked me up hard.</br>  <br>yea man! i love biking,<br>biking is one of my favourite ways to get exercise, see, when you bike for long periods of time your brain releases endorphins like dopamine.. you get something like a runners high, and those feelings can last for days... it's awesome... <br><br>some people don't like biking for pleasure, if you're one of those people get a bike, and use it as transportation... <br><br>DO IT! <br>i promise you won't regret...<br>get a couple of friends to teach you to ride, it will be worth it</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I know this is gay and shit but...<br>Would you grab my hand in the air?<br>Idk man, i'm just so fucking sad.</br></br></br>  <br>I just feel like /b/ is the only place who really understands me rn</br>  <br>Why not get a job, or at least start looking?</br>  <br> Get a couple friend to teach you how to ride <br>What friends?</br></br>  <br>You know damn well that's not the point.</br>  <br>fucking buy a bike and google it.<br>don't be such a downer<br><br>listen man, i promise it will make you happy...<br><br>whatever, do you what you want, have a great life</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd grab it interlocking finger style.<br><br>Anonbro, it's all good. We all feel some sort of emptiness and loneliness. Today I started bawling out of nowhere in the car driving to my work to pick up uniforms. But afterwards I felt amazing, liberated even. It's in our loneliness that we look to others to fill that void--offline and online. Knowing other anons here feel the same way you do should give you solace in feeling that you aren't alone. I'm here for you, anon. I love you, man. Please be happy.</br></br></br>  <br>This is not the place for you</br>  Guys, I'm deeply depressed constantly. If anyone cares to know why, fair warning its a long and painful and I'm on my phone.  <br>that's because you're depressed as shit</br>  <br>kekd</br>  <br>Go.<br>I think this thread will be alive long enough.<br>I'm also mobilefag btw</br></br></br>  <br>It's just balance man, balance and confidence. Again, what do you have to lose? So what if some random people see you fall. Everyone is embarrassed at some point, it's natural. Again, what do you have to lose. I don't know about you, but depression is freeing for me. Yeah, it sucks, but It's not like my life could get worse. So fuck it, let's have some fun. I'd rather fall on my ass trying to ride a bike every damn day in front of everyone I'll ever know than regret never trying when I'm on my deathbed.</br>  <br>Godspeed, anon.</br>  <br>i bet it's because you eat shit food, get absolutely no exercise, spend a large portion of your time on the internet, playing videogames, watching television and doing other extremely unfulfilling things. <br><br>unfortunately everyone goes through tough times, <br>everyone loses friends, family, loved ones. you are no different. get over it. <br><br>it's never too late. <br><br>it isn't too late right now, it won't be too late tomorrow...<br>just pick things up. it all starts with a healthy body.<br><br>best of luck.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you just have to patient and be open to just randomly tossing hellos at people you find attractive and see where it goes :)</br>  <br>you totally made me smile :)</br>  Me and the love of my life broke up in december after I entered a dark depression. I'm still depressed and all but it will all be better soon. I am going to the doctor to get some antidepressants because nothing seems to work, and I've tried everything to shake this rain cloud<br><br>It just comes and goes in waves. One moment I'll be totally okay and the next I'll want to hang myself or lay in front of a train.<br><br>This doctor guy is my last hope because otherwise I'm getting real drunk and going through with one of my suicide plans</br></br></br></br>  <br>i think depression can cripple you or make you stronger its how you look at it and if your willing to fight it</br>  <br>Okay fuck you. I'm 6'4, 220 lbs. I'm in pretty good physical shape. The most I come to junk food is a few doritoes a day. I work out with free weights and practice jeet kun do.</br>  <br>It's been a long time since anyone's told me that man, thanks. It means a lot.</br>  <br>what the fuck did you just fucking say to me?<br><br>i'll have you know i graduated top of my class</br></br></br>  <br>question, <br>have you tried eating healthy, not doing any drugs, not drinking, and exercising?</br></br>  <br> let's have some fun <br><br>I'm almost certain you're not depressed</br></br></br>  <br>stop.</br>  <br>Could probably get somebody to help you out on craigslist or even a newspaper classified.<br><br>You could even teach yourself if you had to and can be patient. You can watch youtube videos about it. Be ready to get banged up a little.<br><br>Forward momentum stabilizes a bike but your impulse is to not pedal until you feel stable. That's the only thing to understand, you just have to practice.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>whoops.<br><br>fuck me then <br><br>but also fuck you</br></br></br></br></br>    anyone here need to talk about anything a /b/ro is bored and lost in these other convos  gonna get ready in 10 min for work<br><br>im really thinking about texting my ex again</br></br>  <br>it sounds to me like you're an unhappy person.<br><br>you probably take everything very seriously, right?</br></br></br>  <br>Hey /b/, how's it? My replies keep getting drowned.</br>  <br>no im just messin but that joke is long sense dead my friend</br>  <br>sup man how are you?</br>  <br>depressed people don't give a shit...<br>you're also trying to talk to depressed people.</br></br>  <br>Maybe so. The depressing thoughts were gone for a while, but it feels like they're back. I hadn't cried in a little while before tonight.</br>  <br>Yes I have. I eat healthy and exercise religiously for that reason and I gave up on all drugs but pot. If I stop smoking pot I get much worse. Also haven't had a drink in months.<br><br>My mom died when I was 6 and I've been battling with depression since I was 13. This isn't simple biological depression caused by a shitty lifestyle, but a depression caused by unresolved trauma and a lot of other stuff (At least that's how I picture it)</br></br></br>  <br>Bitch, no marine can defend himself against me in hand to hand combat. I practice with 50lb free weights and work daily on my self. Its all I have left to do. I honestly have nothing. I have been so depressed I don't even feel guilt or remorse anymore. I will kill you if you every try to fight me. I've dealt with bitches like you who think their shit is funny, listen, people hate you and you should hated because youre a dick.</br>  <br>exactifuckingmundo...<br>seriously man, it's so easy to feel good</br></br>  <br>Yup, you got me, I fucking love my life. I love my life so much that I'm spending it talking to strangers at two in the morning. I guess I forgot how much I just love having friends who ignore me, a family who couldn't give a shit less about me, and this fucking empty feeling in my chest all the time. I came here to feel man, not to argue. Please, fuck off.</br>  <br>ive got 20kg free weights bro and you aint gonna stop me</br>  <br>I've only got a month and a half to go before school starts and I'd have to quit. Unless there's a place where I could literally just jump in for a month and then leave with no hard feelings.</br>  <br>alright, trying to find a scary movie to watch. any suggestions?<br><br><br>i'm sorry you feel that way, how are you otherwise?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well there's nothing wrong with that, just don't go in with one outcome in mind. Know that there's a chance that things won't go well depending on what you say, and be fine with it. Don't invest time in hoping for an answer you're looking for, otherwise you might end up hurting yourself.</br>  <br>Hey man. You down in the dumps too?<br> This. And it only brings guilt that we do this</br></br>    <br>Bro, just learn to shut up.</br>  <br>NO<br>!!!!</br></br>  <br>only thing i can do i guess</br>  <br>bruv what</br>  <br>Well I want to know how in the midst of this emptiness you can have fun</br>  <br>Bro, leave this thread now.</br>  <br>I haven't felt tears in a while.<br><br>Thank you for making me feel alive again, anon</br></br></br>  Wife is depressed and were having a huge life changing event not in a bad way but she doesn't like it. Basically hates me but won't admit it because it's pretty much dependent on me. She has trauma related issues and this just adds on to it. Never talk to anyone about my feelings like this because there is no one else i can talk to.  Does anyone know how bad suicide by arm is? I want to know if it hurts. I need it to.  <br>Beta pussy, grow balls</br>  <br>look up suicide bag.</br>  <br>Fun is the only relief I have from this emptyness. Every once in a while someone might actually do something with me, whether it be my mom asking me to come to the store with her to help, or a friend wanting to go fishing. It's like listening to static on the radio. Sometimes, for a brief little second, you might hear something. After that, it's right back to just plain nothing. I can't really word it any better than that.</br>  <br>She sounds like me in my last relationship. She may love you deep down but can't really tell because of how shitty she feels. <br><br>It's not up to me but it'd be nice to see someone stick it through with a depressed partner. Get her some professional help if you can, that's what I'm finally doing</br></br></br>  That one character who you want to be real but alas, they will never be.<br><br>What's her name /b/?</br></br>    <br>I dont want it to be painless. Also i heard they started mixing oxygen into the tanks so it doesnt work anymore.</br>  <br>well if it's arms, just remember it's up the highway and not across the street.</br>  <br>Sounds like you're alienated.<br><br>Maybe you really are depressed but personally I get no pleasure from doing anything with anyone or even by myself until I get a random spike of normality when I call up my friends or my family to chill with them until it strikes again and I go home and do nothing at all.<br><br>I am really sorry you are so lonely, anon. <br>There is nothing I can do about that but wish you luck in finding companions. Maybe one day you'll find some and some happiness while you're at it</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>/r/showerthoughts</br>  Lurking, but this is for all you anons who have a girl whom you have memories with, but can't quite have her anymore..<br>This song:<br>The Airborne Toxic Event - Sometime Around Midnight<br>hits me in the feels every time.</br></br></br>  <br>Think about all the small things you'll miss</br>    <br>Thanks man. I hope you can find what you're after as well.</br>  <br> leddit </br>  <br>I kekked</br>  not really feels, but i have a good cringe i remembered today while working.<br><br> be 8-10 <br> staying in hotel room with parents, brother, and sister. <br> wake up somewhat before everyone else after having some dream about renamon <br>always had a crush on fine ass renamon<br> tried to go back to sleep thinking about her, ended up moaning about renamon saying shit like "oh yeah renamon, a little lower" <br> open eyes and look at my dad who i can only assume is trying to avoid looking at the shame of a son i am <br> "dad, could you hear me?" <br> he fucking nodded his head. <br> went straight back to sleep to try and forget the whole ordeal. <br><br>woke up later in the morning and just tried to act like it never happened.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>do you feel better about yourself?</br>  <br>Ill be dead anon, i wont miss anything.</br>  <br>You'll miss oglaf</br>  <br> the nigger posted it, im letting people know where to get more </br>  <br>Idk &amp; idc</br>  <br>Try to have a good laugh</br>  <br>But these arent funny anon.</br>  <br>I'm sorry OP. If she wouldn't even text you back, she isn't worth your time. Be a man, be calm, don't send her some long emotional text, just move on.</br>  The fuck do I do, /b/. I'm attracted to her but I'm not, know what I mean? She's in our close-ish group of friends and my best friend is into her, but she's not interested in him. We've been snapchatting alot lately but I'm pretty sure she's into my other best friend.  <br>Oh you don't like oglaf?</br>  <br>You got family? Friends that'd miss you?</br>  <br>nigger i hate you</br>  <br>No. These are really bad and written by some hyper feminist.</br>  <br>Tell her how you feel /b/rother</br>    Anybody have any Borderline experience? What is that like?<br> have been treated for depression <br> feel like it's not the whole picture <br> take psychcentral tests once in a while <br> it's usually easy to tell what you would have to say to game the test one way or another <br> take Borderline test, come across a number of questions that seem like they're just about normal behavior <br> answer honestly <br> score high likelihood <br> it says I should talk to a mental health professional <br><br> inb4 self-diagnosed <br>Not trying to win mental illness bingo, just wondering if anybody's got stories / if treatment is much different for Borderline. I've been meaning to go to a shrink just to talk some shit out, this could maybe be a new angle to check out.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I guarantee you that that last one wasn't even slightly feminist. <br><br>And okay, Mr. Judgy, kill yourself but most of all fuck off</br></br></br>  <br>I promise it gets better homie hang in there. Almost wrapped my car around a fucking pole going 160 on a back road crying my eyes out, and the only thing that stopped me was a call from my mom. Didn't answer it, but it made me think that would fucking destroy her. So I didn't. This was my reason why I was still living. You just need to find a reason and fucking make that reason your everything.</br>  <br>The last 2 were. None of these are funny. Also brb drinking bleach.</br>  <br>I also score highly on borderline test. <br><br>I'm going to see a professional to get my suicidal depression in check and if you score so highly you should see one too. After all, you MAY have it but don't go in believing you have it. Go in with only the knowledge you have of your experiences</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>It's ok anon, not everyone appreciates oglaf.</br></br></br>  <br>That'll be painful as shit and just get you hospitalized.</br>  <br>You're so anti-feminist that you believe things are feminist when they aren't?<br><br>Please make it a painful death</br></br></br>  <br>Ive been through this cycle. I dont have a good relationship with my family, i dont have any friends, vidya and music are all dull and boring. I dont want to work and i dont want to go back to school. Theres no point in anything, so pussing out is the logical step.</br>  <br>In real life I would say fine, but fuck it. I feel lonely, how about you anon?</br>  <br>I don't know man, I feel like it'd fuck up our group of friends, if she feels the same or not</br>  <br>Fuck off with your oglaf cunt</br>  <br>It was a joke anon.</br>  <br>Eh you never know</br>  <br>dude... that hit to hard</br>  <br>Pls go back to reddit.</br>  <br>Glad my nigga is in this thread</br>  <br>New friends like you and I have to stick together</br>  Everyone seems sad, so ill post some good news.<br><br>Over a year ago i was posting in these threads about how sad i was, and i truly was sad. Everyday was a struggle, i really didnt care or feel motivated. I went through a bout of depression and it sucked, it really did. Id sleep all day as soon as i got home from school, never really felt happy, my grades were failing... it goes on and on. I felt like this for... i think about 5 months. <br><br>Anyway, fast forward to now, ive got the girl of my dreams (we have been dating for a bit over 4 months), started Krav Maga and boxing, have gotten more /fit/ and have lots of friends.<br><br>More than anything, I am happy. I remember the first day i felt happy last year. It was the beginning of spring, so snow was still melting but it was nice and warm outside (compared to the winter), I was walking home and i breathed in and realized, shit, i feel happy. Theres not much more too it than that, i felt content and i felt good.<br><br>So anons, that is a shit story but believe me, it does get better</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You're entitled to your opinion, but I shall dump a few other comics i have hiding around.</br></br>  <br>I literally was in the exact situation as you. Nothing ever happened, I told her while I was drunk more than once, eventually learned she wanted nothing, I got a little sad but now we are still close friends to this day. Didn't really fuck with the group, I feel like if something were to happen it would have maybe fucked some shit up, but eh.<br><br>I'm the kinda person who doesn't really talk to many girls and this girl was just perfect in my eyes, I became attached to her and she didn't want anything with me. Man honestly if you don't think anything will happen, don't convince yourself there's a chance. Just tell her but say you kinda maybe feel something but you don't know, don't make it seem like you are in love, and whatever answer you get, make that the final one. It'll save you lots of emotions and lots of time.</br></br></br>  <br>lol cry more faggot</br>  <br>I remember when that happened to me last year.<br><br>It gets better only to get worse. It's a brutal cycle</br></br></br>  <br>sadly i connect to this to much. My best friends always see me as a joker, and it sucks that i can only tell 2 of them (femanon and manon). I feel for this person. This hit me hard in the heart</br>    <br>pls dont say that</br>  <br>I swear, out of all the shit I've seen on this site, this is what hits me the hardest, and I have no freakin' idea why.</br>  <br>No you aren't, silly.</br>  <br>to /d/, with love</br>  <br>have you gone to a professional before? Did you talk about borderline at all?</br>  COMON<br><br>STEP INTO THE LIGHT.</br></br>      <br>You first...</br>  <br>the only good news is that at the end there is eternal darkness</br>  <br>RIP in peace gunshow comics</br>  <br>I've been exercising for three weeks now and it's not doing shit. Sure I feel healthy and whatnot, but the realization is this: I feel alone. I can run, lift, swim, etc. for all I like, but that will never change the fact I'm alone.</br>  <br>Same type of person. Don't really talk to a lot of girls but all my friends do. Thanks for the advice, anon, you seem to know what you're talking about.</br>  <br>m8 id rather just live for the ups than remember the downs, besides, i really feel like this will last. I have no reason to believe otherwise, i mean, i know its early but i really think i could marry this girl and she thinks the same of me. <br><br>We are happy</br></br></br>    <br>I went to a professional for years when I lived with my parents but it never got anywhere besides a diagnosis of depression because I never cooperated. I always said I was fine no matter what. I really haven't much else to offer you. I just know that I'm going to get diagnosed with some shit because my mind is an enigma to me</br>  <br> 3 weeks <br><br>thats no time at all. Keep going at it, you'll get there some day.<br><br>As for friends, you need to get out of the hosue, join a club or something, anything that involves other people</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>and i take my leave</br>  <br>Different anon. Ive been at the gym for a little over a year and physical self improvement does help, but not enough by any means. Its hardly worth it tbh</br>  I've been posting back and forth here, but here's my story I don't know I anyone will read this I just haven't told anyone before...it's kind of embarrassing to discuss.<br><br>I was depressed all of a sudden one day, I just realized I wasn't as happy as everyone around me. I couldn't connect with people that good and I kind of always got sad and cried on my free time. Part of me knew this wasn't normal.<br><br>Went on meds for a few months, that really fucked me up. I remember walking to school, with a relentless rage, fists clenched, and just fucked off of my own brain chemicals. Wasn't sad but wasn't happy either...it just kind of made me numb...so I decided feeling sad was better than nothing so I just started smoking weed to have a temporary get away, and feeling happy for 2 hours a day and then feeling sad the rest was good enough for me. <br><br>Eventually smoked weed all day, was constantly in a daze, not quite happy but not sad because I'd forget I was so fucked up. Constantly contemplated suicide, like daily. Almost drove my car into a pole that was the closest I got, but I pussied out.<br><br>There wasn't really a triggering event, no bullying or anything, I had friends there to support me, and I was always known as a happy guy and the jokester of the group.<br><br>Now today, I am still depressed, really fucking bad with women and kinda socially awkward if I have long conversations with people, but I am better, and that's all that counts.<br><br>When you are that fucked up, you hit rock bottom, and from there the only way you can go is up.<br><br>It gets better anons.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tomoko</br>  I feel like dying every single day. Nothing ever goes well for me.  my ex that fucked me out of 1500 dollars gets out of jail tomorrow, I'm 2000 miles away but I don't know how to feel. they're fucked up but I'm still very in love  <br>I was in the exact same boat as you.<br><br>Girl of my dreams, everything I could have ever hoped for, talk about marriage, deep love and connection, copious amounts of sex, bountiful friends and family always around me, life was a fun ride.<br><br>Now here I am, alone and empty. I spend my time alone binging on netflix, masturbating, browsing /b/, sitting in darkness and thinking about how I can end my pain once and for all<br><br>But my experience has nothing to do with you. Sorry for throwing negativity at you, you may have struck gold and found your future wife. I hope you stay happy</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  I just saw my reflection blink <br>I thought this was feels not spooks</br></br>  I think I have borderline personality disorder. Scored 27 on the test. Wat do?  <br>Thank you, i hope you can find happiness again. <br><br><br>get professional help<br>Goodnight, anons</br></br></br></br></br>  Anxiety, depression, mild OCD. Dude, those are linked together.<br>I have been in a somewhat similar situation during the last year (new job, new town, no friends, lots of stress plus no money) and began to suffer first anxiety, then OCD, then depression. You should probably look for professional help, which can help identify the source or at the very least prescribe anxiolytics. The worst thing about depression and anxiety is that they don't let you see past them, when sometimes improvement is around the corner.</br>  <br>She is getting professional help but due to moving she will have to have a new therapist so that adds to the stress. Not giving up though just needed to tell someone about it</br>  <br>Holy fuck, I just scored a 27 too.. <br>I don't really consider myself to have this, just mood swings I guess, Depression.</br></br>  Best part of these threads is realizing you aren't alone.  I think I might be quickly slipping into anxiety/depression quite soon. Life was good, to a short time ago, still is. Not sure what happened. Actually, I do. Oh well. <br>As I recently entered my vacation, the time I feared came: loneliness, I can't stand it. I can't stand being alone with my thoughts. It hurts bad. I've been crying nonstop for almost two days now, getting irrational fears about things and people. I'm scared I'm not the most important person to the one who's most important to me. I'm scared of failing. I don't know, I'm just... <br>As long as I'm stuffed with schoolwork and exams I'm usually fine. But then this one person just took my heart and opened it so forcefully. I feel vulnerable. I haven't seen him in a little bit more than one day and I feel like shit. Not being around him hurts. Being alone hurts. <br>I feel pathetic.</br></br></br>    <br>I don't do any of that cutting horse shit but I do have a tendency to experience strong feelings of loneliness for seemingly no reason.</br>  <br>You need to feel good, feelin'good is good enough.</br>  Best way to go.  <br>addicted to cocaine and an alcoholic.

I was 15. Staying at my uncles house because im close with that side of the family at the time. Over there all the time. My cousins best friend was staying the night too. They were both 13 at that time. Her friend had spent the night before when i was there so no big deal really. Things are normal. Go swimming. Play some games. Bullshit around the neighborhood. Starts getting late and go back to my cousins room. Her room was upstairs in the rear portion of their big ass house. The ceiling is angled on one side because of the rooftop. No windows. We are sitting in the room talking and shit. Its the 90's so we didn't have a bunch of crap to do besides talk really. That and music but no one had cel phones or laptops and all that garbage. We actually had to interact. Playin around and such. So, my cousin starts randomly daring her friend to flash her pussy at me. She to my surprise actually did it. cont?</br>  <br>this is gold btw got more?</br>  <br> i finally ended up feeling her up on the couch and fingered her <br> we would get the blankets and lay on the couch watching a movie <br> i would finger her and she would jerk me off <br> we didn't acknowledge it was going on but would moan and shit. <br> this went on for about 2 weeks </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Go on.........................</br>  <br>Hnnnnnnnggggggggg</br>  <br><br>She quickly pulled her boy shorts down and I could see her red bush in that quick flash. They giggle loud and crazy. Her bush wasn't out of control. She had it clean but it definitely was a bush. Her friend was thin with clear pale skin with not many freckles for a redhead. Not small but not really big tits. Seemed a nice size for her frame for as far as I could tell anyway. She was pretty good looking. Anyway, my cousin keeps on with the dares saying for her friend to show her pussy again. Then her ass and her bra. Eventually she would show her tits. Very perky, better than I had imagined it would be even after seeing her in her bathing suit top from earlier. Nice tits really. Nicely pinked nipples with little areolas. Then she had her grinding on me for lap dances to whatever ghetto bullshit they liked to listen to then. I didn't care. I had ass rubbin on my cock. I had a raging boner by this time obviously and didn't give a fuck if she felt it. I knew she did feel it because she started laughing maniacally when it poked her on one of her grind sessions. I just smiled. This shit was great. She had fallen to the floor laughing. My cousin was laughing hard too. Saying "What happened does he have a stiffy?!". Both burst out laughing harder because, you know, 13. Goes into all the names possible "Chub Chub? Boner? pitchin the tent?" blah blah blah. They think its hilarious. I just go with it. Smiling and shit. Then my cousin gets up and runs over to the light switch and flips it off. It is fucking dark. Remember, no windows. cont?</br></br>    <br>I'm not going to lie I am picturing this and it's fantastic.</br>  <br>Goddamn type faster</br>  <br>Keep going...</br>  <br><br>So when I say dark I mean cant see shit dark. I hear bumbling and fumbling. Calls her friend to come to her voice. Giggling because cant see. Hitting things and such. Admittedly, this was actually pretty funny. You had to be there to understand though with things that were said and how it played out. This is 16 years ago you see so its hard to really encapsulate the moment for you but I'm doing my best to relive this tale for you. I hear murmuring but honestly cant make out what they are saying. More laughing from them. My cousin says "Ok. Guess which one of us it is?". I said "What are you talking about?". I feel someone hit me in the chest with a Ric Flair chop. POP. I hear laughing. Through her giggles she says "who was it?". I was laughing too because as i said I'm close with this part of my family and although it was fucked up and hurt it was very funny to me. I make a guess. "Nope". POP. "Ow. What the hell man?" Laugh. Then I started to feel rubbing on my chest and a breath was on my lips and right before they touched it went away. Giggling. "Who?". Make guess. More touching. No one said anything. I didn't really care honestly. This was getting interesting but admittedly i was a bit confused. I thought that maybe my cousin was gonna help me get laid. I'm all for that. lol. This kind of play continues for a while. Making guesses. Sometimes right sometimes wrong. Don't give a fuck really about being right or wrong. It slowly kept escalating with touching on my stomach and legs to light brushing on my lips with what felt like lips. After probably a good thirty minutes or more it goes silent. Dead silent. Im sitting there not wanting to say anything because man i don't want this to end. I assume my cousin is making shit happen so i can get a thrill out of her hot friend because she's cool like that. Our family really does roll with the blood is thicker than water motif. I remain silent because i don't want to fuck shit up and wait it out.</br></br>  <br>my sister would usually come out after mum was fast asleep drunk and on sleeping pills but this night she had her best friend over<br><br> on the couch watching some comedy <br> sister and friend join and watch the movie <br> all a sudden my sisters hand creeps under my blanket and starts trying to unbutton my boxers <br> i kind of ignore it thinking shes just teasing infront of her friend <br> she manages to slip my dick out and starts stroking slowly untill im hard <br> being turned on i crept my hand over and started playing with her clit slowly trying not to make to much movement under the blanket <br> im trying to focus on the movie and not make to many movements under the blanket <br> my sister stops and picks up her phone <br> i take my hand away and think its over <br> freaking out she set this up to show im a freak ect <br> sis and her best friend are exchanging her phone texting and shit <br> then my sister hands me the phone <br> its got "my friend feels left out" on it </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Be 8 years old, boy <br> have 22 year old male cousin <br> dont know anything about sex dicks anything <br> he sucked me off <br> be 8, cant cum but feels good <br> happens about every other month until 10 <br> asks me to suck his dick <br> nope <br> get violently assfucked for 4 years until I was too old for him <br> cousin is a preschool teacher <br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/628284679#p628290113">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fake as fuck.

Get a hairstyle, a simple one. High and tight or something more sophisticated than a shaved head.<br><br>3. Take care of yourself health wise by learning how to balance your diet with fats protein and carbs in the morning carbs and protein for lunch and pure protein for dinner (like chicken).<br><br>4. Start doing curls and some moderate cardio.<br><br>5. If you're drinking soda, STOP. If you are eating fast food, STOP. Stop jacking off to porn late at night, it will make you eat junk in the fridge without any regard for your diet. If you have to whack it, do it in the morning it will even you out for the day and you can choose to wait to eat till lunch.
