I don't care anymore.<br><br>You, people like you, I hate you. From the deepest part of my heart, I hate you more than I could hate anything else. Your mere existence makes me seethe with rage.<br><br>I've been here since the beginning. I was there when 4chan was born, a shitty image board for the discussion of anime, made by a kid 2 years my junior. moot. I was there to see the first set of trips. I was there when we first hit 1000 posts on /b/ - it was the only board at the time, /a/ was created a month later. I witnessed birth given to other new boards, then I watched those same boards die, other boards taking their place. It was a better time, a better place, with better people.<br><br>Then, it started to die. The more popular it got, the more it was polluted by faggotry: white knights, moralfags, normalfags - people who didn't like what this place was about and wanted to change it to suit them, you know who I'm talking about. Dislike anime? You don't belong here. Dislike messing with people for some cheap entertainment? You don't belong here. Don't want to lurk and learn the board's culture through the posts of other anons? You don't belong here. You may have been here for years, and you may think that gives you validation to stay. It doesn't.<br><br>In these past twelve years, I've moved houses and changed jobs more than I can count; co-workers, friends, family all came and left faster than I could blink. There's only one thing in my life that's stayed with me this entire time, that's been a constant, 4chan. My home.<br><br>Seeing you, coming into my home and the home of many other anons just like me, shitting all over the place and trying to burn it to the ground - well, you can only imagine how I feel.<br><br>I hate you. I hate everyone like you. So much that it hurts everytime I think about it.<br><br>But... it doesn't matter anymore. I don't care. Now that moot is leaving, I guess it's finally my time to make that once-in-a-lifetime trip to Gensokyo.<br><br>Goodbye 4chan.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  no sound <br>  everyone's crying over it <br> mfw </br></br></br>  <br>story pls</br>  <br>underrated,<br> this webm is fucking hilarious</br></br>  <br>the point is she's ocd. ;that's all.</br>    <br>Fuck this gay earth.</br>    <br>thats what im saying</br>  <br>theres nigglets in there too</br>  <br><br>Fucking love conan so much but damn it's hard to believe he was murdered infront of a studio audience. <br><br>pls don't post this anywhere else, have some respect for the dead</br></br></br></br>  <br>wtf?</br>  <br>Not to mention, a real knife wouldn't make her friend in the black top instantaneous take a step back like that.</br>    <br>i'm epileptic you cunt</br>  <br>fucking how</br>  <br>Did it work?</br>  <br>ninja as fuck</br>  <br> filename <br><br>literally took me two seconds to find a vid of her<br><br>https://www.peekvids.com/watch?v=yt<wbr>cPAcvCUub</wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i know i spelled that wrong im really pissed off</br>  <br>This is so 2008</br>  <br>Source</br>  <br>The batter was called out cuz the fielder would have definitely caught it</br>  <br>funnier than the webm</br>  Better with soudn: <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=iRU<wbr>SQm5ZskQ&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1m</wbr>  [ ]<br><br> ya Dingaling </br></br></br></br>  <br>thankfully no</br>    <br>disgustingly grose</br>  <br>now speed it up and reverse it</br>  <br>some of us arent plebs with 1cm x 1 cm screens, so it's a tad more shocking to us<br><br> pleb </br></br></br>  <br><br>check out the black guy just behind her to the left.</br></br>  <br>Yeah</br>  <br>it was reviewed and called fan interference, so it was an out</br>  <br>Only faggots do shit like that.</br>  <br>Foul ball dumbfuck, what else would it be?</br>  <br>Man that policer officer has balls</br>  <br>Holy shit its a bigfoot!</br>  <br>That's one of the worst things that can happen to you over there.

I don't care anymore.<br><br>You, people like you, I hate you. From the deepest part of my heart, I hate you more than I could hate anything else. Your mere existence makes me seethe with rage.<br><br>I've been here since the beginning. I was there when 4chan was born, a shitty image board for the discussion of anime, made by a kid 2 years my junior. moot. I was there to see the first set of trips. I was there when we first hit 1000 posts on /b/ - it was the only board at the time, /a/ was created a month later. I witnessed birth given to other new boards, then I watched those same boards die, other boards taking their place. It was a better time, a better place, with better people.<br><br>Then, it started to die. The more popular it got, the more it was polluted by faggotry: white knights, moralfags, normalfags - people who didn't like what this place was about and wanted to change it to suit them, you know who I'm talking about. Dislike anime? You don't belong here. Dislike messing with people for some cheap entertainment? You don't belong here. Don't want to lurk and learn the board's culture through the posts of other anons? You don't belong here. You may have been here for years, and you may think that gives you validation to stay. It doesn't.<br><br>In these past twelve years, I've moved houses and changed jobs more than I can count; co-workers, friends, family all came and left faster than I could blink. There's only one thing in my life that's stayed with me this entire time, that's been a constant, 4chan.
