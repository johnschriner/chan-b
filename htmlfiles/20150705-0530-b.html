Hello 4chan!<br><br>My name is Rashida Jones and I'm the executive producer for the documentary, Hot Girls Wanted (which is currently streaming on Netflix and you should totally watch). For my next project, I am tackling "revenge porn." My associate producer informed me of a place called "b" on this site and told me that users often post pictures of their exes.<br><br>I would like to get a better understanding of the mentality behind revenge porn. So if you wouldn't mind answering a few of the following questions, it would be greatly appreciated.<br><br>1. Have you ever posted nudes of your ex?<br>2. If the question to #1 is yes, did your ex ever find out and what were the repercussion?<br>3. Should revenge porn be punishable by a court of law (if that's even feasible to begin with)?<br>4. Were you ever the victim of revenge porn?<br>5. And lastly, if you've ever posted revenge porn, why did you do it? How did it make you feel before, during, and after?<br><br>Thanks a million everyone!<br><br>Your Truly,<br>RJ</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Dear OP, Tits or gtfo  <br>go fuck your holes cunt.</br>  <br>tits baby</br>  Pics usually get sent to the ex's family members via facebook to show "what a whore" their daughter is :)  Please buy Tommy a new asshole.    Tits or gtfo    <br>Tits or gtfo</br>    <br>only freaks and geeks expose the former lovers on /b/</br>  NO girl we don't use b anymore for that we use an amazing app dedicated to send ex nude called xm transfer check it  <br>"We don't take too kindly to you TV folk".</br>  <br> implying there are people on /b/ that aren't freaks and/or geeks </br>  u can't tell me that the moon landing wuz real    Yes<br>No<br>No<br>No<br>Cuz she was a cheating whore. What's worse than completely scaring someone's life by posting their nudes. To be honest women today are such sluts, their desire for attention and affection drives them to show it to anyone who'll talk to them.</br></br></br></br>   should revenge porn be punishable by courts? <br>Do we look like a bunch of French commie faggots slapping their dicks together? <br> Fucking No. <br>Freedom of speech, you ignorant slut.</br></br></br>  <br/>  Nice bait m8 i r8 8/8  tits or gtfo<br><br>loved you in parks and rec btw</br></br>  <br>Get raped bitch</br>  <br>Get off here you half breed</br>  <br>Show tits and I'll respond</br>  karen from the fucking office? yoooo    <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Read the fucking filename you retarded morons</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tits or GTFO</br>  2nd time i've seen this fuck off anon  <br>Get raped faggot</br>  <br>this is some kind of weird bait</br>  tits or gtfo  <br>Check your privellage you White, cis-female misandrous asshole</br>  Timestamp or fuck off newfag  <br> 3. Should revenge porn be punishable by a court of law (if that's even feasible to begin with)? <br>If I took the picture with my camera with her (even barely implied) consent, I own the copyright 100%. If I choose to give away (not sell) the photo, that's my absolute right.<br><br>You (yes, 'tards, I know it's not actually her) work in an industry that could not function without copyright protection.<br><br>Yes, revenge porn can be legally punishable if and only if you're willing to completely discard the notion of copyright law. Just tear those pages out of the law and throw them away.<br><br>Are you willing to pay a price that high? I'm not.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Women are sluts and deserve to be locked up inside the washing machine because not even sandwiches can be trusted with their shit hands!<br><br>Joey is my idol.</br></br></br>    <br>This, fucking newfags</br>  <br>1. No<br>2. N/A, but I can say for sure the answer would be "didn't find out" and "no repercussions"<br>3. Yes, it should technically be illegal, even if enforcement isn't feasible. Revenge porn is not ok, just like sharing a password given to you in confidence for a specific reason is not ok. When people share some private information, they get to choose where the limits for use of that information are placed, and anything outside of the boundaries specified by them is wrong, full stop. It doesn't matter how stupid it was to share that private information in the first place. If you believe otherwise, then no form of social engineering is wrong either, which courts and common sense obviously disagree with.<br>4. No, I am a man. Men don't really have this problem.<br>5. N/A, but I can imagine it making me feel awesome if I didn't have a conscience and hated women.</br></br></br></br></br>  1. No<br>2. No<br>3. No<br>4. No<br>5. No<br>6. Oh Mama mia<br>7.

This lack of explanation lead to questioning so the gov quickly did a study and if you kook it up on Google youll see headlines like "WTC7 conspiracy completely debunked by National Institute of Standards and Technology report". Then when you read the article, this is what you get:<br><br>"WTC 7 collapsed because of fires fueled by office furnishings. It did not collapse from explosives or from diesel fuel fires."<br><br> oh that makes perfect sense... </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>See<br/></br>  <br> there are still people who understand that this event is the reason why the Western world is such a shit state of affairs?

But do you know what *did* hit the building? Literal tons of burning debris from the north tower. For several hours.</br>  The planes themselves were hijacked, the gov knew this was coming but did nothing (on purpose? ). We the people are probably kept in the dark about how large buildings are dealt with in emergencies. They were probably lined with built-in explosives in case of an emergency situation to collapse upon itself instead of falling on other buildings causing destruction of more property and lives bringing lawsuits from multiple sources rather than blaming the initial disaster.

Why in the 1500 reviewed photos of the accident scene is not one seat, cushion, or piece of luggage visible? Why did the US Postal Service not receive one complaint about missing goods and mail known to be carried on Flight 77? Why did the Secretary of Defense of the United States run out onto the Pentagon lawn after the crash for a rescue photo-op when a fourth known hijacked airplane was still airborne and the morning still wholly chaotic? Why did a construction generator trailer create such a massive explosion and fire when struck? Why is there so little conclusive evidence of a Boeing 757 at the crash site? Why did there happen to be multiple war-games being run from the Pentagon on the morning of 9/11 mimicking hijacked airplanes and terrorist attacks, causing confusion and chaos with FAA flight controllers as to whether what being reported that morning was 'real-world' or staged? How did five separate substantial lamp poles struck by the airplane cause no adverse effect on the hardware of the aircraft, nor its flight path?

If you mean the force of the plane smashing into the building caused the "air" to create a blast shaped like this V, in some cartoon fashion, then no...thats not how whatever you're thinking works. The initial explosion from the plane caused all the damage it was going to cause. The theory that FOX news scientists came up with is that the fire from the plane caused the steel beams on the top floors where the plane crashed to bend/melt and the building structure at the top began to collapse, causing a force from the top of the building to start a chain reaction of collapsing force. But this theory is pretty much as stupid as your V shaped air force explosion thing because it would be like you standing still and having someone drop an apple on your head, and that small force caused your entire body to collapse. Somehow all the beams at the top of the building melted and gave way at the exact time and then the 5-6% of the top of the building, dropped down at a perfectly to cause the remaining 90 something percent of a very strong structure to just give way and fold up like accordion</br>  <br>DID YOU KNOW: Silverstein wanted a lower insurance policy, and was pressured by his stockholders to get a higher one?<br><br>DID YOU KNOW: Silverstein is still paying off the lease on the property, and since it's in midtown Manhattan, said lease is incredibly high?<br><br>DID YOU KNOW: Paying off the lease, even with the insurance payout, will actually cause Silverstein to LOSE money on the deal?</br></br></br></br></br>   Jews are not behind every subversive movement/conspiracy in America.   <br>building 7 didn't get hit by a plane</br>  <br>They didn't melt. Jet fuel can't melt steel beams.<br><br>What it CAN do, though, is lower their structural integrity and cause them to buckle, and loosen the joints holding the building together, causing several hundred tons of steel and concrete and sheetrock to fall down.

Here's what I would do if I were in charge:<br><br> End the war on drugs. Legalize weed, mushrooms and possibly XTC and cocaine. At least $100 billion is saved in lower police/prison expenditures, lower crime, economic growth from the legal drug industry and putting tax on drugs. <br> Legalize prostitution <br> Cut $300 billion from the Defense budget. $500 billion will remain, the US will still easily be the #1 power <br> Close Guantanamo Bay and apologize to the victims of torture (also admit that it's actually torture) <br> Reduce the federal debt <br> Reduce income taxes below $200k <br> Change the age of consent laws (enprisoning people of 23yo for fucking a 17yo is retarded. European laws are better) <br> Religious institutions are no longer tax exempt <br> Put a man on Mars before 2030 <br><br>It's pretty much Libertarian I think. Thoughts?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>your pic is a black man. FYI</br>  I'm here to save the day.  <br>everybody knows this would work but it will never ever happen. theyre just going to elect another puppet and keep making money of the middle east. money that will go to rich capitalists until america collapses.<br><br>I really hope america falls during my lifetime</br></br></br>  <br>It will. There is a season for everything.</br>  <br> enprisoning people of 23yo for fucking a 17yo is retarded. European laws are better <br>This is on a state-by-state basis, many have clauses against doing this sort of thing to people.<br> Legalize prostitution <br>Also state-by-state, Nevada for example has it legal outside of Clark county<br> Close Guantanamo Bay and apologize to the victims of torture (also admit that it's actually torture) <br>The admitting has been done, the Senate outlawed any form of enhanced interrogation, although the military may still practice it, they'd get fucked over if caught<br> <br>Otherwise you're pretty on point</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Agree with stated above besides Gitmo and religious institutions.<br>That being said, caveat:<br> Summary execution for unrepentant prisoners of war and those who commit crimes against humanity, most at Gitmo qualify. <br> Since most Religious Personnel in non-modern civilization take vows of poverty, allow exemptions for religious institutions on the most basic amenities, and allow only funds for maintainance and building grounds. Nothing more or less. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Raise Taxes on the richer classes<br>Remove benefits from being a worthless jobless lowlife from the poorer class, and give back more of the money to the middle class<br>revamp the educational system by taking it out of the hands of lawyers in D.C.<br> inb4 right, left or communism/fascism </br></br></br></br>  <br>i really hope your right.<br><br>Its like USA is a huge bubble thats gotta burst sometime. The soviet union collapse came pretty much out of the blue and maybe USA will as well but im not so sure</br></br></br>  <br>although the military may still practice it, they'd get fucked over if caught<br><br> if caught. <br>lol</br></br></br></br>  F R E E D O M<br>R E E D O M<br>E E D O M <br>E D O M<br>D O M<br>O M<br>M</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Raise Taxes on the richer classes <br>Lowering taxes for non-rich is a better idea<br><br> Remove benefits from being a worthless jobless lowlife from the poorer class, and give back more of the money to the middle class <br>It would surprise you how little money is saved with this. Taking away all benefits for unemployed and giving it to the middle class, would be like a 1% improvement for middle class and a 90% reduction in income for unemployed. There aren't as many long term unemployed in the US and they don't get as much money.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The Soviet Union is a good example because their people were rekindled inside, unintentionally, by Gorbachev's glasnost. The same will happen in the West but on an unprecedented scale. Just as puppet regimes fell in the satellite states leading up to the collapse of the Soviet Union, so current regimes will come to an end across the world. A growing number of people are becoming disillusioned with the various dreams they've been raised to believe in. Cultural, local, racial identity are come to the fore again.</br>  <br>...also increased crime rates cost more money. And the reduced spending by unemployed is bad for the economy. Middle and upper class tend to save much more than the poor. That's why you can't save as much money by not giving anything to the unemployed.</br>  <br> Its like USA is a huge bubble thats gotta burst sometime. <br><br>The bubble bursts every 30 years or so<br> 1929 <br> 1987 <br> 2008 <br><br>Followed by a depression, followed by a recovery.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>America IS great</br>  <br>I think he was meaning more along the lines of the rise and fall of empires, rather than cyclical economics; but you're right about that. My state stupidly invested $1b (then, not adjusted for today) in a giant shopping center in the capital city, right in the middle of a recession (1990-91). Naturally actual profit fell far below projections, the state bank collapsed.</br>  <br>Forgive all 100% of all debt owed to the top 1% of people or the institutions that the individuals own shares in relative to their relative ownership of said institutions.<br><br>Go to mars, start new civilization. Human culture goes on forever as American/western based.<br><br> Win the Game of Civilisations </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. — That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.<br><br>My fellow Americans, tomorrow is the Fourth of July, which of course we celebrate as our day of independence. The quote above is from the Declaration of Independence, among the great documents of our nation. It's my favorite quote of similar works of the era. Whereas most of the world was ruled by kings, the Founding Fathers, following the example of the Magna Carta and expanding it to its natural conclusion, determined that a government only can exist so long as it has the consent of the governed, that no one person by birthright may rule another human, that leaders are to be determined by individual merit, leadership skills, and offering a coherent vision of the future so that citizens may choose for themselves what the future should look like. We have stumbled in the past, often unsure how to interpret different parts of the documents. But what has been consistent is a greater recognition of a truth integral not only to America but the whole western world, a thought that was dangerous and revolutionary: the belief that every human has a certain dignity on the merit of being human. It is this belief that challenged the abuse of monarchs and emperors, and it is this belief that has been upheld by courts time and again. It is this belief, that all have dignity, that allowed for the birth of modern democracy and liberty. And it is this belief that is under threat to this day. <br>1/2</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hm yes. The American empire might collapse. But, that doesn't mean America becomes a poor Syrian-like anarchy. Britain lost all its power after WW2 and it's still a "rich" country and a regional power. <br><br>Same with a country like the Netherlands. Dominated the seas in 1650, now a small and unimportant country. But it's still very rich and in the top 5 of best countries in the world to live in. Americans might lose their power but that doesn't at all mean they'll lose their wealth. There's not much to fear. You'll drop from #1 to #4 or so in the next 100 years. So what.</br></br></br>  <br>Whenever a government imprisons someone for an opinion, this cherished belief is threatened. Whenever a government determines your life choices, forces you to suffer physical indignity like abortion or torture, this belief is threatened. Whenever you are threatened into silence, this belief is threatened. <br><br>Never allow that belief to die. Tyranny takes many forms, from the visible horrors caused by despots such as Stalin or Pol Pot to the quieter tyrannies such as "forced disappearances" or government-paid thugs that beat peaceful protestors, detain them infinitely for dissent, rape inmates in prison to intimidate them, or systematically slander them or prevent them from working. There are many forms of tyranny, and on the Fourth lets remember to look out for it in all forms, to call it out, and drag it before the light of liberty.<br><br>2/2</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The bubble bursts every 30 years or so <br> 1929 <br> 1987 <br> 2008 <br>The restriction implemented by the US Government in the 1930's didn't cause a bank crash for all most 50 years. <br>Those restrictions where lifted and... well 1987 and 2008!</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;625777777   <br>Only because their rebellious offspring the US replaced them as the economic power. That too was when countries were molded around their own people.

Russia will never become powerful unless they change to a more western system of democracy+capitalism.</br>  <br>Estonia is in the NATO.</br>  <br>Barroso, is that you?<br><br>By the way, I am not basing this on what has happened regarding Ukraine.</br></br></br>  <br>I know this. But how many NATO members will look at their dependence on Russia and go "well... Estonia DID have a bunch of Russians...."<br><br>That's the same reason Germany hasn't been hard on Russian sanctions, nor the rest of the EU. Putin correctly calculated they will blink and do little.

Institute a federal inheritance tax that crushes the high percentiles so that every generation is forced to work. Give the rich the option to donate their wealth before they die or do tax free employee buyouts/donations of capital investments. I now I'm taking above most of you faggots but its the only thing I can see that gives younger generation of taking back a piece of the pie.

Nothing but a sniveling government dick sucking coward.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  American soldiers wouldn't just en masse start dropping bombs like in Syria. Last time they were involved in such situations (Katrina, LA riots) they took great pains to avoid killing civilians. <br><br>The simple fact is the American military is volunteer. This means that as a consequence the military tends to attract certain people. Typically they trend conservative. Conservatives don't like oppressive governments. You can see where this would be a problem if an oppressive government is telling Americans to kill their countrymen. Many own guns of their own. Many are not satisfied with domestic policies laid out as it is.<br><br>America has a much stricter border between police and military than most nations. Military personnel cannot interfere with a crime out of their base. They cannot be deployed to gather guns without a declared state of emergency, and even that would likely be national guard at the state level. Combined with poor record keeping as to who has what and you have a more difficult hunt than looking for an ant in a pile of poppy seeds. Most may opt to not follow orders, since it could run against the constitution depending on how a ban is implemented (soldiers swear an oath to defend the constitution, not the government itself). For example in rural New York the police largely ignore gun rules imposed by the city on the rest of the state (NYC has a huge population to the point it can force the state to adopt its rules, Chicago is in a similar situation with Illinois).</br></br></br></br>  Statist*, you commie fuck :-)  <br>http://www.infowars.com/revolt-mill<wbr>ions-of-n-y-gun-owners-refuse-to-re<wbr>gister-firearms/</wbr></wbr></br>  <br>I also called you retarded but I forgot about your shitty education system so you probably 'don't read so good'.<br><br>speaking of dick sucking btw isn't your country the one that just came out of the closet?</br></br></br>  <br> I also called you retarded <br><br>You're on 4chan.

I look at the bigger picture.<br><br>I even support christfags having rights even though I despise their insipid religion.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shut up, Greece.</br>  <br> Implying US is the only country in debt <br><br>Shit, almost everyone is in debt to someone else today.<br>There is going to be a global conflict over that eventually.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Humanity will stagnate until we do away with debt slavery and bank-based economy.<br><br>The world should just agree to wipe the slate clean. The amount globally owed is so huge it's become a joke.
