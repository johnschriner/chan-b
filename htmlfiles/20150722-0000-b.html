Deviantart shells money for dumb fuckers using the circle tool for inflation fetishists. Hell, even bASE ARTISTS GET THAT FUCKING CASH.<br><br>Now Furaffinity, we got auctions that can be bought out or just climb price until a deadline is met. Highest bidder wins.<br><br>The higher the quality the more money you get- but then you have the niche audiences to consider, they shell for fucking anything if they can desperately jerk off to it!<br><br>Tumblr i a bit of a more interesting place to pick your pricing and method. You have to get a bit established and people WILL rummage through your social shit to judge you despite the art quality.<br><br>All and all it's a matter of audience climate and the will to try and adapt to all of said climates.<br><br>The real gamble is hiding the gross shit from your FRIENDS.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Popopoka, what do you think of this?<br>  </br></br>  <br> hiding the gross shit from your FRIENDS. <br> from your FRIENDS <br> your FRIENDS <br> FRIENDS </br></br></br></br>  <br>Be strong Popopoka!

This can be stressful. Hosts are professionals who specialize in listening, coversation, and empathy. Add a dash of charm and good looks to please the eye and you have a host!

I've come here alone without my fellow club members to carry out my hosting duties. Fomalities are necessary unfortunately, prevents (even worse) misunderstandings. I hope you understand.</br>  <br>Hmm... I think I hear a weird noise again...</br>    <br> plops on the floor <br>Come on.. I won't risk pissing Medusa off just for ear scratches</br></br>  <br>You're s-s-supposed to be the ultimate perfect warrior right? You died from a rock. I bet Lincler could handle you.<br><br>R-r-right Rick?</br></br></br>  <br>I mean my post link is wrong.. but forget it<br><br><br>Well I'm not into that stuff..I'll just watching you from afar..</br></br></br></br>  <br>Your words do me honor! though I must ask, why is your title imperfect?</br>  <br>I think it's a skeleton.</br>  <br>Logs eh? My name is Jubei I apologize for not introducing myself earlier</br>  I hope I ain't doing too shabby for a first time host on any chan.  <br>What part of Imperfect do you not get? And I'll just drink Lincler.</br>  <br>Do you understand what I do now, Free?<br><br>It's bad manners to ignore people who are trying to explain things to you. An ignorant statement in full view of others is a great inconvenience to me and my work. I hope it doesn't happen again.<br/></br></br></br>  <br>Breddy gud m8</br>  <br>Very well...</br>  <br> mfw just realizing I accidentally cropped some names out just after saying that. </br>  <br>I've got my eyes on you, Rock....</br>  <br>You're Krillin cells would screws you up <br> Morty </br></br>  <br>Too bad you got rekt. Just like I thought you would be. I hope that you have better luck next time.<br> Scary Skeleton </br></br>  <br>So you used to have a real club, but since you're the only club member here, you recognise yourself as the club... and invite girls to you? Slightly less creepy but still so.<br><br>Oh, ok... suit yourself... but he deserves to be punished<br><br>...skeletons move and make noises over here?<br> scared look on Maria's face </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thank you. I'll be trying to recreate some of my memories until the next game.<br>I will see you then.</br></br>  <br>Well, I guess the real question is how does imperfect fit you? Why is it something that defines you?</br>  <br>Go on Free, take those snakes out. See what happens.</br>  <br>I have 3 forms, err 4 if you count my juvenile state. Imperfect, Semi-Perfect, and Perfect. I'm currently imperfect.</br>  <br>Yes they do.</br>  <br>Sorry about that I wasn't paying much attention. Though I understand what you do. Though I still find it silly</br>  <br> help </br>  <br>But you have Maba's eye. Why are you so afraid of Medusa.</br>  Ahem.. if the mouse girl is still here, I think I've been able to pinpoint exactly where the snakes are in your body and know how to remove them in one felse swoop.  <br>And when you were perfect you lost to a 10 year old<br> Morty </br></br>  <br>Your basement is a scary place... will they move and come over to me?</br>  <br>Not to "me", to talk... I don't know where you're getting the idea. There's absolutely nothing in it for me but to see my guests happy. Are replies to your posts here not a good thing? People caring about what you have to say?</br>  <br>Well I figured you were watching anyways. Though now I am curious</br>  <br>Multiple forms? Interesting. I assume that the perfect form is more advantagous and that there is a reason you are currently in your imperfect form.</br>  Jesus Christ Rock is a warrior.  <br>I shall see you then</br>  <br>You're cramping my style, can you change it?</br>  <br>No sweat m'liege! The games are as enjoyable as ever</br>  <br>I hate snakes they are disgusting.</br>  <br>Everyone does, I suppose...</br>  <br>get in the coffin, it's save in here</br>  <br>That hairstyle reminds me of someone..<br>And if you could even kill me that is!</br></br>    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=LOY<wbr>Qtbz_pPg</wbr>  [ ]  <br>It's only one picture you don't have to worry.</br>  <br>Not in that situation.<br><br>It was inevitable<br><br>That 10 year had help from all his buddies, and he was born into a race that has war in their blood.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh I am by no means scared of Medusa. Though I like her enough to not try and anger her</br>  <br>Oh, ok. I think I understand better now. So you just talk to girls to pass time. Good.<br><br>T-the skeletons are making a noise again...</br></br></br>  <br>Damn that's one crafty-Ass rock</br>  <br>I thought you were a fan, ahahahaha!</br>  <br> tries to open lid </br>    <br>Haven't acquired enough energy. And my second for disgusts me. Theoretically, with enough power, I could skip my 2nd form though.</br>  <br>Then you would hate Medusa<br><br>But hey man it is your thing. Do so whatever makes you happy</br></br></br>  <br>Um, yeah..Have fun there~<br><br><br> i don't know how! </br></br></br></br>  <br>Hmm...</br>  <br>Oh i'm a fan, if I wasn't I wouldn't have saved the picture no?</br>  <br>Well you're immortal, so my best option would be to lock you in a cage. As for Mizune and Eruka, well you wouldn't want their blood on your hands now would you?<br><br>Well I think they are beautiful creatures.</br></br></br>  <br> damn </br>  <br>I just never had people copy my clothes for that reason...</br>  More Pokemon references, more broken events, and Rock is kill now  <br><br>It will go away if you ignore it.</br></br>  <br>I see, well you are a formidable warrior even in this form! I know I would enjoy a chance to test my mettle against you!</br>  <br>Don't you need both Android 17 and 17 to become perfect? I'm not a scientist but why didn't Gero just implant them into you when you were made? It just seems like a design flaw.</br>  <br>S-something's moving my seat...<br><br>..you're not trying to help the enemy out are you?<br><br>So do I have it correct this time?<br><br>I-i'll try to... i'll just sing to cover up the noise... lalala~</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I... guess I should...</br>  <br>Hmm I suppose that is fair enough.</br>  <br>Well done!
