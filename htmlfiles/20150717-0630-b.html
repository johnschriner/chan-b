So adorable.</br>  <br>What is that?</br>  <br>You just can't do it~! Cirno is a "Baka" Cirno is a "Baka"</br>  <br>Well i don't know myself either... maybe Marvin would know.<br><br><br>Hmmm....<br>  stares </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ha!

Gotcha!</br>  <br>If i may ask... are you related to someone called Ganondorf?</br>  <br>That is for you two to decide</br>  <br>....What did you just say?<br><br><br>EVERY TIME REYNOLDS<br><br>STOP ESCAPING MY GRASP<br><br><br>Meh, not a bad price. A pleasure doing business with you, my savior. <br><br><br>Where can I find this "Marvin" at?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I guess we'll see... And I've missed you too. How have you been?<br><br><br>Good question... I kinda like this idea <br>but I feel like it's going to eventually become complicated</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I make a better Ciro Immobile shop if you give me a better head <br> that sounded wrong for some reason </br></br>  <br>Why are you s-staring at me?</br>  <br>I like that pillow you've got there (´・ω・`)</br>  <br>WAS HAST DU GEMACHT!?</br>  Nya nya nya...  <br><br><br>I can do anything!</br></br></br>  <br>Haha...hahahaha</br>  <br><br><br>I'd like to be regular Ryuko.</br></br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=LgG<wbr>mQZn77Uw</wbr>  [ ]<br>YOU WILL DESTROY US ALL</br></br>  <br>Is a great pillow</br>  <br>But why are you wearing a pumpkin hat?</br>  <br>I could have sworn you already had it, oh well. I must be mistaken.<br><br><br>Oh, things have been interesting, to say the least. Raven asked me to prom, Brash and I had a falling out of sorts, but have since reconciled, I got a few bans on 4chan...<br><br><br>I'll show who the better god is!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It reminds me of the 600 emails Denko never read (´・ω・`)</br>  <br>Science is stupid!<br>Boring!</br></br>  <br>Yukari no!<br>It will ruin my math class!</br></br>  <br>I am not. I do not associate myself in any way with that wretched king.</br>  <br>Marvin is an artificial being who apparently knows everything in the universe. He acts as a depressed and hopeless robot. He is not here at the moment, but if i see him again i will ask him.</br>  <br>If you can do anything, are you able to do nothing?</br>  <br>How could Mewgenics POSSIBLY be boring?! <br><br> mfw out of Dr.Beanies pics </br></br></br>  <br>Except freezing the sun, for that's impossible! The sun is too grossly incandescent</br>  <br>I don't actually know. I felt I needed something a little bit more for the costume but I guess that really is an oddity isn't it.</br>    A pit.<br>At least it was no tree.</br>  <br>Why thank you! That would be very convenient! <br><br><br>I want to ride the pony.<br><br> Dr.Beanies </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  sighs disappointedly  <br><br>...Nothing. Stay with me if you want to survive the next battle.</br></br></br>  <br> Cliff out of nowhere </br>  <br>I don't even really like Firefly, but I'll help you. Christ.</br>  <br>Ok regular Ryuko. But what about other Ryuko? Shall we call her Old Ryuko, or something?</br>  <br>No chance.<br><br><br>I know, I tried it myself, it did not work out too well.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Hm? So he is indeed a King? beause he does nothing but act like a foolish and lecherous pig.</br>  <br>Good luck, Beanies<br><br>Nep, well, I don't think you're invited to my bday party anymore.</br></br></br>  <br>Sorry Jesus!<br><br>T-Thanks..</br></br></br>  <br>Trees are far worse.</br>  <br>I think it would be better if I was Ryuko, seeing as I've been here longer. Besides, it would complicate things, especially with Hunter if I started going by notRyuko<br><br><br>Well I'm glad to hear everything's sort of fixed itself. And I guess I'll be seeing you at prom, Hunter and I are going together again</br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks. I'll take all the assistance I can get.</br>    <br>Thanks, Jesus.<br><br><br>Pleaaaaaaaaaase?<br><br> Dr.Beanies </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes<br><br><br>The sun cant even fight back, it stands no chance against my danmaku</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why would you ever do such a thing?

You know if they had this cast in the 2nd movie, the world would of been fucked....you know the fatties wouldn't walk up all those stairs.</br></br>  Melissa McCarthy  <br>it is a needless film done solely with the intent of pandering to the female audience because that's the state of affairs nowadays</br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br>women</br>  because it's ghostbusters  <br>hey as long as Bill Murray is gonna be in it, shit's gonna be cash</br>  <br><br>It can't top the first movie.

They already had a disgusting blob.  <br>Could easily go either way. Cast is undeniably talented, but remember what a piece of shit Ghostbuster 2 was.</br>  <br> Surprisingly not cast as Stay Puft Marshmallow Man <br>fixed. Slimer isn't that fat.</br></br>  <br> implying you still won't watch it when it comes out </br>  <br>Because it is yet another fucking re-hash of an old format. No originality except "Oooh, they were blokes before and this time they'll be wimmins". Hollywood is lazy and churns out site.</br>  <br><br>Captain America: Civil War comes out 2016.</br></br>  <br> shitposting  <br> kek </br></br>  Women won't watch it.<br>If women liked funny women they would be popular.<br>Men didn't really watch twilight...didn't stop that being popular.<br>Women are intimidated by funny girls.<br>And men are just bored by them if they're not attractive.<br> life </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That cast alone is an insult.</br>  <br>Yeah we might all watch it eventually.

Jordan was cast because he's a capable actor, and had worked with the director already. This is a pretty common practice in Hollywood. Jonny Storms defining characteristics are that he's douchey, and can set himself ablaze. Being white is secondary.</br>  <br>Because it will suck balls.</br>  Because Deadpool will be.  <br>This. I really don't care if it's an all female cast. I don't even care that much that it's an all female cast becaus eshitty sjw politics have ruined pretty much everything. <br><br>I do care that they picked 4 of the least funny women in a world full of funny women to play in a movie that was a character piece about 4 people who now wont be in it in any meaningful way. They've raped the premise and will receive none of my money. I wont even do them the honor of pirating it. <br><br>Any hope for the continuation of Ghostbusters died with Harold Ramis as far as I'm concerned. Fuck Dan Akroyd for pushing this shit. He's a bigger cuck than moot.</br></br></br></br></br>  Can anyone confirm if the new Jurassic Park is good or not? I haven't seen it yet, I've heard about the ending and it sounds fucking ridiculous  Janosz sums it up perfectly.  <br>Almost. You missed out on the "You can't bust ghosts, you're women!" followed by a snarky save the day.</br>  <br>cos its a try hard feminist movie.<br><br>blatant sexist ideology and good, quality entertainment production don't go very well in hand.</br></br></br>  <br><br> implying doing a reboot isn't original </br></br>  <br>Holy fuck. WHo thought this was a good idea. Women don't like other women. Men don't find women funny, or think about them as real people, so they don't give a shit what happens to them. This movie will make like 20$ tops.</br>    <br> mad max fury road </br>   i like to eat...deal with it! <br> fat whale awkwardly flirts with guy <br> period jokes <br> gurls can be rude too! *fart joke* <br> ghostbusters 2016 </br></br></br></br>  love how they had to include a fatty and a black.<br><br>dat profiling.</br></br>    <br> not greentexting </br>  <br> But Slimers ugly af tho <br>fixed. Slimer isn't that ugly.</br></br>  i might watch it to laugh at the fat woman pretending to run.  <br>Great they have a fuckin dindu in the cast. She looks like an idiot. This picture makes me want to vomit.</br>  <br>best at what? causing feminist uproar when the movie sucks?</br>    <br>I had a fuck buddy who thought she was hilarious I watched identity theft and whatever that movie she robs to be fat.<br><br>Now I think they want women to watch this but most wont and most still think ghostbusters is for nerdy people so its going to flop because the jokes will be mostly about food and being fat with a few sexist things thrown in.</br></br></br>  <br>Like another anon was saying a while back. Ghostbusters could have been a movie about exterminators or fucking contractors, the job itself didn't matter as much as the interactions between the characters.<br>A reboot of just women (and remember even the director based the decision on 'I think if they were all women it would be great') basically overlooks the whole winning formula just to put women under a familiar brand name.</br></br>  <br> sucked </br>  <br>Because Suicide Squad is scheduled to release in 2016.</br>  <br>It's the best one. No joke. It gives you EVERYTHING you could possibly want from a dinosaur movie. It's not citizen kane. It's not supposed to be. <br><br>It's RAWR and running and AHHH and dying and biting and it gives you more of it in one movie than the last 3 of them gav you combined. Quit your bitching and go watch it on the big screen before it's gone.</br></br></br>  <br>/thread indeed</br>  <br> makes absolutely no sense unless Susan is a nig too <br><br> 2015 <br> Hasn't heard of the "Adopt A Nigger" project <br><br>It's a wonderful program showcased in "The Blind Side" - Check it out!</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That black chick is actually pretty funny.</br>  <br><br> changing a story that's 54 years old to please SJWs <br><br>You're fucking pathetic.</br></br></br></br>      <br>Bix nood af</br>  What annoys me most is not the fact its an all female cast. <br><br>It's the fact that when this movie bombs it'll put off any decent director and/or studio from ever touching the franchise again and making something decent.</br></br>  <br>movie will have these themes:<br> &gt;men are shit and fuck the patriarchy <br> &gt;fat women are beautiful <br> &gt;white women prefer black men <br> &gt;empowered vaginas can defeat all evil men <br><br>i dont even want to think what kind of SJW/Whiteknight/betas male actors as supporting roles they will shoehorn into this.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What's the premise? The Stay Puff Marshmallow Woman joins the squad?</br>  <br>That might have actually been me, heh. I've been typing that everywhere, that it could have been ratbusters or roach busters because the premise wasn't the point. It's a character flick. You can't make it about different people and have it retain what made it good.<br><br>I'm amazingly butthurt about this juvenile horseshit.</br></br></br>  why do most black women just look like black men with tits and makeup stuck on?  <br>If it stops people from touching the franchise again then that's fine. The main annoyance will be when it inevitably bombs and SJWs whine saying it bombed because the evil patriarchy doesn't want to see Ghostbusters played by women.</br>  <br>Guy who played Thor is in it. I hear he's the damsel in distress or their secretary (both if they're copying GB2).</br>  sturd  <br>Interesting fact, Bill Murray didn't even want to be in the original Ghost Busters and he only did it because the studio promised to do a movie he wanted to make afterwards. He didn't even like Ghost Busters, and thought it wasn't written well. Only try hard nerds and hipsters actually like that movie, because it's a "classic"</br>  <br>mad max fury road isnt a reboot, it's the story of furyosa and how max helped her.<br><br>It's a good movie because it isn't a sequel.<br><br>I loved Ghostbusters as a kid, i had all the fucking toys man. I won't be touching this shit with a 20ft barge pole, these bitches are not Bill Murry n co.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I concur. Dinosaurs rawring, eating, biting, people bleeding, running, screaming, and Bryce Dallas Howard. Why the fuck aren't you watching it right this second? <br><br>Also, Bryce Dallas Howard.</br></br></br>  <br><br> empowering women by having a ridiculously handsome man as the receptionist <br> muh patriarchy </br></br></br>  <br>Ever looked at a chimpanzee? Were you ever able to tell its gender just by looking at it?</br>  <br>It's a fucking comic book movie if a character changing pisses you off you haven't read enough comics, race doesn't matter in them this is a genre that has people capable of thinking you out of existence.<br><br>And being fantastic four Franklin Richards could be born and a black character is him trolling</br></br></br>  <br> That filename </br>  <br>Well if that's the case, hello again anon.<br>It really is. It's basically "Women can do just as well as men, watch we'll do all the things men have done and you're sexist if you think it's not as good or better than the first".<br>And yes, usual faggots are already pushing that narrative.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Any failure will be attributed to the patriarchy.</br></br>  <br>He's gonna be the guy they "hilariously" flirt with throughout film.<br>Until fatty McCarthy falls through a ceiling while trying to run over to him.</br></br>  <br>havent seen fury road.<br><br>do they try to make furyosa into somekind of super vagina, with max just a cuck paying and making her way?</br></br></br>   "Hey strong woymn we ghosts think you should use proton pack <br>s to kill the patriarchy".<br> "LOL OKAY". <br> Woymns are kill <br> Best movie 2016. </br></br></br></br>  <br>i see.<br><br>that makes sense.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh and her clothes get progressively more ripped. She's got a super hot milfy thing going on that got me wanting more.</br>  <br> 'll put off any decent director and/or studio from ever touching the franchise again <br>that wouldn't be a bad thing. Hollywood needs to quit recycling shit. only reason people care abut it is because jew media has been hyping it for maximum shekels</br></br>  <br>Nah, enough mouthbreathers will go watch it, just like with any other dumbass movie that came out since 2000. So when it inevitably becomes a box office success thanks to copious marketing (like OP's post, for instance) every self-proclaimed anti-capitalist femminazi bitch will suddenly confuse quality and financial success, claiming genderbending the main cast magically made the movie better.<br><br>While in reality it will be an insipid retread of a plot we already know, but without all the punch of the original, and focusing on all the wrong things. If this takes a page from other reboots, we'll probably spend half an hour on the "origin story". You know, the shit we all already know and is literally the movie's title.<br><br>We already know it'll suck because the genderbent main cast is the only attraction to this movie. It's a gimmick, and nothing but a gimmick. Frankly, I'm insulted that feminazi's even claim it's a big deal. If they didn't insist on shittily rebooting a classic, no-one would complain about an all-female comedy.<br><br>But that's exactly the point. Taking a known name is nothing more than a marketing ploy. A way to stir up interest and free publicity. Take some other reboots you know. Star Trek, Total Recall, RoboCop, and strip away all pretense of being the original product. Kirk and Spock become Jones and Sork, commanding the starship Venture. Would you watch that shit? Would you even have heard about it? Fuck no!<br><br>People aren't mad about women being in this shit. People are mad about having this crap constantly shoveled into their faces like we should give a fuck. Like we should just accept it, because some Hollywood producer wanted to make a bundle of cash. Reboots can fuck right the hell off. They're weak, creatively bankrupt pieces of shit, and the fact that these comedians are working on it says more about them than their inevitably poor performance will.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Isn't there suppose to be an all male Ghostbusters film after this one? This is basically going to be a battle of the sexes and if the all male version does better muh muh muh misogynistic  <br>Jurassic world is good for a total of about 10 minutes, if you watch it you'll notice how there's a few short clips about dinosaurs and a massive movie about fucking human shit.<br><br>When the indiminous rex fucks shit up, when the t-rex fucks shit up, and when the giant whale beast fucks shit up its entertaining.<br><br>The female in it makes a sexist comment, the characters you really dont care for, the british assistant who is to baby sit the two children gets brutally murdered (some critics say it was really unnecessary to kill her in the way they did).<br><br>I liked the dinosaur parts, hated the human parts. I'd watch it if you are a fan/grew up with the original Jurassic Park like i did. But don't expect every minute to be as nearly as good as JP.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>...is not a reboot.</br>  <br>If he is the damsel, I've already figured out part of the script.<br>He'll be the one to call with the whole "I have this crazy story you'll never believe", all women will swoon, they'll get right on the case.<br>They'll talk about him in the car, debate staying the night to watch out for 'the ghost' *wink wink*, end up going back that night because "I didn't know women could fight ghosts/be so brave"<br> insert witty feminist dialogue <br> wymyns capture ghost <br> wymyns swoon, one of them gets him, rest want to see his ass. <br><br>Cap it, I predict it will be so.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  what i'm looking forward to, is how feminists will inevitably turn on themselves and rip the movie to shreds.  <br> unfuckable <br> cumdumpsters <br>pick one...</br></br></br>  Well it hasn't come out yet so no one can tell you how it is silly sausage  <br> i ain't afraid of no roast </br>  <br>Real mean actually do consider them as real people. But we consider them to be the annoying little brats they most likely are. Only that rare once in a while do you even cross paths with an actual woman, who has matured mentally, emotionally and physically. But ofcourse you wouldn't know what a real woman is, kid. Judged based on action. Not appearance. Or you're still playing their game. And how are you representative of all men's opinions all of a sudden?<br><br>You sound like a tumblrsjw.<br>Except reversed. Petty, pathetic piece of shit husk of a man.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Even Stan Lee has said if they want to give black people super hero roles, why not just make new characters instead of changing already existing ones. <br><br>Now lets think about this, how hard is it to come up with a name? Why ruin what has been established for over half a century just because nigs feel left out. Or like GB, excluding white males because feminists feel left out. It's fucking stupid and it's a slippery slope I don't want to be on, because white males will be on the losing side of this battle.</br></br></br>  <br>So apart from the all girl cast, any word on the story line? Perhaps a strong story with source material that explains P1&amp;2 will redeem this movie. <br><br>I heard Dan Aykroyd original Ghost Buster manuscript was around 2,000 pages.</br></br></br>  <br> I-I-I-I didn't burn no toast </br>  <br><br>Not at all. They wouldn't have made it without Max. If anything the movie's about how Men and Women need eachother.</br></br>  <br>I'm so mad bro. I grew up with this. It was second only to ninja turtles for me. I had the toys and everything. They're fucking with my childhood. They're gynecological inner-childhood pedos and I hope she has a heart attack during filming so this thing never happens.</br>  <br>never again will there be an all male.<br><br>there might be a LGBT one though.</br></br></br>  <br>they're not hot</br>  <br>FUCK! I wish I'd thought of that.</br>  <br>tfw you remember they already tried adding in a female ninja turtle</br>  <br>nt wasnt that bad . kina cool action scenes</br>  <br>Goddamn gorilla</br>  then after this, will be the next debacle of how they shoehorned Wonderwoman into a Batman/Superman movie.<br><br>just cos.</br></br>  <br>waait wast ??? wherer ? the nw nt didnt have female turtle ?</br>  <br>Honestly, that's the beautiful part about this particular endeavor. It really doesn't matter if they scream "mah patriarchy" or not if it fails. Because movies aren't about cultural conversations. They're about money. If it doesn't make money, it goes away and studios will avoid the "wymenz power" horseshit. <br><br>Unfortunately, as much as I do hate this, I don't think it's a safe bet that it wont make money. Have you seen the profits from movies lately that are objectively horrible films? Hollywood has the best racket going because you have to purchase the product and use it in its entirety first before you know if it's good or bad. And even if it's bad, you don't get a refund. They can do almost anything and turn a profit. And this movie being successful is a VERY bad thing.</br></br></br>  <br>I propose "Wonderman". Because Amazonians need more diversity.</br>  <br><br>Damnit anon you may be right</br></br>  <br><br>1. It's remake<br>2. It has a bunch of no-name actors.<br>3. It's an all female cast to pander to social justice warriors.</br></br></br></br>  <br>well wasnt there a female robin ?</br>  <br>In the Frank Miller comic. She was like....16 or something?</br>  <br> Only try hard nerds and hipsters actually like that movie, because it's a "classic" <br><br>You're literally a fucking moron</br></br></br>  <br>Because writers are lazy that's why it's way easier to just keep the character but change appearance it doesn't affect the story there aren't a lot of good comic writer's left.<br><br>I'd be more pissed if wolverine suddenly went from kicking ass to being a shitty behind the scenes character than him being black</br></br></br>  <br>Venus de milo<br>Lasted a season or so before being fucked off.</br></br>    <br>Watch it, I loved the Mad max trilogy, well you can't really call them a trilogy as it isnt a story that progresses, it's three different stories which involve Max.<br><br>This fourth installment is a story about Furyosa, max is simply the crazy dude who is forced to work with her to survive, after all. that's what he is all about. Surviving in the wasteland.<br><br>Fanboys say its shit but those who don't have their tongues firmly rooted inside mel gibsons anus realise it's a good movie, i really liked it because it has a lot of action, not a lot of fucking annoying stupid dialogue about pointless shit that you really don't give two flying fucks about, and it has a lot of people doing crazy shit which is entertaining.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yeppers pedo bats <br><br>bats vs sups is based on frankmiller but reversed roles</br></br></br>  <br>Yea i actually think she is very atteactive and a good actress i like her...</br>  <br><br>How the fuck are they "fucking with your childhood"? Do you suddenly retroactively not have a childhood? It's the fucking past, it has happened already, just fucking let go.<br><br>Do you really not have anything else to do with your life other than sitting on a message board spewing out your sad angst over some fucking movie no one gives a shit about?</br></br></br></br>  Womyn aren't funny  <br>It's Frank Miller the dude just made edgy stuff, he's a more imaginative Tim Burton</br>  <br>Differnet guy here.<br><br>All the shit about Max and Furiosa is massively overblown. Max speaks less than 100 words, Furiosa slightly more. This is the centre of the argument that lead crazy feminazi's to claim that she's the main character.<br><br>Well, she ain't. Her name isn't on the box, and for fuck's sake, she isn't even the viewpoint character. Max is. Max is the one the movie follows from start to finish, Max is the one with the crazy hallucinations, and Max leaves the centre stage ONE fucking time to do something offscreen, and it's heavily implied he kicks all sorts of ass while the rest is sitting with their thumbs up their asses, waiting for him to get back.<br><br>The character of Max is literally the same as in the first three movies, with the same character arc.<br>-Max wants to be left alone<br>-People won't leave Max alone<br>-Then he needs the help of people so he can walk away<br>-He walks away and realises these people aren't so bad and decided to help them, thereby winning a small amount of peace of mind<br><br>Furiosa is a strong, unorthodox female characters, yes. She's also a fucking amputee. Have you seen anyone claiming that she's part of the amputee agenda to promote handicapable characters in fiction? Nope.<br><br>Fuck, Nux speaks more words than the two of them put together. Nux arguably has the most complex character journey of the three main characters. Nux goes from sympathetic villain, to neutral character, to finding love, and through redemption through love. Nux also has cancer. is Nux part of some nefarious ploy of cancer patients to get more cancer patients into fiction? Nope.<br><br>Put a fucking woman on screen, and feminazi's and MRA's flip the fuck out. That's all you need to know about Furiosa.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>If there's something strange, it's that there's not one dude<br>Who you gonna call? (Ghostbusters)<br>That one fat girl, can't lay off the food<br>Who you gonna call? (Ghostbusters)<br><br>I ain't afraid of no roast<br>I ain't afraid of no roast<br><br>I was going to do the second verse, but frankly it can already be twisted into SJW, fuck the patriarchy anyway.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>pretty sure everyone discards any remakes of TMNT as garbage and non-canonical</br>  <br>Take it easy mate, his childhood is the only thing he has left.</br>  <br><br>Its because Batman is going to lose the fight with Superman, and just pay Wonderwoman to go rough him up.</br></br>  <br><br>It was decent enough. Better than JP3</br></br>  <br>kek, but will never happen.<br><br>unless its transgendergaywonderman</br></br></br>  <br>you've obviously never raped one</br>  because it's filled with womyn muh equality bullshit  <br>Man, that's the entire problem with modern feminism in a nutshell, too.<br><br>Ever notice, EVERY SINGLE TIME some dry-cunt bitch has a problem with something they always scream about how OTHER PEOPLE have to change what they do to suit their desires? <br><br>" You need to spend your professional time that you studied for and took the risks to engage in making games that cater to what I like instead of what you like" ...etc<br><br>Never, and I mean NEVER do these "feminist" sluts EVER suggest women go to school to study something wonderful and create the things they want for themselves. Modern feminists are actually using the woment hey claim to be defending as step ladders, they rely on the subservience and victimization of women in a way the "patriarchy" could only stare at with green eyed envy. <br><br>Feminism is anti women. There's no other way to say it that's more clear. They use them, they keep them in a subservient and inactive position, and they tell these women that they're doing something great for themselves in the process. <br><br>This is going to end so poorly.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Still carries the name, trying to feed off the original series by being edgy, different or diverse. And now we have a reboot of Ghostbusters.</br>  <br>Keep jizzing over a movie with a shit movie with a terrible budget, that the funniest guy in, didn't even want to be in. If anything it's a testament to how funny Bill Murray is, because he just half assed it and made it good. People keep throwing the word classic in this thread but it isn't a classic, it's just iconic. <br>  I ain't fraid of no ghosts!  <br>That's all its legacy is.</br></br></br>  <br>Picture porky pig raping Elmer fudd</br>  This movie is gonna flop harder than a fat bitch off the high dive  <br> be at Hollywood <br> have too much time, money, hookers than I know what to do with <br> think about what I could do that would feel fulfilling <br> see Bill Murray at a party and remember all classics he was part of <br> get the vision to bring classics into the modern age <br> realize that Ghostbusters is a great place to start but not sure how to adapt it <br> think "I know, I'll add women!" <br> realize Ghostbusters already had women in it <br> confused and coming off my cocaine high I realize if I can't make it great I'll just piss everyone off <br> while a hobo is jacking me off for $5 throw together a script with females leading in this bizarro world <br> announce it to the world and present it as progressive <br> pat myself on the back and watch as fans are torn apart by trying not to seem sexist while defending one of their childhood favorites <br> mfw </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ok, so its about the female lead, with max as sidekick to leach the franchise. as expected then.</br>  <br><br>Ya'll can back the fuck up for not being able to handle Leslie Jones. <br>No humor in your dead souls</br></br></br>  <br>Actually, this is the ultimate version of the FF, and even so. Plus, things change over time.<br><br>54 years ago there wasnt Internet. If you want to discuss FF, write in to the marvel letters page like people did 54 years ago.</br></br></br>  i'm going to hinge all of my opinions on shoehorning women into media because of muh equality on this one film.<br>if it is good, i will side with the womynz forever<br>if it is shit i will never accept another argument again</br></br>  <br><br>SHE FUCKING HAS TURTLE TITS</br></br>  <br><br>It's not "heavily implied" he kicks a bunch of ass.
