[ Best of 4chan thread    Casey Franks and his thug friends invaded a Las Vegas home to rob it and ended up raping a woman along the way (pornstar Cythera). Reading their Facebook friends support is why black people have got to go  <br>Niggers gon nig</br>  His Facebook page is /casedogg206  These big friends' replies are barely legible, this type of shit make me lose faith in humanity  <br>The White Man and his thug friends invaded homes in Africa, America, Australia New Zeeland, India, etc to rob and ended up raping women and enslaving men, women and children along the way, reading history books is why white people have got to go!</br>  <br>So what you're saying is that two wrongs make a right? Damn we learned they don't when we were kids. Stop justifying the crimes of monsters.</br>  <br>B8</br>  <br>KEK<br><br>I'm white but this African American is speaking the truth</br></br></br>  <br>Stop replying to yourself</br>  <br><br>It's almost like being a violent sociopath isn't a racial thing. So weird, thankfully we all know that's just what the hollywood jewreptile mastermind zionists want us to think.</br></br>  <br>Slaves were mostly captured and sold by other Africans.</br>  <br>Double dubs has never seen rednecks before, excuse him.</br>  <br>Black people are fine but niggers got to go. Doesn't matter what race you are; if you act like the stereotypical ghetto back person you have to go. <br><br><br>see pic related <br><br><br>Not all were. Stop it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Can you even read? how am I justifying anyone's crimes? I simple make a comment about other crimes that were committed trough tout history... I'm not saying that Rape, Genocide, Enslaving and Pillage of a multitude of entire nations together with the rape and robbing of a woman make a right, both of them are wrong... they are not proportional but they are both wrong...<br><br>do you capisce ?</br></br></br>  <br>Tee Millions? That's a big step up from Tree Fiddy.</br>  <br>forgot pic</br>  <br>wtf is he or she saying</br>  <br>More Europeans were enslaved by Africans during the Barbary Slave Trade. If you really knew your history, you would know that Africans started it. All Africans should be exterminated.</br>   free my nigga <br><br>I will never understand black culture</br></br>  <br>You must be new here.</br>  <br>Read a history book you dumbshit pavement ape. Nigger "leaders" sold their own people to us. Also don't even pretend you have anything to do with any of that. You're living in our society and are given equal rights and a beautiful place to stay. Would you rather a mud hut in a nigger desert? I didn't think so.</br>  <br>that's why Africans are filthy rich!</br>   pornstar <br> rape <br>Pick one.</br></br>  Isn't Cythera the pornstar that pisses like a mule?  <br>someone needs a girlfriend...</br>  <br>Squirter</br>  <br><br>squirt piss same difference. They squirt piss.</br></br>  who's the pornstar bitch. someone post some content of this bitch. got raped by niggers top kek  she had it all under control. shes taken a few dicks before this......  <br>So you need to be a dumb shit like you to have a gf? Gotcha.</br>  <br>In front of little kids no less.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>White boys fighting with white boys about nigger dick... this thread is full of in-closet homos with the jungle fever.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't have the mental fortitude to debate this nor do I really care.</br>  <br>Aren't you the most generic anon ITT?</br>  <br>Why, because she makes you insecure?<br><br>Soldiers can still be murdered<br>Journalist can still be lied about<br>Politicians can still be lied to<br>You can still get raped</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br>It's not possible to debate it, there's evidence. It's like "debating" that gravity exists or that my hand isn't on my cock. Because you know damn well where my hand is, and nobody gives a fuck about gravity.<br><br>QEW</br></br></br></br>    <br>Lol anon decides to show up.</br>  <br>http://www.theprp.com/2015/07/22/ne<wbr>ws/former-enabler-bassist-amanda-da<wbr>niels-speaks-on-suffering-abuse-mor<wbr>e-while-in-the-band/</wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>AIDS.</br>  <br>Agreed.</br>  <br>People will debate about anything anon; even things that are factual. I'm not saying that squirting isn't pissing just that I'm not falling for the verbal trap.</br>  <br>I can't take anything with "gravity" in it serious since interstellar xD</br>    <br> actual cuck detected </br>  <br>4 knobs, is that the deluxe j bass?</br>  <br> implying being a cuck is a bad thing </br>  they should hang those niggers like in the good old days  <br>Africans sold other black people into slavery you do know that right</br>  Why exactly did they end raping Cythera? DId they just met in the street and followed her home? Did they actually had her adress? were they obssesed with her squirting skills or she was just the frist pornstar they got?<br><br>did she squirt?</br></br>  I totally agree with this thread! We need to help stop the oppression on black people. We are all black when the lights go out anyway.<br><br>Meanwhile check my band new video!<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=jRG<wbr>rNDV2mKc</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  got the video  Dumped gf for sayin her black coworker aint no nigger  <br>underated post</br>  <br>Fun fact, the first slave owner in the US was black.</br>  <br>she was definitely fucking him</br>  Pornstar is not even good looking but then again what girl with niggers is? <br><br>Niggers need to take what they can get.</br></br>  <br>That and white people actually stopped slavery in most parts of the world.</br>  <br>The first person to own slaves in the US was a black man.........</br>  <br><br>Im genuinely curious In a conflict of feminazis versus niggers who do the SJWs support?</br></br>  <br>what kinds of faggots post this shit here as a response? are you a sjw faggot? seriously i fuck u faggots up irl.</br>    <br><br>Yes and In fact white Americans did more to stop slavery than most other groups.<br><br>After the Barbary wars and the abolition of slavery in the US, the Ameriflap navy did a lot to disrupt the east African slave trade where blacks sold their captured slaves to the Arabs.</br></br></br></br>  <br>http://palimas.com/video.php?id=775<wbr>8</wbr></br>  source?  <br>How will SJWs respond?<br><br> a woman was raped <br>kill the men!!<br><br> the perpetrators were black <br>they didn't do muffin!!!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She willingly participated in gangbangs.

She could really stand to trim that brier patch down though. I've always like Miley's physic up until I heard her talk. That bumpkin voice of hers is a complete boner kill. Would I bang? Hells yes if she keeps her mouth shut.  <br>i don't really care about her as a person. i just fap to her. not into short haired girls and think miley is a bit of a butterface myself - probably mostly due to the mongy faces she pulls in every picture. but she does have a nice bod and is worth the odd fap.</br>    <br><br>i like the patch</br></br>  <br>moar pussy pics in this set ?</br>  Am I the only one that would rather fuck a septic tank then this bitch?

All trannies are abstracted autists.  <br><br>So you guys think all of them went to jail?</br></br>  <br>in what manner where they touched? did the women press charges?</br>  Lots of fools in this thread. If you want to get away with anything just become a faggot, much better a trans. You cant bash them, you cant question what they do. Our govt gave em all the rights now. Time to wake up and fight this mental illness.  <br>I'm trans, I use womens bathrooms, and i behaved in such a manner in them, i'd expect to be expelled and charged for indecency like any cis man or woman.<br><br>I don't get how you people can be this retarded, being trans does not put you above the law.</br></br></br>  <br>Too many scenarios. Apparently the girls were unaware they can press charges because for them it was nothing cause they consider trans females. Theh prolly just got pissed then moved on.<br><br>Now imagine that being done to your gf, by a pretend trans.</br></br></br>  <br>He may be all woman on the inside, but he's 100% child molester on the outside.</br>  <br> using cis as a prefix for man and woman <br> being this retarded </br></br>  <br> not understanding latin <br>https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cis-<wbr></wbr></br></br>  Pretend Trans Guide by Caitlyn Jenner<br> losing fame, convert to faggotry <br> perks gained: <br> free kill (got away with it) <br> fame and money rushing back <br> receive courage award <br> big time magazine deals <br> still banging women cause he's a trans lesbian </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Cause I dont need to. Cis usage is for latin, are you latin? If youre just from tumblr, get off your fucking high horse. You're not impressing anyone SIR</br>  <br> I'm trans <br>no matter how hard you try to pretend that the sky is green and the grass is blue, it will never be so.<br><br>everyone else just sees you as an ugly man</br></br></br></br>  <br> I am above basic etymology <br>you just went full retard</br></br>  <br>Way out of context. Latin may be the root of most words, but that doesnt mean youre required to use/memorize the ancient ones. It has no practical application unless you're lit or just trying to impress people online with your hipster bullshit.</br>  <br><br>Hes also 100% troll.<br>Look at the smile on his face.<br><br>Thats the smile of someone who can freely perv on pre teen girls getting changed and nobody can say shit about it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You dont have to say cis.<br><br>Cis just means normal.<br>If you leave it out, everyone will assume the person you are talking about is normal.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> cis in conjunction with man or woman is redundant <br> 0/10 </br></br>  <br><br>since when have trans people had these rights?</br></br>  <br> ancient <br>but cis and trans are common prefixes<br><br>transatlantic/cisatlantic<br>translocative/cislocative<br>transregulatory/cisregulatory<br>translunar/cislunar<br><br>if you have any understanding of the english language past those of an immigrant taxi driver, these are things you must understand.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You're a creep though, and not a charming gay guy.</br></br>  Okay, so we can't say man or woman now? Cause if we do, we'd get bashed on how we assumed right off the bat that he's straight.<br><br> huurrr i have a dick but im a woman </br></br>  <br>Oh wow, big words sir. I dont use them in my career because I dont need to. Are you a mapper or something? Or just from tumblr?<br><br>Last time I checked those words arent required to speak english. If your standard for mastering the english alphabet is by memorizing these words with cis, then i have bad news for you.<br><br>Also, stop hating on immigrant taxi drivers. It's an honest job. Such a racial and hateful trans you are.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>All that gendershit has gone too far, those gendershit people drags it down to an entirely new and shittier level. It is just a sign of rotten brains, and those piss-brained excuses for civilized creatures want their insanity to be the norm. They are all retarded to no end! I dont give a fuck what they identify as. I dont give a fuck what makes them feel comfortable. My wish to say 'he' or 'she' outranks their wish about what they want to hear.<br>' He ' = born with a penis.<br>' She ' = born with a pussy.<br>End of story.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> i only know words pertinent to my career <br>wow.<br>retard thread.<br>/out</br></br></br></br>  <br>so cis is required when mentioning man or woman now? the fuck happened</br>  <br> cisatlantic <br><br>I lold slightly.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah man. Preach ignorance!</br>  <br>I think you should use cis if you're comparing it to trans. A transwoman vs a ciswoman.<br><br>In other situations, you'd just call both women.</br></br></br>  <br>Man or woman by default are straight. Those who pretend are trans. Adding cis to them is an insult.</br>  <br><br>Yeah! Hold back science to the point YOU think it should be at.</br></br>  <br> I think you should use cis if you're comparing it to trans. A transwoman vs a ciswoman. <br><br>Agreed.<br><br> In other situations, you'd just call both women. <br><br>But then people would assume the tranny woman is a cis woman.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>What kind of manbaby would be insulted by adding cis?</br></br>  <br>Enjoy you delusions and mental illness.</br>  <br>sure, bet your words have a meaning to a wrestler. Not everyone is a now it all unless youre from the internet.</br>  <br>Huh??</br>  <br><br>What difference would it make if people think if the tranny is a woman?</br></br>  <br>Comparing a transwoman to a ciswoman and just calling the ciswoman a woman implies a transwoman is not a woman.<br><br>And she is. Fight me.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Trannies. They are unstable and often unreasonable in their demands for being treated as a special snowflake.</br></br>  <br> What difference would it make if people think if the tranny is a woman? <br><br>Someone might attempt to have sex with it and get a nasty surprise.</br></br></br>  <br>Easy<br>If you have a dick, you're a man.</br></br>    <br>It is a he.<br>What he does is just some kind of dress-up.</br></br>  <br><br>They just want to be treated as the gender they identify. It's you manbabies who throw a tantrum and act like it's an unreasonable request.</br></br>    <br><br>And hormone therapy.</br></br>  <br>Do you believe that, as you are a trans woman, you should be disallowed from using the men's bathroom like all other women.</br>  <br> an unreasonable request. <br><br>Yes, it is.<br>What they do is just some kind of dress-up.</br></br></br></br>   be who you are, a famous quote for trannies <br> cant accept birth gender <br>Hypocrites</br></br>  <br><br>I want to be treated like Prince William.<br><br>Just saiyan.</br></br></br></br>  <br>For them it's feelings&gt;facts<br> Hurt it doesn't matter that I have a dick, I FEEL like I'm a woman so I am one. </br></br>  <br>Yes, they could need some mental therapy for all that piss they have in their heads.</br>  <br><br>And also hormone therapy.</br></br>  <br>Hurr* <br>On mobile</br></br>  Could it be that Americans heard that song 'man I feel like a woman' and took it too seriously?  <br><br>Just saying you don't understand analogies?</br></br>  <br><br>I'm not sure you understand what a trans person is.</br></br>  <br> other women. <br>Idiot!<br>He is a male! No fucking woman.</br></br></br>  <br><br>That's not it at all. But I guess looking into basic science is too hard for you.</br></br>  <br>To herself she is a woman, to the rest of the world she is a man masquerading as a woman.</br>  <br><br>Well, to the idiots she is.</br></br>  <br>Kek'd 20/20</br>  <br>Since I'm obviously so retarded, why don't you go ahead and explain why I'm wrong?</br>  <br>Wow we're entering science now. Ready to admit its a mental illness then?</br>  <br>My wish to say 'he' or 'she' outranks their wish about what they want to hear.</br>  <br>Trannies want to make it a crime to reject sex with one of them. Trannies are literally anti-consent, but you SJW fucktards are too retarded to realize your contradictory double standards.</br>  <br>You are m-a-l-e.<br>Or you are f-e-m-a-l-e.<br>That is the basic.<br>If you feel like anything else, that is j-u-s-t a feeling.<br>If you identify as anything else, that is a m-e-n-t-a-l d-i-s-o-r-d-e-r.<br>Doesn't change a thing.<br>You are s-t-i-l-l the same.<br>You c-a-n'-t change.<br>No fucking way.<br>What you do is just some kind of dress-up.<br>End of story.<br>If you say you h-a-v-e changed, that is l-y-i-n-g.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Does this mean<br><br>That if everyone considered themselves female<br><br>We could all bitch and complain about unfair work/rights??</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The mental illness is the discomfort they feel for being in the wrong body. Again, basic stuff. It's not that they're a man who identifies as a woman. Why do you think they change the body? Did you ever put any thought into this?</br></br>  <br>Sad reality check. I loath the day that trannies will sue you for rejecting them to buttfuck because of discriminations. Liberals will allow this.</br>  <br><br>Also they do hormone therapy and surgery. Still. Who's surprised you are unable to learn new basic facts? I'm not.</br></br>  <br>God, that's so retarded I lost my will to reply to your argument.</br>  <br><br>Show some proof of this.<br><br>At least for you manbabies, forced sex will mean you could get laid before you an hero.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Science says XY or XX or XXY, or XYY<br>Male and female are the basic reduction of XY and XX<br>Everything else is dictated by culture to a great extent</br></br></br>  <br>If a male with plastic boobs doesn't say anything about his pissniss, than it is h-e who is cheating in the first hand. So don't blame m-e!<br>And in the second hand, he is sick in his head, so fuck him. (not in h-i-s way)<br>I would probably kill the guy.</br></br></br>  <br><br>First of all you need to properly address me as His Royal Highness.<br><br>Then I will read your message and respond.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, it must be hard when I have a basic grasp on this stuff, and you still stumble over the mental illness part.</br></br>  <br>A trans vagina is literally a penis turned inside out and pushed back into the body. So they are lying when they say they don't have a dick</br>  Wait til trans ask for alimony when you get them pregnant  <br><br>You're confusing sex and gender.</br></br>  <br> basic facts <br><br>' He ' = born with a penis.<br>' She ' = born with a pussy.<br>There are no more alternatives.<br>End of story.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Or, there is the simple, biological and physical fact that a transwoman is different to a woman. And we are lucky enough to have different words for it.</br>  <br><br>Unfunny people are such a drag.</br></br>  <br>Here we go with this retarded argument again.<br>They are the same.thing.</br></br>  <br>So if it was a male with natural boobs it would be ok?<br><br>ALRIGHT PEOPLE MAKE SURE YOU TAKE YOUR HORMONES <br>AND GET YOUR NATURAL BOOBS GOING. <br>you are not sick if you have natural boobs<br> plastic boobs </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Gender is reallysimple.<br>Theres two genders. Straight male and fag.<br><br>If you arent a straight male, then you are a fag. Simple as that.<br><br>Before anyone asks, women are a type of fag.<br>That explains a lot I think everyone will agree.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What if<br><br>you were born<br><br>with both parts?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I like your confidence. It's similar to when a man grinds meat then his hands gets shredded instead. Keep it up.</br>  <br>Not at all. <br>I never once said someone could physically change their sex, not at our current level of technology.<br>Biologically even sex is misconstrued into thinking its just XX or XY- permutations do exist. <br><br>Male and female are interchangeable terms for both sex and gender- thus, culture dictates how one is received and what concessions are made outside the binary paradigm.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br>Whats that?<br>I cant quite read your message because you arent addressing me with the right pronouns.<br><br>Try again maybe?</br></br></br></br></br>      <br>Nope.<br><br>Normal people call one a woman and the other a crazy man in a dress.</br></br></br>  <br><br>But that's not a dick.</br></br>  <br>I live no more than 10 minutes from that college. it's filled with hippies and trannies and feminists and anything liberal you can imagine.</br>  <br> if you have natural boobs <br>... and are a male, it's probably fat. Go on a diet.</br></br>  <br>Trigerred trans detected<br> no argument, post spidey instead </br></br>  <br><br>He and she are gender pronouns. You listed sexual characteristics. Do you even try?</br></br>  <br>  giving fashion advice is sexist and triggering <br>But what are they going to read besides fashion magazines then?</br></br>  <br>i know that person kek</br>  <br> In other situations, you'd just call both women. <br>no, nobody with functioning eyeballs would ever call them both women</br></br>  <br><br>According to who? I mean besides fat virgins.</br></br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>Muh nigger</br>  <br><br>Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha, le epic joke man. Pretending to be a royal on the Internet, who even DOES that. <br>Crazy.</br></br></br>  <br>gynecomastia, yo. <br><br>Here's a question: Why does their need to be only two genders accepted? Biology states there is only two sexes, but culture cannot be reduced to binary.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Or its like when a guy has read something, and has to argue with an ignorant virgin.</br></br>  <br>It's not a vagina</br>  <br>Bet you read horton hears a who</br>  <br><br>Holy shit, George Carlin is back from the dead!</br></br>  <br>kilala mo sya</br>  <br>ye it is. just a mutilated one</br>  <br>Every sensible person ever</br>  <br> Hormones </br>  <br><br>Except scientists.</br></br>  <br>What?</br>  <br>There ARE only two genders you retard.<br>Male and female.</br></br>  <br>Sex shaming isn't very progressive.<br><br>Why can't you SJW crazies ever practice the bullshit you preach. Oh, because it's not "problematic" when you're awful, right? Punching up, or whatever other excuses you use to not obey your own mandates.<br><br>I hope you all die painfully.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Well, it seems to me like we need to come up with a word for this backwards dickhole vaginot.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>   sex </br></br>  <br>But you can have a lot of different kinds of sex with those two.</br>  <br>Ever notice medical exams have <br>[ ] Male <br>[ ] Female<br>[ ] Other<br> ? </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A dick</br>  <br>No, no there aren't.<br>The Indians have the Hijra, the Thai have their kathoey, the Native Americans have the twin-spirited etc etc. <br>Gender is culture based.</br></br></br>  <br>You can thank the SJWs on twitter for that</br>  <br>then you can go fuck yourself</br>  <br><br>I'm not an sjw. And see? I nailed the virgin part.</br></br>  <br>  "I'm 13 but I identify as being 21. Stop opressing me and give me alcohol &amp; a drivers license" </br>  Wait, trans people are allowed to be in whatever bathroom they want?<br><br>If they identify as the opposite sex, fine, but i still identify them as their real sex and its retarded that they should be in the same bathroom as me</br></br>    <br>I'm a mtf trans and if you don't pass, you don't go in the female bathroom. If you didnt transition before 18 your chances of passing are probably 30% that you'll pass at all. Being trans is like being a super nigger. Everyone hates you. You get arrested and attacked for just about everything. I have no idea where youre getting this get out of jail free card bullshit. If anything, I'm the first person to be blamed every single time. Fuck even if 'm in guy mode, I sometimes get shit for "being gay" and I have to deal with incorrect gay bashing bullshit too.<br><br>I'm probably not even going to come out as trans if I ever get caught. I'm just going to make up shit about muh chromosome genetic testing because your average person has no fucking clue about anything transgender or intersex anyways. ama if you want. I wont bullshit you like the rest of the cancerboard that is /lgbt/.</br></br></br>  <br><br>It predates Twitter by decades, pal.</br></br>  <br>flipfag detected, saw a bunch of these gays in buzzfeed.</br>  <br>What do you mean you get arrested?</br>  <br><br>You definitely sound 13</br></br>  <br> knows he's right but doesn't like it <br> uses ad hominem </br></br>   we live in a world were this is okay   All ya'll bitching about trans people. Then when all the trannies are gone you're going to be bitching about not having any porn.  <br><br>You do realize there are people born with both genitalia and the like? <br>  Are you part of the 49% <br>  The other 49% <br>  or the 2% of freaks we never really think about </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>How is he right? He's just showing he doesn't understand trans people at all. It's not an opportunistic choice.<br><br>Also, ad homenim doesn't mean making fun of someone.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Move out of texas.</br>  <br>I've never met a trans who wasn't completely insufferable in real life<br><br>and then I always find normal ones on 4chan<br>why aren't there more of you and less of the others? fuck</br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah it's a pretty small place here<br>everyone knows everyone<br>person in pic is a decent fellow</br></br></br>  <br>look at that niggas face, you know he knows what he's doing and he's getting away with it.</br>  <br>Maybe the problem is that you suck.</br>  <br> Thinks being trans is an acceptable lifestyle <br> Claim you won't bullshit us <br><br>top kek m8</br></br></br></br>  <br>its true, back there everyone knows everyone. Good thing im far now.<br><br>dont know him personally just saw him in buzzfeed and just lol'd at his message.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Kill yourselves</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You chose to live outside societies norms.<br>You have no one to blame but yourself.</br></br>  <br>Cry more</br>  <br>Yes I'm aware, it's most likely because we all have vaginas in the womb but men develop the penis and lose the vagina, sometimes the vagina doesn't go away</br>  <br><br> chose <br><br>So you don't think it's a mental illness anymore?</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a mental illness that they choose to feed in to</br>  <br>People with this illness never chooses to acknowledge it.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Kill yourselves as well</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Now you're changing your answer. It's funny how you squirm from simple logic.</br></br>  <br>"Evidence suggests that people who identify with a gender different from the one they were assigned at birth may do so not just due to psychological or behavioral causes, but also biological ones related to their genetics, the makeup of their brains, or prenatal exposure to hormones"<br>wiki/Gender_dysphoria</br></br>  <br><br>They do! That's why they get hormone therapy.</br></br>  <br>Having an illness and acting on it are two different things</br>  <br>logic motherfucker, can you use it?</br>  <br><br>That's like saying I have lung cancer and still continue to smoke.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Kill yourselves</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Illness and urge aren't the same thing.</br></br>  <br>no, fuck you, no =]</br>  <br><br>No, it's like having lung cancer and going for chemo.</br></br>  <br>https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dav<wbr>id_Reimer</wbr></br>    <br>If i think grey aliens have taken over the government and is secretly planing to genocide all humans that is mental illness.<br>If i chose to tell people about this that is my choice, because even delusional people have some sort of understanding of what is considered "normal" in society.<br><br>Perhaps transgender people do not, maybe they are too far gone into their own delusions that they no longer have any contact with their sanity.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If inhaling more tar is chemo for you, go ahead.</br>  <br>It's more like having lung cancer, getting gills surgically implanted and then move underwater, instead of stopping to smoke.</br>  <br>I'm not sure you know what a mental illness is. Or an analogy.</br>  <br> drawing conclusions using sample size = 1 <br> no peer review <br>umm yeah thats not how science works</br></br></br>  <br>  touch boobs (regardless of age) <br>Nope<br><br>  go to women pee rooms <br>I believe so, but you're not going to get away with it for long unless you start taking horomones and shit.<br><br>  and swing my dick <br>You're not going to get away with that at all</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>You realize that the current best medical treatment for these people is transitioning them, right? You're literally arguing against our best medical science with bad analogies. Are you against vaccines as well?</br></br></br>  <br>no, because youd get your ass kicked for doing that anywhere you stupid fuck</br>  <br>Yeah. That's called being a girl.</br>  <br><br>Ahahahaha. It's pretty obvious you're trolling now.</br></br>  <br>Thats like allowing a blind man to drive a bus on a curved road. Expect death.<br><br>Enable =/= Cure.</br></br></br>  <br>Anything you do, you are immediately the party who fucked up because youre transgender. Its like being an animal or a retarded woman. Nobody trusts anything you say and youre treated like a nigger. You can literally see people wanting to sic dogs and use firehoses on you.<br><br><br>I'm in Arizona. My mtf friend moved to texas. I feel bad for her.<br><br><br>I dont know. Everyone on the internet is a faggot now. I'm pretty bad though lots of mental problems and sleep problems. But yeah I've noticed a lot of transgenders are either fake or retarded man children or ugly ass hons like jenner.<br><br><br>It isnt. Im pretty much full time in male mode. Hormones don't do much anyways. <br><br><br>I didn't choose anything. My body is just fucked up and have always been this way. I was unfortunately born this way. Fighting it has only filled me with hate and resentment. If I had supportive parents and transitioned when I was young, I would have passed flawlessly. When my testosterone levels were high in my teens, it practically made me psychotic. Even if I have to spend the rest of my life as a guy, Id rather have estrogen in my body. It just feels right. The world is vibrant and colorful. Whenever I run out for a few days, I become suicidal and everything is awful. I want to just be myself. I feel crossdressed all the time dressed up as a boy. I just want to be myself. Im hoping to be able to pass and pretend all of this shit never happened.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not arguing against it. I'm just saying in the process of transitioning, they basically have to change their entire life. <br>Maybe a therapist and a bit of realism would have done the same.</br></br>  <br><br>It's not "enabling" anything. It's treating a disease. I wonder who would know more....modern medicine, or you. Tough call. If we need a bad analogy, we will ask you.</br></br>  <br><br>More people pretend to be women on the internet than royals.</br></br>  <br>no you stupid fuck<br>research in science is conducted on large samples<br>while the reimer case was tragic, you cannot use anecdotes to draw sweeping conclusions. again, large samples</br></br></br>  <br><br>They do go to therapy. Nobody is arguing that they aren't born in a man's body. Realism is there.</br></br>  <br>Modern medicine calls this a mental illness and it says therapy not transition.<br><br>Youre saying that it's like raising a rat underwater because it thinks it's a fish. It will drown.</br></br></br>  <br>I meant when the dick develops and the vagina doesn't go away</br>  <br><br>It's one particular, prominent case, you retard. WITH a control.</br></br>  <br><br><br>this fuckin guy<br>do you even know what analogies are you idiot</br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty much yeah.</br>  <br><br>You need to learn what mental illness is. Also, if transitioning wasn't the best option, they wouldn't do it. Do you live in Mexico or something, where you can pay a guy in a back alley for anything?</br></br>  <br><br>No kidding. It's like a badger failing a spelling test.</br></br>  <br>theres only ONE set of twins<br>to draw valid conclusions you need a large sample of twins, you tool</br></br>  <br>Transitioning is what the majority of denial patients call for and societ has accepted it. Its not a cure, its more on the lines of dianetics.<br><br>Its like getting aids and thinking having more sex will eventually kill it out.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah dude. Theres no fucking therapy. Psychiatry is a fucking joke for the most part and is about hugs and snuggles and learning to let things go and not being a faggot other than the few obvious biological disorders like schizophrenia.<br><br>No therapists or even endocronologists have any fucking experience with transgender people. If anything they are scared to touch us. My endo in Tucson said he only sees about 12 transgender patients an entire year. Its pretty much up to us to figure it out ourselves. Most people are just obvious fetishists and you dont need psych help to figure out you just like wearing wigs and sticking shit up your ass. Psych help usually comes down to: let's talk about what you are going to do when your family abandons you.</br></br></br>  <br>Would you argue that cutting of the limbs of leprosy afflicted people is the best way of treating them? Maybe in the future it will be easier to correct the brain instead of changing the entire body. <br><br><br>No it's not. They spend thousands of dollars if not millions to change their lifestyle, so it suits them better. <br>Why don't people cheer on 50 year old men who buy porches and act like they're 25?<br>They clearly feel out of place and are also ready to spend a lot of money on it. <br><br>I'm not against them or anything, but acting like it's the most common and logical thing in the world to change your gender, if you feel pretty in girls cloth, is absurd.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>How many sets of twins do you think there are where one had their dick burned off? You really are dumb.</br></br>  <br><br>Wow you're so bad with analogies.<br><br>They don't just let anyone transition who asks. Again, modern medicine disagrees with you.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>They aren't changing their gender.</br></br>  <br>By modern medicine, you mean shamanism?</br>  <br>thats exactly what im saying! you cannot draw conclusions from such a limited sample!<br>not to mention the doctor was an immoral asshole who compelled and manipulated his subjects<br>the whole thing was utterly useless _even_ as a case study</br></br></br>  <br>this. Transgender people are rare as fuck as it is let alone twin studies and large thousands of person samples. Then on top of that youd have to exclude all the hon fucks from beyond the 1990s because the meds they took were all made of horse piss and useless as fuck and weren't biologically equivalant. Then you'd have to deal with all the fucked up psych problems from being persecuted all their lives. Physical assaults, rapes, sex workers. Eating disorders. Some people self-mutilate their genitals to fuck with their normal growth. The list goes on and on and on. All this shit that isn't part of a normal human's life. I've met 1 other transgender person in real life. Good fucking luck studying all that shit.</br>  <br>So what, wanting to change your gender is somehow more special than wanting to be young? <br>Weird, I don't remember all the stories about the fountain of sex change and until recently both were equally undoable.</br></br>  <br>But yet his "research" is what everything about gender today is based on</br>  <br><br>You do see a lot of weird body modification stuff like people having saline injected in their foreheads etc.<br><br>Some people get their tongue split surgically so it looks like a forked tongue.<br><br>Or look up corset piercing.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  The people defending mental illnesses such as these always throw around words like 'uneducated' and 'ignorant'.<br><br>I could go on about the billions of years our universe has been around, and how everything from the spread of matter from the singularity every atom in it was once part of eventually resulted in our solar system, which resulted in our earth at one point, and with it, at some time millions of years ago, organic molecules. These organic molecules eventually evolved into life as we know it today, through chemical reactions resulting in bacteria/ very small sea life which eventually through natural selection/ 'survival of the fittest' grew larger and left the sea after early amphibians grew legs and survived/ reproduced on land. Now fast forward a bit (just by our monkey ancestors) and you get us, the human beings.<br><br>The male has the XY chromosomes, and the female XX. Everything scientific points to that. Everything in the body is determined by that perfect DNA/ chromosome pair. I can guarantee you scientifically that if you have the XY chromosomes at birth, everything in your body was geared for a male homosapien life, from your reproductive organs &amp; hormones to certain parts of your brain and your skeletomuscular system, even to your nerves and sensory organs. The same goes for the females with the XX chromosomes.<br><br>Now come to the late 20th and ongoing into the 21st century, there's a very current societal culture of people claiming to be the opposite gender. It goes against everything we know about science and biology, but it's a social trend with a massive following and victimisation stigma attached to it in order for society to accept and integrate it to be a norm, and naturally it becomes stigma and 'ignorant' to question this as normal. Kids growing up today are being fed in schools and through the media that this is all normal and perfect, and anybody who says otherwise is a 'hater', 'ignorant', or even a bully.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You never Googled Dr. Money, did you? No wonder you sound so clueless.</br></br>  <br>God damn it anon, you're arguing about the most retarded shit.</br>  <br><br>They aren't changing their gender. Wanting to be young isn't an illness. I don't even know why you would think a midlife crisis is an illness.</br></br>  <br> God damn it anon, you're arguing about the most retarded shit. <br><br>/thread.<br><br>The whole notion of being able to change your gender in any way is retarded.<br><br>Get a fucking job or something. For fucks sake.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Body modification is not the same thing. Why would you think it is?</br></br>  <br> geared for a male homosapien life <br>Are you implying current culture is the epitome of "male homosapien" life? That we, as a collective, are currently living the best possible outcome of biology and manipulation of environment? If so, then the embrace of transgender-ism is the natural byproduct of evolving genes...<br><br> Now come to the late 20th and ongoing into the 21st century <br>Uhh, "transgenderism" has existed way longer than that. See India, native America et al.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The person I was replying to was implying that doctors will only perform medical procedures on you that are safe and appropriate. Unless you live in Mexico.<br><br>I was providing an example of people getting extreme surgery thats not exactly medically advisable.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Uh, you're confusing sex and gender. Not only that, it doesn't go against our science at all.</br></br>  <br>Nah, I'm just saying they're not really different from anybody else, that ever wanted something, so he or she could feel better. <br>Except, that they spend a lot of money on it and I think it's a frivolous thing to do, of course there are much more frivolous people out there. <br><br><br>Is it not? A lot of people fear death and yearn for youth, we've just accepted that we can't do anything about it, so it's normal. You collapse crying because you can't handle your own mortality? You get send to a shrink, they don't try to make you younger. <br>It's nice that we can now do something about people wanting to change their gender, but is it really the best thing to do?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Who is changing their gender? Nobody said that.</br></br>  <br> tldr <br> let me explain science to you from a 6th grader's standpoint by misrepresenting science because I have no idea what im actually talking about and are actually just throwing terminology around to sound intelligent </br></br>  <br> Who is changing their gender? <br><br>The trannies.<br><br>Try to keep up anon.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You don't go to a dr for piercings.</br></br>  <br><br>Wow you really are retarded. Look up the word illness first. Being old isn't one.</br></br>  <br><br>If they could change gender there wouldn't be a problem</br></br>  <br><br>Like most medical procedures that depends how much money you have.<br><br>Some physician in new york has done 15 tongue bifurcations.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>That's not a treatment for an illness.</br></br></br>  <br> Except, that they spend a lot of money on it <br>You know like 40% of the homeless are lgbt right? Bruce Jenner spent a lot of money on shit BECAUSE HE WAS FUCKING MARRIED TO A KARDASHIAN AND OWNS AN AIRCRAFT MANUFACTURER AND HAS A NETWORTH OF 100 FUCKING MILLION DOLLARS</br></br>  <br><br>Easy solution:<br><br>Step 1: setup<br>stream on Younow<br>Step 2: Kill urself on stream</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You don't even understand the issue here, do you? It's not people who want something like you want to have sex one day. It's people who live shitty lives because they are the wrong sex.</br></br>  <br><br> shitty live because wrong gender <br><br>Kill yourself, seriously, do you even read what the fuck you write? Either this is one of good bait or you're seriously a huge faggot with a tiny dick and big testicles that smell like sweat you little basement dwrlling trans crossdressing mental disease</br></br></br></br>  <br>Being old isn't an illness.<br>Being old and desperately wanting to be young?<br>But arguing about psychological illness is pointless anyway, since we do not definite way of classification.<br>  inb4 some arbitrary scale some clever professor made up  <br><br><br>So you're telling me having a sex change with hormones and all is a cheap procedure? <br><br><br>Yeah, and 40 years ago, they would've had to suck it up and stick it out. <br>It's nice that people can do that now, but is it really the best course of action? <br><br>I'm kind of interested what you would think of transgender people having their brains readjusted instead of having a sex change.<br>Would that be ok?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Don't take up insult comedy. You're painfully unfunny.</br></br>  <br><br>Correct.<br>Its trying to conform reality to their delusion via extreme surgery.<br><br>The point I was making of course is that just because a doctor performs a procedure doesnt mean its automatically appropriate, safe or sensible.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yes, modern medicine literally says it's the best course of action.<br><br>And everyone wants to be young. It's not a disease.<br><br>Why would they change the brain when the body is wrong?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>We are talking about treatments, not cosmetic surgery.</br></br>  <br>You don't change at all during transition anon. Youre the exact same person as before. All youre changing is your appearance and presentation, so that you better fit the stereotypes of what someone of your gender looks like.<br><br>People always confuse that shit and part of the reason is the word transition. You aren't changing things you are reverting them to what they should have been prior to going through puberty. A male to female was never a male in their life. They were always a female who's been forced to pretend to be a male because of their medical problem where their brain developed as female and then got a different hormone wash and developed a male body. Exactly how is unknown but that is the current belief in the medical field. Its a brain development intersex order.</br></br></br>  <br><br>That depends on your perspective I suppose.<br><br>I dont really see a difference between someone wanting a bifurcated tongue or a bifurcated penis.<br><br>But I think you have accepted my point that you cant just say a procedure is valid because its done by a doctor.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>No, it doesn't depend on perspective. It's like you think science and medicine are just feelings.<br><br>Your point is that you missed mine. Sure I accept that.</br></br></br></br>   b8 thread <br>Everyone gtfo before it multiplies.</br>  <br><br>Wait, do you really think all they do for trans people is cut their penis in half?</br></br>  <br><br> But arguing about psychological illness is pointless anyway, since we do not definite way of classification. <br> &gt; inb4 some arbitrary scale some clever professor made up  <br> some arbitrary scale <br> some professor <br>listen to guy<br>he is clearly expert<br> inb4 has no clue how science works </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You are not very good at this anon.</br></br>  <br>Typically nobody gets srs because its $30,000 and a huge ordeal and not covered by anything at all and you pay it in cash. It's real major surgery. But spiro and estrogen are cheap as fuck. They are typically tier 1 meds on insurance and cost $0-10. They have a total out of pocket of like $32 for both even if you did have to pay for them. The hard part is finding an endo and getting to one who could be 4 hours or more away and be so filled with appointments that it could be half a year before they can see you.

Maybe there might be a possibility to correct during fetal development but even that would be complicated. Its easier just to fix with hrt prior to puberty, since puberty will fuck up a person's skeletal structure and that's the main obvious reason between boy's and girl's hormonal development. Nobody helps little kids though. Its at the point where a lot of trans people are transitioning in their 20s because thats the first chance they have where they can legit support themselves because they most likely will be completely abandoned by their family. The majority of the damage is already done by the end of puberty though.

It wasn't meant to be a full feature os, many changes since it was released</br></br>  So you installed beta win10 and are upset that it works like a beta OS would? I'm surprised you even know how to install a new OS to be honest.  no regrets. best operating system out there. OP is just one of those oldfags that can't let go of the past because he says windows 7.  I'll be sticking with win7 on my desktop until there's support for rainmeter and confirmation that my vidya work  <br>You're a retard that can't catch up with the time.</br>  <br>Didn't work out like OP expected he figured everyone would hop on the bash windows train</br>  Installed Windows 10 a month or two ago. It's as broken as fuck. GTA V Performance split in half and if the game is ran in Fullscreen mode it crashes. Other games as well were broken. If that is fixed, then I will really enjoy Windows 10 on the 29th.  <br>RTM not techincal preview.<br><br><br>deal with it<br><br><br>I'm sorry but I would like the option when to download and install shit like every other version of windows prior 10. It's my bandwidth I'm paying for it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was thinking of "upgrading".<br>Why does it suck?</br></br>  <br>What are you on about? Who forced you to install it? I still have Windows 7 on my old PC. It's not mandatory and if you got it through update, then you're just retarded enough not to realize you're installing a whole new OS.</br>  <br>because it's full of botnet and is still unfinished piece of garbage.</br>  <br><br>No. The Windows Updates in Windows 10 are set to download and install automatically and you can't stop it.</br></br>  <br>This. Windows 10 is hands down the best Microsoft OS yet since XP. Incredible memory and cpu efficiency.</br>  <br>try fixing it with your graphics control panel</br>  <br> being this retarded <br>You literally have to reserve your upgrade by MANUALLY clicking the RESERVE windows 10 icon on system tray and signing up.<br><br>Try harder faggot.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Moron</br>  <br>So what? Will it infect your PC with viruses or something? What is so bad about some updates that you want to choose what not to install? You people will bitch about anything. If you don't like it, go back to whatever OS you were using before and gtfo. But Windows 10 is by far the best Windows OS I've used.</br>  <br>What a response</br>  <br><br>source?</br></br>  <br>It wasn't mandatory shitlord</br>  <br>and windows has a history of updates that always work and never fuck up.<br><br>Also some of us are on cap internet plans. I don't want to be at 90% usage just to start to download a gig or more of updates to make my internet go over making it slow down to a crawl.</br></br></br>  <br>i don't like paying for windows, i might pay for Mac OS X, though that sucks balls too, just not as hard as microsoft.<br>however, how does one go about pirating windows 10, i don't give a shit about their updates.</br></br>  Kek mandatory. It's annoying to a point, but you aren't required to reserve the download or download it at all  Um I thought you had to have legit versions of 7 to even get the notice to upgrade. <br><br>Itt: fags who pay money for an os</br></br>  <br>Official release date is 7 days from now. Fuck. Off with your bait.</br>  <br><br> &gt;I'm going back to windows 7 where everything was fine the way it was. <br><br>OMFG Lol</br></br></br></br>  OP here<br><br>When I said manadory updates I'm not talking about the free upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 10.<br><br>I'm talking once you install windows 10, the windows updates for windows 10 are mandatory and you cannot choose to download or prevent the installation updates.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait till it's on a tracker and torrent it?

You can't know if they'll be broken before you install them anyways. If mandatory constant updates are the biggest issue with Win 10, then it's an amazing OS.<br><br>Also, who installs a new OS without checking its features first? It was known for quite some time that the updates will be mandatory. So why did you get it in the first place? <br><br>And who has cap on their Internet plans nowadays?

Just yesterday there was a mandatory update. Alright no sweat had it before no biggie.<br><br>Reboot and enter the win7 partition. Black screen after win7 bootloader animation (no idea what it's actual name is. too lazy to care). Well shit now win 7 is fucked. Force power it off, reboot, use last best known setup which was incidentally 30 minutes before the forced update (was that emergency security patch), update again, reboot, all is well.<br><br>I'll be going onto win 10 soon, but im going to be a faggot and wait for a cracked version. I already enjoyed the preview builds and see no reason that it'll be fucked on release. They learned their lesson on the last minute changes with win8.<br><br>And on a side note, did anyone try the win8 preview? If so did you like it in the preview but dislike it on release? I'm not sure what it was but somehow they fucked it once it went retail.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the only issue I can see, is if its an actual Mac. Im not sure how the install will handle that with activation via OEM certificates. Or possibly BIOS and SLIC problem. <br>Keep in mind, Im not running Lion on a Mac...I installed it on a plain, homemade, PC made from spare parts I had laying around.<br>Its worth a try though.</br></br></br>  <br>A month or two ago you installed a 8 month old preview build.<br><br>It was buggy. Big surprise.</br></br></br>  <br>i've successfully installed pirated win 7 on my mac before, but lost it when a mac genius's only solution to the weird glitches my mac had was "reinstall everything" i just need to get my hands on a serial again.<br>damn i hate this part</br></br>  <br>Good thing there are viable third-party options these days.<br><br>I've been using WPS as my office suite, and I know there are local alternatives to adobe cloud products as well.</br></br></br>    I always think of this guy every time a new flashier version of windows appears. Because we really need every single fucking thing on the screen animated, but they can't figure out that when a program (or app for you kids out there) calls up a file select menu, put the fucking focus on the scroll bar/directory listing.  <br>Just fyi for any college students...MS used to allow a free download of Win Server. I obtained Server2008 and 2008 R2 for free this way. These are stripped down and based off current consumer Win versions. IE, 2008 is basically Vista, 2008R2 is Win7. Configuring to a standard Win/workstation is usually relatively easy. If you want a legit, free, Win10, and are a student, wait for Server 2016.</br>  <br> cathedral and the bazaar  <br> everything is a copypasta of something else why not see what is copyleft <br> install gentoo <br>I would rather use gnewsense as my OS over MS</br></br></br></br>  <br>I never had a problem with a Windows Update since Windows 95, neither do I personally know anyone who had a problem with them. There are reports every now and then that an update fucked things up for some people, but they must have really esoteric hardware.</br>  <br>not a student for the moment, and probably wont be for a while. Cracked is my easiest option, but I just have to wait.</br>  I'm running 7 Ultimate. They want to give me "Home Premium." 10. What the hell....  <br>Literal botnet updates.</br>  <br>I do break fix and IT, we regularly have computers that get corrupted from updates or that can't install updates for whatever reason and need to be re imaged</br>  <br>Only ever had Windows legit because it came with laptop. Never bought a boxed copy.</br>  <br>I still have a couple bugs to work out in my hackintosh. Took me a week to finally get all 3 installed and booting/running properly. For instance, the Apple store doesnt want to let me in/create an account. :/<br><br><br>The only Adobe I use is Lightroom. Because of their shitty new cloud bullshit, Im exploring Darktable as a free, replacement, option. Its for Linux and looks pretty damn good. Hence my triple boot test rig I mentioned earlier</br></br></br></br>  <br>they're angry you didn't buy 8<br>and also they're evil dude</br></br>  <br>Huh, it's almost like you could turn it off if you wanted.</br>  <br>P2P updates, not botnet faggot. Botnet is controlled by a c&amp;c server</br>  <br> create an account <br>just hop on someone else's mac and create it there, if you wanna create one without a credit card i suggest the mac computer's app store program</br></br>  on windows 10 since a few weeks<br><br>would never go back to 7 ^^</br></br>  <br>Ok, Mr. Robot.</br>  <br>problem is it supports only up to 4gb of ram</br>  <br>BTW isn't there an update i have to get rid of? last time i had win 7 on my mac, the wallpaper disappeared after one of their updates... replaced with "please buy our shitty OS"</br>  <br> Never bought a boxed copy. <br>ive gotten an in box windows vista ultimate 32 and 64 bit for free. am i mad? no because it was free shit. got free boxed office 2003 as well (whatever was the highest version. been a while since i used it).<br><br>Furthermore, i used vista ultimate for 4 years and never once had a driver issue or anything past it. i swear the problems with vista were only on the home premium versions or professional versions. really im curious why so many people had shit experiences with vista</br></br></br></br>  <br>ERROR ERROR<br>fuck off</br></br>  <br>Ok then...like I mentioned earlier...torrent an OEM Win7 thats been custom put together with every manufacturer certificate. <br>Mine lets me choose to install any version of 7, Home, Premium, etc. Been installing it for almost 2 years now and never had a box go down due to authentication. Then enroll for free Win10. Spend no money, easy, profit. :)<br><br>Just make sure your BIOS has a SLiC 2.1 table. Most do nowadays.</br></br></br></br>  <br>7 ult upgrades to 10 pro.<br>2/3s down the page.<br>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/win<wbr>dows/windows-10-specifications</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>this means you cant legally use a computer effectively. And yes they are making you pay for the updates. They will give CONSUMERS free updates but you cant disable updates. This is so businesses can pay microsoft NOT to update so their point of sales or whatever other proprietary software still works on windows and will not get any of the new bugs not yet found in the upgrade. Either way you pay with either freedom or a blank check but you are at the mercy of tiered pricing plans or subjugated with monthly subscriptions. This is already in effect in a way with mobile phones where some apps stop working when the phone company auto updates.</br>  <br> Lightroom <br>pretty sure they cracked the CC 2014 verions, the 2015 one is sure to follow no?</br></br>  <br>not sure why youre telling me this when ill probably just torrent a cracked 10 anyway. dont feel like installing win7 again just for the win 10 shit. ill install 10 when i feel like it. or hell if theres an OEM win10 go with it</br>  My pizza....rate  <br><br>WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT? holy fuck that must be disgusting</br></br>   not enough meat <br> no chillis <br><br>looks pretty inventive though anon if that's what you had in. give it a crack of black pepper and 6/10 would eat</br></br></br>  <br>beaner/10</br>  Sauce ?  should have gone with something else than corn.  <br> corn <br>I'll never understand some people.</br></br>  Strawberry jam on dough with onions, corn, sliced up pink erasers, and ripped up bits of styrofoam cups.<br><br>2/10 needs more sriracha</br></br>  <br>Its hobo pizza.</br>  <br>All those fucking onions.

The energy value is there, you know it, and it's not difficult to find out the energy required to do specific exercises.<br><br>I once lost weight eating nothing but McDonalds.

Insulin is a hormone that has many functions, one of which is to cause your body to slow fat metabolism. Therefore if you constantly eat carbs you will have a harder time burning fat and while you may "lose weight" you won't look much better unless you work out way more than you need to.</br>  corn/10  <br>Looks delicious. I love burned pizza; I'm sure that sounds ironic, but seriously. So good.</br>  <br><br><br>Who honestly gives a fuck? Unless you personally invented the pizza, I could not possibly care less.</br></br></br>  <br><br>That's how I like my shit a little over cooked</br></br>  <br>Ha, in ye face! Type 1 diabetic here so my insulin production doesn't spike at all</br>  <br>you disgust me. greetings from a half italian.<br>0/1</br></br>  <br>I actually did.

It's good.<br><br>Here in Japan, every pizza place from which I've ordered has not only had corn as a common topping, they've always also had a pizza that is basically just corn and mayo.</br></br>  murrica/10  <br>How about you finish cooking it you fuck</br>  <br>Not enough cheese on your pizza</br>  <br>that's fuckin mad rank dude</br>  <br>BR?

Potato fuckin' salad. I really don't care for that since it's just carbs on carbs... Too much.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Thats not Pizza, thats some sort of Americunt abomination by someone who once saw a real Italian pizza from across the room for 5 seconds then tried to recreate it.</br>  <br>Not digging the corn but the rest looks good.
