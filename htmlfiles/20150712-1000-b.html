Girl was a slut and kept being a cunt to everyone, hit guy with shoe... guy showed her what the patriarchy is made of. Female entitlement fail and comedy gold!</br>    <br>this is why 136,000 american soliders died in the iraq war, while only 22,000 died in both korean conflicts combined. simply because korea was before they allowed women in the military services</br>    <br>sauce plz</br>  <br> "Lol I'm so edgy hitting this guy with my high heels" <br> gets hit back <br> "omg why would he do that" </br></br></br>    <br>she bent the bar,</br>  <br>and she bent the bar, this is a wrecked girls thread, not wrecked bar thread</br>  <br>Its a game show. The objective is to keep your hand on the car the longest, whoever does get the car. As you can tell, some women went in bikinis to try to distract the men. So she was being a bitch and annoying everyone, so the dude next to her got pissed took his hands off and downed her. I think he got DQ'd for it, but I'd have to find the source to make sure.</br>    <br>Fking whitening</br>  <br>Totally not expecting that</br>  <br>seen the gif 28,000 times, never bothered to notice that<br><br>thanks, it makes it funnier - now i'll post about on funnyjunk</br></br></br>  <br>she's cute. would fuck</br>  <br><br>It's what happens in Russia when you try to act like a typical spoiled American trash<br><br>In America, she'd had a bunch of shirtless douchebags fist pumping and running to her rescue and the betas of the internet would be on Reddit talking about how much of an asshole he was.<br><br>There's not many spoiled little cunts in Russia because they're all treated like that and they learn their shit quick.<br><br>Based Russia</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Girlfag here. Women are usually good sailors and pilots, but soldiers...not so much. If women want to be in the military, let them, just don't put them together with men. It's a distraction. Let them do what they're good at, flying, sailing, paperwork ect. Fuck feminists, we're not 100% equal to men. End of story.</br>    <br>If I remember correctly, this happened in Brazil, and the woman survived. I just read about this last week, after reconstructive surgery she looks completely different.</br>  <br>I like the way u think.. wanna share her</br>  <br>i want to drink that cuties pee</br>  <br>people were hiking<br>then a person fell into water<br>the end</br></br></br>  <br>Women aren't good at anything.<br><br>The only purpose women serve is to birth children which is unfortunate because they make god awful single mothers.</br></br></br>  <br>That or the fact that population increases leading to an increase in military personnel which leads to a higher average death total. Doesn't help that weapons have also advanced to be better at killing than what they were at the time with Korea.</br>  <br>I feel satisfied watching this</br>  <br>alpha as fuck</br>  <br><br>You're a girl so you must know what every other girl is good at. Any other male couldn't have possibly said that? It was also necessary to proclaim you're a girl?</br></br>  <br>i would hope she would look different than what i'm seeing there</br>  <br> Women are usually good sailors and pilots <br> pilots </br></br>  <br>did he died?</br>  <br>You mad that you could never fuck me? :)</br>      <br>That's physically painful to watch</br>  2015<br>The summer of memes<br>:^)<br>Kappa</br></br></br>  <br>topkek</br>  <br>justic</br>  <br>Quit being a basement dweller faggio</br>  <br>No, I can't vouch for every other girl. I'm sure there are some great women soldiers, but overall they're not. I for one would probably blow my own foot off. I'm good at drawing, but that's not going to get me anywhere where I live.</br>  <br><br>dayum rape porn so hard to find</br></br>  <br>you could have made that entire statement without mentioning that you're a girl, and it would be just as valid as it is now, whore</br>      <br>Rape?</br>  <br>Burn the coal pay the toll.</br>  <br>She found out she has prostate cancer a few days later. Sucks, you can be fit and still get cancer.</br>    <br>act like a cunt get treated like a cunt</br>  <br>Heh, I'd like to punch you in the face. No offence.</br>  <br><br>Samefag</br></br>  <br>HA! shit caught me off guard xD</br>  <br>Equality at its best no special treatment for anybody</br>  <br>i love the way she vomits all that cum</br>  <br>Coalburner</br>  <br>Millions died in WW 2 - the reduction in deaths between WW 2 and Korea was due to massive advances in medical procedures and medicines.<br><br>These were even more advanced by the time of the iraq war - yet the figures show how many died just to satisfy a few feministic ideas about 'equal rights'.<br><br>Note also that while taking proportions into account, three times as many men died in iraq as women - most were whiteknighting as was seen in this video.<br>One woman who was saved by two other men, who died by the way, was slightly injured and ended up with a limp, being sent home safely. She then sued the families of the two men for 'undue care and attention for fellow personel on duty'.<br><br>You should read more about the fucked up shit that you are defending.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rapey-papey, mate :D</br>  <br>agreed</br>  <br>beautiful</br>  <br>Total butter face em i right fellas</br>  <br>One question<br><br> how </br></br></br>  <br>This was actually not as bad as i thought it was going to be.</br>  <br>its that a fucking dead dog?</br>  <br>Of course it would.

John Snow the news reader on the BBC read these figures out, as have all the news channels in the US - where did you hear that figure - one year into the war?<br><br>I've been in the service for over 20 years. I joined just after the beginning had started - and I've personally seen over 1,000 deaths - so I find it hard to believe that in all the other places combined there have only been 6,000.<br>12,000 alone died in the bombing of baghdad, when the bombing patterns were mixed up and we dropped our loads on our north western encampments.</br></br></br></br>  <br>wtf are they talking about <br><br> dat slap </br></br></br>  <br>tl;dr</br>    <br>No, it's a man and a woman</br>    about to be rekt    <br>Holy shit dude please give us details</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Fucking summer.<br><br>The only valid response to that "girl" is: <br><br> TITS or GTFO! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Super strange boner</br>  <br>russian women is quite bitchy too.
