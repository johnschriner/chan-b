I'm not familiar with that?</br></br></br>  <br><br>People who dislike Stannis for burning his daughter are immature fucks.<br><br>He knew what had to be done, he realized his own sorrows, sense of ethics, and love for his daughter were not as important as peace and uniting the nation. He sacrificed something he cared dearly for to achieve nobler aim; something dipshit idealistic fuckheads can't conceive of.<br><br>Yeah. He's a bastard. But that's the point; leaders don't have the convenience and leniency in their lives to adhere to warm fuzzies and personal satisfaction... they gotta make the hard calls. They have to be willing to sacrifice, even at great personal cost.<br><br>I applauded when Stannis burned stoneface at the stake. He was mature enough to recognize what had to be done to achieve his goal, and despite his tremendous pain and loss at such an act, was willing to do it.<br><br>Fuck people who 'feel otherwise' because of itchy morals and lack of decision making capabilities.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this, and tyrion is the half brother of dany</br>    as long as jon snow lives and we see sansa tits, who gives a fuck about the king?  <br>There's precedent in history where a man has taken a women's name in order to continue the family line<br><br> no citation needed, I am his descendent <br><br>Ironic fact of the day: he only fathered daughters and had to marry them off, losing the land and the titles.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it was a retarded thing to do. Let's ignore for a fact that it's morally not great to burn your only daughter.<br>Him beating the boltons wouldn't have made a difference, real control is not over there.<br>Plus he just burned his heir, ending the baratheon lineage...</br></br></br>  <br>hello moribund</br>  <br>jet fuel can't melt steel beams</br>  Ask a bloke who's Guinea Pig just died anything  <br> precedent in history <br>It's a book in a world where your "precedent" means nothing...</br></br>  <br> He was mature enough to recognize <br>he was stupid enough to not see his men run away...</br></br>  <br>at the same time, though, you have to think about what your followers are thinking. Enemies of Stannis will forever use the fact he is a kinslayer (the ABSOLUTE WORST SIN ONE CAN COMMIT IN WESTEROS) against him, and a lot of his men won't like what he did.<br><br>Look at what happened to Jon Snow when he didn't take his own men's feelings into account.</br></br></br>  Daemon Sand for KING!  <br>This. <br><br>Hard truths cut both ways.</br></br></br>  <br>and it did him no good, in fact it seemed to lead to greater disaster <br><br>at least he got to be beaten on a sunny day</br></br></br>  <br>Why did it die?</br>  <br> your face when </br>  <br>what veg are you gonna have with it?</br>  <br>In a world which takes heavy influence from real life events, Martin even says this himself.</br>  AEGON THE TRUE KING  <br>his sacrificing her will give Mel power to rez Jon<br><br>"one life for another" and all that shit<br><br>lrn2redmagic</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Baratheon - shit load of bastards, which can be legitimized like Ramses Bolton. <br><br>stark - bran and rickon still alive, more than likely rickon is best hope.

His failure to achieve total victory isn't the point. The point is that his character made the right call in being willing to sacrifice a single life for the nobler aims and needs of the nation.<br><br><br><br>Sure. But he was in a rock and hard place, needing the snows to melt to have a military hope and proceed on his campaign. He had no other options, and he's not a brilliant politician, obviously. The character's sacrifice and willingness to offer up his own child for the cause was a noble pursuit. His failures surrounding that decision aren't relevant to the decision and the nobility, maturity, and rightness of that decision.<br><br><br>Yup.<br><br><br><br>It did him plenty of good; the snows melted. Unfortunately, he failed elsewhere in his logistics and expectations of his men. This does not tarnish the glory of his sacrifice and the brilliance with which Stannis the Mannis shone in that glorious hour to the screaming sillhouette of his own daughter.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Only Baratheon and Arryn are dead/at the brink of extinction<br><br> Lannister <br>Kevan is alive in series, dead in the books,<br>Still many more cousins are alive<br><br> Stark <br>Sansa, Arya, Bran and Rickon are alive<br><br> Greyjoy <br>Asha, Euron, Victarion and Aeron are alive and kicking<br><br> Tyrell <br>Willas Tyrell, the heir to Highgarden is still going strong</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nobody saw Neds head rolling</br>  <br>burn your family alive in the name of the Red God and he will live</br>  <br>Ramsay<br>Jaime<br>Eyrie<br><br>Splitting hairs on spelling doesn't make it false</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Sure, he lost in the end, but that's not relevant to the decision to burn his daughter at the stake for the greater good.

He has the best claim to the throne and will be supported by Howland Reed. He "died", but will warg into his wolf for awhile while his body is preserved in ice. He'll later return to his body, likely resurrected by Melly. After he returns to his body he's freed from his vows to the Night's Watch, because he died.

Varys suddenly shoots Kevan in the chest with a crossbow, and the wounded Kevan notices that Pycelle has already been slain. Varys explains he bears Kevan no ill will, but he cannot allow Kevan to undo Cersei's misrule. With his death by crossbow, Cersei will believe that Kevan was murdered by Tyrion Lannister or House Tyrell. The Tyrells, in turn, will suspect Cersei herself, undermining the alliances shoring up Tommen's hold on the Iron Throne. This would open the way for Prince Aegon to take the throne. Varys then commands his "little birds" to finish Kevan off.<br><br>Taken from ASOIF wiki<br><br><br>I hope so, the Greyjoys seems interesting<br>And Littlefinger might, seeing as removing the last competent Lannister will work in his advantage as he thrives on chaos</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Terrible.</br>  <br> implying a snow can't be legitimized </br>  <br>Pretty bummed they elimated that whole plot line.<br><br>The whole thing was so subtle yet totally badass.

So it's darn good, but there are still SOME games I prefer over this one. Although it gets extra point for making have feels about the Bloody Barons aborted child quest.... that was sad/ bordering on almost wrong</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>your mother</br>  <br>No I actually hate the developers and I hope they all die from aids, but really the idea and feel to the game is like no other. I was playing it earlier with my fully geared character which I am attached to now and I'm really scared to lose it, and some guy comes flying past me in a v3s truck. My heart was pumping like a thousand suns as he drives past. No other game gives you an adrenaline rush like DayZ, because in every other game there is nothing to lose.<br>Knowing that you can lose all your hard earned time in a click of a button is what I love about DayZ, not because the devs are slow as fuck and don't really know how to make a game, but the fact that I love having the power over my options and choices and how they will actually affect me mentally.</br></br>  <br>This. It was an amazing game nonetheless.

Witcher 3 is an amazing game. The only people I see hating it love games like Dark Souls- which is the most basic plot, and quick paced games like bloodborne. Only other game worth comparing to in the RPG genre is Skyrim and even then you can't compare because it is so freaking different (although I liked the Witcher games more than all Elder Scrolls for many reasons).  <br>Play a real game you fucking faggot</br>  It's looks like I win  Snek  <br>Barbie's Beach Bonanza</br>  <br>winrar</br>  Monster Hunter, all of them.  <br>Ark, survival evolved aka survival of the 10yo can't play solo fanbase.</br>  <br>They removed persistence in .57, so none of your shit stays.<br><br>Game is pointless without it.</br></br></br>  <br>jak 3 fuck yeah</br>  <br>fuck</br>  <br>tetris</br>  Am i the only one who thinks Destiny is a great game. Will be way better when the next expansion comes out in sept. too. Heres some tits  Rayman  XCOM EW  <br>have fun buying a 80$ xpac that comes with the base game and season pass</br>  <br><br>  woah buddy gunna have to stop you. <br><br>lol, it's not stopping me if i'm on a message board and i've posted my full current thought.<br><br>as for your perspective on the rankings, that's your rankings. I loved oblivion, but i think so far the witcher 3 is going to edge it out. (I'm not done playing not by a long shot and I love it so far.)<br><br>The key difference I find is the emotionality at times with the main quests. And hooking you in. Like for example my wife, she didn't care to watch skyrim (we weren't together when i played oblivion back in college) There is alot of open world more simple quests/ dialogue where someone says, run into that cave for an hour kill things in the dark, and bring back this shiny thing in there. And although it sounds like i didn't love it, i did. It's a VERY immersible world. <br><br>Witcher 3 seems to have a better way of hooking you into quests from an emotional caring level, especially main quests. My wife has barred me from playing main quests unless she is watching. But even some of the secondary quests are nicely told, but not many so far. They remind me alot of the generic skyrim side quests. <br><br>It helps to have a talking main character with cut scenes to help with other people watching caring about what's happening.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This</br>  <br> bungie promised free-roaming and free DLC's <br> activision takes over and it turns into COD-clone <br>fuck you nigger destiny was a shit</br></br></br>  <br>ESO blows. Kinda like you, faggot</br>  <br>the developers havent even updated their nvidia drivers</br>  Faggotry aside, Grand theft Auto : San Andreas is clearly the only correct answer here. It was so god damn fucking good that it took GTA V like 24hours to reach a billion fucking dollars.

Of course a movie from last year is going to suck. </br></br></br>  It's almost impossible to suggest scary horror due to everyone having different things that scare them. <br><br>GOOD horror movies however:<br>The Thing<br>Hellraiser<br>Halloween 1+2<br>Texas chainsaw massacre<br>Evil Dead (3 isn't really a horror though)<br>Cabin in the woods<br>Alien/Aliens<br>The Shining<br>28 Days later<br><br>The Thing is definitely my favourite, I even didn't mind the 2011 prequel, the CGI isn't great but if you can overlook it, it's a good mindless popcorn movie.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  The exorcist creeper me out...  The Twin Peaks movie. Nightmare fuel.  <br>event horizon is will make grown men cry<br> also i hear the appointment is twisted and scary </br></br>  <br>The Exorcism of Emily Rose make me really mad</br>  <br><br>Loads of films as a kid will scare you, Mars Attacks! made me hide behind the sofa, but OP wants stuff to scare him now.</br></br>  <br>Who are you quoting, kid?</br>  <br>i thout it was but my gf didnt :\</br>  <br>It follows was actually shit.... That movie was fucking terrible man. I regret spending my time watching it.</br>  <br>how bait?<br>I ranted only cuz gotta poop brb<br>was creepy, it was always sounds, signs of some paranormal shit like the rocks and symbols etc. much how your imagination does all the work when you read a book.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Decent list of horrors though none are in the scary category except maybe 28 days and even then thats only the start. Still a good list though.</br></br>  <br> Hostel <br>are you serious? Every rekt thread here is more 'scary'.</br></br>  Begotten  <br>it had 1 jumpscare<br>the atmosphere created was the creepiest in a long time</br></br>  <br>way to name 70% slasher films, 2 sci fi's. a zombie movie and 1 horror. clap clap for te handicap.</br>  <br>The third one is hilarious.</br>  <br>agreed.</br>  <br>Event horizon sounds really cool. Thanks. I'm gonna check it out</br>  <br><br>It's the only film to this day that still scares me, but it gets a bad response on /b/ because obviously /b/ is all just hipsters against popular society.</br></br>  <br><br/></br>  why do you whites suck japans dick when it comes to everything? get a life  Close encounters of the third kind  <br>it had many jump scares dude. and it had literally 0 atmosphere.</br>  <br><br>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH<wbr>AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA<wbr>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH<wbr>AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA<wbr>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH<wbr>AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA<wbr>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH<wbr>AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA<wbr>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA<br><br>Good keks anon</br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br><br> 18+ </br></br>  <br>yeh not only that they all die.<br><br>basically convinced me that camping DEEP DEEP into woods is a horrible idea haha will never do</br></br></br>  i smoked some pot and watched oculus, it was physiologically scary, could barley finish it  Antichrist ... not really scarey but horrific  <br><br>kek</br></br>  <br> that forced laugh </br>  <br>OPs birth tape. Scared the shit out of me.</br>  <br>This is so insane, the exorcism of emily rose<br><br>/watch?v=lSy7DldFdUI</br></br></br>  <br><br>Well I think dark souls was the best game ever.<br><br>BEST GAME EVER<br><br>Fuck off.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't creep out to horror movies, it just doesn't happen. Horror games on the other hand can freak me right out if they are done well. Dudes right, go for the games instead bro.</br>  <br>not very scary but GREAT movie. spoiler: aliens communicate with humans via keyboard(piano)</br>  <br><br>This is what I mean by it being hard to suggest scary horrors, 28 days later wasn't scary in the slightest for me. Still a great movie however.</br></br>  <br>popular society has always deemed it shit wtf are you talking about.</br>  I might suggest "I saw the devil" but I'm not sure it fits the horror category...  <br>shit yeah</br>  <br><br>What are you on (pot as you said), that was such a badly written, incoherent shit turd of a film. Really annoyed i wasted a second on it.<br><br>"Oh there's that omnipotent mirror that literally controls our minds and the world, let's go try and break it. Oh wait we can't because it is literally god and we knew this so lets all just die".</br></br></br></br>  <br>k</br>  <br> literally 0 atmosphere <br><br>it's best to comment on things when you've actually seen the subject</br></br></br>  The Wicker Man<br><br>Original, not the Nic Cage comedy.</br></br>  <br>nah. thriller action/badass also a great movie</br>  <br><br>I'd agree with this too. It's much easier to be scared by games since you're not so detached from the events on screen.</br></br>  it cant be like this!!!!  <br>Quads checked</br>  <br><br>Blair Witch? The reviews were pretty great on release and it grossed like a motherfucker. I reckon if you surveyed everyone on their scariest film it would probably take first place.<br><br>Not saying you have to like it remotely, but it is popular.</br></br></br></br>  The Grifter is the scariest movie. I couldn't watch more than 20 minutes of it because it was fucking up my shit so bad.  <br><br>I saw it, can confirm 0 pascals.</br></br>  Suspiria is fucking beautiful and made me uneasy.  <br>ya the present day shit was pretty garbage but the past parts were what i paid attention too, like when the father chained up the mother and made her starve in the bedroom, you have to admit that made you at least cringe</br>  <br><br>whatever nothing is as scary as DARK SOULS<br><br>its the best movie and game in like 20 years</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah that meme was already posted kidd :^)<br><br>Nice try though kiddo :^)</br></br></br>  <br>shit was intense as fuck though</br>  <br>I wish I was joking. But that scene where goes to the bathroom and the woman is in the kitchen really freaked me out. And the cupboard ghost scene oh god</br>  <br>Weeb</br>  <br> cabin in the woods <br>I want this meme to stop.<br><br>not quite a horror fan but I liked Wolf Creek and Jacob's Ladder (if you can count this one as horror movie)</br></br></br></br>  <br>no you didn't</br>  <br><br>Eh, by that stage I was just too far gone down the annoyance path that their plan literally made no sense from the get go that if there was anything good in there I wouldn't have been able to notice</br></br>  <br>I liked dark souls but it isn't as amazing as you weebs make it out to be.</br>  the Wicker Man  <br>lmao <br><br>summer so hard<br><br>you dumb nigga gtfo <br><br>go outside kids and play<br><br>it warm lil nigga</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this</br>  <br><br>cupboard ghost?<br><br>Scariest part of the film is when the 3D space water flies towards the camera but you only have a 2D screen so it makes you sad.<br><br>The film was good but not really scary at all.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>cabin in the woods had a somewhat OK premise but it got WAY up into its own ass about trying to make "deep" statements about the horror genre. It was like it was tailored to the tastes of faggots on the internet.</br>  <br><br>Want to question me on it? Did see it, papillion, magic fire cars sucking people into the ground with kekkles feet sticking out blah blah blah. Shit tier.</br></br>  <br> sinister <br> dead silence <br><br>they are both pretty good movies <br>dead silence has a great finish and has kinda more action to it.<br><br>sinister is awesome all the way, but they kinda fucked the end up.<br>you´ll like them</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br> meme <br>The only "meme" I want to stop is dumbfucks referring to anything they don't like as a meme</br></br></br>  <br>i was about to compliment your taste in movies until the second line. That is blasphemy nigger, the nicholas cage one owns.</br>  <br>Zombie movies ain't scary m88<br>What's scary about mindless dumbfucks that are so easy to kill? Every redneck village in the US would stop them.</br></br>  <br><br>  But muh left 4 dead monsters <br><br>Still I loved it</br></br></br></br>  anyone ever have a threesome?
