Being older than 15 makes fucking with people who are trying to make money not fun. Fuck off child.  Fuck off OP  I just called them and told them what eas going on. Gave the guy the link to this thread. Hopefully he follows thru with what he said he was going to do OP.    <br>bump. this was hilarious last time. tell brian you love him</br>  Post your 10/10 celebrities.

Thinking about using a nasa wallpaper    <br>How did that happen?</br>  dreamscope the same image over.<br><br>If you start with the base image and dream scope twice do you get the same results?<br><br>What happens when you dreamscope a dreamscope?<br><br>Use pic related.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Think saved trippy and added art deco saved then some more filters</br>  <br>You don't get the same results each time but they're similar. Kinda like the patterns in a pancake would be similar yet unpredictable. <br>If you dream scope a dreamscope image then you get a more developed image.

PRESS THE ASSAULT</br>  Man Faces 6 Months in Jail For Disagreeing With Feminists on Twitter <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=xfK<wbr>P_cEBt1U</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Why are women so stupid and childish /b/?</br></br></br></br>  one of the comments on jewtube<br><br>The fact this man ever faced charges in the first place is beyond sad. I've read up on this case, there was NO harassment at all. She didn't like him disagreeing with her, so she made a criminal complaint.<br><br>Now he has lost his job and been barred from using the internet for several years while this case plays out. Even if he is vindicated, which I believe he will be, he has already been punished.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Man Faces 6 Months in Jail For Disagreeing With Feminists on Twitter <br><br>That's his lawyer's perspective, I'm sure the prosecutor tells a different story. But you don't care about that, you just want validation of your misogynistic views</br></br></br>  Honestly though who the fuck cares? It's Canada. The home of fucking idiots and french people.  <br>You are one dumb fucking cunt.</br>  <br>Hey, I'm not French</br>  <br> You are one dumb fucking cunt. <br><br>No, you're the fucking gullible cunt, his lawyer claims "there was no harassment just disagreement", guess what, genius, his claim might not be true.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm a chick, but jesus christ these 'feminists' piss me right the fuck off. They really do and I feel terribly sorry for the guy because this whole situation should never have happened. How the fuck is having someone disagree with your view harassment? If someone disagrees with me, then whoop-dee-fucking-do I don't care. I don't scream harassment and try to get them charged for it. And on Twitter of all places. For fuck's sake. It seems all common sense has left the building and if this man is found guilty, then it will open an entire barrage of similar cases where the law will allow these idiotic clueless cunts to try and have anyone who disagrees with them charged with harassment. It will be the only thing to get their panties wet because no one else wants them.</br>  <br>Yea there has to be something else, otherwise crown wouldn't have taken the case</br>  <br>This might be bait, but please inform yourself, he disagreed with a campaign that wanted to shame a dude on the internet. He's literally going to be imprisoned for trying to protect someone.</br>  <br> "I CALLED YOU A NAME NOW YOU ARE WRONG LALALA MISOGINISTIC LALALA RAPIST" <br>Fuck off</br></br>  <br>Mein Gott you guys are stupid, he doesn't get convicted just because this bitch says so, there's a fucking judge and jury. If it's as cut and dry as you say it is, he won't go to jail</br>  <br>quads of truth <br>tits or gtfo</br></br>  God. I hate that I'm really not surprised that this happen and I'm ashamed to be the same gender as people like this. Why can't women stop being so fucking ridiculous? Do they have no common sense?    <br> This might be bait, but please inform yourself, he disagreed with a campaign that wanted to shame a dude on the internet. He's literally going to be imprisoned for trying to protect someone. <br><br>You moron, that might have been his objective, but how do you know how he didn't harass them going about it? For example, vaguely- threatening phonecalls, or the other tactics kooks use to get their way.<br><br>His lawyer and the credulous fools in the thread want you to believe he sent a few tweets saying "I respectfully disagree with your opinion :^)" and then the police came and arrested him for it.<br><br>I say again WHAT HIS LAWYER IS CLAIMING ISN'T NECESSARILY TRUE.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But there's an actual case on this, he might actually go to jail for trying to protect someone from being harassed online, which is ironic, because HE is the one being accussed of harassment. Can't you see how toxic modern feminists are? Yes, he probably won't go to jail, but the sole fact that there's a case about this is downright embarassing.</br>  <br>Your blind faith in the "justice" system is sad.</br>  <br>If you had the power to imprison random internet people and make them lose their jobs for shit and giggles wouldn't you abuse the fuck out of it? I would. Tumblr feminists have created a super power.</br>  <br> fucking canadians </br>  <br>Ta da. Shitty quality but I'm still in my pjs.</br>  <br>this added absolutely no value or substance to this discussion <br><br>all dribble</br></br></br>  <br>I dunno what your yankee justice system is like down in niggerville, but it's pretty solid here in Canada</br>  <br>According to his lawyer, the closest thing to harassment he did was indirectly calling her "fat". <br><br>The irony is priceless, they're accusing someone of harassment, but they were organizing a campaign to massively harass a game developer.</br></br></br>  <br>True. I am curious to reward more about the case though.</br>  sigh. Only thing to to is to go mideviel  <br> At no point did Elliott make any remarks directed at the two that could be construed as sexual harassment, hate speech, or violent rhetoric, according to Toronto Police Detective Jeff Bangild.  <br>So a detective confirmed he's not actually said anything that could be called harassment. This is a frivolous case that will swiftly be dismissed. There's no need for so much excitement.</br></br>  <br>fuck off back to /soc/ you dumb cow</br>  <br> they were organizing a campaign to massively harass a game developer. <br>Now that is an interesting point. I wonder if the organizers of all these 'shaming' campaigns lately will ever face trial for harassment. I doubt it. Even in the 21st century, in the first world, we're really still the same as when we put people in stocks and threw rotten fruit at them.</br></br>  <br>Nice tits, come cam for /b/<br><br> FemanonCams <br> .  <br> com <br><br>It's like tiny chat but better</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  it's on Infowars, so it must be real.. 4 news sites online carry the story... i call bullshit.  <br>Shitty b8, fuck off.</br>  <br>You know the problem with Canada?<br><br>Half of you cunts speak french, and the other half fucking lets them.</br></br></br>  COME CAM FOR B<br><br> femanons <br> dot org <br><br><br>COME CAM FOR B<br><br> femanons <br> dot org <br><br><br>COME CAM FOR B<br><br> femanons <br> dot org <br><br><br>COME CAM FOR B<br><br> femanons <br> dot org </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying canada isn't freer than 'murica. </br>  <br><br>Tragically, it is real.
