You should use regular cooker and you will get better food faster..</br></br></br></br></br>  Got tired of the jungle of greedy jewish sideburns holding fast to any load i bust. So I just shaved my ballsack for the first time.<br>How do people put up with this burn/itch?</br>  <br>it stops after you do it for a couple of times</br>  <br>I hope so, i do like the aerodynamic feel.</br>  First time it's unavoidable. If you shave badly it might come back when you shave in the future.<br><br>Sharp razor, hot water, first with then agonist the grain. If your razor is hot and sharp enough this will be all you need and you won't have to go over areas and make them more irritated. If you have something to clean pores with afterwards is a good time. Rinse with cold water to close the pores and avoid dirt getting in them, dry well and you should avoid spots and stuff.</br></br>  <br>yep it will be annoying for some time but you'll get used to it and feel nothing later</br>  Keep shaving. U will be fine in a few weeks  Veet your balls, brother.  Get an astringent like an alum block or some witch hazel.  Put those on after you shave.  this shit works like a charm OP or anything close to this  Ive been shaving the base, balls, taint, asshole and ass with an electric razor, and Ive came close to nipping my balls and Im wondering if waxing would be better.  I put some lotion on a little bit after making this post, seemed to have helped a bit with the itch and burn. I used an electric razor and then a single blade bic. probably not the best choice...  <br>Elec is bad. A nice good normal razor is better. So long as u shave correctly</br>  <br>this</br>  <br>Yep, i shave my balls since hair started to grow on them and it only was itchy the furst 2 times</br>  <br>always go with the grain, not against it and it won't itch</br>  <br><br>- used an electric razor.<br><br>Now there's your problem. <br><br>Get a 3-blade pack of disposables and do it in the shower with a good lather. Repeat every week.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>fucking faggots, shaving is for girls, enjoy sucking cocks</br>  <br>IcyHot or Bengay gets rid of the itchiness instantly. Use it liberally on the area. Thank me later.</br>  <br>so edgy.<br><br>I mean, you won this thread, bud.</br></br></br>  Which one would you fuck and why ?  WoW is down. My life has lost all meaning.  <br> Wow1 </br>  Shave, shower, brush your teeth, clean your house and trim your fingernails and toenails. Server maintenance is perfect, for that.  <br><br> implying it had a meaning to begin with </br></br>  <br>There are multiple WoW for however many "accounts" I guess you say that you have on there. My WoW1 is my paid time and my WoW2 was a f2p to 20 account account from when I was broke.<br><br><br>I am in military boarding school. Made my bed took out trash, brushed teeth, cried a lot, it doesnt change anything my life no longer has meaning. <br><br><br>WoW time mother fucker</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  what server  <br>Of course your life has no meaning, you're in military boarding school. Why are you in a school that's teaching you to do the bidding of old men in grey suits, sending you out to fight and die for them?</br>  <br>Every server is down, and they will be unill 2:00 or so.</br>  <br>jesus, what fucking server do you play on you loser</br>  <br>I am going to sit on an Aircraft carrier after I leave here and take xrays.

The quest line is pretty fun and so is building your garrison.</br>  <br>Might have to try it out. How's the pvp? Thats all I ever do</br>  <br>no.<br><br><br> 2015 <br> Not playing WoW <br> WoW is F2p as long as you are not shit </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hunter OP</br>  <br> not playing wow </br>  <br> no. <br>I DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU</br></br>  <br>typical</br>  <br> Not a bad expansion <br>jesus christ you're retarded<br>everything after wotlk was shit<br>there's nothing to do in wow, unless you're a fucking casual, every1 who played longer will tell you that</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Not playing Heavensward </br></br>  Mal'Ganis master race checking in  <br>haha u fucking faggot</br>  <br>WoD actually isnt shit<br>Does millions better than its cancerious MoP</br></br>  <br>Gtfo my website you chink faggot. Go eat some rice</br>  Just switched from balanced druid to feral. im a noobie so i didnt really know what was good but holy fuck the difference in dps  <br> Be me <br> Play WoW since Vanilla <br> Money down the shitter for subscription time <br> Probably months of in game play time <br> All worth it </br></br></br></br></br>  The game is good but it isn't difficult, sort of casual, me and my retarded guild completed the hardest content last tier and we're the fucking worst honestly  <br>PvP is the same as it always has been p much. Balance on the whole is actually pretty good this expansion, almost every spec has a viable comp it can run in arena, and of course if you just do casual bgs / wpvp you can do whatever you want. The new PvP zone Ashran isn't as bad as people say, but it's still pretty bad. Sadly there's been no new content added besides Ashran and some world pvp stuff, but if you're into RBGs / arena those are still fun. If you want to play fotm, frost dk aff lock feral rogue and hpal are go to specs</br>  <br>小妹妹，u cant into moon runes my americano buddy?</br>  pvp is pretty boring atm, but it's still playable  <br>The real challenger was fucking Naxxramas in vanilla.</br>  <br>When your days played on 1 character is 4 digits</br>  <br>If you've played WoW since classic and you only have months of playtime, you must not play much. I have been going since day one and I have just under 1150 days played across all characters.</br>  <br><br>I just hit lvl 100 on my first p2w noobie character.<br><br>Im thinking of making a warrior, are they any good?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Killing Blackhand on normal doesn't count.</br>  <br> Implying I'm American <br>I don't need to speak your moonspeak since I don't live in your 3rd world shithole. Get back to the labor camp you yellow monkey.</br></br>  <br>I have taken breaks for several months when content from patches has gotten old or if I got a little tired of WoW. I was on ship deployment when MoP came out and I am not sorry I missed that.</br>  <br> hiding ingame name <br> under 1500 <br>Git gud</br></br></br>  <br> 2015 <br> STILL playing wow <br>AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAH<wbr>AHAHAHAHAH YOU FUCKING FAGGOT<br><br>THATS LIKE RIDING A BIKE FOR TRANSPORTATION AT AGE 30 BECAUSE YOU ARE TOO SCARED TO LEARN ANYTHING MORE DIFFICULT</br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br> hardest  <br><br>implying mythic, autist</br></br></br>  <br>hell.i like you.<br>you can come round to my house and fuck my sister.</br></br>  <br>dat sexy DK</br>  <br> ha ha <br> lv 30 <br>kill yourself</br></br></br>  <br>You play EvE then I take?</br>  <br>go to fucking sleep you faggot</br>  Just got heroic Archimonde down to 9%, anyone else doing progression raiding?<br>My heroic shipyard cache would have just finished too. Fuck. I need a life. Or a boyfriend.</br>  <br>I'm implying you haven't downed him on Mythic. Say what you will about WoW's difficulty on the whole, but raiding now is more difficult than it has been in the game's history.</br>  <br>2400 req for illusion enchant<br>2700~ cr in 3s <br><br>can sell you a boost from that 1500 bracket tho</br></br></br></br>  <br> bait <br><br>but my guild killed heroic arch without me tonight (not scheduled raid day), bunch of faggots, might quit the game srs</br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't have many screenshots of her, just fac changed.</br></br>  <br>的</br>   624929564 <br>Raiding is better than ever, the problem lies in how little there was to do outside of raids during 6.0-6.1.<br><br><br>MoP got a bad rep because of pandas, the ridiculous amount of dailies tied to raid level gear in 5.0, and 14 months of SoO. It was a solid expansion though.<br><br><br>Balance is insanely good on sustained cleave, I mained it in cata and mop and wod changed it to the point I switched, currently raiding on spriest and unholy dk. Auspicious spirits shadow plays close to mop balance did, which is nice.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>play a better game</br>  <br>lmao you must be super casual, it's easier than it was in Vanilla/BC/Wotlk, only slightly more difficult than the other two shit tier expansions</br>  <br>dude i did all pvp achievements till end of cata<br> that feel when i got gladi and hero before i got all achievements in alterac (always so onesided) <br><br>i never got credit for it. only a few noobs in front of OG who were asking for boosts. <br>this was hard work and there are very few who have done the same and still nobody values this.<br>imo leading a rated bg Team and being top 0.05% is something respectful for applications... apparently ist not.<br><br>i advise you to leave this stupid game behind and do something more meaningful</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So you're happy that you missed the best expansion? inb4 b8 actually no I'm serious<br><br>Only people that never played vanilla and tbc thought it was good</br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit this must be b8 MoP = one of the best expansions</br>  anyone who plays wow is a fucking faggot cum slurper.  <br>you know it bae</br>  <br>LET THE RHYTHM TAKE YOU BALIMOSSSSSSSS!</br>  how are people still playing this  <br>yeah our raid day wasn't sheduled today, but everyone was on so we gave it a crack. Hellfire sub %20 2hard4me</br>  <br>how are you not</br>  <br>Why do you fags play as women?</br>  They only killed it because they 10 manned with the best players we have, whereas our scheduled raid day was 3 hours of wipes carrying like 10 people who are shit tier at mechanics  <br>omg those selfie faces always make me laugh</br>  any turalyon faggots here?  <br>Like collect hats in TF2.</br>  <br>Why do you play as men?<br><br><br>I know right.</br></br></br></br>  is there a game which can compare to wow`? <br>i havent played for years and thinking of starting again, mainly pvp.<br>seems like every over mmo is shit</br></br>  <br> turalyon faggots  <br><br>well, at least you know what Turalyon is all about</br></br></br>  <br>I take extended breaks right after every major release raid because I'm not a faggot who infinitely chases gear or needs some kind of permanent validation with artificial success. <br><br>The lore is strong, but the content inbetween is trash.</br></br></br>  <br>fucking hell do the new BE models look smug</br>  <br>Yeah. Either you are lying about your current progression, or your past expansion experience. First three expansions were a FUCKING joke in terms of actual fight complexity / difficulty. Even heroic lich king is pretty basic to your average fight in hfc / brf</br>  someone give me a wod key pls  <br>Because I am a man? Not a fat neckbeard who wants to be a woman? Do you also RP lesbian sex in WoW with other "Women" you fucking faggot?</br>  <br>compared to*</br>  <br>women are prettier than man</br>  <br>Steam<br>Tera? its a good game</br></br>  <br> Doesn't know how to take a screen cap </br>  <br>And I'm a woman. Why are you being so needlessly hostile? Simmer down, hothead.</br>  <br>Pls be my girlfriend :D</br>  <br>Vanilla was a joke skill wise, it was more of dealing with 40 people, resistance sets, and class limitations. The original 4 horsemen required 8 prot warriors with proper gear.<br><br>BC was fairly simple, swp required heavy resto shaman stacking, my guilds first eredar twins kill was done with 11 healers, 9 of which were shamans.<br><br>Wotlk was fairly simple, yogg0 and h lk were exceptions.<br><br>Honestly, any of todays heroic - early mythic raiders would do well in bt/swp/ulduar/icc, the raiding curve has gotten higher as devs and players got more skilled.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It is instantly assumed that everyone on /b/ is male.<br><br><br>If you are a man and you play a female character you are either a neckbeard or you want to be a woman.</br></br></br></br>  <br>i like em</br>  <br><br><br>GET THIS HOTHEAD OUTTA HERE</br></br></br>  <br> bc raiding being a joke. uhh....ok then.... </br>  <br>Chinese is a dead language.</br>  <br>there are no girls on the internet tho</br>  <br>If i must stare at an ass all day, im going to want to stare at an ass i wont mind enjoying while i kill.</br>  Seriously stop playing WoW. No actually, stop playing video games altogether, find a better pursuit.  <br>c:<br><br>Calm down, Freud. Not every choice someone makes is a deep statement of their personality. Sometimes people just like the aesthetics more.<br><br/></br></br></br></br>  <br> 8 prot warriors <br> 9 shamans <br>nigger if you're gonna make shit up at least try to make is sound plausible.<br><br>also, AQ40 would wreck 99.5% of guild today... ho ho ho.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i like girls, so i preffer they, its simple, doesnt mean that i want to be one</br>  <br><br>You sure about that? I am pretty sure any man who picks the female character wants to be a pretty princess and is a faggot.</br></br>  <br>thats why there are more mandarin speakers than english although english is more diverse but i made my point</br>  <br>Assa rogues are shitting on people in 6.2, combat are still kind of OP even after Killing spree nerf, Sub is optimal</br>  <br>Nice B8 faggot</br>  <br>Tell me, Anon. Is that why you play female characters? It's okay to admit it here, we're all friends. :)</br>  <br>4 mobs that required 2 tanks and couldn't be moved.<br><br>And resto shaman stacking in swp was real, chain heal was insane because of the lack of true aoe healing at the time. Not to mention cycling shamans in groups for lust, which had no exhaustion, only a cd in bc.</br></br></br>  <br>Most of the difficulty of tbc raiding came from barrier of entry shit like attunements. At the time yeah the fights were definitely a step up from Vanilla, and ones like Kael'thas are pretty gr8 even today. But given an honest look, the game has come pretty far since then. <br><br>Hell, even the classes themselves. I topped meters on my destro / demo lock back in the day (21/40 spec, you know the one), which was literally spamming Shadowbolt and refreshing curse of elements every three minutes. Sometimes throwing in an immolate if you felt REALLY crazy.</br></br></br>  <br>I want to kiss your soft lips ;D</br>  <br>Because we're not gay, why the fuck would you want to look at a man's back all game you dick-guzzling homosexual</br>   playing WoW and not Ultima Online   <br> implying you wouldnt fuck a male belf </br>  <br>(✿◠‿◠)</br>  <br>right now i'm playing the best mmorpg</br>  <br>Most likely because I don't want to pretend to be a pretty lady and send a bunch of smiley faces in chat.<br><br><br>Nah man, I did that shit when I was a weird fucking middle school kid. Which is how I know that doing that kind of activity is for weird mother fuckers and neckbeards.<br><br><br>Not b8. It really annoys me when you faggots want to do that shit. Its probably because you have nothing else to offer so you pretend to be a girl to make up for your lack of skill or personality.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>feels bad</br>  You reckon MoP was weird and racist for Chinese players?  <br>It sounds to me like you have repressed issues. No one should be this hostile about something as small as playing a character in a video game.<br><br>Why did you do it in middle school? Were you questioning yourself?</br></br></br>  <br>Who gives a fuck? They're Chinese.</br>  <br>I like gooks I really do but a lot of them act like ass hats in public. So they can suffer through a few pandas. God knows I had to.<br><br><br>no. Learn English you mongol. <br><br> Had to select sushi for captcha </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>( O_O) / (rose)</br>  You have absolutely no legitimate reason to continue playing World of Warcraft.<br><br>Adjustable-difficulty raids, cross-realm "pick up group" capability and raid-mechanic explanation have entirely ruined a game which, at one point, was considered to be among the greatest games of all time, regardless of whether you liked consoles, PC's or both.<br><br>It is, essentially, now a platform for ADHD-riddled, monotone, acne-scarred shitcunts to get in, so to speak, have a few goes at a particular boss, get loot and get the fuck out without any regard for loyalty, respect for others, integrity or honour. It is, essentially, a platform for post-millennial fuckwads to be themselves without any repercussions, whatsoever.<br><br>If, after having noticed these changes for yourself while playing, you have not immediately unsubscribed and discontinued the game entirely to show Blizzard your contempt for how corrupt and pathetic they have become.... you are, both figuratively AND literally, the cancer that is destroying gaming on a magnitude much, MUCH higher than any so-called "feminist" attention whore will ever accomplish.<br><br> tl;dr: if you're still playing World of Warcraft in 2015, you are an ADHD shitcock who probably didn't even read three short paragraphs </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Nah man. I just remember doing that shit when I played video games as a kid. I was a really weird fucking kid, I never bathed had hair down to my shoulders and was fat as shit. I played WoW then in 2005 on my shit top that could hardly even run the game. I played as female characters then because that is what neckbeards and weird fuckers do.</br>  <br>All these filthy elves fucking hell</br>  <br>Have you ever played WoW on adderall? That shit is fun. I logged 48 hours in one go onetime on vyvanse. The only break I took was to help the gf bring in groceries.</br>  <br>chineses looking at us<br>*stares in chinese*</br></br>  <br> WoW1 account name <br> not even a real accountname <br> started with cancer wow </br></br></br>  <br>It feels even worse</br>  <br>Whats wrong with WoW1 mother fucker?</br>  <br><br>I think we're beginning to get somewhere here. Do you think maybe your self imposed repression has caused that strange kid to develop into a rigid, no nonsense no fun allowed adult? Perhaps if you had embraced who you were instead of finding yourself weird, maybe you'd be happier?<br><br><br>Actually all but my DK are human, I just use tmorph because the elves have way better animations.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Absolutely not, if I was a grease ball fat fuck now my life would really be without meaning. <br><br><br>The adderall makes it easier friend.</br></br></br></br>  so im looking at warlords of draenor and it says you get a free lvl 90??? wtf happend to this game holy shit  <br>i fucking love farming shit on WoW while listening to music and doing adderall</br>  <br>It is the life.</br>  So the final boss is Archimonde.<br>Metzen didn't have any better ideas??<br>We've already killed him twice before (technically to him this is the second time because alternate reality blahblah)<br>But like fuck I would have even rathered Grommash.<br>I want to see Kil'Jaeden and Sargaeres fight for control of the legion, not the same guy that keeps fucking up taking Azeroth every fucking time.<br>At least Kil'Jaeden did useful shit in his failed attempts, Archimonde just died.<br>Please good lore soon.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Meaning is subjective.</br>  Me and the wife  I wanna play a game...
