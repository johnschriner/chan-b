Account</br></br></br>  <br> is there an PB app for smartphones <br>Yes there is.</br></br>  <br>I don't think so. He's an adult and wouldn't make shit public.

Could he actually be Brad? Other posts on that forum make him sound young and starting out.</br></br></br>  Here is one of the news stories if you have not seen it yet. <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=49I<wbr>aufNj_9I</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br><br>true he still wouldnt want his daughter's nudes out there.<br>but brother might not care as much. and brother could easily be author of those posts. dad might be too old to be posting in forums and using embedding pictures in html</br></br></br>  <br>where else would he get his daily fix of tranny pictures?</br>  ITT: Post habeebable stories and habeeb them. <br><br>Maybe he changed it after the scandal to confuse you dumb fucks?</br></br>  <br>Brad is an Alabama fan and they hate Auburn</br>  <br>Also somewhat interesting, AuburnOwnsSEC spells arse the british english way. Not ass.</br>   are you autistic   <br>brother would easily know. he's a full tilt neckbeard</br>  <br>Kind of wondering about that myself. I have a daughter Lani's age and I would never use the word "bro". However I do know about 4chan so...</br>  <br><br>All of you fucking idiot theorists. This shit all started on Reddit's photoplunder subreddit. Lani gave Brad the credentials, and the fuckstick left everything public.<br><br>The ORIGINAL thread, where the pics were first posted:<br><br>http://www reddit com/r/photoplunder/comments/3erxhy/<wbr>toddweissen_hot_small_win/<br><br>Pic related, it's a message from Lani to an anon who was harassing her.</br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>With a QT girlfriend.<br><br>I'm fucking moving to Alabama.</br></br></br>  <br>I think L. just hijacked her fathersPB account, and told Brad to upload stuff there to share with her.<br>Stpid Dude maybe didn't even think twice about that since she gave him credentials</br></br>  He could've been a 4channer, or browsed 4chan. The way people respond sound like typical /b/ users.  <br><br>let's find out if Devin Weissenbach is an Auburn fan</br></br>  maybe instead of thinking it was the dad who wanted to expose brad, what about the brother who found out and was pissed  <br><br>I frequent the SEC Rant forum. It's a big place for people to bitch about SEC football. They filter it so swear words get you banned, so people say arse instead of ass, etc.</br></br>  It was found by a redditor, i don't think the brother has anything to do with it  You guys are complete fucking assholes, leave me and Brad alone.  <br> http://www reddit com/r/photoplunder/comments/3erxhy/<wbr>toddweissen_hot_small_win/</wbr> <br>We're talking about WHY the photobucket was under the name Todd Weissenbach</br></br>  <br> weak sauce, cunt </br>  Ok so whats the big deal? a teacher cheated on his wife and fucked a student? <br><br>where did all this SJW white knight faggotry came from</br></br>  <br>Please give me one google search that shows up that image with no metadata associated with it.. no tags.. no description.. nothing. It's a gif randomly numbered, the only way he could have it - is that he was searching PB recently upload randomly and saved it. then started a topic on it..<br><br>Makes more sense the guy who started the topic uploaded it to his PB account. <br><br>Is the Dad an Auburn fan at all? Or Arkansas... ? Does the Dad Like Baseball at all?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yes, and that's explained in the attached picture.<br><br>lrn2reading</br></br></br></br>  <br>this is the best theory for me</br>  <br>Between this and stalking through Lanis moms facebook albums, I feel kind of bad for Lani.<br>She sounds and looks like a sweet girl that fucked up after being taken advantage for for a while by Brad.</br></br>  <br>How old is he? <br><br>Maybe Devin liked Crystal Pepsi? If hes late 20s early 30s? it came out in the early 90s.</br></br></br>  <br>Can you upload ? Havent seen it</br>  <br>Brother is the one we're looking for. Dad still would not want nudes exposed of daughter.<br>brother might not care though</br></br>  <br> Some dude from Alabama using 'arse' and 'shite'?  <br>That seems very suspicious.</br></br>  <br>But why is it under the name Todd Weissenbach?</br>  <br>https://mega.co.nz/#!YUxAiZIA!8_Izj<wbr>JF0vc3U6zCTn-AD_GdoUIMKIDuieeNeisUP<wbr>uCk</wbr></wbr></br>  <br>explained above its to get around language filters</br>  <br>What she had at her disposal.immediately</br>  <br>right.<br>no way a father would accept the collateral damage for his girl..</br></br>  <br>Thanks</br>  How old is the student.<br>I don't see why that would be wrong, she apparently seems to enjoy herself.</br>  Kekd  <br>Kill yourself, lani....it's the only way</br>  <br><br>"shite"?

PEOPLE DON'T NEED TO CONTACT PEOPLE FROM PLUNDERS!!!!<br><br>Where is this damn 4chan link so I can see how much damage have been done by all this bull shit</br></br></br></br>  <br>It´s not, it´s just the fact that /b/ is so deep in social justice its more or less tumblr in here</br>  <br>he would have deleted the actual nudes at least from the folder.</br>    <br>It's French, you fucking idiot.</br>  <br><br>bypassing inappropriate language filters, you retard. not every site is like 4chan.</br></br>  <br>for the 76th time its to get around the language filters typical of normie sports forums</br>  <br>We're not deep in social justice, we fucking did it because we were lucky to find a guy who slightly broke the law and we felt that we had the power to throw him in jail, and now we're here.</br>  <br><br>brother got married in october 2014. Newly married, bragging about hot wife.<br>that's totally him posting on that SEC forum.</br></br></br>  <br>seems legit to me</br>  <br>"Avril" for April is French, cunt</br>  On the SEC Rant forum, there is an off-topic forum separate from the sports forum. Might be a good place to ask around. They are very anti SJW there, as one would expect with mostly southerners.  <br>We're wasting our time coming up with theories, constantly monitoring this, because we don't have anything better to do. Honestly, this is one of the most entertaining things I've seen so far.</br>  <br>This was fake</br>  <br>I like where this is going...</br>  Lani's Dad is named Todd. Lani's oldest brother is also named Todd. SEC account posts that fav food from childhood was Crystal Pepsi and links to a gif on a photobucket account named toddweissenbach. Much more likely it is the brother Todd on SECrant and PB than the dad  Brad should get his next party at the dungeon.<br><br>http://efukt.com/21298_I_Want_HIV.h<wbr>tml</wbr></br></br>  <br>Why wouldn't he just contact the police?</br>    <br>LOL should have seen it sooner. Old man Todd would not need to go on an SEC forum to ask about how much landscaping should cost.<br>Neckbeard brother Devin totally would need to ask tho.</br></br>  <br>Devins hot wife is<br> Alicia Kadie on facebook</br></br>  <br>bro and sis sharing the PB account? why not?</br>  <br>Is there any proof this is even legit?</br>  <br>what year was crystal pepsi tho? is that something a 20 yr old brother or 50 year old dad would remember fondly?</br>  <br>I meant Italian.</br>  <br> implying this is even her <br> implying this is even her <br> implying this is even her <br> implying this is even her </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>how do u know it was fake?<br>I had my suspicions about those early moments of the shitstorm so im all ears.</br></br></br>  <br>Is Aprile spanish? Italian and spanish are alike and it'd make more sense if it were Spanish</br>  <br>interesting</br>  Funny thing is, I stumbled upon this bucket two days ago and read the texts and shit, quite incriminating shit, I thought I had discovered something big, but of course you guys were already all over it haha. I found her Facebook, it's unfriendable. I too was confused why it was in her dads name, but it makes sense if he was trying to gather evidence  <br>No, April in Spanish is abril.</br>  <br>How'd you stumble upon it?</br>  damn dudes, let it go. Your mission is accomplished I'd say. Dude's life is literally destroyed. Marriage ruined, which will probably financially ruin him, a ruin which he will likely not recover from anytime soon since he is unemployable with his now worthless degree. This dark cloud is now over both of their heads, so their relationships with family/friends are forever changed, probably for the worse. Hell, even if this guy gets his life back together, what is he going to tell his kids one day when they google his name? Grats you literally destroyed several lives and got your lulz.  it's legit from old thread  <br>1992-1993, brother Todd started college in 2005 or 2006 or something like that according to LinkedIn</br>  <br>We're just bored and have time to spend.</br>  I dont appreciate people contacting the users from my plunders (self.photoplunder)<br><br>submitted 2 days ago by ohfourgts<br><br>Yesterday someone made a TIFU about the post I made containing a bucket... of a guys name, who supposedly had pics of his daughter.

Most entertaining thing I've seen in days. I'm all for live and let live.

I was going through photobucket recent uploads</br>  <br>I'm fucking around man. kek</br>  <br>The PB is still up?</br>  <br>It's a good school but one of the coaches tried to persuade me to have a threesome with one of my blonde friends. What a creep hehe :D!</br>  <br>Or mail the teachers instead!<br>I found this pastebin in some other thread yesterday: http://pastebin * com/rDsyn4gg</br></br>  holy shit guise<br>did this guy really deserve this???</br>  <br>Not the whole thing just the convos anon was having with Brad and Lani but it's just a theory just like everything else. I was in the original thread and I saw everything as it was going down. When anon was having the convo with brad he kept saying he wanted him to write /b on his forehead but wouldn't. Then he settled for him to make an L on his forehead with his hand. Anon could have easily already had this pic of him and was playing with everyone. Soon after that Lani contacted him and was replying to him. Just seemed a little of to me but again I can't prove that so its just a theory.</br>  Dude's wife got chubby and he banged a newer, thinner model. Can't blame him.<br><br>Still, it's been a long time since /b/ was this interesting. Gotta love it.</br></br>  SEC fan here. It's quite common for children to root for the rival team of the team the dad/mom roots for. Kind of like being rebellious. If dad is a Bam, then son is War Damn Eagle.  <br>Probably not but who the fuck cares</br>  talk about first-world problems  <br>yes. have you seen his balls? They're shaved bro. No MAN should ever do that.</br>  <br>This. Brad wasn't gonna use his name. He needed something she would remember...

I saved a shitload of the pics and some of the texts. <br>http://s172.photobucket com/user/toddweissenbach/library/?s<wbr>ort=3&amp;page=1</wbr></br></br>  <br>that doesnt explain SEC rant guy using the toddweiss photobucket for an account he just made. ur believing that anons on 4chan actually got both brad and lani to respond at the time of the thread.</br>  <br>Read the thread or use ctrl + f</br>  <br>Was just about to post something similar but different.<br><br>After some googling, it seems Lanis mom and dad are Tea Partiers. Devin Weissenbach had some stuff that makes him sound a lot more liberal (eg supporting Obama care).<br><br>Totally irrelevant to anything else.</br></br></br></br></br>  why not contact the journalist and get her up to par on the events <br><br><br>You can reach Melissa Brown at mbrown@al.com</br></br></br>  Lani's good to go I would put at least 2 fingers in her just putting this out there  <br>we know for sure there are desperate anons who are willing to photoshop shit to get more attention, spin lies. fake news stories, shit like that. <br>so it's not impossible that this is a brother's smear campaign. he is an aspie, remember</br></br>  <br>You guys still don't understand that this was a neckbeards personal request do you? He was jealous and angry that this man has a hot 18 year old and a wife.</br>  This is un-fucking-believable. <br><br>I just...I can't wrap my mind around this.<br><br>Alabama has schools?!</br></br></br></br>   Brad has been among us all along   <br>https://twitter.com/itsmelissabrown<wbr></wbr></br>  <br>why is it impossible the neckbeard is the girl's brother? he could have wanted them dragged through the mud by his personal army just as easily.</br>  <br>sounds plausible<br>and makes the capped convo with brad to the very first OP legit.<br>"left it public" "idiotic mistake"...</br></br></br>  If people search the thread I linked earlier about the grandmother with cancer stuff, you'll see that a certain SEC Rant member verbally embarrasses the son. The son comes off looking like a beta and basically implies that his wife runs the household.<br><br>http://www.secrant.com/rant/display<wbr>.aspx?sp=57246472&amp;b=12&amp;s=1&amp;p=572464<wbr>72<br><br>Follow the entire thread.</br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>In one of his old posts he say he played baseball for 12 years.</br>  <br/>  The brother is the recently married (to a hot wife) neckbeard aspie who is old enough to have worked in a video store (dad was too old to be stocking shelves in a vhs rental store) and fondly remember crystal pepsi from him childhood (dad was obviously an adult during the late 80s / early 90s). The account on the forum was recently created. There is no doubt it's him. <br><br>Why did he have the files? Why did he put it under his dad's name? Is Todd maybe Devin's middle name (or real name: Todd Jr. with Devin being his middle name?)</br></br>  <br> toddweissenback@nigge.rs <br> @nigge.rs <br> nigge.rs <br><br>Oh you!</br></br></br></br></br>  Incase anyone care, a list of all of Lani's graduating classmates.<br><br>http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/artic<wbr>le/20150523/NEWS/150529871</wbr></br></br>  Why is it that lots of kiddy fiddlers, and student fuckers etc.. all seem to be Jesus preaching christian fucks?  <br>Kind of, in the same way that a neckbeard has muscles. Technically true, but in practice not useful.</br>  <br>Lan ihad access to his account and just was naive enough to use it. the end</br>  Devin is 27 by the way.

I wouldnt mind if she killed herself. Lets do this?</br></br>  <br><br>So both Lani and Devin use their dads pb account?</br></br>  <br>No, I hate hypocrites. If you're gonna be a self-righteous Christfag don't have an affair with a little girl like a creep.</br>  there is no way that is a grown man with children the way he talks on the SECrant forum  <br>Waiting for an hero</br>  The brother must have used the photobucket account that was set up by his father because his feels that they need to keep an eye on him. Reading the forum posts looks like his wife has to approve the things he says online. She must have gotten that from his parents knowing that he is kind of a retard. -kind of?  <br>Because pedos are mad in the head, and religious people are as well.<br>They're not always both, but the madness is probably in the same section of the brain.</br></br>  <br>why not...I know plenty families who share accounts for services like PB</br>  They actually seem like a really cute couple.

While I agree, most men my size have no stamina, and I get this question almost every time someone is at the gym with me. But I do run, I do a shit load of cardio, and I never do a workout without cardio. (Unless I am building size which I don't anymore as I would go over the weight restriction for my particular job). That being said, smaller people find it easier to build stamina because they aren't carrying as much weight. But to answer your question in tl;dr, I run, and I'm fast, Agile and have much higher stamina than you'd expect.<br><br>Why do you want me next to you in the field?

OKFINE. Dream on kiddo, dream on.

I have 10 times the stamina you do, ill run circles til youre winded then take my time fucking you up</br>  <br><br>Been in about 600. I don't have to know the names of shit I take advantage of. Lost only 1 fight because 6 of his brothers decided to join in and one of them hit me with a pipe really fucking hard in the skull. Got dizzy. Killed two of them, ran the fuck away.</br></br>    <br>Exactly, he comes to try and punch you thru your window and ends up face to face with a .45. Then his friends say "he was such a great guy, what a tragedy"</br>  <br> implies first shot isn't what won the fight already. </br>  <br><br>Kid. 16 hour shifts hard labor in construction and oilfield, all anaerobic. I don't look like a million bucks but I last like a million bucks and I really can throw a motorcycle at you. Have fun in your dream world on the internets. I'm out.</br></br>  <br>News story? I doubt this.</br>  <br>Didndunuffin</br>  <br>I'm the kind of guy who notices everyone.<br>I am the kind of guy who is so aware of his surroundings that he detests getting drunk in public because it makes him feel uneasy.<br>I see smaller people as a bigger threat because they are more likely to be afraid of me, and when you corner a scared animal it doesn't try to take you head on it pulls out a 10 inch hunting knife and tries to put it through your fucking heart.<br>I'm the kind of guy that if you came up behind me as I get out of my car, I already know you're there and shit is about to get messy.<br>The key to my ability to have little fear is to be afraid of everything and prepare for it.<br><br>Sorry I don't live up to the 'meathead' expectation of thinking my biceps will save me from knives and bullets, good thing that I took advanced hand to hand and close quarters combat training.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why come here in the first place... I thought you were out fucking our g/f's</br>  <br>good point, Im pretty confident in my first punch technique, it almost always works. I think along with a well-landed punch, the person is totally shocked cuz u actually them so theyre head-fucked for the rest of the fight.</br>  im a taekwondo itf teacher all i will say is speed and precision its more valuable in a punch speed&gt;mass  <br>i doubt this guy ever gets high<br>he doesn't look like he's cool</br></br>  <br>I'm the kind of fuck sitting over there in the bushes.<br>I've been there for an hour.<br>You'll get out of the car and never even know I was there.<br>I won't do shit. <br>I just like existing.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> doesn't know the difference between a fight and an assault <br> roid rage intensifies </br></br>  <br>Well as long as we fight near a motorcycle store I guess youre set. Retard</br>  Fuck all of you cunts I'll smash the living shit out of any of you puny faggots. You squealing queens are a joke, All your talk about how fucking hard you are and how you can hide it but you're a bestial killing machine is just that: talk.<br><br> Fuck each and every one of you fucking gay cunts, I'll wreck you, dig up your mother's corpse and fist it</br></br>  <br><br>kekelino</br></br>  <br>Dude I almost spewed my oatmeal when I read this. Haha!</br>  <br>Just because you've got big muscles doesn't mean that you actually know how to fight. Im not saying that I would win in a fight.<br>Either you're baiting, or the roids are getting to your head.</br></br>  <br>How tall are you and what weight are you at? If you want higher than 245 then I suggest you stop doing bench for a while and do bent over rows really hard for a week or two, do Bench still but stick at a lower than max weight.<br><br>Use creatine if you don't already, and make sure when you do work bench that you do slower reps for maximum time under tension, get a swell happening. And then next time you do bench do max weight for 5 reps, do 5 sets of that or as many as you can really. Make sure that tomorrow you feel like you can't move, take shit loads of protein in whatever method you prefer, powder or steak. You'll be pushing more in no time.</br></br></br>  <br> Taekwondo <br> Punch <br><br>Pick one</br></br></br></br>  <br>ill choke you to death with your own femur you feeble queef.</br>  <br>Not really on both accounts.<br>But if it makes you sleep better at night, I guess there's no harm in you believing it.<br>Or rather, you believing you're that faggot in the pic.</br></br></br>  <br> Taekwondo <br>opinion discarded</br></br>  <br>go put on a tutu princess, real men are talking</br>  <br>You are on steroids which is why you have hormonal problems that cause your awful mood swings, penis problems and hair loss.

I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.</br>  <br>Go ahead and read the rest of my posts man, I don't do steroids and I know muscles don't mean combat prowess... Fuck sake man.</br>  Looks like another e-peen flexing thread here.<br><br>You do know that once someone throws a punch or something it's legally on and the defender can fuck your shit up without legal consequence?<br><br>Might want to consider that before talking up a big game.<br><br>So... yeah. I see a big guy walking down the street all Alpha and such, I sell him something because Alphas are the biggest Betas ever, you just have to get them to like you.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I have a black belt in judo so, the heavier and slower you are because of all your muscles, the better for me.</br>  What the actual fuck is this thread? With idiots saying they'll fight each other and this shit and that shit bunch of cluster fuck spasms  <br> inb4 google <br>TIMESTAMP OR OP IS A FAGGOT</br></br>  <br> not knowing an assault turns into a fight if there are no successful first blows. <br>What is fighting?</br></br>  I simply think someone like you and someone like myself and my gf would never cross paths. We would both have trouble understanding the things you value and you'd feel the same about us.  <br> Implying show-off bodybuilders would last 30 seconds against a trained fighter </br>  <br>So What? I'm full level in League of Legends. Shame on you.</br>  <br> Not on roids <br>What are you? Like 4 ft?<br>explains your aggression.<br>I would be mad as hell too if I was a freakshow always looking up at real men, knowing I would always be lesser.</br></br></br></br>  What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch?

Also hi.</br></br>  Omg it's so full of people here    <br>I feel I'm very similar to your situation there, no motivation to post every night. How have you been?</br>  <br>If you shitpost it, they will come.</br>    <br>could be better could be worse. my life is just meh right now.</br>  <br><br>I have been doing pretty good thanks.

Going to have to bury my cousins dog later while he is in jail. Plus being inebriated doesn't help sentence structure. <br><br>But still want to watch that JLA thing soon. Great nerd stuff coming out to enjoy.</br></br></br>  <br>No</br>  <br>I thought you lived in Melbourne though? Is it really that boring</br>  <br>ehh there's probably stuff to do around here, but i'm just not motivated at all.</br>  <br> Going to have to bury my cousins dog later while he is in jail <br>WHAT THE FUCK LOL I'm not saying I'm laughing at either your cousin being in jail or a dead dog but holy shit that is one of the funniest fucking sentences I have read in a long time</br></br>  <br>Well ask a stupid question <br>Hope you are doing well tho</br></br>  <br>Ah, do you go out with friends often? play vidya?</br>  <br>Only cool cats like me are from Melbourne, surely cocka doesn't qualify</br>  <br>Doing fine.<br><br>Talking to league etc etc</br></br></br>  <br>nah, anyone's cool enough to live in Melbourne</br>  <br>Woops, no picture.</br>  <br>browse the internet and sleep. used to play tons of vidya but those days are over.<br><br><br>get fucked im the coolest cat</br></br></br></br>    <br> muh exclusivity <br>not true, we only let in the qt's!!, you're thinking of Sydney.<br><br>maybe I will, faggot!</br></br></br></br>        <br>that's not a very exciting existence, what do you study at school?<br><br><br>nope, definitely melbourne<br>Radelaide is where it's at for cool people</br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br>  <br>Haha well enjoy then and I am glade I could give you that! I know you mean well and all so I don't mind. Just kinda got home and found all this out. Gonna have have to work though it more in the morning when more sober.</br>  <br>robotics, don't really like it though.</br>  <br>If you have to put rad in the name of a place to make it sound more interesting it probably isn't that good to begin with<br><br><br>Uni been going okay for you so far?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Was ok - not amazing. Went to town with some mates but it was underwelming. Several of the places I used to go to had shut down so ended up in random bars &amp; pubs. Feels like Adelaides nightlife is dying...<br><br>Ahh back to Uni eh, that must suck haha. Wasn't your bf coming back soon or something??</br></br></br></br>  <br>What uni?</br>  <br>Good times... He is good people</br>      <br>heh not uni bro.</br>  <br>Why thank you scratch, so how are you doing right now?</br>  <br>what do you want to do instead?<br><br><br>nope, it's the coolest place<br>Uni's been great, aside from a few shit compulsories it's been a lot of fun<br><br><br>well that sucks, Adelaide nightlife is... interesting from what I've seen<br>uni's a lot better this semester. Yeah, we picked him up at the airport, it was great seeing him again</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    Where all the tigers at?  <br>i don't fucking know, having plans for the future is for lame people. probably just computer science if anything. or maybe cooking, i like cooking.</br>  <br>Yep</br>  <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ECq<wbr>xmfmp6gU</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Half of your core subjects are always garbage, I had to put up with a whole heap of stupid process ones that were just a waste of time that you learned nothing from. Exams went well, I assume? Haven't really spoken to you since we were procrastinating and not studying just before exams.</br>  <br>Ah, I remember when I was like that, you'll find something you want to do eventually. Cooking's not bad, as long as it's something you like doing and people aren't just saying to do it</br>  <br> all the cool kids study compsci in melbourne <br>copycat</br></br>    <br> i don't fucking know, having plans for the future is for lame people. <br>This is the fucking stupidest thing I've read all night, and I hope to god you're kidding. Also robotics is fucking tight, as goes with the rest of the mechanical engineering field. I know because it's my field of choice. If you're studying that in college and not thoroughly enjoying yourself, there is something seriously wrong.</br></br>  <br> computer science <br>DEAR GOD NO, YOU WILL NEVER FIND A JOB!!</br></br>  <br>saved!</br>  <br>Okay for the most part, a little drunk and tired, hopefully going to sleep eventually. Plus you are good people :)</br>  <br>The main subjects are actually pretty fun, it's just a few of the other compulsories are shit, like learning basic english, that course can fuck off<br>Exams went pretty well actually. We did, sorry but I don't remember that<br>you at uni?</br></br></br>  <br>That should work</br>  <br> DEAR GOD NO, YOU WILL NEVER FIND A JOB!! <br>My bf is a software engineer and found a job literally before he graduated. As with a good majority of his graduating class. As with all my friends who work in CS. What fucking planet do you live on?</br></br>  <br>Wat, there's like a trillion jobs you can get in that field</br>  <br>of course i'm kidding, i just don't know what the fuck i'm going to do.<br><br><br>cooking's probably the only thing i like doing that i'm good at. i don't know if i could do it as a job though, too much pressure.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>Idk, they escaped maybe</br>  <br>ur bf can't be that great he's dating u<br>p low standards imo</br></br>  <br>Ah yeah, I didn't really have to do any courses outside of my field tbh, would have been pissed having to do rudamentary english and stuff. I had to do an ethics one, sorta, I guess. And that's okay, was just in passing anyway I guess.</br>  <br>Eh, some people are weird and like to date people that are significantly uglier/fatter than they are because it makes them feel like they have more security/safety knowing that their partner won't leave them for someone else.</br>  <br>Couldn't be worse than robotics could it?<br><br><br>What course are you in? I really don't remember a lot from back then, it was a pretty busy time for me</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>also just realised that close was only 9 off quads ;_;</br></br>  <br>That's why I am still married.</br>  What ever happened to Marty?  <br>i mean i'm alright at robotics, but i just have no passion for it. it's not FUN to study. cooking's great cause you can experiment and make cool new foods.</br>  <br> melbourne <br>urgh<br><br>Melbourne should change their tourism slogan to "At least it's not Darwin"<br><br><br>Eaten by sharks</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>      <br>D':<br><br>F F F F F F F F F F F</br></br></br>  <br>Well I'm glad you are okay, also get some sleep. It is good for you and helps getting less drunk, and thank you! I also feel like you are a great person.<br><br>When iI see computer science I usually see people do the desktop support\Help desk side of it. There àre so many people doing that, jobs are insanely hard to find</br></br></br>  <br>Your jelly is palpable, as always</br>  <br>so close<br><br><br>If you don't have a passion for it don't do it, nothing worse than being stuck in a job you can't stand for 40+ years<br><br><br>that slogan would work better for Perth</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>good thing i'm not even at uni yet, got plenty of time to find my passion.</br>    <br>Ah, good. And yeah don't worry, I had the "I'M FUCKING CONFUSED" phase pretty much all through high school and afterwards, up until I turned 20. Then it dawned on me that mech-eng is the shit for me, so I'm chasing it.<br><br><br>Deans list every semester.<br>Graduated Magna cum Laude<br>Got hired into a position that would make most people of any age salivate.<br><br>Then there's me, a like-minded engineering student of mechanical persuasion rather than software, who built built a pyrotechnic gauntlet at 14, designed a jet turbine at 17, and designed a plasma fusion reactor at 21. I'm basically Tony Stark but except short blonde and gay. Nigger if anything both his and I's standards are high as fuck.<br><br><br>Ah yeah IT positions are icky, but they actually pay pretty decently. And depending on where you live, even they're in large supply.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Of course it is. It's Aeroplane Jelly.
