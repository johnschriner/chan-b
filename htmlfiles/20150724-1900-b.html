It doesn't fucking work, moron. All you hear is "free shit and we'll just make all the rich people pay for it" and you think "WOOHOO" and you don't have a fucking clue what the real economic consequences would be.

I'd much rather pay for college for my own countrymen than rebuilding shit countries we have no business being in.</br>  <br>nothing is free, dumbass.<br><br>sanders is for all the idiots that dont understand economics and the idea that everything costs something.</br></br></br>  <br>communism and socialism are not the same thing. retarded murricans, I swear to fucking god.</br>  <br>Rand Paul</br>  <br>You don't need to read Ayn Rand (I haven't) to realize that paying taxes is not voluntary. It's kind of obvious.</br>  <br><br><br>But we don't. Federal Reserve is a foreign entity. AND socialism doesn't fucking work. If you believe Greece's problem was its control over its currency and not socialism, it's apparent you don't know a thing about economics and therefore I'm simply wasting my words here.</br></br></br>  <br>It's not just a currency issue. They have shitty socialist policies that have forced their government to hemorrage money without creating and good source of wealth or tax revenue for the country because people barely fucking work in Greece because of their socialist policies.</br>  <br>fucking kek<br>kill yourself, you do not belong in society</br></br>  <br>nah, that's not really greece's problem at all mate</br>  <br>Are you an idiot?

No exceptions.<br><br>I'm just sick of hearing about how free college will solve the student debt "crisis". Yes, spreading out the costs of something insanely overpriced fixes the problem, just like rape fixes AIDS. Colleges figured out that students could get loaned shittons of money so they raised prices to milk the students for everything they could. Reverse that and you've got cheap college and low student loans back.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> using socialist and progressive as derogatory terms <br><br>You are an incredibly stupid person</br></br></br>  <br> taking the bait <br> being this new <br>GTFO n00b</br></br></br>  <br>wrong.</br>  <br>Union's fault<br>LOOK AT DETROIT PEOPLE FUCKING UNIONS RUINED THAT ENTIRE CITY</br></br>    <br>Taker a closer look at those countries and they're starting to rot from the inside out because taxing the everloving fuck out of your citizens is not sustainable or fair.</br>  <br>Socialism and caring about the welfare of your countries citizens is not an inherently bad thing.<br><br>Healthy citizens with ubiquitous access to higher education promotes long term economic growth.</br></br></br>  <br>Socialism and Communism are as different as Coke and Pepsi.
