Only their penor are decent at times </br></br></br>  <br>Ashkenazi jews are, on average, the most intelligent ethnic group in the human race.

I've been pondering this question since I was 12</br>  <br> that gif <br>Holy shit.</br></br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>Because men allow women to control sexuality. If only men would take it from them, men would have all the power. But men choose not to. They choose to give the power of sexuality to women by allowing them to choose their mate. Men will fuck anything that moves and women take advantage of that by using sex against men. So in part, they are given rights to experiment bisexually with no consequences as a king would playfully execute his challengers and be praisednfor his nobility.</br>  <br>gay</br>  <br>I don't consider it gay.

A completely straight man could never be in a relationship but fuck all the girls he wants simply because he doesn't want a relationship. Same goes for any other kind of sexuality.</br>  <br>Because a key that can open multiple locks is a masterkey, whereas a lock that can be opened up by multiple keys is a shitty lock.</br>  <br> playfully flirt with multiple <br>Because otherwise the bitch will try to take control. It's a way to keep em checked in way. It's physiological</br></br>  <br>So again there's no gray scale? You suck one dick and boom -- gay. I havent even sucked a dick. Yet women can go through an entire phase of fucking all the girls they want and go back to being straight? Okay.</br>  <br>Because men are stupid enough to fall for it.</br>  nobody mentioned bro code?<br>it's bro code</br>  <br>I'm sure a grill can playfully flirt with multiple other grills, you just have no imagination</br>  <br>Because no one feels threatened by it.<br><br>...and it's hot.</br></br></br>  <br>QUADS</br>    <br>Billy your sink is a fucking mess</br>  <br><br>Because you're sacrificing your masculinity by becoming a passive, submissive party. It ain't rocket science, faggot. Ancient Roman peasants could figure it out. Why can't you?</br></br>  <br>Because it's illogical. And you're dumb for accepting it at face value</br>  <br> intro to psych at stanford <br> godlike <br><br>This is why I dropped out of community college and joined the military so I could have my stanford education paid for. CC is for fucking rural bumpkins who think they're big in the city.</br></br></br></br>  <br>WITNESSED<br><br>the truth is in the quads</br></br></br>  <br>So you want to suck dick but be straight because life isn't fair.</br>  <br> illogical, but can't prove it <br> you're stupid <br><br>Two strikes in a row. Lame.<br><br>Why are you Millennial faggots so awful at reasoning and argument? Have you fuckers EVER had to think? EVER been challenged? Do you even know what a syllogism is (without having to Google it)?<br><br>Jesus. Go suck a dick. You obviously want to. Just quit fucking WHINING. Because you're too weak to handle disagreement, and too stupid to prove a point.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Because all the men who tried it were killed by the men they tried it on  Because they pander for male attention. Men doing this just makes them look like fags so women don't want them any more.  <br>Who said I couldn't prove it? <br>I said it before... you accept that women can exhibit homosexual behavior, even at extended periods of time, and they can return to heterosexuality without question. If a man even think about doing something homosexual, he's immediately homosexual. This isn't a Millenial thing, old-fag, it's 100% a social contradiction.</br></br>  <br>This lecturer is actually entertaining, its free for fuck sake, learn some shit from the best educator i've seen<br> I live in england and have no sides here, i also study physics </br></br>  <br>Nobody said women are "allowed" to "turn into" heterosexuals whenever they want. That's in your head.<br><br>You obviously have bought into the lie that women have all the power, and you want to suck dick because you want to be more like a women in order to identify with that power. Trying to say you're not gay despite frothing for cock should TELL YOU that something is WRONG IN YOUR HEAD.</br></br></br>  <br>women fuck women to get something, not because they want to. a man will fuck another man if it's for something, dominance, getting girls, etc, but if a man wants to actively suck dick, he's gay, because he wants it for no reason other than the action itself</br>  <br>http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-co<wbr>ntent/uploads/2009/05/strawman.png</wbr></br>  <br>Not in the least. Pack up that armchair, Freud.</br>  <br>Because Society says so.</br>  <br>Sauce on that gif I rofl hard anon</br>  <br> thinks women are incapable of having sex for sheer enjoyment </br>  <br><br>does this mean i can't have a playful 69 with my bro anymore?</br></br>  <br>Who the fuck is stopping you? Go for it. Just be careful you don't go catching feelings.</br>  nice  <br>Fucking funny shit</br>  <br><br>I dunno, I think you can want cock without wanting the rest of the maleness that comes with it.<br><br>That's why traps are so big here, riiiiight?</br></br></br></br>  <br>You can't solicit a stranger's opinion about your sexuality without expecting some psychoanalysis. Where the fuck do you think you're posting? Hugbox.com?</br>  <br>Sounds like you just don't wanna be gay even though you probably are</br>  <br>Idk how to explain it. I'm repulsed by nearly every guy. The hair, the muscles, almost everything about the personality. It's just not for me.<br>Still there have been a few dicks thatve looked appealing in porn. Wouldnt mind doing a girl and dude.</br></br>  <br>Naming a logical fallacy isn't an automatic win for your internet team.</br>  <br>Yeah, but it's so wrong, though. Did you even take psych in uni?</br>  <br>Nah</br>  <br><br>Seriously? You're kidding right? Because two guys being "playful" is gay as fuck. There's no bi about it. Girls who play with girls aren't even necessarily gay. But a boy who plays with a boy is just a straight up faggot. All there is to it.</br></br>  <br>Except when it's apt, right?</br>  <br>You don't know the answer to your problem, so you come here looking for answers. Answers are provided, but you say they're wrong. <br>Just suck a dick and get it over with.</br></br>  <br><br>Girls love attention, if that means becoming an outcast they will do so. Being different makes them feel special. Some are just horny but won't say it.</br></br>  <br><br>You are wrong, but you'll never find out why.</br></br>  <br>I'm not looking for an answer. Just sharing, brah.</br>  Ok /b/ros I had sex with two shemales had nice tits and everything but I wouldn't have sex with a regular guy does that still make it gay even if I like femininity?  <br>He's mad that girls get a pass for homosexual behavior and he doesn't. Society doesn't treat the sexes the same way. So yes, my statement was apt, and you've failed to counter it or improve it.</br>  <br>I'm not mad, just pointing out why you're wrong. If you don't want to listen, and keep wanting to accept things at contradictions at face value, be my guest.</br>  <br>"So why is it that women can mess around with other women but men can't?"<br>If you're just sharing, then don't ask questions.</br></br>  <br> Doesn't understand entertaining ideas, because it's contradictory to his standpoint. <br>Or I can do whatever I want.</br></br>  <br>Meh, honestly you shouldnt give a shit, if they are feminine and you like feminine traits you are pretty much "straight".<br>The real question is why do you care, its fucking 2015 and if you have fun nobody gives a shit, i could tell my friends i fucked two shemales and get off fine apart from a few gay jokes aslong as i didnt take the bait<br><br>TL;DR, literally nobody cares, fuck whatever makes you happy you massive faggot</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sexual aggression. It's natural for men to be sexually aggressive and to get what they want. It's natural for girls to be sexually passive and select based on what comes to them.<br><br>Seeing two girls being playful sends the message that they're sexually open. This is natural and desirable.<br><br>Seeing two guys being playful sends the message that they're both submissive twinks. These men unnatural and undesirable.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm glad you're so intimidated by me that you feel the need to puff yourself up with big-boy phrases like that. <br><br>You're obviously just shitting all over everything at this point so I'm going to leave you to it.</br></br></br>  <br>Sure, Freud. Consider retaking Psych 101.</br>  <br>This except sexual openness is only seen as desirable (and therefore 'natural', never the other way around) once you add for the parameter of a sufficient degree of desperation in the population of men being observed for preference.<br><br>Men who are not desperate (n.b. that having access to a lot of mates in men does not necessarily negate the possibility of desperation due to overarching sociological parameters) react to lesbians the same way women react to effeminate men, with disgust, either explicit or implicit. The opposite of effeminacy in men is sluttiness in women.</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks anon that's all I wanted to hear</br>  <br>fuck</br>  <br>'natural' is an ignorant concept. Anything that happens on Earth is natural. Literally everything has a cause and effect.</br>  <br>Witnessed</br>  <br>Fearful of the 'downfall' of men. Sounds like you're just fearful, because you're threatened by your own sexual desires.</br>  <br> implying I haven't already bookmarked it and am currently listening to it <br> implying I don't intend to listen to all of them <br>I'm just saying I feel like most of the professors there are actually worthy of the title.</br></br></br>  <br> Anything that happens on Earth is natural. <br>False. That would mean that what is particularly unnatural is somehow natural.<br><br>That's not a negation of the idea of nature, it's literally just a refusal to allow it to mean what it means.<br><br>Natural means efficient, not simply 'that which occurs in nature'. Not everything which occurs in nature (happens on Earth/in the universe) is logically efficient, so not everything is natural.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Witnessed</br>  <br><br>'Natural: existing in or caused by nature; not made or caused by humankind'.<br><br>By which definition does 'natural' mean 'efficient'?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I know a few actually bi girls, although one now says shes a lesbian. I also know a couple of lesbians who have fucked men.</br>  <br>Its tough to find professors worthy of that title given that you can be an autistic recluse who gets a phd then be expected to teach, that given, 1/5 lectureres are still excellent. <br>Intelligence breeds entertainment apparently</br></br>  Women are more naturally bi. Deal with it.  <br>That isnt even true, i refer you again to evolutionary biology and the science behind reproduction.</br>  <br>yo this needs sauce</br>  <br>Dictionary definitions just use the most commonly understood definition not the actual definition.<br><br>Aristotle first defined the idea of nature as efficiency but we have admittedly lost track of that truth in the recent century. All philosophers up until the late 18th century pretty clearly understood that 'natural' didn't simply signify 'that which exists in nature'.<br><br>You don't need a dictionary though, it just makes sense. If natural meant 'that which exists in nature', then, like you pointed out, everything in existence would therefore be natural, and the word would therefore have no real meaning because, as I pointed out, what is unnatural would also be natural. It's a basic contradiction. You cannot say 'well then 'unnatural' doesn't exist' because if a word has no opposite then it is necessarily tautological, meaningless. And if a word truly were meaningless, it simply would not exist at all.<br><br>The word natural obviously does exist, as you can see I just used it in this sentence (we're talking about the basic actual word, the literal concatenation of letters, not the idea), so it has real meaning, and it therefore means 'efficient', because, as we've just proven, it can't just mean 'that which exists in nature'.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> you can be an autistic recluse who gets a phd then be expected to teach <br><br>It's funny how we're supposed to trust 'experts' when the majority of them are completely in their heads and out of touch with reality.<br><br>Thomas Sowell, one of the better ones, wrote a book about it.<br> https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ER<wbr>j3QeGw9Ok</wbr>  [ ] </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just because Aristotle posited the idea, it doesn't make it so. Have any modern scientists likened 'natural' to 'efficiency'?<br><br>Also, can't the word 'unnatural' simply be an intrinsically faulty concept?</br></br></br>  <br>This isn't true. I had a friend back in high school who i was very "Playfully bisexual" with. Many people couldn't tell if we were just weird guys or some cray gay couple</br>  <br>Thanks for the post anon, watching it now</br>  <br>http://Rebecca19.jotamax.com<br><br> Live NOW <br>FREE</br></br></br></br>  <br>There were a couple of guys like that in my brother's class at school too. At least one of them is openly bi now though</br>  <br>The questions you're asking me clearly indicate that you comprehended little in the way of what I wrote.<br><br>I explained exactly why and how the word natural. can't mean anything other than 'efficient'. If you actually read and understood my post you would realise that.<br><br>I also answered why the word unnatural cannot simply be an intrinsically fault concept. There is simply no such thing in natural language. If a word is inherently meaningless it simply doesn't exist.<br><br>Mathematics is already the language which is inherently devoid of real meaning. There is no room in natural language for an intrinsically meaningless word to exist.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What year?</br>  <br>Class of 06. Im in England</br>  <br>Do you know if the other ever came out as bi or maybe gay?</br>  <br>If everything is natural, why does the word exist?</br>  Some one kik me... johnmcnal<br>im super horny and id really want to see guys girls or trannies</br>  What's your ranking for races in order of sexiness?

Insta rage, building collapses.</br>  <br>What so the bitch can go into cardiac arrest from the work? I wouldn't test that because I'll let the bitch die</br>  <br>It's not inaccurate, but if any feminazi saw it they'd be screaming patriarchy</br>  <br>OMFG HAHAHAHAHGAGAGH</br>  <br><br>and he said "thou shalt be dubs" and it was so</br></br>  <br>I agree 100% You can think whatever the fuck you want and all that, but when it crosses over into actively deceiving people into thinking you're something you ain't, THAT'S wrong. Pre/post op. I don't care. You're a man.</br>  <br>this is bullshit and you know it<br><br> majority of rapes are commited by men <br> most rapes are commited by men <br><br>only men can rape, stupid misogynist pig trying to spew his bullshit, go die in a fire</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>lol op got told on twitter and needs confirmation now from xis "/b/ros"</br>  <br>Gross.</br>  <br>this is why men should arm themselves with pepper spray in one pocket and iron knuckles in the other</br>  <br>Is that a Euro thing?

Dat f-body. Never seen a Taco in one.</br>  <br>Yeah it's british, but I got it in Sweden a few times.</br>  <br>No, the feminists would look at the corridor and proclaim that it insults them in some way, stand outside of it and proclaim that this side of the corridor is now the better and most desirable side, but also that the corridor is shit and should be widened by men to allow for real women to get through, but don't worry, this side is the better side anyway, nothing good will be down there, but you better fucking open it up.</br>  <br>i know bro, but when i first started seeing this shit i couldnt believe it either<br><br>everything will be ok</br></br></br>  <br>I agree I may be bi but traps make me want to puke.</br>  <br>You're oppressing womynz by being gay</br>    <br>topest kek</br>    <br>this is from a satire site</br>  <br>It's okay, I checked.

Right now they're just amusing.</br></br>    spending 78k on policing how men sit  <br>We don't respect you</br>  <br>Anon this is not a YRYL thread</br>  <br>So if I go in and claim I'm actually a woman they can't do shit?</br>  <br>Best thing to do when you see that shit is just go inside and make yourself at home. Even if you are a straight guy. Seriously they can't do shit about it.</br>  <br>Anon, this is a feminazi hate thread. It pretty much is YRYL</br>    <br>the problem is they already are in places of power just not gov positions<br><br>just take a look at the media with false rapes being reported as true with no investigation e.g. matress girl and the uva rape<br><br>also look at how they teared down tim hunt for a joke</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>With no losing :^)<br>Only the feminists lose by merely existing.</br></br>  <br>kek</br>  <br>gender is a social construct mein jude. you can be whatever you want to be. just claim that you are a trans-woman, pgp she/her/they, and they will accept you with open arms</br>  <br> female programmer <br>never fucking again<br>we had this one chick on team, she was so stupid it hurt<br>got in because she was fucking our manager<br><br>she had some bullshit degree and that was it<br>no experience with anything, kept asking how to do basic things yet she tried doing more complicated shit on her own<br><br>in the end we had to fucking redo anything she even touched<br><br>never fucking again</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>      <br>We just have to infiltrate these spaces<br>Out number them and claim they trigger us and boots them out</br></br>    ITT 4chan users can't tell when fake convo's are created in order to debase feminism... i'm the first to jump at an attempt to laugh at feminists but this is sad      <br>how fucking weak and delicate our fucking society is now where literally everything insults someone. 80 years ago we wouldn't have to have put up with shit like this. Jesus guys, what the fuck happened.</br>  <br>Gays cannot marry in religion because they can't get pregnant and shit out kids</br>  <br>Sounds like the feminazis are treating each other like severely autistic children who can't handle loud noises.</br>  <br>Cool 9gag watermark on that pic faggot</br>  <br>many girls wear fedoras</br>  <br>I thought 9gag didn't allow anything that might offend someone (except for white men, of course)</br>    <br>They say you lose an argument when you compare someone to HItler. I say though, you also lose all arguments when you ACTUALLY ACT LIKE HITLER. Or a Bible-banging redneck. Or Maoist China. Or Kim Il Jongsun.</br>      <br>haha</br>  <br>This looks shooped, but if not...<br><br>lulz</br></br></br>  <br>we should amend that internet law</br>  <br>A PSA to women: If you think you might be fat, you are fat. Stop asking.</br>  <br>I'd put it more aptly like this:<br>You lose an argument when someone can clearly make a connection between your ideology and actions, with those of Hitler's. And hitler was pretty much the biggest redneck bible basher there was. Except he hated the jews.</br></br>  <br> I don't want to have to lower my standards <br> Everyone else should lower their standards so I don't have to </br></br>  <br>It's your spelling that's inadequate.</br>  <br>What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little rape apologist? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in Social Justice 101, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on r/creepshots, and I have over 300 confirmed instances of saying "check your privilege". I am trained in being overly offended and I’m the top SRSer in the entire social justice blogosphere. You are nothing to me but just another shitlord. I will call you a neckbeard with persistence the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, cis-sexist pig. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of differently-abled, ethnic, transqueer womyn across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the AC360 investigation, *aggot. The investigation that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your erotic subreddit. You’re fucking privileged, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can complain about you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in arguing with shitlords, but I have access to the entire arsenal of Jezebel.com and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your privileged bigotry off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “sexist” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will passive-aggressively type fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, cis scum.</br>  <br> Gender Roles <br> Unnatural <br><br>Holy fucking shit, they no nothing</br></br></br></br>    <br>rape is love</br>  <br>if you dont click on it it looks like her leg is comeing out of the back of her head</br>  http://Rebecca19.jotamax.com<br><br> Live NOW <br>FREE</br></br></br>  Ask a girl who performed her first blowjob last night anything.
