Just another fat neck beard that scared of advancement because he won't own women in his hose hold like they're slaves</br>  <br>When was America ever socialist?<br><br>The only socialist thing they ever did was give free education to war vets after World War 2, and it was a RESOUNDING success. It created two generations of absolutely unparalleled economic strength and scientific growth, with tons of social progression tempered by logic.<br><br>Now USA has become borderline anti-education, with Republicans implying, and all but outright saying that education is "snobby" while jacking up the cost of a degree. All the while our generation is suffering economically. Those of us who are working make more money than our parents, but we aren't generating wealth because there's an enormous cost to owning anything, and we have a mountain of debt for our education and training.<br><br>If anything, that proves socialism is super fucking viable.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I vote republican because I want less of my tax dollars going to idiots on welfare with 7 kids that are pretending to look for work to keep getting all of their bills paid by the government. There is no saving these people and it would be better that they starved if they refuse to contribute to society. The world is getting too populated to waste resources on people willing to contribute nothing.</br>  <br>There is 2 problems with US politics.<br>1) Dinosaurs (either party) There are too many old fucks that just don't understand technology and social problems... and they FUCKING HATE change.<br>2) Too many politicians have become corrupt. They all take money from big business. All of their influence is coming from mega rich companies. The people no longer have a voice.<br><br>So really it comes down to.... Who is less greedy?? Big brother, or Wall street...<br><br>But guess what... wall street owns the media and the politicians.. so its not even a fair fight. We just. get. fucked</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So rather than giving your money to poor people so they can take care of their kids, you'd give it to rich people so they can hide it in overseas banks or foreign investments so the American public never sees a dime of it again, all the while paying less taxes than you, or said poor family?<br><br>Americans are so fucking stupid. You're an absolute moron.</br></br></br>  <br><br> I want less of my tax dollars going to idiots on welfare with 7 kids that are pretending to look for work to keep getting all of their bills paid by the government <br><br> There is no saving these people and it would be better that they starved if they refuse to contribute to society <br><br>Only retards like you assume that welfare goes towards people like this all the time. I've worked with people on welfare in my high school job, and they're the hardest working people I have ever met.<br><br>They work 5am-6pm, much more than your fat lazy as would work.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You realize helping the poor stimulates the economy right?</br>  <br>There should legitimately be an age limit on politicians. They shouldn't be allowed to run if they are over 60 or under 30.<br><br>They should also have an income cap. If they make over a million dollars they should not be allowed to continue office. Someone who makes more money than 99% of the population of a country cannot viably represent them, because they simply can't see things from their perspective. They can't know the same suffering or understand their plight. Many of these politicians haven't really worked a day in their life.</br></br></br>  <br><br> The only socialist thing they ever did was give free education to war vets after World War 2, and it was a RESOUNDING success. It created two generations of absolutely unparalleled economic strength and scientific growth, with tons of social progression tempered by logic. <br><br>Nigga, are you forgetting Roosevelt/Rockerfeller?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Too bad "those people" are the people living on the extremely low minimum wage thanks to republicans backing buisnesses that want to underpay workers and over pay the higher ups so shit stays the way it does</br>  <br>It never went full socialist. Thats why its the SURVIVING empire from the twentieth century.</br>  <br>same goes for democrats</br>  If you think this bitch was enlightening, you're retarded.  not every person on welfare works hard and not every person on welfare milks it. Some people use it as a stepping stone and some use at as a way of life. Not all anything is bad. Repubs, Dems, each have good ideas and mean well most of the time. The problems lies with each person either being someone who wants to better themselves of be a leeching piece of shit. The only thing we should all agree on is the bigger the government the worse off this country gets.  <br> Not all anything is bad. <br>Right?!? I sometimes use meth to help me stay awake to work 48 call shifts as a doctor. It's not ideal, but it gets the job done.</br></br>  <br>Most of the EU is older than the USA as independent nations, and most of them are surviving and thriving now save for Portugal, Spain, and Greece. <br><br>Meanwhile the rest of the world can see, clear as day, that USA is faltering because of the far Right wing lobby machine and the Republicans it controls. USA simply can't see it through their sickening nationalism and misplaced pride.</br></br></br>  <br> [Update] [Auto] 2 new posts <br>moderation is the key</br></br>  <br>Correct.<br>there is greed at every level. But a single mom with 7 kids doesn't draw 100 million a year in tax breaks... but greedy stock holders and business owners do. Do you think they are ever going to stop that shit without government involvement? Which is the easier problem to fix here... let the poor have their food stamps and budget education and housing? or let the corporations bleed this country dry.</br></br>  The wealthy benefit from both political parties.<br>Nobody benefits from socialism.</br>  <br><br>I'm not saying every idiot is a Democrat, only that every Democrat is an idiot. Sure the republicans have their share of religious nutjobs, but at least the majority of the party is trying to fix the damage done by Democrats who seem to be hellbent on ruining the country they live in.</br></br>    <br>Is that why china is quickly catching up to our economy?</br>  <br>But will you pay a billion dollars in taxes you're going to get millions in a tax break. The best way to get a major corp is to not shop there. every major corp started as a Mom and Pop shop. they just had better marketing ideas and pushed name recognition better. The government should stop at the front door. They should build our roads, run our army, thats it.</br>  <br>but when you pay....goddamn it</br>  <br>If they work that many hours and still on welfare they're stupid and deserve to starve on the pennies the government gives to them.</br>  <br><br>Please do. These are all good reasons to vote democrat.</br></br>    Mfw libfags don't realize the dems are utilizing modern day slavery with welfare and big government. The dems never changed to the party for the people. Welching off hard working Americans and wealth distribution does nothing to make this country great. Forward thinking huh lol  <br>Sure thing Nacy Pelosi talking points</br>  <br>this, but being less of an asshole about it</br>  <br><br>When you are talking about the eastern block: what failed was the authoritarian socialist approach. The libertarian socialist approach is something completely different.</br></br>  <br>What about socialist democracy? Like Sweden?</br>  <br>The left is made up of people who cannot create wealth.<br>We are talking about welfare queens and trust-fund socialists.<br>People who don't even understand work.<br>In their world-view wealth is not created by effort, it can only be stolen, which is what they are trying to do.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Or the democrats that spend trillions on failed companies making our money worthless.</br>  <br>Conservatism is better than liberalism in every single way.<br>Name ANY issue and I can show how how.</br></br>  <br>Believe me... if i had a choice in what fuel i had to buy, or what banks I have to use, or what medicine I could buy...

I vote based on doing whatever is opposite of whatever mommy and daddy think. I'm such an individual and free thinker. Huffington Post told me that all republicans are evil rich white racist homophobe biblethumping males, so I hate them just like I'm instructed to do.  amazing how literally all the republican replies in this thread are exactly like the left guy in the picture:<br><br>"i vote republican because of non-existant bogeyman trumped up to scare me into voting republican!"<br><br>"socialists" are the people living totally normal lives in northern europe.<br>"welfare queens" are poor people trying to get by.<br>"queers" are dudes that like madonna.<br><br>These are the people you're afraid of.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br><br>That's fine.

My argument still stands.</br></br>  <br>Democrats are just as corrupt</br>  republicans are vastly superior in their thinking than you nerds lmao  Kiwi here. <br><br>Republicans fucked up right from the Donald trump.

I cannot wait.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>now that's what i call edgy.<br><br>yes there's corruption in both parties. no, they are not fucking equivalent. republicans are stridently and proudly pro-corporation. democrats will often push back and it's only the worst of them (lieberman) that are totally on the take.<br><br>no, that doesn't give you an excuse for withdrawing form the process and proclaiming your superiority. that just makes you complicit in the outcome. <br><br>go vote.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yes, the AIDS-addled liberal brain would think that way</br>  <br>Nah dude. You're just dumb. Republicans may be evil, but Democrats are downright delusional retards. It might make sense in your head, but that's not reality, is it?</br>  <br> how how <br>liberal confirmed true conservatives only need one how.</br></br>  <br>Republicans are red Democrats are blue neither of them gives a fuck about you.</br>  <br>go back to your shit hole /pol/</br>  <br>Because leftist economic policies don't work. Look at Detroit, then look at Houston.</br>  <br> you think it's bad that blacks are aborting at 5 times the rate of whites and wish their families weren't in ruins <br> you are racist <br><br>typical liberal logic</br></br></br></br>  <br>for state representatives, it's one of the worst jobs you could choose if you were in it for the money. they couldn't make more than, say $20,000 per year off of being a politician.</br>  <br>Even if dems are running the schools, the reps are lobbying to under fund the schools. You can't run an effective education system when you don't have more budget to subsidize it. Money should be taken from the military and put into the education system.</br>  <br> democrats preten to push back <br><br>Ftfy. They just bet on different horses than republicans and then lie saying their backing this billion dollar corporation for the environment or whatever. Don't be such a dumbass.</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Less people paying into the government <br>the top 10% of earner pay over %50 of fed taxes... no one will notice a difference</br></br>  <br>Implying you are going to go pick your own damn food out of the fields. In fact, you would rather KILL the people trying to do that job.</br>  <br>human life has no value other than evolutionary. go back to church, christfag.</br>  <br>No, dipshit. The problem is teachers unions fucking everything up. Democrats think you can fix everything by throwing money at it.</br>  <br><br>if you're so interested in reducing the abortion rate, do you vote to subsidize contraceptives and sex ed? as has been overwhelmingly proven to reduce the rate of teen pregnancy and abortion? (e.g. the law passed in colorado a few years ago that did exactly that.)<br><br>oh, you don't? weird. i wonder how i guessed that.</br></br></br></br>  Can't wait to jizz on America's tombstone.  <br> but that's not reality, is it? <br>When I take facts, evidence, and statistics to form my point of view then it is reality.<br><br>I step away from the delusional and only look at facts and what is tried and tested.<br><br>Tried and tested Republican ideals do not work throughout history or they create terrible living conditions. Liberal ideas across the world have high quality of living and work.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Whatever makes you sleep at night,<br>You, again, just put down the blacks as a race. I have not, and did not say it was bad. I am saying its good. They know they are making the right responsible decision.</br></br>  Kinda sucks being a liberal, but not a socialist. Liberals think you're not hardcore enough on fiscal issues, and conservatives think you want to give everything to the government.  <br>I grow my own produce, beaner. And I pick it without turning my neighborhood into a crime riddled ghetto.</br>  <br>But that is horseshit. Again, 20k per pupil and a 50% graduation rate.<br>Your 'hurr durr, throw more money at it' way of thinking is dumb.</br></br>  ITT: People dont know what socialism is  <br> human life has no value <br> I vote liberal because we're more caring <br>LOL, retard.</br></br></br>  <br>Being conservative is great. Being a republican is stupid.</br>  <br>Here he goes with the delusions again...<br>Who has the biggest gdp in the world again? Seriously. Get rid of the shitskins and America would own any country in everything. They're where all the fat and stupid and violent comes from.</br></br>  <br>Not that Americans care but to the rest of the world socialists,Nazi Germany, are right wing and communist are left, USSR</br>  <br>How in the sweet fuck is social security socialist, when the country keeps borrowing against it to bail out insurance companies, the automotive industry, and banks? How in the sweet fuck does social security benefit people when most people in our generation won't ever even be able to collect it?<br><br>It may have started off socialist, but it was ruined by capitalism. That's not a proper "socialist experiment" if the experiment is fucking sabotaged.</br></br></br>  <br>You're wrong about Colorado, of course. The teen pregnancy rate fell nationally, and demographically, Colorado was exactly where one would have predicted.<br>Just curious: there is more sex ed and more easily available contraceptives today than in 1970. Is the illegitimate birth rate lower? The abortion rate? No?</br></br>  <br><br>"hurr durr both sides do it" (except not in equal measure at all...)<br><br>i live in a city where the local democrats reliably do things that help me personally, like increasing the minimum wage. your ignorant, comfortable cynicism isn't going to talk me out of facts.</br></br></br></br>  Looks at the failed european socialist states. Do you actually want the US to become anything like them? Look at how gay marriage has coerupted our morals and how its ruined our quality of life. Dems want to raise minimum wage but thise people can easily work harder and go to school to make more money.  <br>Wow, so does my grandma.<br>Now lets talk about those clothes you are weaking, house you are living in, car you are driving.<br>Did you make those too? No, beaners did</br></br></br>  <br>i never said liberals were more caring. nice straw man, politifag. i said that human life has no more value than any other. if you can run over a squirrel on the road, you can get an abortion.</br>  <br> blacks are aborting their babies at 5 times the white rate <br> I think that's great <br> because I am not racist <br>kek</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, 50 years of democrat policies turned Detroit into a Utopia.</br>  <br>So why vote at all, and for what party?</br>  <br>It really is a wonderland. They solved the overcrowding problem. When the GOP ran it, 2.2 million people lived there. Since Dems took over, the population dropped to 700k.</br>  <br>Liberals live in fantasy.</br>  <br>Nah, chinks did. Mexicans can't make anything but fall down prefabs and crime.</br>  <br>Before gays could get married I had a great life. Now I have a box. How I posted this is unknown probably was telepathically lifted from my mind by some gay gypsy faggot nigger.</br>  <br>Yeah, I know. Each side accuses you of being part of the other one.</br>  <br>If you don't vote you might not enjoy that flavor of corporate shit. Atleast one is more appealing while you try and fix the system.</br>    <br>Conservatives live in fear.</br>  <br>Wasted trips.</br>  <br>yea just like greece</br>  They are so retarded that that the democrats can feel better about themselves to be slightly less retarded.<br>But in reality they are equally as retarded.<br><br> 2015 <br> Thinking that voting changes things </br></br></br></br>    <br>exactly. there's no point in voting, because the only people who are actually voting are people who didn't vote in the generation previous. and by that, i mean younger demographics only get to change what they want to around fourty years too late. too many old people voting with their shitty opinions ruins the country for us right now.</br>  <br><br>uh, no. colorado's state ranking for teen births fell, which means they improved relative to the national average rather than tracking with it.<br><br>source:<br>http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_2<wbr>6085784/colorado-teen-birth-rates-d<wbr>rop-state-hands-out<br><br>and the abortion rate is in fact lower than it was in the 70s (excluding pre-legalization, which is impossible to compare because there wasn't good reporting on illegal abortions). source:<br><br>http://www.guttmacher.org/media/nr/<wbr>2014/02/03/<br><br>... but keep it up with the straw men, you're doing great.</br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fear that I'll be charged for blowing a burglar to bits due to liberal bullshit? Maybe.</br>  <br>not an answer, edgelord</br>   My first day with politics   <br>Dubs of truth.</br>  Another pointless thread. yay?...  <br>Typical conservative response. Since they cannot think as fast or reason as well, they simply mimic.</br>  <br>every conservative president in the last 60 years has pushed the US into more debt. every single time.</br>  <br>LOL, no.<br> We need a totalitarian nanny state and a massive social welfare system because YOU guys are afraid. <br>kek</br></br></br>  <br> being this fearful and living in fantasy </br>  <br><br>I don't live in detroit. I live in a city that's doing great, like most of the big cities in the US, almost all of which are run by democrats.<br><br>Detroit is extremely atypical and there's a long list of reasons why it has problems, none of which are "but the mayor is a democrat."<br><br>anecdotes are not statistics.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Failed socialist experiment? Like public schools, roads and bridges and grants to medical research? Or maybe you're talking about public parks or the water supply that feeds every city and town?</br>  The whole immigration debate is an example of how sheepish the public is. The politicians get their minions to be pro-immigration because it's the right thing to do. It's fair. And that makes you feel good. Immigrants are hard working people and they just want to come here to seek the American dream. Etc. Retard peasants eat that shit up. Meanwhile, the politicians are for immigration because they want millions upon millions of poor people coming here because they will be zombies for the government. They aren't coming here for jobs. They are coming here to feed off of the enormous tit of free shit that the government hands out. Food stamps, healthcare, and tons of other shit - the government will just give it to you. And who do you think these people are going to vote for? Democrats of course. So of course they are for it. That's the problem of a republic with democratically elected representatives where every dipshit gets a vote - the job of a politician is to stay in office. They do that by making a majority of their constituents happy.
