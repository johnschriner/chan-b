You can make the choice at first, and make mistakes like everyone, and then not be allowed to redeem yourself. On top of that, there are situations where you're unable to get out of poverty with your own actions. This is a very common misconception with the american people, americans are gifted most of what they have. People like that tend to want to justify it knowing full well they earned nothing. <br>To answer your question I don't have kids because it's expensive, I prefer free time vs work time. Doing so I can afford to live off a night stocking position comfortably so long as I don't take a wife/gf that doesn't have a job. Also, kids are too easy to fuck up and I don't feel competent enough at this point in my life to raise one. I'd rather first do no harm before putting myself in a position to do harm.</br></br>  celeb nude thread go<br>God tier edition</br>  <br><br>Fair enough.<br><br>Now I want to cum in your mouth though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Good thing I'm bi then.</br>  <br><br>And you swallow, right?</br></br></blockquote>]
