'Leisure' makes me think more of having a nap than someone banging sheep.</br>  <br>It would be a pleasure to enjoy some leisure with you.</br>  I'm thinking of emigrating to NZ or OZ from Europe but undecided.<br><br>I've only ever been to the North Island and Auckland seems like every other major city I've lived and worked in but what is it like?

Auckland is fucking massive, its a dumping ground of immigrants from the pacific islands, Asians and basically everywhere else<br><br>Wellington is a hipster city, generally a lot quieter as a lot less people. i'm originally from wellington so its prob my nostalgia but i would say wellington is the best NZ city.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>nice 2 bro</br>  <br>this is actually a much more fun way to bump the thread than typing "good thread"<br><br>check em</br></br></br>  i work in a bank ama  <br>how is burger king treating you?</br>  <br>give us a loan?<br>i pinky promise i'll pay it back</br></br>  <br>i remember when i was a bank wanker</br>  <br>gimme my monies</br>  Lower hutt here  <br>can you hook us up with some cheap money?</br>  <br>me home town<br>whats it been like? <br>anything happening there recently?<br>any shootings in naenae or wainui?</br></br></br></br>  <br>yep</br>  <br>Nah not realy its chilled out a little. Upperhutt had a mass axe muder a while ago</br>  <br>Who are you?</br>  <br>South island is beautiful but fuck it's slow down here. Christchurch might be your best bet if you wanted to be south island based but I'd probably head to Wellington<br><br>Auckland is a sprawling cesspit and filled with cunts who think the rest of New Zealand is backwards.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>is it possible?</br></br></br>  <br>Pro tip drive through is quicker.<br><br><br>what's your credit rating like?<br><br><br>What did you do?<br><br><br>Call up the bank, have terrible connection for like 20minutes. Call back a week later and say you were charged $25 because you called from overseas and they put you on hold for 20 minutes.<br><br><br>For home loans interest rates are dropping down 0.25% on the 27th, imo wait 6 months before you fix.<br><br>If you're a student you can get $1,000-$2,000 overdraft at 0%. if you want a personal loan check out interest co nz. walk into the branch and say X bank offered me this rate (11.00-13.95%) can you match that so i don't have to switch.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Pro tip drive through is quicker <br>was talking about the burger king in wellington that is in an old bank building.<br><br>because you said you work in a bank. not at a bank.</br></br></br></br>  <br>uhh my credit rating?<br>i paid my student loan twice in the 2 weeks i worked at maccas last month<br>is that good enough?</br></br></br>  <br>Dat filename tho</br>  <br>All round nz is sweet it all looks sexy but depends what you like. Mountains skiing and tramping. Go south. For a larger population and more farms and shit go north. Im from the north but the south is fucking beautiful. Wellington is a awesome city</br>  <br>Which bank you slut?</br>  <br> december 2014 <br>fuck that was a month before i moved out of the hutt</br></br>  <br>used to suck off the manager</br>  <br>LOL FUCK. thanks for explaining that, it's good joke. I'm from auckland but i should have known.<br><br><br>yeah you're sweet. Credit ratings only get fucked if you apply for heaps of shit at different places.<br>make sure you tell the bank you have a legit reason for the loan. If you're concerned you're broke we average out the last 3 months of your income/expenses, try lower your expenses for that 3 months. Don't withdraw cash, gamble or spent heaps on useless shit for 3 months before you apply.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ANZ</br>  <br>Good evening<br>Chch</br></br>    <br>is it time to just start believing without the need for a timestamp.</br>  <br>I dunno. You can believe or disbelieve, these pics are from earlier today / yesterday. Just sharing 'cause bored and drying my hair.</br>  <br>yup. Sadly this is becoming a usual thing</br>  <br>what would it take for you to let me get my dick up in that ass</br>  <br>I want to believe</br>  <br>Yeah the guy was on pee and thought his mates were shit talking him my mates dad was first on the sceen he said it was really fucked up</br>  <br>where are the other 17 photos and why did you save that one twice?</br>  <br>Nice</br>  <br><br>Your panties changed colour and style.<br><br>In my spare time I'm a detective. Nothing slips past me</br></br></br></br>  <br>I like that cat</br>    Time to eat a whole mudcake MYSELF.  <br>I didn't save it twice, the site overlapped the same name, didn't bother to change it.<br><br><br><br><br><br>How's this?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>post pics</br>    <br>Are you sad Nigger Flag?</br>  <br>ok<br>lets see how good you are<br><br>was 9/11 an inside job?</br></br></br></br>    <br>No can do. Already begun.<br><br>Nah why?</br></br></br>  <br>Your story checks out ma'am<br><br>Not what my research indicates</br></br></br>  <br>Now that's a woman, my goal body.</br>    <br>Much better. do you have any other features?</br>  <br> Is there a massive difference from the north/south? Or just Auckland vs Wellington? <br>Wellington is much cosier, as is most of the country minus Christchurch city, although a guy I know reckoned he saw at least as many homeless people there as in Auckland, surprisingly enough. Chch is more or less a smaller Auckland I think. It's flat and earthquake damaged and I wouldn't recommend it unless a construction job is your thing. Auckland is congested, suburban, not very pretty architecturally, and full of Indians/Asians/Islanders. What kind of work are you planning on looking for BTW?</br></br>  <br> Nah why? <br>whole mudcake to yourself</br></br>    <br>I.. Guess I have boobs etc. I am overweight though (for now), so it depends what you're into.</br>  <br><br>Jesus</br></br>  <br>staph</br>  <br>You have a staph infection? You should get help</br>  <br>"for now".... what is this just a "phase"?</br>  <br>post pic of your pussy</br>  <br>Nah I'm in the midst of losing it. 6 (almost 7) kgs down so far</br>  <br>Just hungry for mudcake is all. I got it cheap from pak n save coz it was a few days old.</br>  <br>just take pictures anyway. I want to see it before its inside you</br>  <br>Auckland is pretty shit, you need a car to do anything, it's pretty expensive to buy a house and shit.<br><br>Wellington is mint, really cool if you're a young and hipster. gets cold and during the holidays you can see all the homeless people.<br><br>Chch is pretty shit since quekes.<br><br><br>What's your weight/height? you look alright in that photo but i feel like you're arching, I'd bang you if you were naked on my bed.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>kek</br>  <br>Anon I....</br>  FRI NIGH MFERS  <br>would you be into "netflix and chill" with a lovable chubby guy</br>  <br>Oh. Good job anon. Keep it up.</br>  <br>Arching back slightly to remove any sign of my face from the shot, this is a better pic (kinda)</br>  i wish i was out clubbing...  <br>Can we see the etc?</br>  <br><br> i would say wellington is the best NZ city <br>I'd second this, Wellington &amp; Dunedin are objectively the best two cities to live in.</br></br></br>  <br>O also weight/height is 5 foot 6, 74 kg<br><br>Someone wanted pussy.. I'm terrible at pussy shots.</br></br></br>    <br>post pussy or gtfo</br>  <br>moarrrr</br>  <br>Don't start what you can't finish.</br>  sail sail sail  <br>Oh yeah that's true picture. how much do you weigh?<br><br>If your face is clear you're doable.<br><br><br>Looks good. i'm 5.8 and 64kgs. strange how just a few more can look like a lot</br></br></br></br></br></br>  ready or nahhh...  <br>I am like 5.7 and 60kilos. I am not fat. can 5kg really make that much of a difference?</br>  <br>you could go murder someone that what they do there</br>  <br>come and get it</br>  <br>shitty closeup of me wet.<br><br><br> strange how just a few more can look like a lot <br>I've found it doesn't sit well on me either so I look a lot heavier than some others my weight. But also you're taller than me, so your weight to height ratio is somewhat better</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you post a lot on tinder and have you lived in Wellington?<br><br><br>I'm suggesting I'm skinny looking compared.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I want to let you guys know I did something similar last year with some other anon<br><br>pic related was the result<br><br><br>bruh</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br>eagermess is hotter than what ever your weight is<br>the simple act of posting pics shows willingness.</br></br></br>  <br>Nope and nope<br><br><br>One time of me doing this ended up something like that. It was enjoyable.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, it's not original, but it's something to do.</br>  <br>Great tits. Would fuck/10.<br><br>I'd like to pretend I work with you. Where do you work?</br></br></br>  <br>was gud homie?</br>  <br>would go to town on that pussy</br>  <br>Seriously though you don't look overweight.</br>  <br>I don't do fulltime work at the moment, shit going on in my life.
