Nope. Been wishing I'd just die in my sleep for years now. Depression is a bitch.  took two 230V hit at word today so fuck no, i'm not happy  <br><br>oh yes .. those lovely lovely nights</br></br>  Nah.<br><br>I have about $300 to my name and once I fuck all of that off, I'm shooting myself in the head.</br></br>  <br>Yeah<br><br>Just kidding lmfao</br></br></br>  <br>not really man every time i take a step forward something sets me right back even farther fml man not enough time or money</br>  not really. Kinda wish i would be in a car crash or some shit like a freak accident at work, just don't wanna suicide cus family nd shit.  As a visionary working in what i love yes.<br><br>As an extremely emotionally disturbed person no.</br></br>  fuck no  I had a really weird dream this morning, I went back to sleep after getting some cereal and was having a dream where I had to anal-rape my sister really violently because she needed discipline. I also punched her face really hard (broke her nose) and throat fucked her. I have been a bit emotionally scarred since I woke up today..<br><br> I am unsure if it would be better to have died overnight and not awoken</br></br>  everyday before bed time i make a wish that i wont wake up :/  <br>I woke up at 1 in the afternoon</br>  well .. least we know why we come here  No, but one of these days im gonna be happy.<br><br>I'm gonna have a good body and a good woman in my bed. I'm gonna be happy one day. I promise myself this.</br></br>  <br>she wants the D</br>  No  Fuck no. I sleep for 4 hours tops, and when I wake up at around 5 or 6 am I feel like shit.  <br>I am trying to think like that, but it's hard.</br>  <br>More than I was a week ago. Before that more than I was a month ago. Fallout 4 is about the only thing keeping me from suicide.

How to Build a Massive Load  g6483035@trbvm.com  I walk through the grassy plains, the air cool and crisp as I walk down the dirt path, the clouds cover the sun from time to time as it helped me not worry about sweating on my trip to Golden Corral. The tall grass rustles as I was jumped and pinned down by a large Snake Anthro (a naga if you consider it, I don't like the human half of those therefor I say Snake Anthro). She giggles to me as her long body gently caressed and curled around me, lightly constricting me.<br> "Hey there, sexy." <br>She gently moaned to me, us meeting eye to eye as she licks my face up the side slowly.<br> "I was getting so~ hungry out here." <br>She blushes as her underbelly rubs against my groin gently, she was in heat and already dripping.<br> "Would you care to help me sate my lustful belly~?" <br>She moans into my ear lightly, her drool gently coating my neck as I blush. She began to grind her hips against me.<br>(Will continue if asked, it's vore but it get's hot)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Bertoia Diamond Chair  <br>thanks, richfag</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=IQ7<wbr>5Ent60ik</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;626192148   Peace Hame  https://<span>youtu.be/Fz_mm_0fUvk  [ ]  99999999999999999999999999999999999<wbr>99999999999999999999999999999999999<wbr>99999999999999999999999999999999999<wbr>99999999999999999999999999999999999<wbr>99999999999999999999999</wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=nNr<wbr>7EkiNNt0</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>私の心が痛い</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=s_D<wbr>Lb27eknE</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>   </br>  Naturally, i have better pics, but i posted these to make them seem properly creepy  Kegal Muscles  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=vVk<wbr>DrIacHJM</wbr>  [ ]  <br>50% male, 50% female</br>  <br>http://www.cnet.com/news/how-to-sur<wbr>vive-with-only-one-usb-c-port-on-yo<wbr>ur-new-macbook/</wbr></wbr></br>  <a href="http://i.4cdn.org/b/1436200594683.webm" target="_blank">http://i.4cdn.org/b/1436200594683.w<wbr>ebm</wbr></a>  I was in English class and we had to write and essay about government conspiracies because English class and I said jet fuel can't melt steal beams and I blew my teachers mind and my friend turns to me and says "so is that true or is it just an Internet joke"  7yfxb536dv17<br>Was a padlet link from last night...

I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit.

Judaism  <br><br>Wrong boyz the answer was OP</br></br>  Your face  <br>Feminism</br>  Yeah, I guess it is mutilation, but I'm still glad I'm cut. I also have a sneaking suspicion that if I had a pill that could make you circumcised in a second a lot of uncut dudes would take it too.  <br>i surely wouldnt</br>  <br>Fuck that shit man. I love my foreskin so much I've even named it</br>  <br>That's mental circumcision</br>  <br>/thread</br>  still believing that holocaust happened  <br>Instant circumcision without the pain? Fuck yeah I'd take that pill</br>  <br>Are you fucking tapped?</br>  <br>Why tho?</br>  <br>Religion</br>  <br>I would fucking sue my parents if they had cut me. But luckily I am not born into a jewish culture like America.</br>  <br> protip <br>Kek</br></br>  <br>Thank the Jews/Christians for that</br>  <br>I agree. I want mine restored.</br>  <br><br>Answer me you fcking retard.</br></br>  <br><br>Well the one thing circumcision has going for it is hygiene. When there is no enclosed area, moisture wont get trapped. That part isnt arguable.<br><br>Aside from that there arent any real pros/cons. Retards will argue over shit like increased/decreased sensitivity, size, mutilation, etc. <br><br>But rational adults know this is just a topic for dipshits on the internet to fight over. A small, somewhat significant improvement to hygiene is the only difference.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The fucked up overdone guy in your pic.<br><br>And I say that thinking circumcision is retarded</br></br></br>  <br>i wouldnt want part of my dick cut off for the sake of having a daily shower</br>  <br>Bait/10. Fuck off cutfag.</br>  <br>no</br>  <br>Same.<br>I will admit. I don't really like the way a natural penis looks while flaccid, but I still want it. I will never know what it's like to have full feeling, and that fucking sucks.</br></br>  <br>Ripping mens nipples off at puberty because fucking why not. You don't need those things anyway! It'll be much easier to clean that way.</br>  <br>The point is that you should not be allowed to do this on your children. Let them grow up and decide.<br>I don't fuckiong care if you want to mutilate yourself, but don't force this on babies.</br></br>  <br>This.<br><br>It also means that Judaism sucks.<br>Literally. it sucks babies dicks off<br>/b/ hates kikes anyway.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>is this your higiene?<br>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/art<wbr>icle-2887862/Fourth-Jewish-baby-yea<wbr>r-treated-herpes-controversial-Orth<wbr>odox-circumsicion-method.html</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br><br>lol chicken legs</br></br>  Skipping leg day, being a filthy BR, and using synthol  <br>It's difficult to explain, but foreskin adds soooo much to sexual pleasure that i genuinely feel sorry for cut people, not being sarcastic or passive aggressive.</br>  <br>Jews giving a baby a blowjob is fucking disgusting but it's not the fault of the circumcision. It's fucking jews</br>  <br><br><br/></br></br>  The only thing stupider than circumcision is the fact that it's done in America and none of us are gay Jews. It literally blows my mind that it is the norm to do more than is necessary in this bullshit country. But obviously it's for profits and jews so it's OK  <br>I'm 32 and cut that foreskin two years ago... feels the same shit.
