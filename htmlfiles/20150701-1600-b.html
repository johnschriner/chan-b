[ Hey b I need help. I'm coming to you guys because I'm out of options. I once jerked off to a sailor moon fanfic that had pictures and shit. The sailor moon group was defeated by pigmen. They were like hogs with penises that could talk and shit. They made the sailor moon girls Fuck each other and shit. One of the girls (can't remember who) was the last one standing and got captured in the end. She was taken to their prisons and another sailor girl fucked her since her mind had been tampered with from the hogs. the hogs also had a king who's personal sex slave was one of the sailor girls. These hogs basically took over the planet and there was a resistance force trying to fight them. I think they turned the Humans into hogpeople which is why they were outnumbering the humans. It was kinda dark. Please help me guys. I haven't jacked off in two weeks because I'm trying to find this.

As the United States does, so to does Exodus begin to have civil disobedience about which religion is Exodus' "True Religion", despite the fact that the founder has no religious allegiance  <br><br> Overseer OP </br></br></br>  What's going on in South America?

I'll need some of those transported to the task force ready for the invasion of Korea. They will make great weapons<br> HCGRBGTC </br></br>  Well, this is odd, while going through some family records of the newest batch of immigrants, one of them has a rare form of the fluenza, which is incredibly contagious and if not treated could cause distress and possibly death among the lower-level economic citizens. Shall we set up a quarantine and vaccination facility?<br> Prof. Freeman, Head of R&amp;D </br>  <br>I will be departing on another trip to see about setting up presence north, towards the Artic. Would I be safe moving a fleet up there? If so, take command of the 2nd, 3rd, and 5th divisions of the Russian Army and convince the U.S. to sign the treaty as well. It would behoove them to do so.<br> ADM TrollLord, Exodus Military Commander <br> Director of Diplomatic Corp </br></br></br>  <br><br>My apologies, Judge Hammond. I shall differ to your expert advice the next time this situation occurs again. Looks like the resident Chinese restaurant will be receiving more meat for their kitchen.<br><br> Judge Ramsay Bolton </br></br></br></br>  <br>No, I want them to live still. <br> ADM TrollLord, Exodus Military Commander <br> Director of Diplomatic Corp </br></br></br>  <br>Smooth Sailing to you<br> ADM TrollLord, Exodus Military Commander <br> Director of Diplomatic Corp </br></br></br>  <br>I put forward to kill everyone of the new immigrants that were aboard with this man.<br><br> HCGIA jim </br></br></br>  <br>Set them in town square and have him executed.

What is the history of this glorious island? Who is the enemy? What did the enemy do?</br></br></br>  So are they being killed or are we just punishing the single immigrant? <br><br> Prof. Freeman, Head of R&amp;D </br></br>  <br>It seems like a good idea to me I see no problem with it. Do what you need to, we still need to take over Korea and quickly though<br> HCGRBGTC </br></br>  <br>Good idea, we will have all surrounding countries start to sign the treaty or be eliminated. Once we have acquisition of the U.S. no one will dare to do anything. <br> ADM TrollLord, Exodus Military Commander <br> Director of Diplomatic Corp </br></br></br>  <br>His entire family.<br><br> HCGIA jim </br></br></br>  <br>Immigrating to our fair fortress with a contagious disease constitutes willing sabotauge.

The blast radius can be preset to ensure only a single target is destroyed, and not mass destruction of the land. They have the ability to turn invisible upon command, and travel at max movement speed of mach 50. With a quick-escape 10 second burst of Mach 90. Additional self destruct functions are enabled with the power to wipe out the entire earth, however these can be set to a radius to prevent accidental destruction of the earth. They feature transporters to the city to allow for unlimited resupply drops and can travel in land, space, or ocean. We have created 30 of these ExoFlights.<br><br>Alongside this work has begun on attempting to make the city have power to its under-layers and fly. The energy is recycled through itself effectively allowing for indefinite flight. Unfortunately these have only been installed to half the city, I'll allow the other R&amp;D researchers to finish this off.<br><br>I have left no blueprints to the ExoFlights in rebellion to a sudden head of R&amp;D appearing so use them wisely.

Let's put them on an island and videotape them for public moral and amusement. Whoever entertains the people best each week will be given a small amount of supplies.

The TV show with them, ads, whole lines of products! <br> Media Minister Europoor </br></br></br>  <br><br>As the weeks pass from the High Councils decision/announcement, protests have begun to erupt, each religion claiming their own specific deity is responsible for Exodus' existence, and they've begun petitions, which to no surprise, have been receiving signatures from people within their own communities: <br><br> Christians petitioning for the banning of abortions and mandatory church services on sundays and to have their religion as Exodus' main religion <br><br> Muslims are petitioning for sharia law <br><br> Orthodox Jews are petitioning for the banning of pork, mandatory church services on saturdays and hebrew to be taught in schools <br><br> A small sect of voodoo practicers are petitioning to have English replaced by Creole <br><br> Overseer OP </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The whole point of the treaty was to assassinate all the leaders and make True Korea part of Exodus.

They were not offered the peace treaty. Chinese Forces will be moving into True Korea under the name of Exodus.

I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit.

Also you fucking tard listen here and listen good. I realize you've gotten shit from almost every person in this thread, but get the fuck over it. This is 4chan for christ sakes. But that doesnt give you a right to be assholes to every person who tries to ask you a question. He was asking a serious question and you said pretty much said before yur fighting off trolls. He's clearly not a fucking troll, so answer the fucking man dipshit. Jesus christ. If you want this website to atleast give you acknowledgement you can atleast try to be nice to some people other than the people that outright say they like you.</br>  <br> misuse of psychological terms <br>Can't this meme just die out already?</br></br>  <br> posts 5 different pieces <br> all of them underdeveloped / "draft 1" </br></br>  <br>What can say?</br>  <br>Also, if you want people not to be complete sacks of shit maybe you shouldn't of said in your post "We're edgy and deep!" Like you can just say heres this music video, tell me your thoughts. People would have probably been more civilized.</br>  OP needs a 4chan 101 lesson<br>and maybe an intro to /b/ class</br>  <br>ur hawt</br>  OP is dying laughing right now. faggot/11 nice troll  <br>omg this newfag</br>  I've cured cancer  Perpetual faggotry  <br>Do you think someone would do that?<br>Just go on the internet, and lie?</br></br>  I can't read  Its a good thing this tripe will amount to nothing. Stick around OP, you belong here.  <br>Shitty basic white girl "omg I love edc" trash. Deep my fucking ass and wtf do you mean heavy?</br>  I came so hard when they touched foreheads   this thread   Next video have more tits  someone shazam that shit, most likely a rip off. OP seems as un-original as the rest of the fags here  I would buttfuck the main guy sooo hard  <br>ur so sexy wan 2 fuk bb</br>  <br>it is no band, it is all synth instruments. find musicians and it will improve the music a whole lot.</br>  Ask a Best Buy employee anything.  <br>What's your IST, faggot?</br>  <br>How hard is it to shoplift from there? Everytime I am there a guy greets me when I come in and leave he is standing there?<br><br>Also.....you guys ever apprehended anyone for shoplifting?</br></br></br>  <br>Have you ever caught a nigger stealing anything?</br>  <br>Yeah that faggots only job is to stop shoplifters, and he's "trained" to spot one. at least at my store we spider wrap and tag everything of value, so getting something out the door is a task, but do-able.</br>  Would you recommend I get a job there? What do you do there. Plus is it frustrating explaining tech to people who don't know the difference between a VCR and a bluray player?  <br>What department do you work in?</br>  Send me a PS4 console to my house nigger  <br>All the time.</br>  <br>Computing and DI</br>  <br>Do you guys prosecute ALL shoplifters or does the dollar amount have to be big?</br>  Do you have Battletoads?  <br>The pay is decent, and it's a good change of pace from last job. Working with tech you know is fun, but naturally irratating when it comes to customers who dont know much. Its not bad though, not everyone gives a shit about why and how something works, just if it works.</br>  <br>So what's your Rev / Hour and why aren't you hitting your goal?</br>  <br>Pwaystation won too or twee?</br>  Can beam fuel melt steel jets?  My boyfriend is about to start work there as a PT inventory specialist. What can he expect?  <br>Havent seen too many high-valued lifters, but generally yeah. Best buy doesn't play.</br>  <br>I don't know but we expect tits now femanon</br>  Where do you work?  <br>A wild newfag appears!</br>  <br>Shut up faggot. Don't even pretend you know what you're talking about.</br>  <br>Kek. You seem keen to how that place works.</br>  <br>Do you guys get commission? Because I spent 2 hours talking to this one guy over a laptop decision. Had an important phone call so I had to go before I got it. Next day I came back and some other guy helped me. I told him what I wanted. As I was leaving I saw the salesman from yesterday LOL.</br>  Why is everything in your store marked up 30% and why is everyone who works there clueless?  Where do you work  <br>I've been a manager at Best Buy for almost ten years now.</br>  <br>Aloooot of training, alooooot of sitting at a desk for 7 hours doing nothing.</br>  How disappointed are your parents that you never amounted to anything?  Why do you guys have nothing of worth outside of sometimes having a movie or two? Is best buy just hoping everyone buys a washer?  Geek Squad faggot here, taking questions and criticism  <br>Because smart people don't dry hump chinese junk electronics to get white trash faggots to buy it</br>  <br>nice</br>  <br>Lighten up on the fucking rec sheets. Pls</br>  <br>The products aren't even close to a 30% margin, the accessories are. If something is on sale it's close to cost.</br>  <br>Nice dubs <br><br>How about after training?</br></br></br>  <br>It's not really a "squad" is it, but a bunch of faggots all working on shitty computers, right?</br>  <br>You don't get your product out unless you have a completed CRW. If an McDonalds employee can ask every client, "Would you like fries with that?" how hard is it to ask some basic questions and fill out a sheet of paper?<br><br>Go get your signing pen.</br></br></br>  <br>Did that poster clearly state that they were female? No. Are they attention whoring? No.<br><br>Please review the "tits or gtfo" rules before posting again, newfag.</br></br></br>  <br>That is the sitting at the desk part</br>  <br>Do you live in an apartment and have a white Ps4?</br>  <br>It was obviously a girl. <br> "tits or gtfo" rules <br>now who's the newfag?</br></br></br>  <br>Final Notice<br><br>We are sorry for interrupting your browsing session.

It's a simple behavior to validate. Being busy or a large store is no excuse to provide a poor experience to your customers.</br>  List the things that you hate about working there?  Why do Best Buy employees have a big dick about what they do?  How much money do you make?  <br>not OP or the other guy who said he works there but I also work for BBY. <br><br>because we get a ton of shit for working for a dick of a company</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;625076649 <br>That statement still doesn't explain why you're such a raging faggot who smells of summer.</br>  can you send us nudes?

Fuck CRWs, and fuck trying to get people to apply for the credit card.  <br>how do you feel inferior scum ? I worked at FutureShop before it closed to bestbuy, made 3 times your pay</br>  From my experience, bb employees don't know shit about tech. They just try to put on a good show for the really tech illiterate customers. They'll believe anything.  <br>Here I was thinking I was talking to rational folk.<br><br>I wouldn't argue with you on a lot of your points, but god damn do you sound like a bottom of the barrel turd</br></br></br>  <br><br> neckbeard <br><br>oh btw neckbeard isn't a word either<br><br>it's just some shit you read somebody post on reddit and you use it now to feel "part of the team"<br><br>pic is you</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Here I was thinking <br><br>will this be your last lie?<br><br>pretend you know me next, then ad hom for days and days. you have already proven beyond doubt you are demonstrably stupid</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hate it so Fucking much. Scanning the night before saved us so much time. We're lucky to finish before our shift ends now Sunday morning. Forget about before the store opens. Even if planos were all 100% they still don't print right so we're left to scan every department after the reactions anyway. Waste of my damn time. Then our managers hound us to hurry up. Makes me hate my job. But hey at least im not being hassled every ten minutes about branded payments or TAs or something. Warehouse life is good.</br>  <br>i dont miss best buy.<br><br>it was cool to work when we didnt have the uptight ass manager and work shitty holiday hours.<br><br>free food was cool though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'll stop homming when you do, love</br>  If BestBuy went bankrupt, there would be zero complaints.<br><br>LOL never looked before, because I already know this type of shit..<br><br>BUT HEY FAGGOTS with edgy neckbeard autism salty troll big bang theory vocabulary<br><br>http://www.resellerratings.com/stor<wbr>e/Best_Buy<br><br>gtfo.<br>/thread<br><br>p/e almost 13, it's july, possible short</br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>sounds EXACTLY like my store... I guess everywhere is having the same problems. Desktops printing as peg labels... missing half of the department in the batch. its fucking stupid.</br>  <br><br>oh ya homming love ok<br><br>BestBuy rating 0.98 / 10 cut/paste from above link.<br><br>Tell me again how BestBuy isn't a bunch of windows users trying to sell anything everything even their ass for that almighty dollar.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yup, our mobile is set 100% and still when we scan after its missing stuff. then routers print as pegs but theyre setup as tags and same with other random shit. our gm said nobody is liking it and theyre all having problems so hopefully theyll change it but in the mean time we dont have choice. they wont let us just scan because corporate will bitch about us not printing their stupid shit.</br>  I absolutely do not shop there ever. Can price match them from other places no problemo if they did try a b8 sale.<br><br>Glad you brought the logo to /b/ for some actual real-time advice.<br><br>There is no future at bestbuy. look elsewhere.<br><br>Circuit City was same shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  ERP thread?

Will I see you again?</br>  <br>Also, would anyone be interested in nursey's other stories?<br><br>if so, any idea where to post them?<br><br><br>why not chatzy?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I like chatzy better myself, even if it's 10 person limit. Maybe more because of the limit honestly.<br><br>http://us21.chatzy.com/594312219867<wbr>70</wbr></br></br></br>  Why aren't you faggots on /erp/?  <br>I would like to join and your mistress.<br/></br>  <br>Because it's a toxic cesspit.</br>  <br><br>You have to ask mistress, but I have no objections to it.<br>(I think she left anyways ;_;)</br></br></br>  Bumb  Dumping lewd.  <br>Would you like to be my mistress?</br>  <br>I roleplay a dude.

I usually don't let it out all at once, it's too much for any one person to handle.<br>I don't think your body could take much more of that, anyway.<br><br>Still, there's plenty of ways to have fun otherwise~</br></br></br></br></br>  What's an "eye-arcee"?  <br>Internet Relay Chat.<br><br>You plug your machine into a virtual room where people can trace you at their leisure, and you're at the whims of moderators and voices that can make arbitrary decisions based on whether you've sucked their dicks often enough.<br><br>I might be a bit jaded, though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>An outdated chat system that stays around today because it's easy to mess with and customize from a code standpoint.</br>  <br>That...uhm... That doesn't sound very fun...why don't we just play here?<br><br>(Accurate. I've never had a bad experience like yours, apparently, but what you're saying is not untrue)</br></br></br>  <br>Trainer: Hey "Snake" It's good to see you haven't died yet<br><br>Good luck sir</br></br></br>  <br>Agreed, next time you can ride me and shower me with your cum as I plunge into you. I just need to remember to close my mouth...<br>*It waters regardless*</br></br>  <br>I decided to get the fuck over my anxiety towards public erp. Seems that everyone's giving Chatzy and IRC a chance, but most of us have slunk back, keeping one eye on both.</br>  <br>I'll...stay here for now. This place has been fun!<br><br>(And I ain't about to fuck with anything that ain't kik because I use my phone :V)</br></br></br>  Bumb  <br>Oooh~ That sounds like fun!<br>*Giggles*<br>I'll be looking forward to that, then~</br></br></br>  <br>So I'm your first in public ?</br>  Harley Quinn has joined the fight!  <br>I don't see why. The pacing of the board seems fine enough to me.</br>  Oh shit, guys. Things are getting really hot.<br><br>I...uh...I think I'm gonna need to relieve myself...oh man.<br><br>Geez. Oh man. Oh geez. <br><br>Whuuf.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Don't let thread die  <br>I think it was the renamon harem really. People had more fun mocking them than they did looking for erp.</br>  <br>I don't know, man. If it dies it wasn't meant to be. Try again in a couple hours</br>  <br>I know right? It's like freaking 103 degrees outside! Way too hot for me.</br>  <br>Well there is Blackula, Batman, and various other silly people<br>It's hard to keep track of what's a joke and who's serious</br></br>  <br>I'd be up for another round, but I'm running short on time.<br>*Notices your cock sticking out a bit*<br>Oh god it still looks delicious. But... not until October.</br></br></br>  <br> People had more fun mocking them <br><br>Honestly, they were responding to the banter pretty well, even joining in on the joking. <br><br><br>Batman's a playful parody of emote action roleplaying.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh that DARK RENAMON DEMON thing or whatever? That was weird.</br>  Where can I get in on this?  <br>I thought he just meant mistress renamon. Was there someone else?</br>  Anybody lurking since then beginning of the thread.  <br>If you've been following 'Mistress' Renamon and her group's backstory, you should know that Renamon also has a demon side, Rigatoni or something, that comes to the surface for reasons, because she was left in the Chamber of Secrets with the basilisk by the CIA or something.</br>  <br>In what, the erp? You have to wait for a mistress.</br>  <br>oh. hahahahahahaha</br>  <br>That's fine. Patience is the mother of all virtues, after all~<br><br>Hmm? October?</br></br></br>  Youre all fucking cunts  <br>Same person.<br><br><br>And yeah, I don't like to judge but it made me cringe and laugh, not hard.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yah, starting midnight tonight, 15 minutes or so, I'm gonna attempt the #Rory100, 100 days without cumming. Insane I know, but I pulled off 41 last year so... anyway wish me luck, gonna need it.</br>  <br> A more dom bi dude <br> Mistress <br>Well that was fun I guess</br></br></br>  <br>Very nice</br>  <br>your a stupid nerd</br>  <br> cringe  <br><br>Personally, I don't get that part. Yeah, it's full of stale cliches, but that's part of the fun of following it. It seems only half-serious, like they're parodying themselves in some twisted manner. Plus, they seem to ease in with the banter pretty well, as I mentioned before.<br><br>We will never relive the glory days of poor Jeremy, blushing extremely as he asks for his butt to be deflowered.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I have one of those</br></br>  <br>yea but you dont fuckin have a life</br>  <br>It's because of the abysmal writing talent, really. The line between emulation and satire is a thin one.</br>  <br>Oooooh, I see, I see.<br><br>Well then, I wish you luck on your journey, in that case!<br><br>I hope I don't end up torturing you too much by accident if you keep reading these threads~</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>thin just like your dick</br>  <br>I want to help push them off the ledge, and tumble with them into the pit of eldritch horror which they so gingerly avoid.</br>  <br>You won't, I'll be leaving 4chan altogether until it's over!</br>  what erp is?  <br>Enterprise Resource Planning.<br><br>*plans extremely*</br></br></br>  <br>what are we planning? porn?</br>  <br>Awww, I'll be missing you dear, but I suppose it's for the best.</br>  <br>electric run panflute</br>  Everyone's lost it.  <br>may i taste it?</br>  <br>Kek</br>  Anyone have requests? I tried gelping an anon a couple hours ago but dissapeared after a couple posts. Or if anyone wanta to be my sister...  <br>Yah, anyway my time is about up. See you in a 100 days hopefully!</br>  <br>Post Nazi stuff plx<br><br>Nazis turn me on</br></br></br>  <br>Sure, you can. But as it is right now it wouldn't be fun at all. You have to give him a bit of "special care" to wake him up and get it ready for you</br>  <br>Take care of yourself now!<br>*Smooch~*</br></br>  <br><br>For you, ill try to find the couple of nazi lolis I have in my 2k~ pic folder.</br></br>  God-tier YLYL<br><br>post only shit you have lost to</br></br>  <br>Why do I get the feeling that if I save this... that thing will kill me?</br>  <br>Its a dead girl being put in a body bag. Don't quote me but I think her parents were documenting her fight against cancer or something along those lines. I didn't lose</br>  <br>Only a matter of time</br>  When people automatically assume somethings bad for you without doing any research at all on it. e.x: electronic cigarettes  <br>It's almost like you don't know that infinitely small violent reactions are still infinitely small.<br><br>This</br></br></br>  <br>Satanic trips confirm OP is a fucking faggot</br>  <br>You people and your inane rhetoric</br>  Ask a Wal-Mart employee in the Lawn and Garden department anything.  <br>What's the difference between garden soil and potting soil?</br>  <br>not op but potting soil is supposed to retain more water i think</br>  Recently quit walmart after 5 fucking years. Yes, walmart sells stump remover. Yes, walmart employees give a shit if you steal, they will report you to AP. If you want to steal from walmart go into the fitting room or the bathroom before you leave the store with your item. They can not stop you if they loose sight of you. Grocery top out is variable by region. Don't donate to charities at walmart because they get tax breaks for your donations. Walmart will take anything back. You can eat a steak and come back and say it tasted bad and get a refund. When you buy washing detergent, pour it out and fill it back up with water and return it saying it made you itch... man... fuck walmart. They gave retarded door greeters a raise to 9 an hour and those of us who actually earned that money didnt get shit.  So me and a buddy were thinking about doing shrooms. <br><br>Anyone got any experience with them or recommendations as what to do while on them (video games, movies, just sit and chill, ect) <br><br>generally curious and dont know too much about them so general does and donts would be appreciated.<br><br>also any shrooms related green text stories would be great.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Think again..I've done shrooms, lsd, pcp, dmt, a lot of random rcs. I've never had a bad trip. The only drug I've had bad times on was street level rolls.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>These are all me, if anyone is concerned. I really do try to give good advice for two reasons. One, so that you have a safe and fun time, and two, so that you don't make the rest of us responsible drug users look bad.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>don't waste your shrooms on video games, movies, or just sitting and chilling<br><br>go explore nature. find a big lake and walk around it. climb up trees and big hills. lay on the grass and look at the clouds<br><br>shrooms are a lot of fun if you just go outside</br></br></br></br></br></br>  would you fuck my ex's nice soft ass?  Yes   You're at the club <br> Past student age (21+) <br> Some cute girl is showing she's interested as fuck <br> Gunnagetlaid.jpg <br> She eventually asks "what do you do for a living?" <br> I've been unemployed for 6 months due to layoffs <br> That doesn't sound sexy though <br>What do? <br><br>One time I told a chick I was a pro hockey player in Europe (I'm fat btw, live in Canada.
