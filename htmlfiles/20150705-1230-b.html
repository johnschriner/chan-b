I played the shit out of Chip's when I was a little kid    <br>you know what's up. playing this on emulator at the moment.</br>  <br>oh shit son, if you played this than you must have played that one windows game with the fucking yeti that jumps you. that game was the shit</br>  Kirby  <br><br><br>this is a great game WOW<br><br>poop https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Xos<wbr>EUjuNYYo&amp;t=12m22s</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'll be popping it into my ps2<br>The old ps2 block doesn't freaken read it<br>So i need the ps2 slim</br></br></br>  "I'm homosexual and I'm afraid about what my future will be and that people won't like me."<br><br>I wish people were nicer.</br></br>  I'm heterosexual and I'm afraid about what my future will be and that people won't like me.  <br>i wish homosexuals weren't always little bitches about wanting cock that constantly talk about it and make it a fucking social issue</br>  I really dont mind  <br>Eh, it's pretty bad for the kid. Going through homophobia is unpleasant.</br>  <br>who cares?</br>  <br>Go to a Church group, they may be able to cure you</br>  Bunch of fucking supportive normies in here  Fuck off poofy  the kid is fucking 8 years old though, how could he understand his own sexuality at that point  <br> I'm homosexual <br><br>Why don't you shut the fuck up about it, you little pillow-biter, and carry on through your life with some fucking dignity as many of the rest of us have. Lift some goddamn weights or something.</br></br></br>  Mods  <br>it's the ledditors... past week or so the /b/rutality is a fucking joke 4chan has become emasculated</br>  <br>It's absurd to think all homosexuals are like that. You're a moron.<br><br>You don't mind that people aren't nice?<br><br>Totally.<br><br>I do. And  seems to.<br><br>Moron.<br><br>I'm supportive of people who are in pain.<br><br>I didn't read his age, but it said he was a teen. Looks totally younger, though.<br><br>This is the kid's quote, not mine. If you're suggesting this kid should do that, you obviously are too young to realize how foolish that is.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>but the fact of the matter is that when he reaches college age, he will be able to lead a completely insulated life within gay and gay-friendly communities....unless he is in a very particular profession that isn't gay-friendly....like being a jock or something<br><br><br>and regardless, in the past day, he's a heck of a lot more aware of how supportive the internet can be.<br><br>also, this kid lives in NYC, so it's pretty hard to believe he would even feel alienated as a kid.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> realize how foolish that is <br><br>Nothing foolish in shutting the fuck up</br></br></br>  <br>I'm a straight white male and I'm afraid about what my future because of the ongoing white genocide</br>  I am 34 y.o and my life has taught me to change my views on homosexuality. <br><br>Homosexuals are one of the most discriminated groups in society, Even among liberal, leftist people who claim to «not discriminate» them, they look at them with contempt and not more than mere curiosities to prove their intellectual viewpoints. <br><br>Homosexuals are simply people who have a different sexuality. Nothing more. Don't judge them, they can be the most accommodating and welcoming people. <br><br>Homosexuals have a lively sex life and in contrast to heterosexuals, who resort to prostitution to fill the vacuum in their lives, they have sex among themselves for free, without exploring people.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This guy gets it.<br><br>I'm always confused why I keep coming back to /b/ with all the bigotry, racism. hate, etc. It's poisonous.</br></br></br>  <br>isn't there a stat that claims 15-25% of gay males have had sexual contact with over 600 different people in their lifetimes?</br>  <br>Anyone else find it weird that there could be gay and straight sportsmen showering together?<br><br>That shit creeps me the fuck out, anyway. I hope in the future it gets segregated. Though that'd mean more people would turn "gay" just for the private, largely unused shower.<br><br>Oh wait, by then it'll be the other way round, won't it?</br></br></br></br></br>  Your future will be full of aids and swamp dick  <br><br><br> here.<br>People at face value said "Oh yeah it's great that you came out, we're all accepting and it's fine"; but what they were saying behind my back was, "Is it ok to be friends with him now?" "Does it look bad on us?". Niggers isolated the fuck out of me with a smile.<br><br>That kid might have a rough time ahead.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Literally the most accepting gay culture in the world.<br><br>Try being a fag anywhere else at any other time (other than greece)</br></br>  <br>Oh, and when I made a post about getting sick of that shit, Facebook banned my account for 'homophobic behaviour'. So the kids' post being torn down, similar shit happened to me too.</br>  <br> in contrast to heterosexuals, who resort to prostitution to fill the vacuum in their lives, <br> all hetero use prostitution <br>why despise hetero?<br><br>  they have sex among themselves for free, without exploring people. <br> promiscuousity? </br></br></br></br></br></br>  ISIS have the right idea  <br><br><br>edgy lonely neets</br></br></br>  <br>Once you get the AIDS. Worrying about what people think about you won't seem as important.</br>  <br>I once showed this website to my father, who is 62, and he thought that this was a gay imageboard because of the number of dick photos, traps and other things you find here. This site is filled with closeted homosexuals. <br><br><br>Probably that is a bit exagerated but they have contact with many mainly because gay bathhouses and gay bars which are used as venues for meeting casual sex. <br><br>In contrast, heterosexuals also have a large number of sexual partners but most are prostitutes, i.e: paid sex. It is a awful phenomenon because prostitution is usually connected to poverty and exploitation. Gays have a large advantage in that aspect. <br><br><br>I'm glad you understand what I mean. Liberals/leftists can be some of the most discriminating, prejudiced people, they just hide it under a cover of «tolerance»</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  i'm just sick of hearing my gay friends talk about their gayness all the time. it's like black people talking about racism all the time. really puts a strain on my friendships. just shut the fuck up and drink a beer already christ  <br>I'm a hetero 44 y/o superoldfag. <br><br>In my experience on average/per capita homos are nicer and better people then heteros.</br></br></br>  <br><br> here again.<br>People wouldn't stop asking me about my sexuality. I'm pretty sure they did it to make me uncomfortable. After a week or so, I just wanted everyone to stop asking, but they didn't stop. I wanted to talk about anything but my sexuality, and they wouldn't let me.<br><br><br>That's only because gay hookups are so fucking easy dude. I've had 2 phones in the last 3 months and have over 200 /unread/ messages on Grindr.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> why despise hetero? <br>I'm hetero myself so I despise no one. I just mean that prostitution is usually bound with social problems such as poverty, international traffic of women, drug abuse, etc. Homosexuals just do it because they want to have quick, casual sex with each other for free. That's why there are gay bathhouses and bars.<br><br>  they have sex among themselves for free, without exploring people. <br> promiscuousity? <br>It is none of our business, if we don't like it, we don't go there.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm 34 and I strongly agree with this. They also accommodate difference better.</br>        gay culture is like furry culture. I just don't care. It's an easy target for trolls because of all the insecurity but there comes a point when you need to admit that haters gonna hate and just live life and be a fuckin man about it.        <br>Yes and they are usually neat and don't start shit. I mean how often do you hear about "gay bar brawl"?</br>  <br>This is interesting to me. I agree with your first statements, but am confused by your last. To be a man about it, are you suggesting that being a man is ignoring it?</br>      <br>Afraid about it?!<br>I am a pedo, and I have real reason for be afraid...<br>This thread has no sense...</br></br></br>    I am sick of cuntish heterophobes always bitching about what heterosexuals say about them. Heterophobes think with their cock and are perverts so go and fuck off and stop fagging the planet up    <br>no stand up for yourself but don't make it your 'identity'. I'm not gay so I don't wanna fuck you, so after that's been established if all you talk about is how your entire life is dedicated to the 'gay struggle' there's no reason for me to want to interact with you which a lot of the time feeds into the idea that i'm not 'supportive' of you. That's bullshit.</br>    <br>sounds like you're able to separate your dick and your brain though lol</br>    <br><br>Even if you're a pedo and never act on it or even seriously consider it, people will demonize you and your safety is potentially at risk. I fucking hate that bullshit. People who claim to be so fucking accepting and whatnot will instantly pull and about face the moment pedophilia is the issue. People are so fucking brainwashed into thinking that pedos are all immediate threats and need to be killed or imprisoned for life.<br><br>I hate everyone.<br><br> this makes me sound like a pedo, huh? </br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>People won't like you. They're called Christians, and they don't like anyone.</br>  <br> prostitution is usually bound with social problems such as poverty, international traffic of women, drug abuse, etc. <br>So no gay prostitution?<br>Just google a little and you see<br><br>Not all hetero recur to prostitution</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Stop being a bitch. Man up and get on with your fucking life. If you're going to cry every time someone says something mean maybe you should grow a spine. Also, enjoy the AIDS</br>    Well... To be honest we all know that everything is wrong with being homosexual as it's not natural. There is a reason a man can't fertilize another man and same goes for a woman. <br>We're all animals and animals are simply here to reproduce, which leads to the fact that homosexuality is wrong and the fact that being a homo means that you have some mental sickness...<br><br>After all I guess this means that homosexuals are simply sub-human filth.</br></br></br>  <br>The number of gay prostitutes is residual compared to heterosexual prostitutes. It's less than 10%.</br>    <br>This is more realistic than a faggot worrying about their future.<br><br>ANY FAGGOT OR NIGGER WHO COMPLAINS ABOUT FUCKING ANYTHING NOT BEING EXACTLY THE WAY THOSE FAGGOTS AND NIGGERS WANT IT TO BE SHOULD BE LYNCHED.<br><br><br>WAAA WAAAA I'M A KID FAGGOT AND I'M JUST SAYING I'M WORRIED ABOUT MY FUTURE TO GET PITY POINTS.<br><br>WAKE UP SJW'S, YOU'RE THE ONES WHO ARE THE FUCKING BULLIES NOW.<br><br>ANY FAGGOT OR NIGGER WHO COMPLAINS ABOUT ANYTHING IS AN ATTENTION SEEKING FUCKWAD.<br><br> 2015 <br> BEING FAGGOT <br> WORRYING ABOUT FUTURE <br> FUCKING FUCK OFF FAGGOT, THE SJW'S ARE BULLYING EVERYONE TO MAKE SURE WHITE HETROSEXUAL MEN ARE OPRESSED TO YOU AND YOUR FAGGOT FRIENDS CAN HAVE A COMFY FUTURE. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you're a Pedo, and I find you, I will kill you, whether you've acted upon those feelings or not, I will kill you.</br>  <br>yeah because the Muslims are so accepting</br>  <br>This one bothers me so much. Too many church folks are the ones that are the meanest.</br>  <br>test</br>  <br>Are you really thinking this for a kid?</br>    Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) of all races and ethnicities remain the population most profoundly affected by HIV.  <br>you mad bro?</br>  <br>im an atheist and i hate fags</br>    <br><br>This is the problem. Someone could go their entire life being attracted to kids and never once act upon it and if on their death bed the revealed that, people would instantly have a change of heart about that person. Fucking nonsensical.</br></br>  <br>Come on.<br><br>I agree it doesn't work with evolution and reproduction, but that's not a reason to hate gay people, becuase they aren't "normal." You don;t hate people who need glasses, or people tho are disabled, or people who are black, do you?</br></br></br>  <br>dont suck any off then, otherwise you will hate yourself</br>    <br><br>This is a part of why I'll never be open with sexuality. <br><br>You die when you come out. The "you" as a person is annihilated. You're just "that gay guy/girl" and nothing more. You're accomplishments, your ideas, your hopes are all crushed by the wieght of the label.</br></br></br></br>  <br>that's what happened to Jimmy Savile</br>  <br>What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.</br>    <br> The number of gay prostitutes is residual compared to heterosexual prostitutes <br>You may be correct, I do not know<br>Is this related to population size? Cause, as you may guess, hetero are much more than homo.<br>Link?</br></br></br></br>    <br> exchanging depression with narcissism </br>  <br>screw you</br>    <br>thanks but didnt need that advice. gay people sicken me worse than pedos</br>  <br><br>If all we're here for is to reproduce, eveyone should just kill themselves. We're no better than bacteria: consuming, breeding and dying. There is no reason to create or explore. Nothing to make us worth more than dirt.</br></br>  <br><br>Interesting.</br></br>    <br> Too many church folks are the ones that are the meanest <br>In my comunity church folks are the one who give shelter and food to homeless and pregnant teens.<br>Who take care of the unwanted in your town?</br></br></br>  <br>If you can't tell the differnece between a fag who wants it in the butt and a guy who's born with a disease then you shouldn't be arguing here. <br><br>You can stop being a whimp and live like you should while you cannot start walking if your born with paralyzed legs</br></br></br>  <br>I am at the 'losing his online friends' stage. I plan to self destruct before I become a ghost.</br>    <br>I'm just ignoring this stupid fucking filler post</br>    <br><br>Cry me a river.</br></br>    <br>kek<br><br>funny pedo</br></br></br>  <br>FUCK OFF FAGGOT</br>  <br><br> I'm going to post this everyday until you like it. </br></br>    <br>newfag</br>  <br>I wish fag cunts like you were straighter.

If you have any problems talk to me about them. I can't believe you're arguing about what mods do instead of talking to the people who can help.</br></br>  <br>He can. Just delete post like usual.

Mod or OP?</br>    <br>OP</br>  <br>Sadly I'm not in control of he is modded. I can't impose self control on people who have none.

Then again, not sure how to feel about the direction this place has been going lately.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  With all the archeological evidence proving the bible is correct, and all the geological science showing evidence for Noah's flood, and all the prophecies coming true, why do you still stubbornly reject Jesus' love?
