Its been this way for years. What was the last game? Crysis 3? <br>even now games like witcher 3 are 90% visually the same on PS4. <br>Devs dropped support for PC exclusives years ago.</br></br>  <br>i want advice when it comes to asset creation and using the programs :V<br><br>currently thinking of using solidworks for what we do, what are pros and cons of all the different programs?</br></br></br>  <br>Any gear that doesn't allow me to play the witcher 3 maxed out in 4k at 144 fps isn't worth buying.</br>  <br>I cant even run rust on medium settings smoothly.<br>with a 8350 and a 7950</br></br>  <br>Again, you're talking about a completely different medium. <br><br>With any kind of graphic -&gt; printing job you're going to be working with some variation of a vector file. There are no doubt dozens of programs tailored to do this for 3d printers, if you're a complete novice I'd say look for the one with the most tutorials and easiest to grasp UI as that is usually the biggest hurdle, getting familiar with your tools.<br><br>The vast majority of software in any given medium tends to be very similar - Once you learn one you can often easily step over to another and spend a little time learning then getting back to full speed.<br><br>Google is your friend here, it'll have far more answers than I could give you.<br><br>Also... lets see some battle stations since this thread has been derailed!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> reference cooler </br>  <br> games like witcher 3 are 90% visually the same on PS4. </br>  <br> 900/1080p looking the same as 2160p <br><br>No.</br></br></br>  gtx980 ti just to play league of legends i am 100% sure  <br>Please be bait please be bait</br>  <br> post ends in 980 <br>sure, 970 sli beats a 980ti, but 980ti btfo the 970 sli...<br>gonna get me 2 980tis if those fucking classifieds ever come in stock</br></br></br>  Dear console fags, it is objective fact that high end PCs are not only worth more per dollar of what you pay for but also are superior from a technical standpoint.<br>if you like consoles because you find them more convenient, No one can argue, but stop bullshitting about the advantages in all these other areas (fun fact, they don't exist)</br>  <br> 980Ti SLI <br>Why? I don't run into anything I can't run at 4k with two 980s. If you said future proofing... Sure but, you could easily get 1 980Ti now and a second when price drops. There is literally no reason to get two unless you're doing some silly shit like surround 4k panels.</br></br>  <br>looks sexy as hell.<br><br>waiting for the new intel CPUs to be released and im going to build a new pc. mine is so fucking old. I still have an 8800 and core 2 duo. <br><br>those "new" water cooling systems seem pretty awesome. ive been out of the hardware loop for a while and shit has come a long way. old water cooling was a pain in the ass</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> surround 4k panels <br> silly shit <br><br>Nigger surround is the only way to go.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i'm doing it cuz i have a pretty well paying summer job and need to spend the money quick before it expires and gets moldy</br>  <br>haha, you are doing it well <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Zb8<wbr>WQ7atNkY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>I'm just glad im not so stupid that i place a new GPU on a carpet. Ever heard about static electricity?</br>  <br>Thanks~ As for the CLC they're honestly over priced. Yes they are more efficient than air coolers at 3x the cost, only even bother if you're pushing your OC to the edge of stability.<br><br>For me it's all about render times so the cost was warranted but for gaming? It's really overkill.</br></br></br>      <br>I paid 6200kr for my 970 strix sli, a 980ti cost 7800kr.<br><br>The 970 beats the heck out of 980ti, AND is about 25% cheaper in the process.<br>I dont understand why anyone wants one single high end gpu and not a mid range SLI thats both cheaper and better.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It looks wonky as fuck. I'd know. See  that third panel wasn't always in portrait. I do not understand people who play games this way. It looks fucking terrible.</br>    <br>LOL. You're just getting one now? What, did you have to save up all your allowance? I had two the day they were released, poorfag.</br>  <br>+, I also got 20% compensation due to the memory issue, and I kept the cards ofc, so its technically 45% cheaper and better than a 980ti for my sake.<br><br>I love my cards</br></br></br>  <br><br>If you're completely autistic with sprinkles of aspergers, yeah I could see that, but for the rest of us 5780x1080 can't be beat. I'm not sure where you're sitting but if the monitors are not taking up your entire field of view, you're doing it wrong.</br></br>  <br> better <br><br>So let me break the cons down for you since you obviously are missing the point of high end GPUs and why people buy them.<br><br> Many games do not support SLI or do not have support currently. One shining example would be Ark Survival Evolved <br><br> SLI has many graphical issues - Many games will have flickering shadows, transparent textures, micro stutter etc. <br><br> Coil whine - You're lucky if you don't have it with one GPU. You're never going to get away from it with two. <br><br> SLI + 4K 60HZ 4:4:4 Chroma over HDMI 2.0 = 50% chance of being fucked. Literally. There are reports of massive issues using 4K HDMI 2.0 large format displays and UHD TVs with SLI. Single cards do not have the issue. <br><br>Now taking SLI out of the equation - For people playing at 4k they need that extra VRAM as many games will exceed 3.5gb/4gb at such a high resolution.<br><br>970 SLI is fantastic for a 1080p setup, probably fine for 1440p right now but likely not for long due to VRAM.<br><br>Different tools for different jobs anon. I damn near opted for a Titan X vs my two 980s just to get away from fucking SLI.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Paying quadruple the price for a marginal increase over last year <br><br>Enjoy being a poorfag being this pound foolish.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You apparently have vision issues. NVSurround / Eyefinity simply stretch the image on the side panels rather than correctly drawing them in. <br><br>I'll continue to game in 4k over going back to that shit any day. It looks fucking -horrible-.</br></br></br>  <br>The point is that I don't have to wait for it to go in the bargain bin, fag. Lol</br>  I've still got this card. I ain't even mad.  <br><br>Enjoy your sub par experience then faggot, you're not getting the most from your PC. Might as well be a console faggot. Bet you paid triple. Well done idiot, you wasted your money.</br></br>  <br> stretched image on both side monitors <br>hate to tell you bro but he isnt the one with issues. that looks terrible</br></br>  <br>Games that dont support SLI can run fine with just one card. ARC is a shitty optimized game in general.<br><br>SLI DONT have any issues, its been out for decades, its the new standard.<br><br>Coil whine? What u on about? Can happen to any card, no whine here.<br><br>I game 144hz 1080p so I dont even need 3.5gb vram, not even 2gb.<br><br>Cant answer ur problems with 4k as I have no experience with it.<br><br>My point is, I got cards with better performance than a 980ti (nearly a year ago), and was still 45% cheaper.<br>And people are trying to say I made a bad choice? kek<br><br>True, different tools for different jobs correct, but for my use, its the platinum deal for me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Paid triple of what? And no, sorry. But NVSurround is a niche, a dead niche. The vast majority of people who have had it, like myself realize it was a marketing gimmick and we fell for it.<br><br>If you like your pixelated stretched out visuals on your side panels... Good for you. Most people recognize that it looks like actual dog shit rather than enhancing the experience.</br></br></br>  <br><br> 6 months <br> top tier card in bargain bin <br> same frame rate as before <br><br>Top kek retard, you wasted money. You literally have no discernible performance increase, assuming you didn't just take a picture from the internet in an attempt to troll. I guess card companies can slowly dole out these cards making minor improvements at best knowing they can skim the market for jackasses like you who don't know how to manage their own bank account.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>LOL. Okay, poorfag. Stay mad.</br>  <br>If you want "hurr durr, I'm rich" bragging rights, get a Titan X, it's only a little more powerful but it's around 300 dollars more, but money must not be an issue for you OP, I'm sure.</br>  <br><br> Implying no improvements will be made <br> Implying an eyefinity surround is sub par to 1/3 the field of view <br><br>Nigger do you even game? <br><br>I have a curved OLED lg 55, a flat 65 4k, and the eyefinity setup with 27" lg's. Would 5780x1080 all day, every day, without question.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>is that nzxt cooler any good? need something that will fit a phantom</br>  <br><br>Mad that you wasted your money? Quite the opposite, I'm glad there's people out there as foolish as you with their money - it helps these companies bang out better stuff cause they know they can skim the market with idiots like you. The question really is why are you so mad that you didn't get the performance gains you expected from your overpriced cards?</br></br>    <br> SLI DONT have any issues <br><br>You realize you're trying to bullshit this to someone who is running SLI and has for years, right?<br><br> CryEngine 3 games <br>Water flickers and artifacts<br>LOD textures don't always render<br><br> FF14 DX9 <br>AO strobe rave party. FUCKYEAAAH<br><br> FF14 DX11 <br>Shadow flickers<br>LOD textures not rendering correctly<br><br> Grid Autosport <br>Micro stutter - It's BAD.<br><br>I could list off probably 10-15 more games I personally have run into these issues - And after plenty of trouble shooting and finding many many other users with the same issues... All that was in common was SLI. Running any of these titles with a single GPU instantly resolved the issues for me.<br><br>SLI has definitely improved over the years but it still causes some absolutely obnoxious issues. I've been running 2-3 GPUs since my GT 7950s, and these problems have plagued every setup I've had.<br><br>As for coil whine... What cans you using? Because I promise you, running SLI... You have it. Whether or not you have a decent audio setup where its noticable or not is another case.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Case? Phantom?</br></br>  <br>No improvements HAVE been made in years. And you are either trolling or don't actually own a surround setup because you'd know it isn't actually 100% gain per screen on visible space in almost any game. Infact the only time this is true is with a few select top downs using a patch from flawlesswidescreen.<br><br>Trying to deny the fact that 60% of your side panels is just stretch is beyond ignorant.</br></br></br>  <br>Running a 5930k @ 4.6ghz and it stays under 60c full load. So I would say yes. It's quite good.<br><br>Kraken X61</br></br></br>  I have the gtx 760.<br>I was once a poor fag but I got money now.<br>I don't want to make a new build till I have more space.</br></br>  I've had no issues with either micro stuttering etc, I use vsync for games that gives me over 400-500fps, I can get some stutteres at that level, but it goes away with v-sync.<br>Games that comes out with no sli support are usually indie games that can run fine with almost any card.<br><br>If its so bad at your side, buy a g-sync monitor.<br>I gonna end it here, im happy with my rig and got no problems that you are experiencing.<br>But v-sync helps if you're playing old games and get skyhigh fps, but that can happen with single cards as well, but they dont reach that point as much because of power limitations.<br><br><br>H440</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I just upgraded from a Galaxy GTX 465 to a 2 way 770 w/ 4gb each.

Do you even know how this works?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't you PC faggot dumbasses realize that no matter how good your graphic card is they're going to program around consoles and give you shitty ports but at higher resolution so you can keep telling yourself you're winning?</br>  <br>100% communism society would end up in anarchy coz ANYONE could enter "your" house and take ANY of "your" belongings BECAUSE in COMMUNISM there IS NO such thing as private.

Oh well, your new computer video card looks pretty cool too I guess.</br>  <br>No one pays for porn subscriptions man.</br>  <br>I game on both, PC definitely has it's pros as if the game is on both PC / Console I will without a doubt buy it on PC for better performance / mods / choice of controls etc.<br><br>My issue with this gen is that they're pushing graphics too hard for consoles. I don't give a shit if it looks as good as it does on a PC if I have to sacrifice a smooth gameplay experience for it. <br><br>Take Bloodbourn for example. I fucking love souls games. I literally cannot play this game. The FPS drops are just too bad and ruin the game for me. <br><br>I don't blame the console hardware for this. Consoles have NEVER been bleeding edge hardware. What are the game devs smoking that they think it's okay to do this? Why are people giving them MONEY to do this?<br><br>I don't need nor expect 60FPS on a console. I would like a SOLID 30 though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>"better performance"<br>Like Arkham Knight? No one but a few developers give a fuck about PC man. Every other game is perfectly honed around either Xbox One or PS4. Keep telling yourself it's better cause "higher resolution" though.</br></br>  <br>Jelly much?</br>  GTX480 is the seXXX  <br>With the way the economy is going worldwide, consoles will be extinct in 10-15 years because they're a luxury, whereas a computer is a must in every home.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;627777777   <br> One game out of thousands <br><br>So, I can play at that too.<br><br> Bloodbourn  <br> 17 fps <br><br> FF15 <br> 21 fps <br><br> Evolve <br> 19 fps <br><br>PS4 in all its shining glory.

Who gives a fuck about consoles other than your 10th asscreed, rehash batman, cowadoody 12 etc?<br><br>What games are on console that arn't also on PC and 99.99% of them run better on PC?<br><br>As for the devs, you do realize that there are shit tons of devs hopping ship off the console train to go mobile/pc only, right? <br><br>I loved consoles back in the day man, but it's time to face reality.

Meanwhile you're too busy in swimming in your tears to accept reality.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  gtx 980 is shit, smh my 780 ti is more poweful you fucking retards  <br>This shit is hilarious. The guy is giving you known facts and now providing sources but all you console kiddies can do is fall back on acting like 12 yr Olds on Xbox live.</br>  <br>They didn't miss it, but considering they all overpaid, it was better to just ignore it.<br> pic related</br></br>  <br> mfw when just got 980 tis and R9 380x last truck night. Which do I buy though? </br>  <br>Lol right? Not sure why I'm wasting my time. It's not like I -want- consoles to die, I'm not sure why they think I'm some anti-console mustard ricer.<br><br>It's just the state of the industry, which is shit. Triple AAA studios shitting on their customers on both sides of the fence is the problem. In reality it comes down to console gamers wanting the same experience that PC gamers get and devs trying to make that happen. Problem is, they're pushing consoles too hard, more than they can handle and on the other side of the coin, giving PCs a moderately better product but only moderately when the gap used to be massive.<br><br>And it's not because console hardware is any better. It's intentional visual downgrading to keep consoles closer in line, yet it's not down grading enough because the consoles... still run the games like shit.<br><br>All in all, it leads to shit products for everyone. No one is really 'winning' this war as when consoles completely dry out, it'll be PC vs Mobile. And we all know PC already lost that fight.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Did you put it in your apple, kid?<br><br>With those extra stream multiprocessors what exactly are you able to do?
