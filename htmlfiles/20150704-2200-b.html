Fuck you.</br>      Why the fuck is /b/ filled with so much fucking traps anymore?Did /b/ suffer of a quick increase of faggots coming in here?<br>Give me one good reason why liking traps doesn't make you gay. And how is the "I like dick but not men" even a thing?</br>  <br>Trying to group loli and trap threads together like that's what /b/ has always been about. Nice try, faggot.</br>  <br>No the Faggots have always been here complaining about gays. Then someone posted it's not gay if it a trap and all the repressed Homosexuals thought this was great and the real gay lesbian bisexual and transgender people went to<br><br><br><br>and<br><br/></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Exactly. They just post all this super gay shit and assume everybody is cool with it. It's disrespectful, really. <br><br>And I'd hate to know what type of impression getting used to some shit you don't really agree with in the first place has on your subconscious.<br><br>4chan really needs a sexuality filter...</br></br></br></br></br>   &gt;REDDIT EXODUS THREAD #244 <br><br>[Be polite to our 4chan hosts.

If you can't wait until marriage for sex, whether you believe in that or not, you have an internal problem.<br><br>Even beyond that, if sex is what matters to you that much, you should just have a fuckbuddy instead of a girlfriend, because you obviously don't understand love. It's sacrificial. It's unconditional. It has nothing to do with how you feel and everything to do with what's best for the other person in the relationship.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks man this is a great story</br>  <br> It's unconditional. <br>until she hurts you or the ones you love.<br>until she looses her sanity.<br>until she becomes a liability.<br>love is always conditional.<br>where that line is different for every couple.<br>sacrificial shit, i can get behind that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></blockquote>]
