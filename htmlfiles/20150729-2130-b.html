These organic molecules eventually evolved into life as we know it today, through chemical reactions resulting in bacteria/ very small sea life which eventually through natural selection/ 'survival of the fittest' grew larger and left the sea after early amphibians grew legs and survived/ reproduced on land. Now fast forward a bit (just by our monkey ancestors) and you get us, the human beings.<br><br>The male has the XY chromosomes, and the female XX. Everything scientific points to that. Everything in the body is determined by that perfect DNA/ chromosome pair. I can guarantee you scientifically that if you have the XY chromosomes at birth, everything in your body was geared for a male homosapien life, from your reproductive organs &amp; hormones to certain parts of your brain and your skeletomuscular system, even to your nerves and sensory organs. The same goes for the females with the XX chromosomes.<br><br>Now come to the late 20th and ongoing into the 21st century, there's a very current societal culture of people claiming to be the opposite gender. It goes against everything we know about science and biology, but it's a social trend with a massive following and victimisation stigma attached to it in order for society to accept and integrate it to be a norm, and naturally it becomes stigma and 'ignorant' to question this as normal. Kids growing up today are being fed in schools and through the media that this is all normal and perfect, and anybody who says otherwise is a 'hater', 'ignorant', or even a bully.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's some pretty delicious faggot sauce.

This type of scientific reasoning is great for many things, but if you'd like to apply this to the human psyche and societal influence, your explanations will fall very short.

It looked like shit months before it was released</br>  I was Supa-Hyped about BRINK and it was pure feces.  I liked infinite's story and graphics but the gameplay was boring af  <br>Battlefield Hardline<br>Fuck every last dollar I used for that shit.</br></br>  <br>Pleb</br>  <br>This. Also the story and graphics weren't that great.</br>  <br>Gameplay was alright, vigors were kinda lame compared to the first two. Having a two gun limit sucked but the gunplay was pretty tight. Story had great ideas yet was poorly executed. Shame really. That lady Comstock chapter was awful</br>  BioShock Infinité<br> Good graphics <br> amasing artistic direction <br> meh gameplay <br> story good at the begining, starts to be awful at the middle, is shit at the end </br></br></br></br>  <br> defending an average game that was hyped to all hell <br>Stop. You can just stop now. Its over, Mr. Levine can no longer hurt you.</br></br>  <br>Dubs is right.<br>This game had some good idea, but they were poorly poorly exécutés. In the end it's just a meh/ok game</br></br>  <br>The Walking Dead Survival Instinct. Voice acting was good, graphics was subpar, and the gameplay was just shit. It had replay value, but it was fucked over by countless issues and incompetent AI</br>  Borderlands Pre-Sequel<br>Half-Life 3<br>Duke Nukem Forever<br>Arcania Gothic 4<br>Blood II the chosen<br>Shadow Warrior</br></br></br></br></br>  Destiny.  <br>http://steam-wallet-gifts.com/?user<wbr>=dbc232</wbr></br>  <br>Presequel is fun but athena is dumb and most people who hated it mained her</br>  <br>I hope No Man's Sky won't be on future lists like this one.</br>  <br> Also games you were hyped for and turned out awful thread <br><br> Diablo III <br> DNF <br> Rage <br> Brink <br> FarCry 4 <br> Watch_Dogs <br> Civ 5 <br> CoD Modern Warfare and everything after it </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  MKX  <br>Rage was so good except for its missions and story.

It was not that hyped compared to others.</br>  <br> &gt;Diablo III <br>well, they fixed that one</br></br>  Fuck off  <br>I'm thinking Sonic Boom, but that was the game no one asked for.</br>  <br>Adventure and Adventure 2 were fantastic games.

The city of lost haven was way better.  <br>EA got us again!</br>  No Shadow of Mordor?<br><br>I mean the overall game was nice, but the day 1 DLC and ending was complete bullshit.<br><br>SPOILER ALERT:<br>I'm talking about the end boss being a quick time event and it's over.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'll see your Load-Time Fun Furry Adventure and raise you THIS disaster.<br><br>I was ECSTATIC for a TBRPG starring Sonic....the disappointment was utter, complete and palpable.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I actually thought this game was pretty good. I've put like 24 hours into it and I was never really bored of it. The story wasn't all too interesting, and the final boss might have been kinda shit but the rest of the game I found fun.</br>  I'm just going to leave this here...  <br>Never played it. What is so wrong with THIS one?</br>  <br>This called that shit from the begining</br>  <br>Goddamnit Anon!</br>  <br>I blame Randy Pitchford for this piece of shit.</br>  Fucking Star Wars KOTOR  <br>Greatest disappointments of all time thread?</br>  <br><br>What at all was there to fall for? Battlefield has done nothing since 2 but r release 3 with new textures and skins</br></br>  <br><br>Really? When I was looking into it, it seemed that Gearbox made an executive call to bait and switch and sucked all the funding out of Alien to dump into Borderlands 2.<br><br>Regardless, we need accountability and we NEED BLOOD.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I remember getting KOTOR when I was in about 4th grade. I had never played an RPG before so when I fought my first enemy I hated it to say the least. I kept playing and found it to be very fun. It is still one of my favorite games to date.</br>  <br><br>Disappointment? I knew Spore would be a fucktarded mess the first time I saw it.</br></br>  <br>Holy fuck. It was all touch screen, gameplay was grindy, and it was a pain to move around.</br>    <br>This fucking game.......</br>    <br>Rookie mistake every game ever made about a movie or show has sucked</br>  <br>Storytime :D<br> buy halo 4 with bestfriend <br> it sucks <br> Girlfriend runs off with said "Friend" <br> Trade in halo 4 for bioshouck infinite <br> it sucks <br> trade in bioshock infishit for the walking dead game(the first person one) <br> Contemplate suicide </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But was there a fucking bestiality/furry ending? If not, I still win.</br>  <br>That probably was another reason for why it was such shit but with all the stuff Randy Pitchford has said after this game has been out. Especially the stuff about how people just can't accept that it's good and other ridiculous stuff like that I put most of the blame on him. He was well aware of what was gonna happen and he let it happen anyways.</br>  <br><br>It's just the most soulless, generic turn-based RPG you could ever play. 100% forgettable, no nuance, REALLY bad movement controls and like no substance whatsoever.<br><br>Remember when ambitious Flash programmers used to make RPGs you could play in the browser and they were cute but shallow and very simplistic? Those were better.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, it was looking good before single-celled organisms got big cartooney eyes</br>  <br>out.</br>  <br>Stabbed my starving appreciation for ea right in the heart took a big steamer on bungie for me too</br>  <br>Pls no<br>No pls<br>Noooooo</br></br></br>  <br>DON'T JINX IT</br>  <br>best game end ever<br> u fgt </br></br>  <br>  :D :D :D <br>Infinites not amazing but it beats the walking dead for damn sure, better off watching that shitty game off youtube.<br> inb4 muh choices effect gameplay </br></br></br>  <br>This....Oh, this. My dad spent 60bucks for me to enjoy, I still feel bad.</br>  <br><br>Bungie and Activision made Destiny you fucking mongoloids.</br></br>  <br> appreciation for ea <br><br>Not since 2003. R.I.P. Westwood</br></br></br>  <br>Survival instict man, its waaaay worse than the other one.</br>  <br>civ BE probably one of the worst games I've ever played but You can hold my nuts while I beat your face with my dick if you think civ v sucked</br>  <br>I was a Sonic fan all my life. I have since just pretended the series stopped existing after Generations. It ties up the "story" well, it was the last good game, and honestly, the fanbase became the autistic mess it is today. And, for the record, I am fucking assburgers, and I think they are fucked up (especially those "Original Characters" Hell, can this become a Sonic hate thread?).</br>  <br>I was somewhat hyped with the very first gameplay trailer. Then nothing for a long time. The next gameplay trailer that came out looked like a watered down version of the first. That's when I knew it was going to be shit</br>  <br> adventure 1 and 2 were good <br>No they weren't.</br></br>  <br>They might fix BE with expansions. Civ V vanilla wasn't that great either. I'm not holding my breath, though.</br>  <br>Totally agree assasins creed mordor</br>  <br>damn dude, i just feel sorry for you now. That games total ass, the ai is comparable to goldeneyes.</br>  <br>The boss fight was so disappointing.<br>Not what has you coming back for more though.<br> batman with swords and decapitation </br></br></br>  Assassin's Credit: Unity<br><br>Fuck everything about that game. Shit-tier story, glitchiest game I ever played, coupled with boring gameplay.<br><br>Every single one of those developers needs to be fired. Fuck Ubisoft.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's what you get for preordering</br>  <br>Every Civ game is shit-tier until DLCs get released. Then they're fucking amazing.</br>  <br>civ5 is god tier game faggot</br>  <br>Assassins creed 1,2 and black flag (just for the shanties) all others overhyped garbage</br>  <br>Can't believe faggots keep preordering....</br>  <br>I didn't preorder, faggot.</br>  <br>Why isn't this abortion of an ES game not included? <br> Honorable mention: ES:O </br></br>  Sadly  <br>Also</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Didn't knew this was a faggot hipster thread.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>brotherhood and revelations are not bad</br>  <br><br>I know. Sonic was a fantastic franchise in my childhood. I always loved the Genesis franchise games even though there were few I could actually beat until later in life. I still consider them better written than the Mario games even though I'm an NES/SNES Mario god. I loved it all the way up through the GCN games. Shadow the 'Edgehog and Sonic Heroes were the last Sonic games I really enjoyed; Colors was...ok but not up to par for me.</br></br>  <br>I actually think Brotherhood is at the same level as ACII</br>  <br>You shut your whore mouth, faggot.</br>  <br><br>Yes they were. Don't be a faggot.<br><br>Adventure 1, 2, Heroes (3), and Shadow were all pretty well made linear games with good plots, music and gameplay.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Really defending Batmobile: Akrham Tanks?</br></br>  <br>Yes, because it's an actually good game. A part of the game you didn't enjoy as much does not make the game shit, faggot hipster.</br>  <br> A part of the game you didn't enjoy <br>  Part </br></br>  <br><br>DMC is a REALLY GOOD game; it's just a shame they had to associate it with the franchise. Standalone it's a masterpiece with really good controls, weapons mechanics, movement, difficulty and HOLY SHIT the boss fights were works of art.<br><br>I urge you to replay (or play?) it without considering it as being Dante and Vergil.</br></br></br></br>  Not gonna fall into the same shit you guys say of calling a game you don't like shit. This is a really good game, I just didn't like it.  <br>Yeah, because it was a good game you dog rapist.</br>  <br>nigger have you even played rogue?<br><br>its better than black flag in so many ways<br> optimized better <br> ship combat improved <br> no more wasting rope darts on wildlife <br> no more autismal 4 hand pistols <br> better outfits <br> killing fucking assassin shits <br> being a templar <br> being a bro with haytham <br> best combat since AC2 <br><br>the only thing lacking was the length of the campaign, you can beat it if you sit down and only rush through it in about 8 hours. all the side activities and the different objectives add up to more playtime equivalent to black flag.<br><br>oh and you get to kill arno's cunt ass frog father for being such an assassin shitlord<br><br>rogue always gets shit on because its hidden behind the massive pile of shit that is unity</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How can you consider a game good but not enjoy it?</br>  <br>Yes, a part faggot. You still control Batman the same way as in the previous games.<br><br>Everyone loved the Batmobile because it was well implemented, the only complains I have heard and I have are nitpicks.<br><br>Go play an actual bad game.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>How is it possible to not like Ocarina of Time? That shit's a fucking Hyper-X God-Tier All-time masterpiece.</br></br>  <br>Too poor for unity?</br>  <br>fuck off egoraptor</br>  <br>Because I can still aprecciate a game even if it's not for me.<br><br>I don't know. I'm into retro gaming so I really don't get why it didn't click with me.</br></br></br>  <br>games hyped for that turned out like shit?<br>GTA IV <br>Most <br>Overrated <br>Game <br>Ever</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>not the anon you replied to, but it's definitely possible to respect the quality of something without actually enjoying the subject matter<br><br>that is, if you're not 13</br></br></br>  <br>Really well implemented. Especially when it replaces all boss fights and puzzles</br>  <br>That's why I hate "overrated" threads.<br><br>That's the mentality of a little kid.</br></br></br>  <br>You accidentally put an I in there</br>  <br>modern warfare was the best CoD. Fuck every other one of them, but CoD 4.</br>  <br>It's a pretty interesting how Rocksteady shifted away from boss fights, especially when you consider that the last game (Origins) was completely centered around long as fuck boss fights.</br>  <br>pic related faggot don't jinx it<br> it just werks </br></br>  <br>Too bad you didn't enjoy it. How does it feel being part of the 1% hipster population?</br>  <br>Halo 4 was a good game.<br>But I did not enjoy it. At all. Any second of it.</br></br>  Here's a textbook example of how a wonderful game can be turned into utter shit by incorporating sloppily-coded and imprecise motion controls.<br><br>This one pissed me off because I actually WANTED to enjoy it. I love EVERY Zelda game. This shit broke my back (and nearly my Wiimote) with its PISSPOOR, INEXCUSABLE motion controls.</br></br>  <br> not recognizing the God-tierness of World at War and Black Ops <br><br>Modern Warfare was good, but it wasn't the best.</br></br></br>  DayZ standalone<br><br>I was super excited to play that after the mod, turned out to be a fucking mess.</br></br>  <br>Pretty much this. Every other part of this series is ruining vidya.</br>  <br>Ok, I forgot about WoW, but Black Ops? Nah, 4's better.</br>  <br>Because a game that spent more than 5 years in development, delivered a really massive realistic world with lots of shit to do, interesting game mechanics, broke records, and pushed the sandbox genre even further is overrated.<br><br>Get the fuck out faggot.</br></br></br>  <br>Feels pretty fucking good. I get up every morning and remind myself that I'm the only person in the world who hates arkham knight. Sometimes I just hold the case and stare at it angrily while stroking my hard throbbing cock</br>  <br>no, I didn't<br>GTA 4 was overhyped as shit to me by all of my friends and when I finally got it I immediately regretted it. Also when I finished it my 360 ate the fucking disc. <br>also the rampant fucking game engine bugs that sent you into space like the fucking trolls/giants from skyrim. Bullshit and Rockstar has done way better before and after.</br></br></br>  <br>That's why motion controls and any of that shit will never take off.</br>  <br>Fuck off egolord</br>  <br>i had zero interest in playing as a fucking cunt who surrenders to more than 3 enemies at once.<br><br>the graphics looked great, but after hearing about massive bugs, laughably poor AI and a campaign that falls flat on its ass i decided to not even bother.<br><br>ended up watching a gameplay/cutscene movie later and was very glad i didnt spend money on unity because i would have played it through once and never played it again. <br><br>the modern day aspect was some stupid shit with running through paris in different time periods while playing a sidescroller dodging waves of air.<br><br>the precursor civ is barely even fucking touched. yes the grandmaster is a sage but thats it. you see the sword of eden in the beginning, and the end, with no explanation as to what the fuck it even was</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>k kid</br>  :#( the first one, was epic haha  <br>Good for you.</br>  <br>Did you play any other AC games? Its been a downward spiral in quality since brotherhood. And why would you start playing 7 games in?</br>  <br>Either one works anon.<br><br> yfw shit past San Andreas and its peak was Vice City </br></br></br>  <br>Please. Everything after Modern Warfare was complete and utter shit.<br><br>I don't even waste my money on CoD games anymore. <br><br>Don't know why the fuck they turned into such piles of shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>III3 was decent. IV was pretty fucking good, Rogue was really good. Unity was a complete mess.</br>  hyped or not, that's my fav games list, and yes i have over 550 games in my steam  LA Noire<br><br>I wasn't expecting 40's GTA, but I got a game that could barely run on my laptop (not a gaming computer by any means but it runs GTA V and ARMA 3 without issue) and was just boring as hell<br><br>I'm a huge fan of detective genre in general, and I just found the "mysteries" uninspired and unengaging</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>CoD 2 is the best CoD. <br><br>MW was when they franchise-ized it and it went straight to hell and never came back.</br></br></br></br>  Most over-hyped shit of the century.<br>Don't get me wrong, it was good, but nothing over the top, just another game like the good old ones. People jizzed all over it because they aren't used to games like this anymore.</br>  <br>Agreed</br>  <br> no fallout 1 2 or the good BoS game </br>  <br>The game is an amazing take on a silly Japanese hack n slash. Or does faggot prefer skateboarding on demons?</br>  <br> 360 </br>  <br>deliberately never played this because I know I'm gonna be underwhelmed.</br>  <br>I didn't. I played Black Flag, but immediately got bored with it. I thought Unity would be an improvement and I was just hyped for the whole French Revolution theme. Don't know how I got sucked into it.</br>  <br>I actually believe it was one of the best games of the last gen.</br>  Clearly hipster faggot thread  <br>Not sure if you're an trolling 13 year old fag or not...</br>  <br><br> black ops <br> god-tier <br><br>0/8 pathetic b8 m8.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a shit game</br>  <br>I actually quite enjoyed that game and found it rather interesting. I played it on my console and it worked fine.</br>  <br>have them on GOG</br>  <br>What did you expect? People can't tell the difference between "I didn't enjoy this game as anyone else" and "This game is shit"<br><br><br>Yeah kid.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Me neither. the story sucks ass the the community is fucking retarded. everything about it just is plain dumb. CoD 4 was a master piece and no other CoD will be as good.</br>  <br><br>The joke's on you. He is a 13 year old fag yet still serious.</br></br>  <br>They were both $60 expansions to a great game. No actual innovation. AC 3 showed us new things at the cost of being glitched and rushing the ending</br>  <br><br>Is this really bad?<br><br>I was planning to get it for my PS4 because the commercial for it looks fucking EPIC...</br></br></br></br>  <br>it's what I had at the time<br>also had people telling me to get the PC version and mod it until it was good<br>fuck that game<br>if I need to mod it in order for it to be good it's shit. <br><br>good then<br>was worried for a second<br>they're all good in different ways</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>OP,<br><br>You're a fucking idiot. This is one of the best games I've ever played. Unbeatable story, character development, art, gameplay feel, theme, casting, and literally everything else was god tier. I lost my virginity in HS but when I played this game (late) in my second year of college, I felt like it was taken for the first time. I'd get stoned and immerse myself in the universe and I would stay up all night thinking about it. Seriously, never has a game entranced me so much that I wished that the game was real and real life was the "game"<br><br>Also, Elizabeth is fucking insanely attractive, mentally and physically.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I hate that it got boring towards the end and that towards the middle it turned into a chore to play. The wingstick was fun to use</br>  <br>I second this. The first one was pretty fun,b ut the second was one the biggest piles of shit every made.</br>  <br>have mercy anon, i offer you a nuka-cola quantum</br>  <br>Civ BE was a crapfest. Goddamn i wish the steam refunds covered it back when i got it.</br>  <br>this<br>always thought bobblehead girll looked great</br></br>  <br> Also, Elizabeth is fucking insanely attractive, mentally and physically <br>You clearly have autism to think this way about animated polygons which is a shame since you wrote an entire wall of mentally handicapped text.</br></br>  <br>Hmm. I might give it another go sometime. I've always felt guilty I never finished it.</br>  <br><br>The game itself, like I said is AMAZING. 100% worth playing, challenging, crazy good controls, etc. <br><br>The main characters are the edgelord supremes to the point of being extremely painful Hot Topic-tier 'cards, but apart from that and it being associated in any way with the Deil May Cry franchise, the game is really good.</br></br></br></br>  Let me just make the quick rundown of everything that will get mentioned or has been mentioned<br><br> AC franchise <br> GTA franchise <br> Pokemon <br> Mario <br> Zelda <br> TLOU <br> Uncharted <br> Metal Gear <br> Bioshock <br> Resident Evil <br> CoD <br> Battlefield <br> The Elder Scrolls <br> Arkham series <br> Fallout <br> Sonic <br> Kingdom Hearts <br> Final Fantasy <br> Any major game franchise ever <br><br>Am I cool now?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the same way we can love a shitty game</br>  <br>yes anon wil u be my borfrend ?</br>  <br>QTE part sucked but the rest of the game was OK. Sure, in a nutshell, all you did was run around, kill, rinse and repeat. But then the way the orcs kind of reacted to you and the multiple orc captain fights were pretty good. get cocky, and you get killed.</br>  <br> actually enjoyed inifite  <br>Oh, do tell me about how good the story is please. I love when faggots defend that the most.</br></br>  <br>This is why gaming culture is fucked up...</br>  <br>I did not need to be reminded of this, anon. Fuck you.</br>  <br>Both of those games sucked fat balls</br>    <br> game is shit <br><br>ha, its lightyears ahead of anything you'll ever accomplish in your life.</br></br></br>  <br>except the only bad fallout game I can name is Fallout Brotherhood of Steel(the shit one no one talks about)</br>  <br>I have to admit, I really fucking enjoyed that game myself. Never beat it, but got pretty far.<br><br>Don't know why so many of these faggots are shitting on it.</br></br></br>  <br>Because thankfully Bethesda games can be modded to the point where they're no longer shit.</br>  <br>This is some next level cringe. Screencapping your post for future use.</br>  <br>I bet you're the kind of person who drinks their coffee before it gets cool.</br>  <br>loved that game. played through multiple times</br>  <br>I loved spore...</br>  <br>The PC port was bad. But the game, not so much.<br>Holy Edgelords, batman!</br></br>  <br>With the online servers down for 2 months and no replayability once all sidequests were finished. And we all loved that 500 gig install that made us delete entire libraries of games.</br>   every Fable after the original   I apologize to anyone I traumatize with this image.<br><br>Was anyone else unfortunate enough to play this game expecting something new and exciting for the survival genre?</br></br>  Kane and Lynch, and Fallout 3. Fucking garbáge.  Dubs decides what Cortana calls me  Nigger cum lover  Gay nigger lover  a fag  Bitch nigga  <br>Mmm you fucked up.</br>  <br>Roll</br>  <br>reroll</br>  <br>rollin</br>  Lord Cuntington  <br>nigger tongue</br>  let's start a general rate thread<br> post your actual gf, exes, sisters/relatives etc </br>  <br>Hot body, perky tits, nice hair and eyes. 8/10 (without braces; 9/10)</br>  <br>Tits or gtfo</br>  ex gf, rate her and i'll show you more of her  Who watches Star Trek?  <br>different anon being funny.
