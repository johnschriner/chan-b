Only reason anything would work like this is if you can get everyone from /hga/ to your /hgar/, which is never going to work. All you will do is divide the community even more and without any results. If you would actually get them all to /hgar/ and then delete the board then they'd still have /hga/. Honestly I might be an actor and have a shit tier education yet I fucking realise how cancerously bad this entire plan is.<br> booker </br></br></br>  <br>More like late Gumball</br>  <br>I want to watch ONE movie you were in, I doubt your career is anything but acting</br>  Allow me to calm my nerves, and then I will explain what this board is, and how it's a good thing. If you guys still don't like the idea, I just wont ever open it up, I didn't plan to for a while anyways. Sound good? <br><br><br>With all due respect Booker, you're not aware of the goings-on in /hga/ and all that, which you're not missing everything. But people sitting on what is supposed to be the backup board instead of ever coming to 4chan is a problem, surely you can see that.</br></br></br>  Where is Hoshi?  <br>At least ya slept, which is always good<br><br><br>Go ahead</br></br></br></br>  35 people actually TRYING to win?<br>...You all DO realise I'm in the game, right?</br>  <br>you got a point. Right now there's a fissure splitting the 4chan avas with the /hga/ avas and by making more fissures it's just going to be one big mess of hangout thread shit until the games go down for good.</br>  <br><br>I guess so... I have to go to the shop now, so I'll be back in about 20.</br></br>  <br>Oops.</br>  <br>I don't see why that's a problem...</br>  <br>Thanks. I woke up and had the itch to host.</br>  <br>I just want a board without moderation.</br>  <br>So you are the 36th who doesn't want to win?</br>  <br> Everyone is fucking skin deep  <br> So at all the "fractures" everyone is going to leave to just oen spot because reasons. <br><br><br>Really?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't worry, my victory is yours as well!</br>  <br>explain please</br>  <br>we did princess, but we actually dont care.</br>  <br>W-well... everybody has a chance!</br>  <br>Why would anyone stay over there is beyond me. Only good thing about that site is the once a day captcha verify...</br>  <br>Alright, have fun.<br><br><br>No need to thank me man</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not for long little girl... not for long heh....</br>  <br>it can only get worse.</br>  <br><br>....</br></br>  <br>I'll beat your ass to a pulp!

It'll just be one big mess dividing everyone.

You are slowly ruining the community if you do it like this. Nobody will move there because they already got their place on /hga/. I honestly don't give a fuck about what's going on in that shithole you call /hga/ or /hgar/. I never went to viiichan and never will. You're just trying to create some coup d'etat just for the sake of having a power position. Power and lust are the downfall of many. Power makes people crave it even more, the second they lose it they want it again. You're one who has fallen to it.<br> booker </br></br></br></br>  <br>Because of 'muh rp' there</br>  <br>You can´t deny the search for a purpose in the people´s hearts</br>  <br>Because making a big deal out of it doesn't escalate this bullshit to a higher level of fracturing?<br><br>Grow the fuck up and learn the ways of the internet.</br></br></br>  I'm back home now.<br>I heard there is a drama gonig.</br>    <br>...but you just said that only 35 people are trying to win while you are in the game. <br>I thought that you don't even try because you already lost.</br></br>  <br>I don't believe it's once a day, it feels more like every 8 hours.<br><br><br>I will, give me a bit. <br><br><br>It's nothing to do with power, like I said I'll explain how it will work. If people don't think it will help anything I wont implement it, I'm not really doing anything extreme. Nice song though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't hit girls.

Not really desperate for high end performance just smooth play with 720p looks.</br></br>   2015 <br> AMD <br><br>ISHYGDDT</br></br></br>  <br>god just google that shit</br>  <br>If it's one thing you don't cheap out on, it's the fucking cpu.</br>  <br>Yeah. but i would go with an intel i7 with 4 stable cores than an AMD with 8 kind-of stable cores</br>  <br>No.<br><br>You'd be better off going with an i3 and a cheaper stand alone card.<br><br>I'm not sure gta5 would even load with an apu.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why in gods name would you even consider asking /b/ about computers when you could just go to /g/ and get opinions from people who semi know what they're talking about?</br>  <br> implying /g/ is better than /b/ with computers </br>  You'd probably want at least 16gb of ram 2133 mhz. Id recommend running a bechmark on steam to see how it fairs without a videocard. Try the re6 benchmark. I have a A45300 with 8gb of ram and a HIS 2gb 256bit 6790 video card and i get like 6000 points or an 'A' score. Probably becuase of the videocard. Try it out and see how you do otherwise id recommend a videocard at at least 2gb and above or at 128bit  <br>He doesn't need an i7. No gamer needs an i7. An i3 with a mid range video card would work for what he wants, an i5 would be better, but costs more. The i7s performance is better at multithreading than the i5, but games generally aren't taking advantage of that.</br>  <br>He doesn't need 16 gigs. 8 would be good, 4 would work. <br><br>I have 16 gigs and have only went over 8 when running 2 games simultaneously.</br></br></br>  So AMD CPU's are not recommended? How about their graphics cards, are they generally more reliable? <br><br>Looks like i'll have to up my budget abit.</br></br>  <br><br>Never ever go with AMD<br><br>Intel all the way</br></br></br></br>  Amd doesn't play Steam Games. Sorry ^ ^. You lose. Read the label.  <br>Their video cards are fine, you will have more driver issues than with nvidia, but as long as you aren't trying to run dual cards it really shouldn't be an issue. Something like a Radeon 6970 could be found for relatively cheap and should perform how you want. You don't need 2 gigs of vram, but if it's only a few bucks more I'd go for it.</br>  <br>Shits expensive get fx 6300</br>    <br>no, it's the PSU.<br> get computer <br> PSU shits up <br> everything fried <br> need new computer </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> 2015 <br> AMD </br></br></br>  <br> 2133 mhz <br>top kek</br></br>  <br>Would not recommend AMD for PC builds... Get a 5th Gen i3 from Intel if price is a concern</br>   amd   <br>Well, my friend has that A10 7850k and complains about his lag and lack of ram. He has 8gb wit no videocard. Perhaps thats why. an amd pricessir aint bad if your trying to save some bucks but invest in a videocard. You can get a good one in a price range between 50 and 100 bucks</br>  <br>but gtav runs fine on my fx-8350 :( im poorfag</br>  <br><br>No gpu wtf why</br></br>  <br><br>/g/ hates when you ask this shit.<br><br><br>AMD used to have excellent budget processors, but their current stuff really does under perform. Their video cards are fine though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>totally untrue. you can make a great gaming pc with a $50-100 cpu.</br>  <br><br>So your friend is just a retard?</br></br>  <br>Agreed it's PSU then MoBo. Everything else will be swapped over the course of the PC. A good PSU and MoBo should last 6 years.</br>  <br>That may be the case with an apu. Moral of the story.... don't get an apu.</br>  <br>AMD bulldozer is cheap and effective. I'm running that and a 750ti, 8gb dual channel ram. No probs here.</br>  <br>Those APU split processor power and gpu power and struggle when it does multiple tasks. Get a videocard to dedicate graphics power when playing a game or running shit</br>  <br>My son has an APU rig and it will run GTA V with on board vidya.</br>  <br>Because all /g/ knows is "omigawd guiz install linux and such linux creator's dik"</br>  <br>Yup</br>  <br>an APU is a CPU with a good chipset<br><br>So it's meant to be used without a GPU, that's the whole point of buying it</br></br></br>  ryan.wiz21@hotmail.com message for butt stuff  <br><br><br>Learned something today, thanks boys</br></br></br>  <br>This is just shit spewing. The advantage of an APU is you can run without a video card or if you have one, dedicate all cores to CPU and it's no different. They will blow the doors off any i3 and run with high to mid i5 CPU's</br>  <br>the fuck you smokin, cracka?<br><br>An APU is an arithmetic processing unit. The part of a CPU suited to number crunching. Often contains hardware implementations of floating/double point arithmetic.</br></br></br>  http://www.techradar.com/us/news/co<wbr>mputing/how-to-build-a-dream-steam-<wbr>machine-to-fit-your-budget-today-12<wbr>90235</wbr></wbr></wbr>  <br>Unless youre going balls to the wall with a cooling solution, id advice going with a 860k or G3258 and a r9 270. Dont be afraid of used parts.</br>  <br>Nope, this is trash. The only APU worth getting is the A8-7600 which plays most games nicely on low 720p settings for $80. The A10-7850K does have more gpu shaders but will be more bandwidth starved even with dual channel 2133 MHz ddr3 RAM. This means you are getting a crippled GPU basically.<br><br>It is better to spend more money for a CPU + GPU combo.<br><br>A10-7850K: $130 (512*720 MHz+~34.1GB/s max)<br>x4 860K + msi R7 250X: $160 (640*1,000 MHz+~72GB/s max)<br><br>While you are spending $30 more you are getting 40% more graphical performance before accounting for how bandwidth starved the iGPU is.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you ask /g/ about computers, all youll get is <br> HURRR AMD HOUSFIER <br> HURR 3.5GBZ <br> MUH 10W LOWER TDP <br><br>OP should use build guides.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not to mention you can add a video card and run the on board video in crossfire with the physical card. APU's are amazingly cheap, reliable and flexible.</br>  Budget teir. <br><br>Core i3 or fx 6300<br>R9 270x or gtx 960<br>Asus mobo<br>8 gb RAM (speed won't matter when you're NOT using an apu)<br>550W psu minimum</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah the A6800k is the better CPU to run with a GPU. It benchmarks way better. One of the best budget build CPU'S there is.</br>  <br>So this is what I would say OP: Stick with the $80 A8-7600 (only 25% weaker than the a10-7850k and less bandwidth starved) or bleed out $30 ($160 total) more and get more than 40% graphical performance improvement. You might one day want to game on 1080p and the A10-7850K would suffer greatly and you would be lucky to run new modern games on 1080p at playable frame rates.<br><br>Not saying APUs are a bad thing, at 384 gpu shaders or less they are very goof bang for your buck solutions. Hell the $40 A4 7300 can play most pre-2010 games on medium 720p settings at playable frame rates. Your not gonna find a new cpu+gpu combo for that price and performance.</br></br></br>  <br>You'd be surprised. AMD actually improved 28nm lithography chips quite a lot, not only do they run cooler but they offer greater raw power per core. Coars and muh GHz are not all that make a CPU good you know.</br>  <br><br><br>This guy knows his shit.</br></br></br>   paying to unlock your cpu <br><br>intelcucks, ladies and gentlemen</br></br>  <br>$40 to play pre-2010 ganes? Holy shit, APUs are fucking amazing.</br>  <br>Not until you run it under load then the 6800 shines a bit better. I agree that AMD is making strides. My whole point is all these intel fags, saying buy an i3 is rediculous. AMD has $59 CPU'S that whoop I3's</br>  <br>Shiiieeet now I want to build an A8-7600 build to play a few 720p vydias. I'm still stuck with my 2012 Intel HD HP laptop. I get like 9 fps on bf3 at low 720p settings.</br>  <br>The benchmark was taken with the CPU under load. The 860K is better, stop being ignorant.</br>  <br>Try harder intel cuckold. You must be part of the "I spent 4x more so it must be 4x better" club. Been running APU for a couple years now and have had zero issues running anything on high settings. I wish summer would end.</br>  <br>Nah man you got bad data. The 6800k beats it on all fronts except power usage and price. Plus considering they have ran 6800's on sale around $100 is better bang for buck especially gaming wise. http://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Compar<wbr>e/AMD-Athlon-II-X4-860K-vs-AMD-A10-<wbr>6800K-APU/3265vs2936</wbr></wbr></br>  <br>yeah, Amd is great! <br>i made my little brother a PC worth 500 dollars and can run games on medium/high 1080p/720p With intel inside. The pentium g3258 is imo the greatest budget CPU you yet can get and for what you safe, you could buy a grapichs card - in this case i bought a GT 740, it's alright, nothing shiny, but i had to keep in mind that it should be budget. <br><br>I will admit that an APU is great! I looked on that aswell! The A10-7800 is great! but unfortunately i think that the g3258 and 740 is better and you get better graphical performance but you spendt a bit more.</br></br></br></br>  <br>All of AMD strides right now are power footprint and multicore integration.</br>  <br>Friendly fire. I really am praising them. By pre-2010 games I meant you could probably run them on high 720p settings and get at least 30 FPS. This specific apu only has 192 shaders so it probably can't run BF3 unless you set everything to low 480p settings. <br><br>Still very impressive for $40.</br></br></br>  <br>This is the PC i buildt if OP want some help to decide. <br>I'm from Denmark, so you might as well get it cheaper where you live - its around 500 dollars.</br></br>  <br>For multi-core performance the x4 860K would be better though. Single-core performance is starting to matter less and less man.</br>  <br>A8-7600 build. All for under $300<br><br>http://pcpartpicker.com/p/fb9wbv</br></br></br>    <br>I would actually say the opposite especially with most high end games being designed with consoles in mind first and most good games on PC being independent now. For every battlefield 4 there is 100 Rust and it's clones that have little or no multi core integration</br>  <br>I mean, this Pc is great for what is is! It can run GTA on low, but thats fine - also it can run Counter strike and minecraft etc. on decent graphics</br>  <br>Noice</br>  <br>One of my computers is an apu. I bought it cheap on new egg to get extra work done. It used to play gta v perfectly with decent graphics. Until the last update. I would not recommend it. Just spend a little extra and go intel. You'll be happier in the long run.</br>  <br>Because the PS4 runs on an APU.</br>  <br>This is a breddy gud build for a poorfag.</br>  APUs are the future.  <br>if you just want to spend $300 on something that just plays games why don't you get a console<br><br> inb4 PC mustardrace faggots </br></br></br>  <br>Get a motherboard with Kabini APU on it, and 4 or 8 GB of memory and you can play GTAV on that. But maybe not in the highest resolution. Games aren't designed to not work on hardware that's not less than 5 years old and very expensive.</br>  <br> AMD <br><br>GTFO.</br></br></br>  <br>Because I fucking hate having to use discs to play a fucking video game, a few scratches and they are kill. I'd rather just download them to a HDD from steam. I also hate how inaccurate the controller is, can't snipe for shit. Though the main reason I would never buy a console is because the PC has a larger selections of games. Even with all the shitty PC games that exist you still get 10 times as many good games consoles have to offer. Finally you can even emulate consoles on the PC which make them very obsolete systems.</br>  Go for it. I had some extra cash laying around and ended up building a box with a A10-7700K + DDR3 2400. These APUs can definitely do some gaming if you feel like it.  <br> Intel <br><br>Eat a dick nigga, I'm not paying 2-4X the price for a CPU with the same performance as an AMD one.</br></br></br>  <br>/g/ in one sentence <br> MUH LINUX </br></br>  hurrdurr intel has the fastest cpu so intel chips are always the best to buy since i'd never admit to being a peasant with limited amounts of money.  <br>Don't forget about all the product shilling in there.<br> muh apple <br> muh windows <br> muh Intel <br> mug gaming dildos </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>obviously hes a fag</br>  <br>not to mention i don't have to pay the electricity bill in mom's basement.</br>  <br> same performance </br>  <br>I agree, just look at cellphones and tablets. The future is one chip that does it all. I think that's why AMD is working hard on integration and not keeping up with the jones's. The tech is there to build bigger and faster, but AMD is working on smaller and smarter. Everyone forgets AMD started the 64 bit trend, they were also striving for the quads when intel was just making duals. AMD doesn't have the advantage money wise that intel does, but if you can read between the lines they are almost always in front of all the trends</br>  <br>No they would just tell him to go straight to /v/</br>  <br>He's right though. A $70 x4 860K has the same performance as a top of the line $140 i3.</br>  <br>Well pc is a better investment in the long term.<br>I don't where you've been but consoles cost like 400-500$ now dude.<br>In addition to the 60$ per game aswell as subscription cost if you play xbox<br>That's a constant wringing out of your wallet with little return no to mention having to buy a whole new console eventually vs an up gradable pc<br><br>Pic related who the console gamers give their money to</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>OP you can get this cpu for now then sli another gpu with the apu for increased performance. If I remember correctly you can use AMD Radeon™ R7 250. Which will give you better performance. source: http://www.amd.com/en-us/innovation<wbr>s/software-technologies/dual-graphi<wbr>cs#desktop</wbr></wbr></br>  <br>There's something bound to happen with AMD and some other company, maybe VIA, who knows.</br>  <br>Dumb StormCunt idiot...<br><br>PS4 and Xbox One use semi-custom AMD APU</br></br></br>  <br>Wow VIA used to make great chipsets for MOBOS and one day just fell off the face of the earth. Let's not forget intel tried to bury them in lawsuits like they do everybody. Intel are most litigious group of rich fucks ever. Plus they never win, they just bankrupt companies dragging lawsuits on and on. You gotta love when it backfires on them like the AMD suit and they end up paying their competitors for 20 years.</br>  <br>Why would you want to play on shit 720p when you could easily do 1080p<br><br>You don't have to have the most balls to the wall hardware for 1080 anyway, well in most cases. Just get a FX 6300 and an r9 280(x) and you'll be good.</br></br></br>  <br>Okay either you have wrong post or you're a faggot</br>  <br>go for i3 or i5 (you don't need really good processor) and better graphic card, that's generally better and you will be able to play most of the games easily (graphic card has higher priority for games)</br>  <br>Also, even if I love AMD I have to say that nowadays Nvidia graphic cards are better choice, have that in mind</br>  <br>If you are considering an i3 you might as well get an AMD quad-core for less money and the same performance.</br>  <br>true, that's also an option<br><br>You can check this sites OP. It will help you to choose the best option<br>http://www.cpubenchmark.net/<br>http://www.videocardbenchmark.net/</br></br></br></br></br>  :)  wut  Wot??  mods...
