Started having some form of panic attack on normal weed. Sucks ass man, anyone know how to get back to normal/enjoy the normal green again?  <br>Me too but mine is like 2 days. I've cut down. Amount majorly too.</br>  <br>Practice practice practice, that's the only way. Learn from other people, google, all that good stuff.<br>Use the thinnest paper possible, which is the hardest to roll with and just keep at it. When you start rolling with slightly thicker papers you'll be godly.<br>I use Elements paper, they're uber thin and taste nice and "clean".<br>Check this out for tips btw http://imgur.com/a/zHvZt#0</br></br></br></br>  <br>Op here. It's a pic from google images. I'm high, I can't take a fucking picture worth posting, so I just grabbed one. The weed I smoke is way better than that shit, the shit in the pic is some stem and seed shit.</br>  Can someone tell if this is good weed? Its more brownish  <br>X-max v2 pro. It can do concentrates as well as dry herb</br>  I'm smokin some King Louie og  <br>h8er</br>  <br>very low quality. looks like a kush. maybe mids.</br>  <br>What's the capacity?<br>How's the airflow?<br>I worry it's just too small.</br></br></br>    <br>thanks I've been looking for a good vape.</br>  <br>remember though, you will always smell like something to people who dont smoke. like with joints/bowls, be careful</br>  <br>hard to tell cause its grinded up but it looks alright</br>  <br>Thought the same. Looks shit as hell.</br>  I dont need no damn weed cause im not a huge beta fag  <br>you're smoking resin from a bong? Nigga that wont do shit to you, doesn't it taste fucking disgusting?</br>  <br> muh I care less superiority </br>  Last weekend I went on an overnight hike with 2 other guys. One guy who said he'd bring the weed forgot his 2 pieces in the car, which was a 3 hour hike back (fucking stoners).<br><br>We ended up making a 'pipe' out of my spare Camelbak tube and bite piece, and for the bowl we used the metal end of a portable bike pump my friend had (it was for his camp pad the fucking pussy).<br><br>If we hadn't thrown it away I wish I would've taken a pic of it, shit actually worked pretty good. One guy might've taken a pic, I'll have to ask him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Capacity is just fine, you won't be vaping more than a trench, and if you do, you're gonna need a decent sesh time anyways<br><br>But if you're on the go, I can see the concern<br>It should last long enough, depending on your tolerance ofc<br>As far as airflow, it's a great design, so you've nothing to worry about, drawing slowly is the only thing to keep in mind<br><br>The people who say the mflb has a learning curve <br>I mean<br>I'm not saying their burnt out stoners, but it's easy af, you would hardly need more than one or two times to get it down, hot, not too hot. Basically as long as you get high and you're not seeing much vapor come out, youre golden</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Honestly it's been the best investment towards weed I've ever made</br>  <br>Newfag</br>  <br>this looks peng. wat country u in?</br>  im trying get seeds. i dont know if get that is legal bring that shit by mail. i found some "legal sites" from legal countries where you can buy it and they send to you wherever you are.<br>what do you think?</br>  <br>yeah fucking right OP</br>  <br>Smoke medical stativa you'll feel fire as hell I suggest super purple skunk</br>  <br><br> says he isnt a beta fag <br> is a beta fag <br> mfw </br></br></br></br>  <br>go for it. seeds arent illegal</br>  <br>it's legal to buy seeds and sell seeds but until you plant them it's illegal.</br>  <br>What' bout answering my questions?<br>Also isn't the herbs directly in contact to the heater? I don't want that.</br></br>  <br> says mfw <br> no fw </br></br>  <br>Nah man, English here so rolled with tobacco. Or hot knife that shit ---&gt; dome to the header like a bitch</br>  <br>thanks faggot. it's perfect, like a children's book</br>  <br>germany</br>  <br>How's it smell? 6923</br>  <br>Butthurt are we?</br>  <br>tobacco tastes like shit too man try hash</br>  <br>wo genau</br>  <br>that looks bone dry and all. low</br>  <br>airflow is shit. capacity is small. need to grind a lot though. vaping is a different high too.</br>  <br>ja klar ;)</br>  <br>metal plate under it heats the weed and thc burns off. that's how it works. unless you get something like a solo and use a screen, it'll come in contact of heater</br>  <br>Man, joints are the worst, I'd rather have an occasional spliff and get super ripped than smoke loads with baccy.</br>  <br>Live in the England so no medical access, plus I've heard/read that sativa gives you more of a head high which can make you panic? just curious to what avid smokers have to say</br>  <br>Now is that a good faggot or a bad one?<br>I thought it was kinda funny with it's snarky comments about soap.</br></br>  <br>sativa is a head high<br>indica is a body high<br>hybrids are a mix, and sometimes one is dominant</br></br></br>  <br> unless you get something like a solo and use a screen, it'll come in contact of heater <br>That's why I was thinking of getting the solo instead.<br>I don't wanna risk burning my fine weed.</br></br></br>  Rest of hunululu kush and afgan...going to buy 25 g in friday  anyone here have pretty glass? pic related, my honeycomb perc  <br><br>neither. save up for a pax 2. best decision in a while. good for small groups too, or big groups if you dont mind reloading the bowl a few times. shits cash.</br></br>  <br>a good faggot :)</br>  <br>Shit bois, That's what I am smoking on. My end just call it resin.</br>  <br>i got mine for $151.xx last week. if you want a link lemme know</br>  <br>Same for the Flowermate, it's indirect contact (Convection?) so it doesn't burn. <br>Any AVB / ABV stories or recipes.</br></br>  <br>Depends what your ratio of baccy to ingredient is tho</br>  <br>Shit's expensive and doesn't seem to offer much more than the solo other than the sleek design.</br>  <br>i tried my first one last night. had like a gram and i put it on a layer of peanut butter and the peanut butter was fucking everywhere and it was a mess and eating chunks of cooked weed it was nasty. <br><br>overall this faggot didnt get much higher than his vape had gotten him</br></br></br>  <br>ist kush mittlerweile kommerziell in D oder ist das homegrown oder aus adam? würde mich interesieren</br>  <br>Yank to Brit-spek with weed is funny, like how spliff and joint are backwards? (Even though with Americanisation brits are misusing them)</br>  <br>That's what I always dream to be.</br>  <br>So which ones won't give me an attack. These only started after taking a massive break from smoking and now only happen when I do smoke.</br>  Just layin about, nuthun specol. Literally :°○  <br>awesome, you're my boy. I don't smoke much and can't get super high every other week. I need to be functionnal at any time. Will that shit get me super high or I can dose pretty well?</br>  <br> i got mine for $151.xx last week <br>A link would be really appreciated</br></br>  <br>Hmm, true.<br>I'm asthmatic, so buying baccy has always felt dirty. I only smoke joints if a particular friend who really knows how to roll a good joint is rolling up.</br></br>  <br>I know right, Well spliff and joint over hear both mean the same thing, I don't know what they are over there</br>  <br>It smells like weed and popcorn but it doesn't linger or stink really bad like smoking does</br>  <br>i would say go with an indica or indica dominant hybrid. if the high is too much you can just pass out, indicas will make you very tired and you will go into couch-lock</br>  <br>Es gibt teilweise homegrower die einfach Strains aus seeds züchten und von sensi seeds oder so bestellen</br>  r8 pls  <br>ok so here http://vapornation.com/arizer-solo-<wbr>vaporizer.html<br><br>find a coupon code for like 20%. i used HIGHTIMES as a coupon code.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>Indica's will get you couch locked (IN-DA-COUCH)<br>Sativa's make your head spark with ideas.<br>Both can give you panic attacks for different reasons, so learn what you're smoking, and see what is effecting you how.

How do you do your shit?</br>    Eh pretty much all drugs do that. Our existence as humans sucks ass especially for non rich folks. Drugs mask the deep sadness we all feel as we waste our lives away basically doing nothing or slaving  <br>That's true but IMO none is more powerful than meth.</br>    <br><br>Oh I've only done it once before and it was done orally. the withdrawals were literally like I was poisoned. I considered doing it again but then I just remember the withdrawals and I just get put off.</br></br>  i'd like to try, but in france that's rare af, you just can't go out in a park and ask some random guy meth  HOLD UP /b/, THIS SOME SERIOUS SHIT. STOP FAPPING TO TRANNIES AND LISTEN FOR A MOMENT<br>Obama just signed a law allowing him to fast track TPP and other "trade agreements", allowing him to accept it with just a simple majority.<br> What is the TPP? <br>The Trans-Pacific Partnership is a disastrous trade agreement designed to protect the interests of the largest multi-national corporations at the expense of workers, consumers, the environment and the foundations of American democracy. It will also negatively impact some of the poorest people in the world.<br>Here are the list of nations that will be affected by the TPP:<br>United States, Japan, Mexico, Canada, Australia, Malaysia, Chile, Singapore, Peru, Vietnam, New Zealand and Brunei.<br> TPP threatens fair use <br>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/<wbr>08/new-leaked-tpp-puts-fair-use-ris<wbr>k<br>From chan culture to youtubers, this could make bethesda's paid mods something you'd call "good old times".<br> TPP will allow a corporation to sue a state over potential losses caused by its legislation <br>This won't happen in a court of your own country, this will place an international court above your laws. Consumer rights, from food to your favourite hobby, will be raped mercilessly. Think it's bad now? You haven't seen anything.<br> TPP will make it easier to outsource labor in asia <br>From governmental contracts to code monkeys trough services, you will be competing with third-world slave labor and buying its products. Should you be able to afford it and have some free time as your working hours get closer to those of Vietnam<br> AHAHAH I will still be pirating stuff anyway <br>No you won't. TPP can force your ISP to monitor your activity, and fine you or even send you to jail. It will be possibile to fine you even just for copying a DVD you own to your hard drive. It's SOPA and all that shit right back from the dead.<br><br> TL;DR WE STOP THIS SHIT NOW OR NO MORE MEMES, NO MORE 4CHIN, NO MORE HAPPINESS IN THE WORLD <br>WE GOTTA STOP THIS SHIT, RIGHT NOW.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>oh gad domnit shite shite shite balls</br>  <br>This.... this is....

The TPP got signed today in Europe. It's not on the news, it's only on obscure news sites or a small article in the MSM.<br><br>To me this is prove the EU and US don't give a fuck about us, it's corporations that run the game all the way through.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I mean..you didnt think that the corporations would do whatever the fuck they wanted and completely fuck you in the process? where the fuck have you been?</br>  <br>trips pls help me</br>  <br><br><br> Here are the list of nations that will be affected by the TPP: <br> United States, Japan, Mexico, Canada, Australia, Malaysia, Chile, Singapore, Peru, Vietnam, New Zealand and Brunei. </br></br></br></br>  <br>You know I wish I could take you seriously because this is a fucking serious issue.
