I see you called someone a "faggot" I'm assuming you meant this jokingly, but I've been mulling this over in my head for several days and it does not sit right. Let me please (re)iterate you on this word. Not only does it aim hatred at a large group of people that I myself and many of my friends are a part of, the word has the power to tear down and undermine a fight that we have been fighting for decades. I don't know where you stand on the issue, but I'm assuming you value your rights to equality as a citizen of this country. You may think that this is only a word, a mere configuration of letters, but this word is the foundation that keeps LGBT people held in the depths of inequality, while men like yourself toss around hateful slurs in a joking way thinking immaturely that you are immune to hurting anyone. This is not true. Next time you throw this word out (however jokingly and privately you may thing you are using this- in this era NOTHING is ever private), think about those who have struggled for the right to feel safe in their own country. The word "faggot" creates a hostile environment and makes many LGBT people feel unsafe around those who have enough power in society to use such words. Don't make me feel unsafe. I have a right to my safety. And although I have tremendous pride in being a mature, strong, bisexual woman, it really sucks when your words get in the way of my pride. Thanks for your attention.</br></br>  <br>I hate the flag and I'm from Florida.<br><br>Every time I see the flag on the back of a pickup truck or wherever, I think of all those rednecks who are pissed that their great great grandfathers or whomever lost the war that could've let them keep their slaves. <br><br>Pic related, he's very livid. Speaking of, what's with the camo on the rednecks?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> what's with the camo on the rednecks <br>they tend to hunt a lot, so camo is a practical part of the wardrobe. those that don't hunt just wear camo because they see other rednecks doing it and they want to fit in.<br><br>bamafag here btw. fuck the flag.<br><br>also give us the panhandle you greedy coast-gobblers.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> After all, DC was at one point part of the UK. <br><br>lol</br></br></br>  <br>I actually DO agree, but this isn't about the confederacy, and you know it. Nobody cared 2 months ago.<br><br>The only reason everyone is all inflamed about the south being racist is because liberal pussies knew it was in their best interests to take advantage of a tragedy stir up an unrelated giant shitstorm in order to make southerner republicans seem as racist for the elections.<br><br>And lo and behold, southern republicans can't call them on their bullshit because of the upcoming elections!<br><br>The entire country just got manipulated and distracted, and SJW cucks and /pol/ack savages are just eating all the controversy up like the dimwitted sheep they were always meant to be.<br><br>Normally I lean Democrat because I don't like the fact that Republicans suck significantly more corporate dick, but this whole situation is so fucking sleazy that I'm voting Republican this time around.<br><br><br>Yeah, I'm from Texas and seeing that flag is by far the easiest way to determine whether not the person you're talking too is a fudd dipshit around here. I still think if a state consisting of 51% fudd dipshits wants a shitty flag to fly than they should be able to fly the goddamn thing even if I don't like it, which is how it was until the liberals made it social suicide to not hide your opinions.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This. UK didn't exist until after America was a country. We fought for independence against Great Britain.</br>    <br>Dear OP,<br><br>go back to tumblr pls.</br></br></br>  <br> Nobody cared 2 months ago. <br>people have cared for decades. it's only now, after the deaths of 9 church-goers, that it's become a hot enough issue for national media attention. the flag can't be divorced from a failed rebellion over slavery, only rednecks cling to it, there is no reason to defend it or cry over its removal. As a Southerner I'm glad- it's about time we started cleaning up our image.</br></br>  Because you can only fly the Union Jack on a ship.  <br>the union jack is the name of the national flag of the UK<br> The claim that the term Union Jack properly refers only to naval usage has been disputed, following historical investigations by the Flag Institute in 2013. </br></br>  Can 't fly the real dutch patriot flag either. Fucking colaborators.  If we get rid of the confederate flag because of offensive connotations, when are we doing the same for the US flag for various horrible acts that happened while that flag represented the country?  yep the flag is the flag of an enemy, the CSA. it has no place on any government buildings. most southerners understand this too. it's a small minority that want the south to "rise again"<br><br>it only started being flown all over the place int he south in the 1950s. before that is was just on a couple state flags. in the 50s when black people got the right to vote, they started pulling that shit flag back out again.</br></br>  <br>Newsflash, people are retarded dumbfucks everywhere, and it's a sign of a self-conscious bitch to capitulate to the whims of foreign faggots.<br><br>It's seriously like political cuckoldry to want to change the image of your state because people 1000 miles away like to make snide jokes about us as they clap for half-naked queers strutting through their streets.</br></br></br>  <br>Way to regurgitate exactly what that nigger on the Nightly Show said OP you tremendous faggot.</br>  <br>the US flag has flown over many parts of our country's history, the good and the bad. the current flag with 50 stars didn't exist for much of that history. the main distinction is that the CSA was formed around the issue of slavery. the declarations of secession go on and on about how important the right to own slaves it- the declaration of independence does not. slavery is a terrible thing that happened in the US, but it is central to the character of the Confederacy. The US moved past slavery, the CSA died defending it.</br>  <br> coloring the white house in rainbow flags is fine. <br> flying a confederate flag at a state gov building is illegal.  <br><br>Keep telling yourselves that your free to express an opinion is free unless unless you don't agree with it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> capitulate to the whims of foreign faggots. <br>wut? the flag should be taken down from the statehouses regardless of what anyone outside of the South believes.<br> It's seriously like political cuckoldry to want to change the image of your state  <br>why would I -want- to embrace the backwards parts of our culture? let dixie die, and maintain pride in the good parts of the South.<br> because people 1000 miles away like to make snide jokes about us as they clap for half-naked queers strutting through their streets. <br>You're part of the problem. get with the times, gay marriage is legal across the nation and it isn't really a big deal. are you waiting for god to punish us?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Expecting libtards to objectively look at something instead of using their fee fees </br>  <br> supporting civil liberties is fine <br> flying the slavery flag isn't <br>yeah isn't that weird</br></br></br>  <br>the flag is an enemy flag. the USA can't be an enemy of the USA dummy. that's why it shouldn't fly, no other reason. and that's reason enough to pull the fucking thing down</br>  The civil war was over slavery? So I guess everything I've learned about Lincoln was wrong. :(  <br>the rainbow is not the flag of Gayland, and enemy of the USA. sorry dumb fuck. you got no leg to stand on here. <br><br>the closest thing we have to Gayland is the UK.</br></br></br>  <br> 2015  <br> thinking racism is bad </br></br>  <br> The civil war was over slavery? <br>is that really a question? the south seceded to preserve slavery, the north fought back to preserve the union.</br></br>  <br>ouch, watch those edges</br>  <br>who cares about racism? it's a fucking enemy flag. even if every southern gentleman blew the black people all day long and fed them grapes, it still sholdn't fucking fly</br>  <br>The slavery flag? You have to be retarded.</br>    <br>exactly, I love quads guns hiking in the woods, I'm fiscally conservative and a military hawk.. and I hate the traiters flag. it makes every white person around it seem like a dim wit that will say nigger in any social situation... so your great grand daddy lost a leg fighting for the south.. why celebrate a tratorous faliure, do you ever look up to the loseing side?</br>  <br>LIL B CREATED THAT CULTURE.</br>  <br>Funny, since the succession of the southern states happened before slavery was an issue. ..hmm. learn to Lincoln</br>  <br> As a people we are fighting maintain the Heaven-ordained supremacy of the white man over the inferior or colored race; a white flag would thus be emblematical of our cause. <br><br>-William T. Thompson, designer of the 2nd national flag of the Confederacy (which he referred to as "The White Man's Flag.")</br></br></br>  <br>are you suggesting we pull down that statue of a traitor too? good idea</br>  <br>oh but i'm sure flying an ISIS flag would be fine. Its de culture and they're making a political statement</br>  <br> The new Constitution has put at rest forever all the agitating questions relating to our peculiar institutions—African slavery as it exists among us—the proper status of the negro in our form of civilization. This was the immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution. Jefferson, in his forecast, had anticipated this, as the "rock upon which the old Union would split." He was right. What was conjecture with him, is now a realized fact. <br><br>- Alexander Stephens, vice president of the Confederacy</br></br></br>  <br>2nd sentence of Georgia's article of secession:<br><br> For the last ten years we have had numerous and serious causes of complaint against our non-slave-holding confederate States with reference to the subject of African slavery. </br></br></br>  <br>and when the wind wasn't blowing it also represented the future of CSA too -</br>    <br>2nd sentence of Mississippi's article of secession:<br> Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery-- the greatest material interest of the world. </br></br>  <br>fuck no. i was in england when that flag was flying there last year and i didnt understand why people didn't just get up there and tear the fucking thing down. finally some old woman did. <br><br>but you're right to equate the two, they are both enemy flags. y7ou're right</br></br></br>  <br> [Texas] was received as a commonwealth holding, maintaining and protecting the institution known as negro slavery-- the servitude of the African to the white race within her limits-- a relation that had existed from the first settlement of her wilderness by the white race, and which her people intended should exist in all future time.

Sorta like "wmd's" in the middle east. Or was Lincoln not a racist who was also against free speech and due process?</br>  <br>you can't divorce the flag from the confederacy or the confederacy from slavery. the flag is forever linked with the nation that flew it during their fight to preserve slavery.</br>    <br>Dude, just shut the fuck up.</br>  <br>yeah apparently not. you overestimate their intelligence</br>    <br><br> "When you pay the fiddler, you name the tune.." <br><br>I would expect nothing less from NBC.</br></br></br></br>  Your alligence to nationalism is irrelevant, we are all a slave of the monetary system, whether you fly the confed or Stars and Stripes. <br><br>Keep looking for the differences in each other, it's a perfect distraction from the system you consent to.</br></br>  <br> Northern agression [sic] against southern rights <br>and which rights were those? the south was afraid that lincoln and his republican abolitionist friends were going to take their slaves before the man was even elected. their documents of secession all blather endlessly about slavery. you can say it's about states' rights, but those rights pertain to owning, transporting, and returning slaves.</br></br>  <br>Why do you even care if the flag is up?

I'm getting tired of seeing all of this black violence, and them turning around and crying racism.  <br><br>ha ha you dumb faggot.</br></br>  <br>Not a theory. Lincoln's own words were if he could preserve the union without ending slavery then he would do it. His own words, that the blackman was a burden to the white. His own pilicy, an attempt to send all men of color out of the U.S.</br>  <br><br>you don't honestly expect any of these racist backwater confederate lovers to actually READ any of that do you?</br></br>  <br>what's your point? the north wasn't fighting to end slavery, but to preserve the union.<br><br>on the other hand, the South was DEFINITELY fighting to preserve slavery, this is heavily documented.</br></br></br>    Fun fact: Google is manipulating search results for a liberal bias and to censor out right views.  <br><br>great sources there bru.</br></br>  <br>NEW VERSION</br>  good goyim, keep calling your countrymen traitors while we finish hammering out this TPP deal...  <br>40 keks</br>    <br>scared of a deal that's been brewing since 2005, thinking it has any connection to recent events. you're a dumb fuck</br>  So the north was fighting to preserve the union and not to abolish slavery? Then why was the south succeeding if slavery want an issue? Please continue with your liberal public education. ..your logic astounds me.  taking down the flag was probably the right decision, but it was stupid the way it came about.<br>also, the flag has nothing to do with slavery.<br>also, the civil war had nothing to do with 'the evils of slavery'.<br>the civil war started because the North realized that if they had to pay workers, and the South didn't they were going to get financially crushed... so they chose to make a purely FINANCIAL decision to try and eliminate slavery (free labor) in the south.<br><br>The South wanted no part of being told how to run their states and said "I'm out".<br><br>Its absolutely moronic for people in 2015 to not realize this. "Slavery" was the pretty ribbon that the North put on a war that was started due to economics. Fast forward to us invading oil-producing countries to 'protect freedom' <br><br>Politicians have been using this trick forever, and sheeple keep falling for it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>no not the fucking north. the USA - the United States of America was fighting. using that kind of language makes it seem like less of an enemy.</br>  <br>Look shit up.</br>  <br>I'm not going to answer this until you learn to quote posts and differentiate between "seceding" and "succeeding."</br>  <br>Hurr durr something offends me and it should be banned<br><br>Go back to tumbler faggot<br><br>I fucking hate the shit out of that flag, what it represents, it's history, and also fuck the south and rednecks, but guess what,... why the fuck should I throw my opinion around as if it is something that anyone wants to actually hear... it is really none of your god damn business which states use what flags of their liking, and the only reason you even bring it up is because of a shooting in the south where that flag had near nothing to do with it (it was on some stupid fuckers car, cry me a fucking river, and I can just imagine how triggered you fucking idiots would be to find he had a nickelback bumper sticker on there too)--- All it is that you are doing is mindlessly pressing an agenda hand made for idiots like you and nothing more... you mind controlled fucking idiot, kill yourself.<br><br> MFW people never think about that </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>slavery wasn't free labor genius. it was just very very cheap labor. and it screwed some of hte dumb fuck rednecks too, who naturally got paid less for work than if slaves weren't around.</br>    <br>So the USA was fighting. ..whatever. Why were the lower half of the USA succeeding if the upper half wasn't fighting to abolish slavery. ..if, as you declare, the war was over slavery?</br>  <br>The Confederacy was afraid that the United States, upon electing a suspected abolitionist president, would attempt to take away the South's slaves, which led to preemptive measures. They were also butthurt about not being able to take their slaves to states that had abolished their practice, and that Western states might not be slave states. They mention slavery in every article of secession, some go on paragraph after paragraph, so there's no arguing that it is THE key issue. you're arguing against facts with nothing to support your opinion.</br>  <br> Why were the lower half of the USA succeeding <br>they weren't, they were losing.</br></br>    <br>i don't declare what it was over. but slavery was definitely a big part of it. not the only part. <br><br>but it's irrelevant. it was an enemy country - it had its own currency, it's own goverment and an army that had to be fought - and the flag should not fly for that reason. i don't care really why they ultimately decided to secede. they failed.</br></br></br>  <br>explain these for me and then I'll get back to you:<br><br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> “My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and it is not either to save or destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave, I would do it.”  <br><br>Lincoln</br></br></br>  <br>not to mention that the csa went on to forbid secession from any state in the CSA. <br><br>think about that. they made it illegal for any state to secede. <br><br>so they knew full well it was wrong.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this is actually true., read the documents of the various states secessions and it's pretty much all that we don't want the right to have slaves taken away</br>  <br>he was trying to save the union yes but tjhe southern states being afraid they'd have to give up their slaves then seceded from the union, this was Lincolns appeal just to keep the nation together</br>  i live 2 miles from the state house in columbia sc, i could give a fuck about the flag. take it down leave it up i dont care. i just want the fucking rallys and shit to end. it's getting old having to navigate around them.  <br>sherman said the same shit. once the south left the union, the US was willing to bend to mend the relationship. the south wouldn't flinch, so they got their asses kicked instead.<br>  Last year they could have saved their slaves, but now it is too late. All the powers of earth cannot restore to them their slaves, any more than their dead grandfathers. Next year their lands will be taken, for in war we can take them, and rightfully, too, and in another year they may beg in vain for their lives. A people who will persevere in war beyond a certain limit ought to know the consequences. Many, many peoples with less pertinacity have been wiped out of national existence. <br>-General Sherman</br></br></br>  <br>luckily the states did secede, or else there wouldn't be enough votes to ratify.</br>  <br>this guy gets it</br>  <br>First, the southern states were promised slavery would remain forever intact when the Constitution was written and ratified. The southern states would not have ratified the Constitution had these promises and protections been included yet almost day one after the signing, northern political groups started a war against everything connected to slavery. Every state to become part of the US from then on had to vote on slavery... These northern groups shipped in tens of thousands of voters to make sure it went their way. We now have major distrust and contempt 70 years before the Civil War starts.<br><br>Second, you have Andrew Jackson using the Presidency to call South Carolina and multiple other southern states "treasonous swine" over State Nullification in the 1830's and calling some very prominent southerners "traitors of the Republic"... we are still 30+ years from the civil war and the contempt has now become open shouting and name calling between "gentlemen"<br><br>During this time you also have southerners noticing that major infrastructure is being built almost exclusively in the north. Quite honestly a lot of dirty dealing went on in Congress during the first years of the country... the South, as tempers began to build, would witness almost all major road, railroad, and telegraph projects get handed to the north. We are now right around 1840 and Congress/States are ready to throw punches over what "culture" they belong to.<br><br>Yes, within 60 years of the country forming, you have very distinctive groups, separated in almost every way (ideology, geography, etc) and they do not really like each other. Other than the political groups in the north, none of this has anything to do with slavery. In fact through half of it, the north still has slaves<br><br>I can keep going if you would like, but I could write a book on the 30 years leading up to the civil war alone</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>if only the USA had followd through with this and destroyed every adult male in the south. then raped the women to put some half decent fucking DNA into that shit territory.</br>  <br>oh noes they wanted to end the horrible practice of human slavery. your so edge you're fucking silly with it.</br>  Why should we fly any flag at all?  In an order to General John Dix on May 18, 1864 he said: “You will take possession by military force, of the printing establishments of the New York World and Journal of Commerce…and prohibit any further publication thereof….you are therefore commanded forthwith to arrest and imprison…the editors, proprietors and publishers of the aforesaid newspapers.”  <br>ok</br>  <br> Quibbling over such a little distinction instead of mentioning anything of substance. <br>Credibility discarded, you might as well have said he was right.</br></br>  Because racism can be fun  <br><br>A lovely quote from the man who would devise a plan to murder men, women, children, livestock, and salt farm fields so they would be unuseable decades after the war would end.<br><br>Sherman was basically slobodan milosevic if you replace religion with geography</br></br></br></br>  we should just get rid of the american flag cause it symbolizes the atrocities committed against the native americans<br><br>i bet this argument will come up soon</br></br>  <br>yep. and even he would have sought peace at one time, had the south not pushed on with their impossible fight.</br>  <br>It already has. Kids have been suspended from school over wearing US flag shirts, and in a lot of school events the American flag is banned as it can cause division and resentment among students of many cultures ...<br><br>Fucking seriously. I wish that was a troll</br></br></br>    <br>links? I can think of one incident involving one kid.</br>  <br>It is just a flag... An inanimate piece of cloth. The swastika is still in use in india... It's just a symbol. If your paradigm of being is based on a symbol and not an ideal then, taking a flag down will never help.</br>  You guys should kill yourselves in a mass protest!  <br>i don't disagree with antyhing else he said. why would i argue about it?</br>  <br>a flag is not just a symbol. when you plant the flag you are indicating what and who controls the place the flag is flying. it's not rocket science.</br>  <br><br>Ideals do not have "limits" An unwinnable fight is still worth fighting if it is the righteous side of the argument.<br><br>Id rather die on my feet than live on my knees - Emiliano Zapata</br></br></br></br>  <br> An unwinnable fight is still worth fighting if it is the righteous side of the argument. <br>And if it isn't?</br></br>  <br>the native americans hsould not fly the US flag on their reservations. why the fuck would they? netiher should iraq or n korea fly US flags? <br><br>are you dumb or what?</br></br></br>  <br>they are trying to have it removed from confederate grave yards and battlefield parks. that is the big issue you dipshit. using your logic if they remove the confederate battle flag from cemeteries and parks they should dig up all the bodies buried at General Lee's old house and toss them in the river.</br>  <br>they want to move bodies too</br>  <br>Google "american flag banned from school" without the quotes. There are dozens of articles. Multiple state and Federal courts have ruled on the issue. In fact in May a teen was suspended from school in SOUTH CAROLINA for having an American flag on his own pick-up truck in the parking lot of the school!<br><br>Put that in perspective. What happens to someone in a South Carolina school for having a Confederate flag on their truck?</br></br></br>  That flag has nothing to do with slavery today. Today it represents being proud to be from the South and today's southern way of life. Nuff said. Only idiots would suggest otherwise.  <br>no youre the idiot</br>  <br> that is the big issue you dipshit <br>no, the big issue, the one constantly in the news, is the statehouse issue. though I see no reason why the flag should be flown at state parks either. Or cemeteries, since the flag was only used by the armies of Tennessee and North Virginia. Besides, you can put flowers on the grave like a normal person. I don't see swastikas dotting german cemeteries.</br></br>  <br>wrong</br>  <br><br>That depends on what side of the issue you are on.<br><br>Forget the Civil War... abortion.

The rednecks who cling to this flag are the same people who call blacks niggers and idolize the civil war and the confederacy. There is a lot to be proud of in the South, but the flag isn't one of those things. It represents hicks with a weak understanding of history, not our entire culture.</br>  ITT = Niggers and faggots  <br> you arent from the south <br>alabama, born and raised.</br></br>  <br>simple answer.<br>we have pride.<br>yall dont.<br> inb4 unfraid of cocksucking yankee faggots. </br></br></br></br>  <br>fucking nigs, 40 years ago she would have been lynched. i think they are testing to see how much they can get away with.</br>    <br>I'll be proud when you rednecks gtfo the South and take your hick flag with you.</br>  <br>it was democrats that put the stupid thing up retards</br>  <br><br>You do fly the union Jack when the queen visits.<br><br>Also everyone knows the only reason why Americans obsess over the confederate flag is because it was the last war they won on their own.</br></br></br></br>  <br> implying dixiecrats and the modern democratic party are the same entity </br>  <br>then get your fucking priorities straight. they are trying to deface all the confederate statues in vicksburg battlefield park. they already removed all the flags and they want to exhume the confederate bodies and move them somewhere else. thanks to Benny Thompson the biggest monkey to ever live.</br>  <br> we have pride. <br> proud to be on the losing side of the civil war <br><br>If this isn't an indicator of how shitty education is in the south, I don't know what is.</br></br></br></br>  <br>in the 50's<br><br>you are to retarded to vote</br></br></br>  <br>OP has it right. Race aside, why are we still flying the flag of a bunch of defeated traitors. It'd be like flying the Nazi flag in Germany, or the South Vietnamese flag in modern Vietnam. We shouldn't be doing that with our government buildings.</br>  <br>Apparently it is rocket science to you. Ideals, thoughts, actions and way of life are what controls things... Not a symbol. A flag is a warning sign, not unlike a "wet floor" sign... The wet floor sign does not denote that "cleaning is paramount and controls all " it only means do not slip. This is not quantum physics. Liberty and virtue are a state of mind and piece of heart, not a "symbol".</br>  <br>you dont really expect people that are holding a piece of cloth as the reason some retard shot up a church to think for them selves do you?</br>  <br> they are trying to deface all the confederate statues in vicksburg battlefield park <br>don't care<br> they already removed all the flags <br>don't care<br> they want to exhume the confederate bodies and move them somewhere else <br>doubt it, other than the one KKK leader someone mentioned earlier.<br><br>we lost the war 150 years ago. we shouldn't have fought it in the first place. My greatgreatgreat-grandfather was a confederate soldier and I respect his courage, but I do not respect his cause. It's 2015, time to move on.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm from the south as well. I fly that flag in the yard. I live beside a black family and we get along very well. We have cook outs all the time. We all watch the Duke of Hazzard reruns and have a great time. That flag has nothing to do with race. Sure.. there are lots of folks who are racist but it has nothing to do with that flag.</br>    <br>what enemy dumbass? it is a fictional made up enemy that non-thinkers such as yourself have invented to make yourself feel better because you are attacking a piece of cloth as racist</br>  <br>what enemy?<br><br>where?<br><br>please dont be this stupid</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Because all of America made that decision to split from the UK. The south knew that unleashing niggers upon this country would be one of the worst decisions ever. Being proven right is a good enough reason to continue flying the rebel flag imo.<br><br> MFW jew shills still don't understand. </br></br></br></br>  <br>I know plenty of black people who hate the flag, and zero flag-wavers who aren't racist. not that all supporters of the flag are racist, but the correlation is worth noting.<br><br>the flag belongs to a nation that fought to preserve slavery. end of discussion. write all the revisionist history you want.</br></br></br>  <br>the south was burned to the ground. every city every town<br>all wealth was pillaged and carpetbaggers and scallywags moved in<br>women were rapped and men killed after the fighting seized <br><br>we have pride in the fact we were able to comeback after such a devastating defeat/political scandal<br><br> inb4 well you lost blah blah <br><br>the south was wealthier than the north. the ploy by the north to "free the slaves" was bullshit. they wanted to capture the wealth of the south, considering the south was fueling the industrial revolution in europe, to make up for their loses due to trade between the south and euro nations. <br>-----getfucked--- you dumb piece of shit ---</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Because all of America made that decision to split from the UK <br><br><br>Dumbest move EVER.<br>America has been on a downward spiral ever since.</br></br></br></br></br>  ITT: Ohhhh my pussy hurts!  <br> the south was burned to the ground. every city every town <br>you need to open a history book</br></br>  pics you weren't supposed to share.        posted it again, glad to hear what would you done to her      <br>will you drop the vids on mega?</br>        <br>where she from? eastern europe?</br>      <br><br>probably not today.</br></br>    someone can post the folders about this chick before deleted ...
