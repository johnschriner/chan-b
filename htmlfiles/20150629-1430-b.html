Only 8  <br>The moaning in Jap porn is better than all that, "Fuck me harder, like the slut I am" shit you hear in western porn imo</br>  <br>It's like they know they're so completely inadequate as men that their penises couldn't possibly please a woman so they need to poke at her with assorted rubber phaluses and vibrators.<br><br>If you told a pathetic beta manlet to make a porno movie, Japanese porn is exactly what he'd make.</br></br></br>  <br>what does that mean? anon plz tell me</br>  <br>moaning in western porn are minimal and more decent. thus why i never fucking mute a porn unless i'm underage living with my parents trying to watch porn in the living room with speakers</br>  <br><br>you would rather hear a woman pretend she is getting raped than hear one be satisfied/enjoy sex?<br><br>have fun being alone and jerking off to motherless the rest of your life</br></br></br></br>  <br>based at 13 good job anon, i dont thinka girl touched muh dick till freshman year</br>    <br> rollo</br>  <br> he thinks western porn noises are real.avibirdflu </br>  <br>Betas gonna beta.</br>  <br> Watching porn in the living room of your parents house.  <br>Even with the sound muted, its still too risky.</br></br>  <br>I'd fuck every single one, don't even have to look at the picture</br>  <br>lucky #13</br>  <br>Doesn't matter if it's real. I'd rather have a girls pretend she's having a good time than a girl pretending she's the victim of a violent crime.</br>  <br>10/10</br>  <br>Rallly</br>  <br>violent like throat fucking til the girl vomits in western porn? fuckofffaggot.</br>  <br>Korean girls much hotter</br>  <br> deceptiontitties.jpg </br>  <br>roll up</br>   be me 25 <br> stay in a big house with a korean friend <br> she's 5/10 + christian = no fuck <br> whatever, still fun <br> she invites her japanese friend <br> nice girl, 7.5/10 <br> giggles at my jokes <br> shows interest in me <br> le fuck guaranteed <br> nothing happened <br> just tried to be polite <br> just what they do in Japan <br> le_sad_frog.gif </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Lol Personally, i dont even bother with regular japanese porn. But Japanese lesbian porn is a bit different in some cases.</br>  <br><br>japanese porn is alpha? "please squeal constantly like you are being murdered while i jiggle my micro penis inside you for 2 minutes and cum on myself"</br></br>  <br>Roll</br>  <br>reroll</br>  <br>give me link to an example</br>  roll  <br> le back to reddit </br>  <br>lived in Japan over 10 years, fucked many, still married to one. generally speaking, they're all shy at first, but after that it's like saying what's a white girl like? they're all different. some are freaks, some are boring, some squeal, some try to talk dirty in English, some are like dead fish. they're all clean, though, great to go down on, and they're all more slender than western girls.</br>  <br>I would but only if she promised not to do that pretend screaming/crying thing during sex because it's really fucking weird</br>  rolln  <br>That's exactly my point.<br><br>He enjoys that shit because he's a beta who knows no girl will ever touch him so he gets a hardon from watching girls simulating getting raped because it's a way for him to vent his eternal virgin rage.</br></br></br>  <br>Awesome Tan. You dumb shit that's their color, brown. Filipinas are hella jealous and can snap on a dime. They do take care of you if there 2nd gen Filipinos, anything after that, no thanks.</br>  <br><br>What's wrong with reddit?</br></br>   fucked chinese <br> fucked korean <br> thai, filipino, taiwan <br> didn't fuck jap <br>life sucks</br></br></br></br>    <br>That's the wrong question to ask here.</br>  <br><br>Seeing them go off is part of the fun. The one I was with would get mad and the accent would be in overdrive if she was yelling at me in English and eventually it went into her bleep-bloop Filipino language.</br></br>  <br><br>Why?</br></br>  <br>rooooollan</br>  <br>People around here fucking hate Reddit, I suspect it's a combination of two factors, one being that they have a kinda cringey vibe there where people say "good day sir" way too fucking often and two because I think a lot of people think they're behind on the jokes/memes/whatever and beat them to death long after everyone here is done with them. That's just my take on it anyway.<br><br>Personally I use Reddit a little but I dislike it for a lot of what I feel are more reasonable reasons (shitty voting structure, shitty voting algorithm, shadowbans, patchy self serving rule enforcement, etc).</br></br></br>  <br>faggot</br>  <br><br>because brown people cant tan? dumbass</br></br>  <br>this might be the most perfect collection of titties ever assembled on earth at one time.</br>  <br>Hating Reddit is a meme itself, one that's been done to death like all the others. It's more juvenile seekrit klub kultur shit. I expect the majority of 4chinners use both sites.</br>  <br>Fuck the rest of this thread, 10/10</br>  <br>what</br>  <br>beep</br>  More pics.  <br>wtffffffff</br>  <br>sssssssss</br>  <br>baz</br>  <br>fgggggggggggggggggg</br>  <br>gggggggggg</br>  <br>Would not bang.

I mean, some subreddits are okay, but most of them are filled with cringey faggots (not that 4chan doesn't have its share of them). I also really dislike the karma system. I like 4chan's anonymity; not because of "HURRR ANOMOLUS SO KOOL," but because people are able to speak their minds without getting shit tons of negative karma. Worst-case scenario, people just insult you for being a retard. Nobody on 4chan is considered more important or a more respected member of the community just because they have lots of good karma.</br>  <br>enjoy your poor genetic breed of children and fake wife</br>  <br>rollo</br>   implying Korean girls arent God-tier <br>Only weebs wish to fuck japs</br>  <br>#15<br><br> pic releated </br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't know.

Other than that nothing. The average user can't go wrong by choosing either one.</br>  If you game, Windows is an obvious choice.<br>If you have an old computer, Linux will get the best out of it.<br>For everything else other than a few specialized uses, one is just as good as the other.</br></br>  <br>Other than being free, what are some of its benefits that'd apply mainly to the average user?<br><br>I know that Ubuntu is preferred when it comes to servers and databases but what about the normalfag that doesn't do all that?<br><br>What about support for games, programs, etc?</br></br></br></br></br>  Wind 7 master race  <br> Ubuntu <br> servers <br>Debian is so much better, though.<br>Games are limited. The only Linux games that I can think of are limited due to compatibility issues. PlayOnLinux is starting to close that boundary, though.<br>Not really much benefits.<br> crashes often <br> open source drivers for some hardware are complete shit <br> Unity (holy shit, this gets me every time. Xubuntu is the only right *buntu) </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I know that there are better alternatives, but I've heard countless times that Linux is heavily preferred over Windows for servers.<br><br>So why is this faggot attempting to shove Linux down everyone's throats? Does he like being "different" or something?</br></br></br>  <br>yes</br>  <br>A complete Newfag to Linux is the only one that tries to prove a point. It's obvious that Linux is great, but it also has its issues. Plus, Ubuntu is shit compared to Mint. Mint just works, compared to Ubuntu.</br>  <br>For the average user, Ubuntu is a step down from windows. Fucking chromium and Firefox both have issues, all the opens our cell and even commercial drivers are shit, the boot time is slower, and simple tasks become a clusterfuck when using the terminal. Although, it doesn't use any resources unless you tell it to, which is nice for low end hardware, also the lxde desktop is really lightweight. Windows is constantly doing shit you don't want in the background.</br>  <br>Linux Mint?</br>  <br>linux is the standard for servers and security. if you never want anyone to get into your computer linux is it if you just want to do banking and play vidya windows is where its at. anyone that says linux is superior is wither very cheap or they dont play video cames... <br> if you dont play video games then linux is definitely superior. </br></br>  <br>ubuntu also just werks</br>  <br> Windows is constantly doing shit you don't want in the background. <br>Yea, but nowadays most "normy" PCs come with 8GB RAM, i3/i5 processors, does that point still stand?<br><br>Computers can more than handle OS background processes nowadays, so I don't really see the problem.</br></br></br></br>  I'd be careful about Ubuntu. Had some bad experiences with it. Like one day I installed it on my Laptop and when I installed updates an error message popped up. I had to restart the Laptop because I couldn't do anything. Not even TTY worked. After the reboot i couldnt move the cursor. This was a non early stages LTS version. Should be stable they said lol. Breaks easily. Better choose another Distro like Open SUSE or something like that.  you dont need a windows online account to use ubuntu  <br>I agree, I run 8.1 on my modern laptop with 8 Gb of RAM and a quad core 2.5ghz cpu, but I run Lubuntu on my 8 year old MacBook with 2 Gb RAM and a 2.2 Ghz core 2 duo.</br>  Can't fuck up your system as easy, also it tends to be more light weight  <br>Ubuntu is not a server os</br>  <br>its a real issue on laptops even gaming ones. they say its for tablets but it does shit all day long when you arent looking... I'm not kidding when i say all day long. it defrags then scans for viruses every security update which is like every day and on a laptop or tablet for some reason it doesnt reconize you are active on the computer after it starts the shit leading to horrible perfomance. Windows 8.1 is a mess.</br>  <br>Yes, play Witcher 3 or new games with 8gb of RAM and still thinking that.</br>  Ubuntu is inferior to ms windows in many ways, and superior in only a few ways. Ubuntu sucks when using a projector, 3rd party software compatibility, and basic software applications, among many other things. For desktop use, only the most common applications are complete and functional. I despise ms windows, but it works.  <br>bullshit. every linux in some way is server os. I like how when I update the distro it just keeps working... justify any other distro with point please.</br>  <br> ms windows <br> MS WINDOWS <br>basically, disregard all of which has been said by this poster.</br></br></br>  <br>he is old school you are new school fuck you.</br>  <br> more light weight <br><br>Read what I said above about nowadays standards for hardware. Most computers come with i3/i5 and 8GB RAM sometimes more, even i7 seems to be the norm for laptops nowadays.<br><br>So I believe talking about "lightweight" is a bit redundant nowadays, since in today's standards, everything's lightweight, especially when it comes to everyday stuff like Facebook, YouTube, banking, browsing the internet and watching movies.</br></br></br></br></br>  tl;dr:<br>op, install gentoo on Hurd</br>  <br> old school <br> implying being "old school" is better then being "new school" <br>fuck off</br></br></br>  <br>you do have to admit 8.1 is a bloated mess that slows operations down if you dont think this you are a millennial shitbag and we dont care about your opinion.</br>  <br>I love Linux but since I pretty much use my laptop for websurfing and games its useless. Linux is just overall faster and more secure than windows but unless you need to install linux then theres no point in fucking with it</br>  <br>it just means he knows more than you faggot.</br>  <br>The only problem with -buntu and other distros of lunix is THE FUCKING TERMINAL SHELL<br> And software installation without using markets like Windows can, FUCKING DEPENDENCES </br></br>  <br>I use W7 for everything except my laptop which I barely touch and it has 8.1. Not a fan of it but with the right customisation tools, you can "unbloat" 8.1 to make it good.</br>  <br> bragging about using Ubuntu of all things <br>Literally babys first linux distro</br></br>  Ubuntu is superior... I'd buy a Mac however  <br>So saying "ms windows" means he knows more than me?<br>If I said "gnu linux" would I be "old school" and know more than him?<br><br>Are you retarded?</br></br></br></br>  <br>if you would learn to use the terminal shell you could install software nigga</br>  I dual boot all of my machines between MS and Ubuntu. I spend most of my time in Ubuntu because I do a lot of shell scripting and Power Shell is annoying. I need Windows for certain applications that frankly suck with WINE and it's less hassle to just have a Windows partition I can boot into natively vs running Windows in a VM.<br><br>Having said all that, however, I have been a Linux user since the Slackware days and I've said time and time again that what will keep Linux out of the mainstream, regardless of distro, is X. X can be a hassle when it goes sideways even for veteran users, and is a complete nightmare for newcomers.</br></br>  <br> Mac is only good with audio editing </br>  <br>it is a very taxing os but when you game it is actually better but if you installed xp on your current computer you would shit your self at the responsiveness.</br>  <br> lunix <br> TERMINAL SHELL <br>what's wrong with using terminal faggot<br><br> software installation without using markets like Windows can <br>get a debian distro and just install a .deb archive faggot<br>or use the make utility<br>or just MOVE AN EXECUTABLE TO A DIRECTORY IN THE PATH LIKE YOU'RE NOT RETARDED</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it means he was around when it was called ms windows and you should listen to someone like that but why would you you impose your bullshit opinion on everyone you meet no matter what they know. neo /b/ folks.</br>  <br>ubuntu is pretty bloated m8. Unity is one of the most resource hogging DEs out there and you hardly get anything to show for it</br>  <br>I like XP but Windows 7 is superior and the difference in responsiveness negligible compared to the benefits you get.<br><br>My 8.1 laptop is not fit for gaming so I do everyday stuff on it and Windows 8.1 is decent for that.</br></br></br>  <br>Hey Is there anything like CCleaner(deletes old prefect data, browsing data,etc) for ubuntu?<br><br>I tried looking everywhere and asking /g/ but got no answers other than ''you can do it your self'' but CCleaner overwrites the data with 1's and 0's.</br></br></br>  <br> Ubuntu <br> superior to winhoes <br>Not really, both are shit-tier OS</br></br></br>  <br>i have ubuntu on a 128gb flash drive. it pretty useful to carry around a desktop of shit around with you.</br>  <br>its absolutely not negligible you never even had xp thats how I know your a faggot.</br>  <br> familiarity with ME and earlier <br> intricate understanding of 7/8/10 <br>one does not preclude the other</br></br></br>  <br>Stop making assumptions, fag. I've had both 98 and XP. Windows 7's built in search in Start menu was the main selling point for me.<br><br>Windows XP was great back in the day, but it's time to get on with the times.</br></br></br>  Linux shits all over microsoft and apple. <br>Can they run on 512 mb of ram?</br>  <br>it just means we knew what it used to be like. dont be a faggot know it all. youre really bad at it.</br>  <br>Say that to the normies, that's why linux is changed to windows in some areas of Germany, cuz the normal people are not going to learn to use that fucking old piece of crap called TERMINAL.</br>  <br>You would have to be pants on head retarded to install Ubuntu, Linux mint, eOS, puppy Linux, Kali, or anything with kde or gnome add the de (really any de but those especially) <br><br>All of those distros are designed solely for personal use</br></br></br>  <br>You really are fucking stupid. Jesus Christ.<br><br>So if you call something by it's outdated name, you're automatically smarter and know everything about it. Even thought what you say is bullshit. Ok, I understand.<br><br>Oh, and saying someone is "new school" and saying they don't know anything is totally not "impose[ing] your bullshit opinion on everyone you meet no matter what they know"<br><br>Just unplug your router.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  The biggest draw of Linux is the amount of options you have, I think. Also, it runs better on older/low power hardware. Gaming is a problem, but nowhere near as much as before. Linux ports are becoming much more common.  <br>You didnt look very hard apparently</br>  <br>they all break when you update the distro fuck off.</br>  <br> Can they run on 512 mb of ram? <br>Are you retarded? Even Windows 7 runs on 512mb of RAM.</br></br>  <br> it just means we knew what it used to be like <br> dont be a faggot know it all <br> WE KNOW MORE THAN YOU <br> YOU'RE BEING A FAGGOT KNOW-IT-ALL <br><br>Jesus fuck dude. Do you have to consciously try to be that fucking retarded?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It had pretty shitty reviews at the software center.</br>  <br>stfu millennial faggot your all fucking google faggots that cant think for themselves as evidenced by your bullshit posts.</br>  <br> W10 also could </br>  <br>XP is much faster than 8.1 do you understand what I'm saying?</br>  <br> we <br>you're such a faggot.<br> We're so special for using MS Windows <br>no nigger I used ms windows too, but they haven't called themselves ms windows in so long that I decided to MOVE ON</br></br></br></br>  <br>Almost all current Gen pc games are optimized for 8/8.1.</br>  Both suck , Arch Linux master race  <br> normies need to use a terminal for work <br> IT people can't use a terminal <br>wtf am i reading</br></br></br>  <br>Have fun trying to get Win7 working smoothly on 512mbs of RAM.<br>Of course RAM is insanely cheap these days, so it's not a huge deal, except maybe for cheap offices.</br></br>  <br>a lot of shit in the software center has shitty reviews. Try downloading it, using it, and formulating your own opinion</br>  <br>nice memes<br> "millennial faggot" <br> "your all fucking google faggots" <br>I'm making pages on knowyourmeme as we speak. Thank you for giving me these nice memes!</br></br></br></br>  <br>faggot.</br>  <br> Arch  <br> master race <br>pick one faggot</br></br></br>  <br>Still less bloated than Windows</br>  <br>doesnt address the actual point good job nobodys impressed.</br>  <br> I can't learn simple shit <br> I'm retarded <br>if you know how to fucking type, you know how to fucking terminal</br></br></br>  <br> Average user <br> Arch Linux </br></br>  <br> Sudo apt-get faggot </br>  I haven't switched to linux yet but so far my reasons are:<br>*Fuck microsoft and their piece of shit OS cheap fagggots<br>*Linux is free and open source<br>*I heard Linux is FAR more customizable because there are different "flavours" you can install because apparently Linux is only a kernel, and for example Linux Mint might be the full os basically means you can choose different looks and desktop styles and a bunch of other shit - useful because the fucking windows doesn't even fucking give enough customization to the start menu, the windows 8.1 shit is so fucked<br>PS if you lose your windows copy and dont have recovery because the fuckheads are so fucked theres an error, LINUX IS FREE SO YOU DONT HAVE TO FUCKING DOWNLOAD CRACK TORRENTS OR SPEND ON ANOTHER FUCKING COPY<br><br>FUCK YOU WINDOWS<br><br>/rant</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> the most casualfag Linux <br> the best thing ever made </br></br>  <br>leave em be they know not which they do.</br>  <br>8/10<br>gentoo's alright too, but building everything from source is a little retarded</br></br>  <br>Probably because there was no point dipshit.</br>  <br>KDE distros are less bloated than windows</br>  <br>STFU stupid dumb dumb.</br>  <br><br> Other than being free, what are some of its benefits that'd apply mainly to the average user? <br><br>It's more efficient; a shitty ten year old rig can still run perfectly on Linux, even though it'd be trash if you put windows on it. That means you basically never need to upgrade your hardware, and you never need to pay for software updates. It extends your battery life if you're on a laptop, since your computer won't need as much energy to run. You're practically guaranteed to never get a virus. Also, you don't need to worry about Microsoft fucking around with your computer. <br><br> What about support for games <br><br>Windows is much better when it comes to gaming just because it's so much better supported. If gaming is a big priority for you then just get Windows. If you want the best of both worlds and you don't mind restarting your computer, dual booting is also an option. <br><br> ...Programs, etc? <br><br>There's a shitload of programs that Linux doesn't support, but in almost every case you can either get by using something like Wine, or you can find a free alternative that's just as good. <br><br><br>If you aren't very tech savvy, don't bother with Linux. If you play a lot of games, stay away from Linux unless you don't mind restarting your computer all the time to dual boot. Other then that, Linux is probably the better operating system.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> open source <br>Normies don't care/don't know about open source tho.<br><br>You ask them what it means and they keep mumbling "muh open source".</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not when you actually start doing it, things always run so much smoother when compiled for your own system</br>  <br>This is wrong. 8.1 uses UEFI, and ripped a bunch of shit off Unix based OS's. Show me your data.</br>  <br> yum install faggot </br>  All can i say is Android<br> /thread </br>  <br>Duh but still too bloated for a server</br>  <br> not shitposting from hardened OpenBSD <br> not auditing every single piece of code <br> using insecure OS <br> 1998+17 <br>pleb</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you dont even have a copy of xp you faggot stfu.<br> thats ok I'll google it. </br></br>  <br>dumb dumb faggot boy. do you think you are fooling anyone?</br>  <br>I'm talking about Linux for modern computers. If you have a modern computer then your first point is null.</br>  <br>Have fun with:<br> almost zero fucking driver support <br> googling shit and copying and pasting code into the terminal when shit inevitably breaks <br> no games <br> popular software on windows not supported <br> lots of other shit </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>free is right.<br><br>free as in you don't pay for it.<br>free as in you are free to do whatever you imagine without an annoying user interface shoved up your ass.<br>free as in free from viruses and security holes and windoz niggerware</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Using a 14 year old OS <br>It was solid of course, but Jesus Christ.</br></br>  <br>are you a mac fag? you sound like a mac fag.</br>  <br>yes. though the internal workings of different flavours is slightly different.<br>if you find a flavour you like, you can just install a different desktop or theme on it anyway.</br></br>  Ubuntu is nigger Linux.  <br>It honestly isn't on modern hardware<br><br>For one 32 bit on all stable versions (yes they made a 64 pro version but it was very buggy)<br><br>It also has a maximum support of 3GB ram</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I actually have unused 2 copies of XP professional right now. I'm also a different person than who you are arguing with.</br>    <br>windows 10 fag. I liked using linux but theres just no practical reason for me to use it and driver support is shit as well as other reasons i listed</br>  <br>Nice misconceptions there, mate</br>  <br>the point you imbicile is that its faster. why would an 8 year old os be FASTER than the new os and why would you want a slower os in the first place?</br>  <br>yeah, that's what I've heard. I didn't notice much except when doing benchmarks. That said, if I want to install something that requires 20+ dependencies, it takes a while to compile everything.</br>  <br>Yeah if you legit want to know whether you should switch:<br>* If you are tech savvy and don't want cheap shit<br>* If you don't support microsoft and want them to die in a hole<br>* If you appreciate the people who put effort into things<br>* If you have the resources to have both os just in case linux doesn't have what you want, but overall you hate microsoft because theyre faggots</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>mad because its true</br>  <br>I kind of want to see what Win10 can do.
