[ Hello everybody, serious post here. I was just on a thread, guessed my number right. OP said he'd show "CP" newfag me not knowing what it is, got a number right. He showed some disturbing content, and the thread is now gone. Can I get in trouble for this? I'm under 18, I'm actually terrified right now, please reassure me ASAP.    <br>Good chance that mods/FBI was watching the thread. Plus, you're under 18. Get on SFW</br>  FBI.gov and you're fucked  <br>Was there as well saw the images didnt click then clicked then said oh.. then went on about my way as the police raided a meth house across the road from me.<br>No.</br></br>  <br>Seriously man get off 4chan right now. If you're on a laptop microwave that shit and toss it. It's your best bet.</br>  <br>shit... your fucked op</br>  <br>So you participate in a thread which spanned over two threads in hopes of what?</br>  <br>Take pics of the methhouse?</br>  <br>You're going to prison. /life</br>    <br>Thank you anon. I'm a fucktard, I actually fight against CP. Its a horrible thing.</br>  <br>Or take a drill and drill it through your hard drive</br>  <br>If you saw it, don't announce it, faggot.</br>  <br>Yeah man, you need to do a clean slate</br>  OP here. I need you guys to be serious. I'm actually terrified. I'm scared for my life. Please be serious here. I'm on a phone.  <br>I recommend drilling holes in your hard drive and microwaving any and all micro-sd cards in your house. should clear it all up and the FBI v&amp; will never know what happened. good luck and god speed op</br>  <br>People will go to hell. Wash your eyes man</br>  <br>Like I said, if you saw it, don't announce it, DELETE THIS POST before thing get bad.</br>  Just call 911. I heard they solve problems  Seriously, you need to calm down and just the computer you saw it on. Back everything up and toast it.  <br>your on a phone? that makes it easier for the fbi to find you</br>  <br>What the hell is that pic supposed to be?</br>  <br>cp is only illegal when intentionally downloaded or shared<br>you are fine</br></br>  <br>  put phone in microwave <br>  turn microwave on </br></br>  <br>in these cases the police usually raid you the next morning for looking at cp. It's a very serious offense and the police dont take it likely. when you are the one who got dubs you are the one who made the op post cp and therefore you are the one in trouble. since it was posted on the internet its counted as an interstate matter and likely the fbi will be involved. i would turn myself in to the fbi as soon as possible if i was you.</br>  DELET THIS POST before people start fucking with your life.  <br>you fight against it yet you try to get a case opened which potentially contains it? You know whats funny is the fact you said later on a post that we were welcome like you were proud of it.</br>  How Can CP Be Real If Children Aren't Real??  <br>Don't listen to this guy.</br>  <br>  police dont take it likely <br>  take it likely <br>  likely </br></br></br>  Talk to the feds. I'm sure they will understand. Good luck.  <br>Like I said, no idea what it was just trying to look like I knew what I was talking about. How do I delete a post? I'm a serious newfag.</br>  you will be taken away by a needlessly grumpy man with a bag shouting "I don't care how old you are, get in the fucking bag"  <br>they take it hatfully</br>  Just confess and they'll give you a lesser sentence.  It's ok, FBI look at CP all the time. How else will they know that it isn't?  <br>dude cmon. The kid neds help</br>  <br>im with this guy. i would go to the nearest fbi station tonight and confess to your crimes. its the only way.</br>  <br>this</br>  OP is 100% going to get died  If you really want some advice, best bet is you're just too paranoid. your life is alright  <br>Please lurk more you fucking child.</br>  <br>Call them first and let them know you're coming. They'll prep a cell with a nice inmate and everything.</br>  You live in Angola right? I don't think they have laws about that there. You will be fine.  <br>This. It's only a matter if time before the FBI triangulates your location. Your local police department will be at knocking on your front door by tomorrow morning. May as well save yourself the shame from your parents.</br>  <br>Thanks man. Its 1 in the morning, parents are asleep. I got nothing to do, can't turn myself in even if I wanted to.</br>  <br>V&amp; and B&amp;, Faggot</br>    OP YOU ARE SO FUCKED HOLY FUCK RUN AWAY  <br>make sure you apologize a lot to make sure they know youre being sincere</br>  <br>So lemme get this straight. <br>  Joins a thread where cp is potentially involved <br> Participates in said thread and is the main cause of the cp being produced in the thread <br> More than likely watched what was posted/downloaded said stuff <br> Bragged about winrar telling us we were welcome <br><br>Sometimes fitting in is not the best option.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you think pedos become cops for this very purpose?</br>  <br>This fuckin' guy.</br>  <br>i hear if you call ahead they give you a better cell and a nicer roommate. It worked for my uncle joey. They even gave him a TV</br>  <br>Yes you can, just call the police and tell them what you did.</br>  <br>DELETE THE POST, people will file reports, make raids and report you.</br>  <br>A TV?! I was lucky to get a cell mate that didn't rape me every night.</br>  Youre going to jail but do not worry, god will forgive you. The only thing that matters is the forgiveness of god  <br>get some rest and take a breath, man</br>  <br>Prepare to be banned underage faggot</br>  why a woman lets that a guy take a picture like this one?<br><br>saved from /b/ 3 days ago<br><br>so... post what you have<br><br>do women think in the future and so...?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why English no good you?</br>  <br>English am are hard</br>  <br>When women love you they don't think and they let you do whatever you want to them</br>  - Has anyone really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like?  <br>Yes you're right, they'll do anything but sometimes the men will do even more even though they didn't mean to hurt them.<br>41°25′39″N 74°25′30″W</br></br>  <br>Why the latitude and longitude, did you bury somebody there?</br>  <br>why not she aint showing face</br>  Indulkana Airport?

I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it.

But def do so. Maybe make a tumblr or some shit so its easier to find</br>  Amazing tits.  How can atheist really believe that the universe was made from nothing? Thats like saying if you leave an empty jar with a lid on it for billions of years (even though time wouldnt exist yet because the universe wouldnt) then there would be a mini-universe in the jar.  <br>Your statement just goes to show how dumb theists are</br>  where did your god came from?  <br>inb4 "10/10bait" I would like a serious answer</br>  <br>where did the universe come from? certainly not nothing</br>  enlighten us with ur wisdom and tell us who created the universe  <br>Im not saying that i know who or what did, but until there is proof of what caused it, I shall stay with my THEORY (yes a theory because its not proved) that God did.</br>  and because u believe in ur theory u think ur better than everyone else? u think ur theory is better than everyone elses? cause from the way ur talking ur saying atheists are stupid  <br>They are if they actually believe that nothing creating something</br>  <br>Then what created God? It's the same thing you fucking fuck are you trolling right now?<br>If something can't come from nothing how did God come from nothing</br></br>  <br>how can mirrors be real if our eyes aren't real?</br>  Atheists don't specifically believe the universe was made from nothing - they don't really believe anything because it's easy and it allows them to feel superior to a large segment of a population  <br>I never said I knew.<br><br>Atheist dont believe in god which means they believe in the big bang theory</br></br></br>  its like planet earth. no god didnt create us or the other animals like he says in his boring stories, google that shit  <br>Never watched that before</br>  <br>It's not a theory, its a hypothesis since there is no evidence. The best theory right now of how matter came to be states that matter came out of energy, and that energy i referred to came to be from nothing, what is physically possible. Let's say that from a system with absolute 0 energy X energy becomes matter because of relativity. The resulting -X comes in the form of gravity, or if you prefer negative potential energy.</br>  <br>where did your turn to ask a question come from? certainly not from answering the one given you</br>  where did God come from then religifag  <br>That's not even a hypothesis since it's not testable.</br>  so if u guys believe in god why are u sitting on ur computer and not sell it and help people? I mean if I believed I would get eternal life for like 70 years of helping other people and doing the celibate thing, i woulnt be masturbating twice a day believe me  <br> Atheist dont believe in god which means they believe in the big bang theory <br>That's completely wrong. Atheist is just defined as someone who does not believe in a deity. Even if they believe in spirits and souls or if they don't believe in evolution or the big bang they are still atheists.</br></br>  <br><br>What you were replying to isn't even a hypothesis, I mean.</br></br>  <br>The one i said or god? Because they already create matter from pure energy in laboratory and that's also mathematically possible.</br>  <br>Being an atheist means you don't believe in god, not that the universe comes from nothing.</br>  <br>Christians don't believe in abiogenesis but believe an invisible Sky Daddy can create man out of dirt and magic. Also believe he created woman from a rib mixed w magic.<br><br>Christians don't believe in evolution but can't explain all of the races on earth, the fossil record, etc. Many believe the Invisible Sky Daddy planted fossils to "test their faith".</br></br></br>  <br>You are making 0 sense.<br><br>Let me rephrase that, MOST atheist i know*** which is quite a lot</br></br></br>  <br>as stated earlier, if you even bothered to read. I never said i knew.</br>  <br>Because a giant floating man in the sky of a single planet fits so much better</br>  Anybody can find the answer to questions like these if they look hard enough. Not saying I know the answer but I know I could find out. And no I don't mean with science bullshit, I mean with cold, hard journeys of consciousness.  <br><br>still better than believing nothing came from something, and we evolved from fish and monkeys</br></br>  <br>Christians that don't accept (or understand) evolution ACTUALLY BELIEVE that it teaches we are direct descendants of monkeys.<br><br>Christians that think God created the universe can't explain who created God. Everything has to come from something except for God. The Invisible Sky Daddy is their ultimate loophole when they run out of logical explanations.<br><br>Christians don't realize the God of the gaps is slowly diminishing in purpose. As science progresses their fables are proven false and they either accept the facts and claim the Bible was "metaphorical in that regard" or cling to it and invent a bizarre narrative to make it coincide with science.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> a rib mixed w magic <br>fucking lol'd</br></br>  <br><br>pic related</br></br>    <br>You still havent answered who created the universe</br>  <br> believing nothing came from something <br> we evolved from fish and monkeys <br><br>Agreed, because no one believes that</br></br></br></br>  The big bang doesnt come from nothing this has been established in modern science  <br>our origins as a species are probably a lot like in the movie jupiter ascending tbh.</br>  <br>No, i said it doesn't anymore sense than religion.</br>  <br> You still havent answered who created the universe <br>Because you are asking the wrong question and IMPLYING a creator. The big bang is a fact. Go google red shift, microwave background radiation, the fact the universe is expanding, etc, etc, etc. There are hundreds of evidences that explain the Big Bang with actual science that has been duplicated and confirmed.<br><br>Christians actually believe a Scientific Theory is like any old theory they pull out of their ass. http://www.notjustatheory.com/</br></br></br></br>  <br>The big bang theory doesn't say "something came from nothing" - just that ~14 billion years ago the universe was super tiny and then expanded rapidly</br>  <br>THIS! FUCKING THIS! <br>I should've probably just posted this instead of trying to explain it myself.</br></br>    <br>I know. It's saying that it's possible that nothing (no energy) can create the something (the universe). And it's likely that's how it went down.</br>  <br>Christian belief is founded in fear. Christians are afraid of death. There is no evidence of heaven or an after life. Life after death experiences have been debunked and proven to be chemical reactions from a distressed brain. The fear of non-existence eats at their self importance and piety so they prefer fairy tales.<br><br>Christians can't handle not knowing something. They prefer to give the Invisible Sky Daddy credit for anything and everything they don't understand instead of being intellectually honest and saying "I dont know and I might never know but that's probably something we should invest resources in understanding". Instead of funding science they try to pretend a 2000 year old book has all the answers and if it doesn't then they "aren't important". Yet they use MRI machines and all of the things science has brought about to help their health. They could always resort to prayer and their Invisible Sky Daddy can heal anything but they opt for Science...</br></br></br>    If You Believe In A Flying Jew Then GBA with your life  <br>Can't tell if troll or if u really full on retarded. Hundreds of evidences? Duplicating the big bang? No, the big bang is not a fact it's just a theory. How about you contemplate the universe for one second instead of letting "science" decide what you think. People like you are just as bad as religious nuts.</br>  I personally believe there might be a god. But of course I also know any religion created by man is bullshit. Whether there is or isn't a god doesn't concern me and how the universe started I could give 2 less shits. What I am concerned about is Muslims, Christians, Jews etc. calling evolution bullshit and believe their stupid little scripts forged by dumb ancient arabs.    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;625888888 <br>wait for it.</br>  <br>there would be a mini universe in the jar though..</br>  <br>The evidences have been duplicated, not the big bang obviously. I'm fully confident you are a full on retard. Red shift is a fact. Microwave background radiation is a fact. Expanding universe is a fact. Facts everywhere. You don't know what a scientific theory is. You don't understand the scientific method. Keep pretending your 2000 year old book of Immaculate Conception is based in science.</br>  <br>check Buddhism out tho. The one religion that didn't go full retard.</br>    <br>What lead you to the belief that there is a possibility an Invisible Sky Daddy, higher power, or supernatural explanation is better than a scientific one?</br>  <br>  How about you contemplate the universe for one second instead of letting "science" decide what you think <br><br>I almost let that watchmaker argument go past me.</br></br></br>  Does no-one remember the Futurama episode when they went to the end of time -_-?<br>Thats litterally the best theory there is next to God. The universe created itself</br>  <br>I said might holy shit calm your tits. A deity is extremely unscientific and cannot be explained scientifically so it is still a probability.</br>  <br>Sitting around contemplating things is way more reliable than Science, I've found.</br>  <br>You're right. But I meant basically every other religion that's followed today that includes a god.</br>  Where does god come from  <br>And you apparently didn't read my question or come anywhere near answering it. What is it that makes you think a God is a possibility? What makes you think that possibility would be a good one?<br><br>Ever heard of Russells Tea Pot?</br></br></br>  <br>not on my watch</br>  <br>This is the beauty of religious logic. God gets a hall pass...<br><br>everything must have a creator<br>god didn't need a creator<br>universe couldn't have just existed<br>god simply existed<br><br>All 4 statements are true to your average Christian...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Quantum foam. Begin to understand theoretical physics and quantum physics and the behavior of quantum level things and the need for a creator is nullified.</br>    <br>I did answer your question fine but you're really shoving it in my face as if you're saying "I'M RIGHT I'M RIGHT LOOK HERE IT SAYS I'M RIGHT"<br><br>Russells Tea Pot has to do with SCIENTIFIC EXPLANATION. A deity cannot be explained scientifically and therefore scientifically does not exist. It is still a probability, regardless.<br>^ and that's why I believe there _MIGHT_ be a god.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's not gravity. Gravity isn't even a real force. It's simply a phenomenon resulting from the movement of objects through higher dimensional curved spacetime.</br>  Well if it was made from something how did that something come into existence?  <br>Not sure if you're supporting me or mocking me here.</br>  <br>because according to all the scientific theories<br>nothing is everything and everything is nothing<br>and if im not corrected when negative energy and positive energy are basically at an equal level the big bang happens or something<br><br>i dunno go read</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>dude that wont work. they literally spent 2000 fucking years making up excuses to anything u throw at em. They will tell u you need to interpretate that shit. They literally believe in shit written by retards its sad I'm not even joking</br>  <br>Debating irrational atheists is near impossible. One may bring up any number of philosophy - such as Aquinas's gambits - and they will always be met with the retort of "LOL YOU BELIEVE IN A MAGICAL SKY WIZARD YOU RETARD"<br>Incidentally I am also an atheist, but a large number of them are just as irrational as radical theists.</br></br>  <br> and that's why I believe there _MIGHT_ be a god. <br><br>So you dont think he can be "scientifically explained". So you don't think science is a reliable method of validating all things and that a God gets a free pass in this one case? Holy fuck you are retarded. Go be a Mormon or Scientologists you fucking idiot.</br></br></br>  <br> not understanding that scientific theory is not the same as the colloquial definition of theory but using it as a retort anyway </br>  <br>Atheist siding with a theist who is irrational. Only on /b/...</br>  <br>Your problem is that you're not trying to find an answer, you're just trying to make yourself seem right. I'm not a theist, I'm just saying you could be wrong.<br><br><br>I mean the thing is we don't know and these people are acting like they do. I'm okay with not knowing. And the amount of people that aren't are showing pretty badly.</br></br></br></br>  <br>oh i understand and what i said still stands. Enjoy your retardation though.</br>  <br>I believe almost every aspect of theism is senseless. However so many atheists who claim to be empiristic and rational refuse to discuss in civility the few points that theists do have in favor of their belief systems. Deism is typically the one I find most favorable, as there is no text written to dictate ones behavior and that is claimed to be divine intervention as the "word of god" or anything so absurd.</br>  <br> implying intensifies <br>Maybe if you weren't stupid. You'd pay attention instead of saying "MUH ATHEISM"<br><br>I'm saying deities are unscientific, meaning science doesn't apply to them. They cannot be proven, so scientifically they're not real. <br>Doesn't mean it isn't 100% not real for a fact. There is a possibility something that cannot be sensed by a human naturally or with the aid of any equipment is real.<br><br>I didn't fucking say it was a fact god is real, now fuck off to your ignorance club.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Life is reality i know its scary for delusional theist like you. You believe that imagery men talk to you.  <br>There is more evidence indicating that our universe does not need a creator than there is that it does need one, but not enough to definitively prove it. So your belief system is fine as long as it is deistic or agnostic in nature. If you succumb to those with scriptures claiming to be the word of god intervening in the daily life of humans on this small world in the vast universe, those beliefs are silly.</br>  <br><br>Why do you persist with this feeble minded bullshit?</br></br>  <br>Of course. See </br>  <br>Your aptitude with the English language seems equally delusional.</br>  it is thought by many that there was one single mass of all matter that was very hot and the size of a single atom, it then exploded creating the big bang  <br>Good; at least you're sensible about the idea. The only problem I have with religious beliefs (outside the bigotry, slaughter, oppression, etc.) is that it discouraged scientific progress on some level. When faced with a difficult problem, those of faith are more tempted to dismiss it as "God did it, we can't know how." rather than solving the problem at hand. Other than that, to each their own. Live an enjoyable life for the ~80 years you have before getting canned by the very entity that spawned you.(read: Universe)</br>  <br>i dont plan on going to your door and giving you a bible chill fam chill</br>  <br>Ugh, "chill fam."<br>You're underaged. However, I'll reply anyway. I'm simply saying secularism is better for scientific progress.</br></br>      <br>shit you're onto me<br><br>anyway, are you saying me believing theres a small possibility theres a god will ruin my ability to increase my scientific knowledge or</br></br></br>  <br>If you hit a wall and encounter a difficult problem, you will be more inclined to dismiss it as "God's work" rather than focusing on how to solve the problem itself. With no belief in deities, there is only the problem and how it can be solved; no scapegoats.</br>  <br>Hey that's prejudice</br>  Nothing is happening right now.  <br>/thread</br>    <br> However so many atheists who claim to be empiristic and rational refuse to discuss in civility the few points that theists do have in favor of their belief systems <br>Deism is also an appeal to the supernatural for the purposes of creation. There is zero reason to think it might suddenly become a rational answer when every other appeal to the supernatural over thousands of years has failed. Why not say "we dont know" rather than "well MAYBE this deity caused the big bang"? How is that a better answer?<br><br>Any other "points" you want to give them credit for?</br></br></br></br>  <br>/endthread</br>    why the fuck am I trying to reason with theists.<br>they are way too mindfucked</br>  <br>I reiterate: I too am an atheist. And there are very few points. This website indexes them quite nicely, although the format takes a bit of adjustment at first. Follow the link if you truly care what I'm talking about here, or just call me a faggot and move on. Either is fine.<br><br>http://www.positiveatheism.org/faq/<wbr>arguindex.htm#theist</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>In a few billion years, the Milky Way, Andromeda, and the rest of our local group of galaxies will be the only portion of the universe that is detectable from what is now the Milky Way. It will appear from the observable facts at that point that the universe is constant and eternal. <br>Will those facts at that time prove the universe is, in fact, in a steady state? Of course not. And the facts we see today don't 'prove' any theory including the Big Bang.<br>Obviously, this certainly is no evidence of a deity.</br></br></br>  <br>We need more atheists to become street epidemiologists. Rather than saying "let them believe what they want" or "let's hear them out" as if to feign empathy is just disingenuous. You need to call them out on it and stop the irrational belief. These people can vote. These people drive decisions in our society. It just takes one irrational moment and suddenly they are starting a war against an Axis of Evil.</br>  <br>A New theory suggests that The Universe Evolved from the Black Hole of a Collapsed 4-D Star.<br>http://www.dailygalaxy.com/my_weblo<wbr>g/2015/07/big-bang-nixed-our-univer<wbr>se-evolved-from-the-black-hole-of-a<wbr>-collapsed-4-d-star-todays-most-pop<wbr>ular.html</wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>those are all the same tired "points" they've tried for thousands of years.<br><br>Pascals wager? You really think that is worth discussing with them?<br><br>All of these arguments and appeals (to ignorance) are simply shot down by referencing a science text book. Now I KNOW you're a troll.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>so you suddenly will throw out these facts because they wont be observable using present day technology in the future? All of my face palm. I guess you can join a great religion then...</br>  <br>While I agree we must abolish the faiths, publicly chastising those who were indoctrinated into it at such an early age they have no way to believe anything else is not the way to do it. Introduce them to alternatives and appeal to whatever reason the have maintained, but these people are thinking humans. They will come around in time, but the humanitarian and egalitarian approach is not to cull them like sick farm animals. It must be a gradual process or there will be civil unrest and possible societal collapse.</br>  OP is right. Except Jesus who our savior into your soul. It is a fact that he died for your sins on the cross.  <br> not proved!! Hurr just a THEORY!! <br>Like the theory or gravity? Or is that also just a THEORY.</br></br>  <br>ITT: atheists actually believe you can reason with theists and "propose alternatives" based on rational thought that will get them to suddenly and mysteriously abandon their faith.<br><br>Shock treatment works far better. You throw the facts in their face and rub their nose in it. They might hate you. They might call you "angry". They might call you "mean". At the end of the day they will have to either accept night and day facts or continue to believe fantasies knowing they are a fool. They grew to their irrational state by planting seeds of faith. Now I'm bombing the fuck out of them with seeds of doubt.</br></br></br>  <br>If a deity can't be explained scientifically, then what are you even talking about? If you can't even explain the basic concept of what a deity is and have no evidence to suggest the same, then there is no use spending time thinking about it, because you don't even know what it is you are thinking about.</br>  <br><br>let's attack the most retarded version of the opposing view because we're too lazy to argue anything substantial</br></br>  <br>I agree. However those who claim to be empiricists should not outright shut down these arguments when they're presented. Discuss them rationally and explain WHY they are wrong. Some things are still rocky since we have yet to definitively prove our universe is self sustainable and is capable of creating itself - although there is a large amount of evidence indicating just this. Some theists can make rational points concerning these things. It's a disservice to those who desire to learn about the unknown to simply dismiss these conversations concerning their unknown. Refer to my post here  it must be a gradual process showing people the truth on these things before any progress may be made.<br>I assure you I'm not a troll. I just prefer to see things from multiple angles and look at the big picture of things, and look to how the world may be rather than how it is.</br></br>  <br>you STILL arent reading what I wrote. Let's say it is POSSIBLE. Just like unicorns are possible. And aliens. And big foot.<br><br>Why in gay hell would you give credence to it as a valid possibility in the absence of evidence? You even state that there is NO evidence but you're willing to submit to the idea. WHY? It isn't rational. It's just mindless banter and you stuck in circular logic.</br></br></br>  <br>You have way more time on your hands than anybody I know.</br>  <br>How so?</br>  <br>Evil exists because God allowed it to. He did not create evil, but gave every being free will, which allowed for someone to deviate from God's will.<br>Now, assuming God is omniscient, he knew exactly what would happen in the garden before he even created it. Why leave free will in there if it just fucks everything up? Because without free will, everyone would be kind of soulless. Also, without the existence of evil, there would never be true feelings of love, joy, or happiness because you wouldn't know the other end of it.</br></br>  <br>You sound like you care less about truth and more about proving there's no god because it would validate your own misery - just saying<br><br>And also, people supposing the existence of an ultimate being, or a source of creation, is different than supposing a magical unicorn or whatever - the former is an abstract philosophical concept and the latter is arbitrary and silly.</br></br></br>  the thing about theist people is they dont see humans as just another animal. they think they are superior to them. well just think of this: if u couldnt comunicate with other people how could you tell ur sons about god. How could u know about god? Luckily for you people developed languages and ways of comunication, otherwise we would be just another animal living like other animals. you are not much smarter than animals. if u had never seen a mirror u too would be surprised and scared like cats in youtube videos :)<br><br>so stop being a fucking dickhead and understand ur just another animal, and if it werent for ur communication skills, you would be a totally common animal, and maybe that would be best for this planet. maybe by fucking up this planet like we will eventually we will fuck up something else.<br><br>theres also a cool theory that only ur conscience exists because thats is all u can prove the existence of. go for that theists it's way cooler than ancient gods with ugly sandals</br></br></br></br>  <br>You totally failed to respond to his points so I judge you as lazy, dumb, apathetic, or some combination</br>  Atheists are forgetting one thing. Somebody had to do the creating. Therefor the bible is true. Checkmate.  <br>We could be a program running inside an elaborate machine, and everything is merely an illusion. <br>We can detect scientifically that everything our scenes tell us about the world is an illusion in a certain sense, i.e. atoms are mostly empty space, and time is relative to speed.<br> Anything is possible, there is no way to prove or disprove the existence of a deity. But to have faith that your particular deity exists just because you were born in the right nation/family/belief system is just silly.<br> I don't mean you personally, and am in agreement with you that there is zero reason to believe. </br></br></br></br>  <br>It's like you're not reading all my posttssssss</br>  <br> Also, without the existence of evil, there would never be true feelings of love, joy, or happiness because you wouldn't know the other end of it. <br>So your God is ultra boring and without Satan you can never know true happiness? So Satan is a necessary evil? So you need to follow Satan once in a while? Your delusional psychobabble knows no end.<br><br>If God allowed evil to exist then he is the minister of evil.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well that's conditional and irrelevant.<br><br>It's possible that something that can't be proven to exist, exists. For fucks sake. I keep saying the same thing. There's nothing else to it.</br></br></br>  <br>the reality is, if you believe in an omniscient god, then you accept that you won't be able to know everything, or comprehend it. Whether or not you can believe in something while keeping that in mind is up to the individual.</br>  <br>I care about the truth. We aren't talking about truth though. The topic is Invisible Sky Gods for $100.<br><br>What if the Unicorn IS the ultimate creator? You are throwing out all of these possibilities without giving them each detail to the Nth degree of minutia that they claim they deserve.</br></br></br>  <br>I won't likely be here in billions of years.<br>Do you think we are the only life forms to develop, or that will evolve, in the galaxy?<br>Another intelligent life could evolve to observe those facts, without the benefit of our observable facts.</br></br></br>  How can atheism be real if god is real?  <br>I'm bored w you. You have made it apparent you like to spend endless hours re-exploring minutia of baseless claims that have been proven false over hundreds of years ago in most cases. I have no time for you. Bring up something new and valid for the existence of God or gtfo. Not sure why you are an apologist for religion when you claim to be an atheist. I think you're a closet theist.</br>  <br>there absolutely is evidence - it's not empirical, but there is totally logical evidence for there being a "source of creation" or "ultimate being"<br><br>for example, tracing the origin of existence backwards to infinity (to an infinite or ultimate source of being) makes more sense than our universes origin story randomly terminating at a finite point. WHY? Because it's simpler that way, and in the absence of other evidence, you go with the simplest explanation. <br><br>There's no proof for god or related ideas, but the same could be said for science. And obviously there are some genuinely batshit beliefs in religion but that goes for many ideologies, and you're only hurting yourself if you fail to see that there are meaningful ideas buried in the bullshit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Go to bed Jaden.</br>  <br>And what I keep saying is UNTIL YOU HAVE THE PROOF (which you claim there will never be ANY proof) then WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT?<br><br>Yes, fairies might exist. Yes, aliens might exist. Until you have some proof why waste another breath discussing them? Does it give you a boner to ponder endless possibilities of nonsense just because it MIGHT be possible?</br></br></br>    <br>Sleep tite puppers</br>  <br>there are as many molecules of air in a single breath as there are stars in the observable universe<br><br>and you still think that someone living in the clouds that watches over YOU when you weewee?<br><br> mfw </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> for example, tracing the origin of existence backwards to infinity (to an infinite or ultimate source of being) makes more sense than our universes origin story randomly terminating at a finite point. <br>You just made it abundantly clear you don't understand what the big bang is. Either that or you are hinting at the multiverse and don't realize it but are calling the multiverse God.</br></br>  <br>I agree with you to a point... Anything is possible... the question is what is probable?</br>  <br>There is some as of yet undiscovered law of the universe dictating that I am typing this sentence and that you shall soon read it. There are currently too many unknowns about this universe and life in general to definitively state either way that one side is correct, or more correct than the other, or anything of the sort. As you stated, we are in agreement here about theism being a silly venture. However, given the sheer magnitude of our ignorance, we have no right to scoff at deists either. They're simply trying to understand the workings of things in the same manner as the rest of us, just with a different methodology. I just want to let it be known that it's not absolutely absurd to think that perhaps something may have had to intervene to create the situation we are in now - be it an advanced intelligence and we are a simulation, or some sort of deity behind the scenes. We simply don't know enough to have a final say yet.</br>  <br>Basically he loves the numbers 1 and 0 and likes dividing 1 by 0 and wondering in his mind if the 1 or infinity that results is "more important".</br>  <br>these pictures you're posting... do you think they make you seem like an intelligent, enlightened person?</br>  <br>So did he fail or did it work? If it worked, then I don't need to worry about it. If he failed, then why should I accept a looser?</br>  <br>that filename triggers me<br> muslim <br> atheist </br></br></br>  <br> the question is what is probable? <br>Don't know, don't care. I'm more focusing on what we have today.</br></br>  <br>theists = explain the origin of the universe, origin of life, morality, etc.<br><br>deists = explain the origin of the universe came from a deity and everything else is scientifically explainable.<br><br>God of the Gaps much? You still haven't provided ANY rational explanation for why a deity would be necessary. Why, with all the other scientific options out there would you go to supernatural explanations when you quickly accept that all other supernatural claims by theists are bunk. You. Make. No. Sense.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>uh you realize science advances because people explore ideas with explanatory power before there's proof?</br>  <br>do you think that was my intention with posting memes or do you think just MAYBE it was to get theists pissed off and butt hurt to incite even more ridiculous responses so their irrational belief system could be further exposed?</br>  <br>That was more of an after thought.<br>Have you read the Silmarilion? Tolkien's creation of evil in that universe is pretty similar to what I'm trying to say.</br></br>  <br>Yup. You realize you stated a couple dozen posts ago that there is NO proof because he can't be proven scientifically yet you keep touting all sorts of possibilities that we could never prove and think we should discuss them...</br>  <br>Philosophy rarely makes concrete sense. The idea is always to make one think, not to show one answers. Our ignorance is why it may be necessary. We don't know enough either way to state who is correct.</br>  <br><br>OP, are you serious about this question? I mean I have to ask because you might be that person posting that girl from the Never Ending Story.<br><br>If you are serious, I'll respond. <br><br>We exist therefore whether, or not a creator created the Universe is a rather misguided question.<br><br>We see time at linear, forward movement. Time itself slows the more as the gravity of a mass in space has. The larger the mass, the slower time. Outside of this Universe there is no time, so asking how this Universe came to be is missing the point. This Universe exists, and perhaps without the slowing of space time by gravity none of that matters.<br><br>Perhaps the Universe created itself. All one mass appearing to be tiny separate parts, only because time seems to make it appear separated momentarily as we see it.<br><br>Outside of time it is all one mass. Past, future, and present all the same. One mass.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So you prop up weak arguments from the Bible w Tolkien? That's a first for me... let me take that in...</br>  <br>And if the apocalyptic religifaggs get their way, we may never know, because they hope to destroy the planet to help out their sky-daddy wipe out evil ironically. That is the scariest part about some of the religious.</br>  <br>sick of this shit.<br><br>atheism has nothing to do with the creation of the universe or evolution or abiogenesis or anything like that.<br><br>it only means you dont believe in god. this isnt a difficult concept to understand.<br><br>theists all make personal choices about their belief in the creation of the universe, evolution, etc. atheists do the same thing. the only difference is that atheists dont believe in sky daddy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Precisely why I believe theism is "bunk" and deism and the like are permissible.</br>  <br>Good thing I made it abundantly clear, not just clear. Nice use of the word abundantly, bravo<br><br>The big bang theory doesn't say shit about the beginning of ALL OF EXISTENCE, just that our universe was super tiny, then expanded rapidly. We don't know where our universe fits into the puzzle of existence, but it would foolish to assume that this is all there is, just like it was foolish to assume that the earth was the center of the universe and our galaxy was all there is just because we couldn't see anything else.</br></br></br>  <br>I like this anon</br>  <br>0, 1 and infinity - the true holy trinity</br>  <br>tldr? Multiverse.<br><br>ITT: pseudo scientists think they are smarter than actual scientists and believe a singular point in time had to define existence. (ie; they think TIME had to always exist and don't get the basic concept of the Big Bang)</br></br></br>  <br>Why assume he's talking about a "sky daddy"? Don't believe in a multi-verse, the possibility that entities inconceivable might, just might have some form of influence over our universe? Not directly Earth itself, but the entirety that makes up our universe? The possibility isn't even in the slightest to you?</br>  <br>your childish insults suggest your statements can't stand on their own</br>  You have no proof to support your sky daddy. I am convinced the religion is nothing but a method used for people to project there themselves and concepts of reality to make sense of things they don't understand.  <br>Have you ever been in a snow storm- in whiteout conditions?<br>You can not see anything because everything is completely white. there is no contrast.<br>If the god is all good (light) then it must have evil (darkness) or there would be no contrast, and hence, no sensation. So if the Bible teaches that the god is all good, and that it will eventually extinguish all evil, then the Bible is a lie, because the god needs evil to survive.</br></br></br>  <br><br>No one believes we evolved from monkeys.<br><br>We believe humans and monkeys have a common ancestor, much like a dog and a wolf</br></br></br></br>  <br> time being a thing <br> not just one of the 10 dimensions of M-theory </br></br>  <br>yet they do. the insult is just to keep the thread interesting.</br>  <br>Fair point. You seem like you want to destroy religion, but maybe one of the reasons you want to expose their belief systems is a because you're interested in understanding them on some level.</br>  <br>I need to go to sleep. I just hit f5 trying to refresh the page to see that guy's retort. Holy fuck I'm out of it.</br>  <br>I am a former Christian and minister. I understand them perfectly. Deprogramming is a long painful process. It takes a shock to the system to make it happen. Once the seeds of doubt are planted it is just a matter of time. Gotta spread the seeds as fast and abundantly as possible... if religion had its way we would have laws and whitepapers on how to kill people driven by 2k+ yr old books. Pic related. It already happened in the middle east.</br>  <br>I believe we are living in a universe made from a white hole after a black hole was born.</br>  <br>All that there ever was, all that there ever will be</br>    <br>In a sense we can never 100% prove anything, outside of mathematics. There is evidence for things, and when there is enough evidence we say we've proved it because it doesn't make sense for us to spend anymore time or energy debating it. But really it's just a spectrum of different levels of evidence.<br><br>When you're talking about an ultimate being, any musings on the nature or desires of such a being are kind of a waste of time, because have pretty much no way of ever knowing. BUT, the question of ---whether an ultimate being exists or not--- isn't a waste of time, because believing in an ultimate being is itself a source of motivation and inspiration in our lives, and we'd be foolish not to take advantage of this psychological power source.</br></br></br>  You have more to gain by accepting your creator than denying it and risking its existence being truth.  <br>No this i can fap to. thx /b/</br>  <br>I think our brains are actually aliens and that our bodies are their vehicles. It gives me motivation and inspiration to think this. I also might kill millions of people because of this belief but it's okay cuz I can believe what I want and irrational musings are just fine and aren't a waste of time.</br>  <br>/endthread.</br>  <br><br>if u think that way u dont really believe it. ur just afraid of going to hell faggot</br></br>  <br>Pascals Wager fail.<br><br>So how do you know you are accepting the RIGHT creator? So many religions. So many consequences for believing in the wrong one.</br></br></br>  <br> having a series of pictures called "religionfail" </br>  <br>source?</br>  <br>It's like trying to explain biology to a pigeon.</br>  <br>when you have a series of pics you name them all something different? Makes perfect sense.</br>    <br>I feel it.</br>  <br>Any specific belief like that ("our brains are aliens" "god hates fags and says it's cool to beat women") would be bad to take on faith because it could be co-opted and taken out of context. But don't you see how there's a certain purity to faith in an ultimate being? Not an ultimate being that thinks this and commands that - but a nameless, faceless source of everything. How could that be a bad thing?</br>    <br>You don't have to be part of any religion to accept a creator. Religion is just a means of explaining this acceptance, it is a human creation, thats why its imperfect.</br>  <br>i have a pic for that too...</br>  <br> having a series of pictures called "fedora"  <br>I bet you made them yourself to you angry little fag.</br></br>  <br> Implying most of these things don't also happen outside of religion... <br><br>Also the suppression of women and faggots is natural instinct</br></br></br>  <br>most ≠ all</br>  <br>would you worship, revere or otherwise pay attention to this creator?<br>would he merely be an explanation for a gap in knowledge?<br>what is the fucking point?</br></br></br>  Captured this moth.<br><br>Dubs decides its fate.</br></br>  <br>kill it</br>  <br>Eat it.</br>  in the pooper  <br>release it</br>  Set it free.
