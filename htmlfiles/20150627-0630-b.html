[ Dubs decides what I order at Subway. Choose my bread, my sandwich and my toppings.  Hearty Italian with one slice of cheese nothing else  Brownbread, with mayo and nothing else  Italian BMT with provolone. toasted, lettuce tomatos, southwest sauce and/or ranch also oil and vinegar  Oat bread. Empty  ask for the bread in the trash out back that has bin sprayed with cleaning agents to prevent people stealing it for your toppings you will have what ever dirt they can sweet from the lobby floor the sandwitch will be nothing but peppers enjoy   reroll. also, italian bread   Non toasted bread &amp; just pepperoni  Lettuce, no bread, no meat, no cheese, no condiments, only lettuce. When they give you the lettuce tell them more, then more, then more. If they don't give you more, jump up on the counter, pull down your pants, and start forcing yourself to shit while screaming "IT'S ALL FOR THE LETTUCE, BITCHES"   last roll    this   Wheat bread, ice, pickles, mayo, oregano  Mexican's are hard worker's.They hustle.They are harder worker's than most Americans.I can't remember the last time I saw a Mexican homeless person.They are also very family oriented and make slamming food.There are some bad seeds but that's the same with every nationality.Why don't Americans want moar Mexican's in their country?  Pic related  white homeless American   most likely an Illegal mexican Immigrant making money for his family    inb4 "They took er jobs"          They may work hard and with little to no instruction, but they are antisocial. The social ones are thugs.  They sort of did take my jobs, cause for a long time I wanted to do janitorial shit, but they like spanish speakers and mexicans. I would have done it. I found my own labor to do though.      Be Mexican   Live with ten of my relatives   House is fucking huge and looks nice   There is literally always food ready to be eaten on the stove   I love being Mexican and I don't understand why white people kick their children out at 17        (Hispanic bro here) I heard about this all the time man. Is it real true you white people get kicked out of home at the age of 18?  A white friend of mine told me the typical white family mindset " I got my own, you're on your own son"        American had everything. lost it. too lazy to work harder than he did (basically not at all). Mexican started from the bottom and has the bottom as default, because they don't take anything for granted, as the Americans who were born with a silver spoon in their mouth(saying in my country, you get the picture.).  Tl;dr It's all about how we are raised in the place we come from.       I don't know OP. I'm white American who works hard tho, I'd say harder than most. As long as hard working people want to work I say let them in.  But Mexico shouldn't just have a mass export of people to a place of opportunity, you guys should stay back and fix your shit over there.   I think a better question is, why don't we have more people trying to get into Mexico? That question should be addressed first by the Mexican citizens instead of just giving up and leaving to the US        This is how my father is and I'm hispanic, he's white from Mexico.

Just the most recent film left to watch,    Anything from England - Amerifag comedy = shit.    Im English and I totally agree our comedy series are much better, but there are a few decent North American ones. Also, Trailer Park Boys is Canadian, not American.       I've been watching this whole day.    I stand corrected, anything from that side of the pond usually = shit.    That show's pretty fucking funny     obviously never seen TPB      Totally agree, most American comedies just seem really slapstick and predictable, with overuse of laugh tracks. But Modern Family and Arrested Development are actually really good.    Just watched "don't legalize it". Fucking hilarious      It's a fucking SAMsquantch        doesn't know about god tier comedy character Mr. Lahey      Haven't seen many actors play a drunk as well as that guy, he is amazing. So over the top drunk haha. Just saw the one where he was bathing in ROC Vodka, just totally fucked.        Good comedy is produced from wit, not forced humour that tries far too hard and is then unrealistic and cringey     Just watched don't legalize it. The short montage at the end of him stumbling around Ottawa wasted, he hugs a trash can, "how ya doin, bud?". Fucking lost it     Yes. That is the main difference between British and American comdies. It's comedy you have work sort of work out yourself, that is subtle, that I find the funniest. American comedy seems to be here is a simple joke shoved in your face and a laugh track in case you didn't work out it was suppose to be funny.     You have no idea what you are talking about. One of the best parts of TPB is the understated long running jokes     Is that the most recent film, the 2014 one? If so I haven't watched it yet.     You fags know this isn't an American show right?    Yea. It's good    God. Tier.     We already said its Canadian. Halifax, Nova Scotia.     He gets hooked on coke. Calls it "the white liquor" lol    Tell that to the rest of the idiots who have clearly never seen this show    You are totally right OP. Best fuckin´comedy I´ve ever seen. Today OP was not a fag     Friends, It's Always Sunny, How I Met Your Mother, Seinfeld.      BOTTLE KIDS.      I think its just my British upbringing, which mostly included Blackadder and Only fools and horses led to the feeling of disdain I have for the America style, Im sure many Brits are the same way. Its kind of unfortunate.      Swearnet the movie was the best movie.     Its in the 'American style' however.    Faggot    You are stupid as fuck and are making broad generalizations, like this: British comedy is fucking retarded, and all jokes are inside jokes based on, or using shitty slang. And don't even get us started on the 100 hours of monty python that isn't even remotely watchable aside from 3 or 4 quotes from brief scenes.    This show fucking sucks    Yea like mighty boosh...      Friends  Are you fucking kidding me? That show fucking sucks donkey balls.     That sounds really stupid and unfunny     British in jokes in British comedy.     I love mighty Boosh    Bc you have never seen it, fag. You have no idea what you are talking about    precisely    This latest season is mediocre and not really memorable, like all the seasons really. Breakdown:  We're out of jail again bubbles   We're back at the park   Things changed omg   Oh man that guy totally fucked us but keep it cool   Oh man that other guy totally fucked us but dont get mad ricky   oh man we're still getting stepped on left and right and its fucking episode 5   oh man we're still punching bags and people are literally using us as a social toilet but lets never ever retaliate   so funny.  thats every season from 3 to 9.              This is true. I've observed there are two types of people: people who love TPB and people who have never seen TPB.    That doesn't even make sense. What else would you call the content of british comedy? Japanese jokes? Think before you stupid.    I disagree, the only season I find mediocre is season 1    So do I, but don't act like only Americans enjoy random stupid humor    I have watched almost all of it and it's just not that funny.   I incur physical cringe and discomfort from watching them take dick after dick up the ass episode after episode, I cannot endure such pussification for such an insane length of time. A single gag where ricky can't fight back against Y for X reason will run for 5 to 10 fucking episodes, and at this point its clear they write every single piece of story to last as long as possible since they need more seasons to sell Netflix. It's just not that good, unless maybe Canadian.      This    always sunny kicks the shit out of TPB up and down the block, then comes into Paddy's for a ice delicious Coors    That was my point the guy was moaning about the British jokes in the British comedy. The point was, the jokes will be relevant to Britain because its from Britain.   IT Crowd Little Brittain The Office     That doesn't sound anything like the show faggot      You didn't have a point, you greentexted 3 words that weren't in any post. But I forgive you.    its always sunny in philadelphia u fag   I'm gay   Oh so then in your mind they go around kicking ass and taking names? The entire premise of the show is "The park changed and you cant do anything about it ricky/julian" For the entire season, then they go to jail, every fucking season RIGHT? RIGHT&gt;? Yes. And then they get out and Guess what, more changes and they can do anything. about. it. Dicks up their asses left and right, with no recourse. Lahey is still right there under them.     Uh no. The premise of the show is they are petty criminals scheming ways to make money you cuck. Congrats you watched season 9   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=jML<wbr>qufujIlw</wbr>  [ ]   Oh really? all the fake weed grows that failed? Fucking lame. And I did watch season 9, 2 or 3 years after abandoning it after watching the first 5 or 6 and asking myself What the fuck was that garbage I just watched    show is retarded as shit like you  try a show without a laugh track and forced humor fagget      I can't say "better", I love TPB too...but Arrested Development was up there.    Sounds like my point, not yours. You watched 6 seasons of a show before realizing you didn't like it? Are you literally retarded?    Workaholics   The IT crowd   its in a league of its own.. you cant compare it to other shit. also the best show to watch stoned and drunk     Black Books The Office Monty Python      one of the worst shows. I'll never understand how it was so popular and how charlie sheen was getting paid more than any actor on TV just to be in it     english comedy sucks   TPB are canadian      Easily.. Curb your enthusiasm    this  also Key and Peele, Childrens Hospital, SNL, IT Crowd, Peep Show, and WKUK      Same, I don't get it.   Fav American comedy  eastbound and down  Fav English comedy  league of gentlemen        iasip for sure never laughed so much as dennis and dee go on welfare mike smith is great but danny devito is unbeatable     it's always sunny.  rip    The big bang theory comedy masterrace, nothing can top it.   its a show that relies very heavily on character development.    b8    Pretty much anything with Steve coogan is God tier    ya forgot that one, god tier rewatched them all a few times    Kids in the Hall     What is this show called?    Silicon valley is a pretty funny show    Fast times at ridgemont high    Trailer Park Boys. Now go slap yourself.    riley reid     English comedy    Dressing as girls   Laugh   Guy sticks dick in guy dressed as girl for a prank    Laugh   Guy dresses as girl and shows ankles   Laugh  Real funny shows you have           I like this show a lot    IASIP    Pretty trashy but alright. Always sunny in Philadelphia did it better. Seinfeld is top.   Arrested Developement up in here!    you merely accepted the liquor    I was born in it, molded by it      rip? nigga they still going thru 2017     Always sunny is good, no where near TPB. Ever watch Seinfeld recently? It didn't age well    Canada is American. They are a part of North America, just not the U.S.A   love me some tpb, inbetweeners is a great show though   Every time it's on I watch Seinfeld. I grew up watching it. I own the the pirate shirt.   I've watched every season like 3 times now on the netflix. Can't get enough of it. If you make it through season 9 and watch all the movies/specials, you can start over and sometimes it feels like you're watching brand new episodes that you've never seen before.   Football friend    Conky. You guys like him or not? I think he's fuckin great. I heard lots of fans dislike him thoug.    torrenting.. hope its good    Look, the meaning of anon's post was not unclear. English has no other word aside from "American" to describe something related to the US, so stop being an autist.      what are you, 12?    The bait is too obvious      Kill yourself     Always Sunny.  Easy.          Jim Lahey is literally the funniest character I've seen in any show. Makes me lose my shit pretty much every episode. So many hilarious characters though   But I don't wanna be a pirate!    Dirty Dancin'...you were so fuckin' sexy in Roadhouse!     ultra shit tier   Fixed it for you     what is this sunny show everybody is talking about?  is really that good?     Hipster as fuck      thinking memearrows are only for quoting     Fucking kill yourself immediately    it will grow on you till it's your favorite show, probably my favorite and I'm picky af    i can understand why some people don't like tpb, it's an acquired taste. But workaholics? absolute fucking garbage     the problem is, peopke drink against the grain of the liquor   I drink with the grain of the liquor   Fucking lost it      You got me there, i really can't OP. Now go get gay married    yea its got some super fuckin good and hilarious episodes and more often than not its hit over miss   DAYMAN, aAAAAH      3) Workaholics cheap comedy but fun 2) TPB trashy comedy but extremely fun 1) Sunny unique comedy and unbeatable fun      For all intensive purposes I think you are wrong. In an age where false morals are a diamond dozen, true virtues are a blessing in the skies, and are more than just ice king on the cake. We often put our false morality on a petal stool like a bunch of pre-Madonnas, but you all seem to be taking something very valuable for granite.  So I ask of you to mustard up all the strength you can because it is a doggy dog world out there. Although there is some merit to what you are saying it seems like you have a huge ship on your shoulder. In your argument you seem to throw everything in but the kids Nsync, and even though you are having a feel day with this I am here to bring you back into reality.  I have a sick sense when it comes to these types of things. It is almost spooky, because I cannot turn a blonde eye to these glaring flaws in your rhetoric. I have zero taller ants when it comes to people spouting out hate in the name of moral righteousness. You just need to remember what comes around is all around, and when supply and command fails you will be the first to go.  Make my words, when you get down to brass stacks it doesn't take rocket appliances to get two birds stoned at once. It's clear who makes the pants in this relationship, and sometimes you just have to swallow your prize and accept the fax, instead of making a half-harded effort. You might have to come to this conclusion through denial and error but I swear on my mother's mating name that when you put the petal to the medal you will pass with flying carpets like it's a peach of cake.            calling them memearrows     I cant fucking stand its always sunny anymore, used to love it though      This is truly a great show.   I cannot believe nobody has mentioned louie yet. its not as great as tpb but still really good. also curb your enthusiasm is pretty... pretty pretty good.    a blessing in the skies   skies  nope.jpg      wannabe pretentious deep show even key and peele is better    I &lt;3 Lucy  You all just lost, hard.     dude, if I were to rewatch the series, I would definitely skip those episodes   The IT crowd     it was alright and he's an epic comedian but it's becoming jazzy hipster garbage and rarely funny anymore and barely was before    This is probably an unpopular opinion, but in the most recent season of IASIP I noticed a sharp decline in writing quality. One aspect of the show I used to like was that the societal commentary was subtly buried in a multiple layers of parody. In the most recent season, though, the writing got sloppy and they start beating you over the head with their political beliefs. Couldn't watch more than 4 or so episodes of it.    fuck off you unfunny cunt   i'm not saying is the best show ever but this new show big time in hollywood fl is really good   sunny for the win     Malcolm in the middle , that 70's show...    Wheel Of Fortune    season 2 was best so far, season 1 is like the prequel    it kinda reminds me of sad jokes, which i really enjoy. like this one: Man: Doctor, I've broken my leg. Doctor: I'm afraid it is a very bad break. You will never walk again.      He said better, not most overrated trash you can think of    Funniest show on TV. Maybe ever.    Shows hilarious. Do you know anything about a second season? I don't really see where they can go after that last episode.   Aint no better joy than a big butt boy        where can I download?   second greatest television show ever coming through   This     and now for the greatest television show ever     Malcolm in the middle was fucking hilarious. Must have watched every episode 5 times when I was younger.    I fucking love peep show    I like it too. Interesting, funny, and on netflix   East Bound and Down! Kenny Powers over everything!    Blue Mountain State    It's rip off of The Wonder Years and 1% as good    When is the movie coming out? I can't believe they canceled it still..    RUM HAAAAAAM    came here to post this      The violent and grotesque adventures of Cuddles the ginger kitten    Can't watch this show, a few episodes I watched out of laziness were cringeworthy. Never laughed. It's pretty much like watching the special Olympics.    kenny fuckin powers. yeah loved the mexico season.   hell yes. marc did you piss yourself?   maron is ok. just got started on his podcast too          maybe its just cause Im a guy in my 20s like them, but its fucking hilarious. I didnt even watch it for like 3 seasons cause i assumed it was stupid hipster stoner bullshit, but its actually really funny. and it was so much funnier when I eventually found out they were the writers and that some of it is improv    Australian Trailer Park boys is equally as good as Canadian Trailer Park Boys.   it sucked once it came back though. they were all really old and weird    I don't think we're watching the same show, bud.   if you aren't a faggot and look at ratings, It's Always Sunny beats that shit   Second this.    I watch Seinfeld every weekday that I dont work. besides small things like no one having a cell phone or something, the comedy still works with how life is today    Workaholics is in my top 5 easily, you must be a boring guy to not relate    nope. i'm erm "a lot older" and i enjoy it a lot    Mah nigga, TPB is my favourite show, I wouldn't mind wasting my life away in sunnyvale for a while. Also does Julian ever appear without a glass of Jamaican rum? (except the prison scenes)      what? those were both my posts    Key and Peele are great. IT Crowd is ok. WKUK has it's moments. I absolutely hate Children's Hospital though.   mfw this show isn't mentioned   He has swish a few times...    Fuckin love em. Hows season 5 didn watch    cause it sucked. they shouldve just made every episode Lake Bell stripping      OI YOU'RE FUCKED IN THE HEAD M8     calls someone a retard   posts a pic of the most boring basic bitch sjw     All I really wanna do is smoke weed and mow lawns in the trailerpark   Alan Partridge was amazing. Saxondale was a bit dry.    He drinks whisky on occasion    you type like a fag    "I'm doing a Chesil Beach!", best line, one of the best moments    and thats OK    That's becauase that show is retarded   peep show is best, faggot   I got the meme    yeah i stopped watching it after season 2.. the writing is deplorable and the actors just seem like some improv group and i hate improv so much    First few seasons were great, but that one where they were suddenly in Japan was terrible. Was the last season any better?    Fuck off, Randy    This September!    not even close..  do you think it was a rip off of the wonder years because it had child actors in it?  have you seen either show?        fuck off Bobandy  Housos looks crazy. I'll give it a try.      good one?    I mean, I believe they all met in an acting class/improv group. The improv feel is probably because Devito has such a tight schedule, they always have to work around it. Doesn't give them much time for more takes so when they fuck up, they just keep going and use that in the show.   Not really a comedy series, but it's still pretty fucking funny   tight schedule for what? this show is the biggest thing he does now     intensive purposes   intensive      He is still a busy guy, he has a bunch of meetups he does plus he actually moves. He goes to conventions and so on. They explained this all in an interview a while back, even though he isn't in much anymore, he is still busy as fuck.

We already have control over this stupid country full of rednecks.   We'll name it "New Israel".      Fuck America  no circumcision no ghettos I can read and write no theocracy etc        typical American women   no wonder why all amerika became fag today.    most american's never leave their country they are all fucking ignorant      noice    When you are the best, everyone wants to take a shot at you. 🗽   ITT eurofags complain about America and dont realize we dont give a shit    most american's never leave their country they are all fucking ignorant  Probably because there's shittons to do in america since it's so diverse all on it's own. You don't necessarily "need" to leave the states.  I can go to a beach, see great monuments, explore forests, climb mountains, ski, shoot awesome guns, hunt, fish, experience deserts, see amazing landscapes... etc etc, I could go on forever. And no language barrier for the most part.       obvious butthurt     You need to come to our beaches     obvious fag      proving the initial point     But you do. Slowly your country begins to realize everyone laughs at Americans and slowly you realize that you've been lied to. You live in a third world country because you were cucked by banks and corporations.      HEY GUYS LETS GO TO AN AMERICAN MADE WEBSITE AND TALK SHIT ABOUT THEIR COUNTRY   Typical yuroboy        Sitting watching the euro fall like a rock.  Going out later to indulge my bulge with some beer and wings while watching the game.       I'm ashamed to say this is true. Don't come to our country it's a shithole. The women stink, I stink, everything stinks and there's never enough scooters at wal-mart.   Murica      It's just bad b8 m8.  summer time      Most of you fags would either be Muslims or beheaded with out us so fuck off and suck my freedom!   they look so skinny and beautiful compared to most americans   An american made 4chan   Have fun paying 60% taxes     Checked.  Here is a virgin for da mudslimes. Good luck  gonna need it.            I usually hate yuropoors, but good public education and health policies make it worth it tbh. That's where we eat shit really hard.       best   lets perversions and double-standards walk all over it   political correctness up the ass   niggers feeling entitled af   nigger president   public school system trash   best           says the country with the highest percentage of population in prison OOOOOOOooooohhhh     I draw when I hurt, too.     implying anyone in america cares about that game       yeah cause we rounded up the goddamn violent muslims and niggers and shut them out. The rest of it is handled by the police on a daily basis. It's actually a pretty big issue. Both how we treat it, and how they behave. It's like a neverending wheel of shit dude, I'll be honest.    USA USA    yeh ok dude shouldn't you be watching fox news right now?    USA USA USAUSA USA USA   USA! USA! USA! AMERICA FUCK YEAH!    I don't have any reason to hate Americans, they have absolutely nothing to do with us, we share a primary language and nothing else.   That is cuz we are a nation of gun toting bad asses unlike other pussy countries. Bring it bitch.         defend their country by posting paint comics  and you guys aren't scum?        USA USA USA  Haha that sure is great for you guyz, but I´d like to ask you a questtion Is there a character that could even possibly EVEN TOUCH Madara Uchiha? Let alone defeat him.  And I’m not talking about Edo Tensei Uchiha Madara. No, I’m not talking about Gedou Rinne Tensei Uchiha Madara. Hell, I’m not talking about Juubi Jinchuuriki Gedou Rinne Tensei Uchiha Madara either. I’m talking about Kono Yo no Kyūseishu Futarime no Rikudō Juubi Jinchuuriki Gedou Rinne Tensei Uchiha Madara with the Eternal Mangekyou Sharingan (which is capable of Enton Amaterasu, Izanagi, Izanami and the Tsyukuyomi Genjutsu), his two original Rinnegan (which grant him Chikushōdō, Shuradō, Tendō, Ningendō, Jigokudō, Gakidō, Gedō, Banshō Ten'in, Chibaku Tensei, Shinra Tensei, Tengai Shinsei and Banbutsu Sōzō) and a third Tomoe Rinnegan on his forehead, capable of using Katon, Fūton, Raiton, Doton, Suiton, Mokuton, Ranton, Inton, Yōton and even Onmyōton Jutsu, equipped with his Gunbai(capable of using Uchihagaeshi) and a Shakujō because he is a master in kenjutsu and taijutsu, a perfect Susano'o (that can use Yasaka no Magatama ), control of both the Juubi and the Gedou Mazou, with Hashirama Senju’s DNA and face implanted on his chest, his four Rinbo Hengoku Clones guarding him and nine Gudōdama floating behind him AFTER he absorbed Senjutsu from the First Hokage, entered Rikudō Senjutsu Mode, cast Mugen Tsukuyomi on everybody and used Shin: Jukai Kōtan so he can use their Chakra while they are under Genjutsu.     The Ukraine is getting its shit pushed in by Putin, asked the U.S. for help and 0bama sends them socks.   Europoors better pray we don't get another liberal for a president or you'll all be speaking Russian.     USA USA USA    Still better than any other country! Faggot!       All that money and you still die younger than the rest of the civilized world :(   USA! USA! USA!  The COLORS of the flag are red, white, and blue. Not colours. Know why?  In this world, Yurofags, there's no room for u.       No actually you're allies.   Feels good to be SUPERIOR   Shut the fuck up you've never even been to america you fucking europoor. Heck you've probably never even left your country. fucking trash.     greatest military   father of modern western culture   father of democracy in the western world   Leader of world economy   Leader of world in general   the only defense the world has against the Russians and Chinese   Not the best          As an American I can safely say that I really don't give a flying fuck what some other country thinks. But keep on posting, it's giving me the weirdest erection.   rate my kitty     USA USA USA!  ITT: What phone does /b/ use?  Pic related. OnePlus One master race    Moto x 1st gen  Windows Phone Lumia 930  Tier race Phone     How is the 930? I was thinking the 1020 or the 1520 originally but I hear good things about the 930    LG optimus G pro   HTC One M7 Nothing special, looks very nice though     Accidentally dropped my OnePlus One yesterday... Just finished ordering a new one. This time with a case... So good!     nice, was going to get it but waiting for new flagship got Lumia 640XL in mean time. used to have a 1520 but it broke   I have an iphone 3  s6, i hate the camera bump on the backside   my 1520 broke to due design flaw. screen is so big it flexes and bends. causing the digitizer to be disconnected from the screen - it starts doing thins on its own, tapping random things and scrolling though menus. can become unusable. you have to take great care. cant put it in your pocket face down.   Nexus 6 White reporting in  Moto g 2nd gen  Xperia z2, love eet  Galaxy S4 It's a colossal piece of shit. It keeps forgetting where my sim card is and i have to reboot for it to detect it. Half the time it doesn't even work doing that and i have to turn it off for a few minutes. Thing is it can be like that for hours before i notice if i don't check my phone. I sent it in for repairs and they sent it back a week and a half later and nothing was fixed.  Fuck rogers Fuck samsung Fuck Canada and it's bullshit cellphone carriers       LG Volt  Note 3 master race reporting in  Samsung Galaxy SIII reporting in.  pretty tight phone. call quality sucks though.     galaxy s6... This thing is sick.... People complain about the camera bump but just get a fucking otter box man... Bump eliminated.    S4 version 5.0.1   Sony Xperia Z3 Compact. Definition of perfection.  Lg g3   Why compact   Iphone 5s  Botdroids too slow   Xiaomi mi3. awesome!   Perfect size. I don't want a phablet.   Htc one m9 master race  Note 4   How does the phone preform? Looking at it now. Is the camera as good as it says?    Did you get the clear case they have?  fag  After my Note 2 I have said goodbye to Samsung. They make great phones when it comes to multi-tasking, screens, and solid cameras, but that is about it.   Never understood the bitching about camera bumps...   definition of perfection  Power button protruding from the side? No.  LG has it right with the backing buttons. OnePlus also did really well with their buttons.   that horribly shitty camera.  If It had a better camera I'd go for an HTC.  Everything as advertised is pretty damn accurate. The ONLY problem I have is phantom screening every now and then. I thought it was a screen gesture problem, but it seems more software than anything. Nothing that would keep me from using this phone.  The camera is amazing and the 4k is great. The gestures are great, the ability to customize is killer as fuck. Friend of mine just started using a Fallout theme, etc. You think it, you can change it. Hardware wise the phone is above all. The backing is just amazing when you buy the sandstone version. IT's a nice sandpaper feel.                               OPO 6 month owner reporting in.  running 5.1.1 through AOSPA      Well to be fair... you can't really slide the s6 across a table, and feel safe about it. Still otter box.   Opo   I can't comprehend why companies are going with glass sided and backing phones...it's like they want you to drop that shit.   myPhone Luna going soon for Motorola Droid turbo   Same here    FTW    it's not even a conspiracy it's just true.     it's not even a conspiracy it's just true.  kek.  Friend of mine picked up the s6. I held it and it just felt like soap in my hand. If I didn't squeeze it or hold it with two hands it felt like it would run from me        https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Dps<wbr>yGweP5so</wbr>  [ ]  The guy looks like a faggot but pretty cool to know about the guerrilla glass 4.       samsung did a 180 and started to copy Apple with the Galaxy S6"   I exited out right there. This guy is a fucking tard.  He's like the Verge. " This phone is amazing, but iphone has this and does this and that's why we suck Apples dick."         Having the power button on the side is literally the best thing that has happened to phones since the invention of the smartphone.  Having it on top just makes for an awkward finger-gymastics session when dealing with it, and having it on the back is the same shit. Having it on the side where your thumb doesn't have to do all that shit.       Having it on top just makes for an awkward finger-gymastics session when dealing with it, and having it on the back is the same shit. Having it on the side where your thumb doesn't have to do all that shit.  I agree about the top. The back is nice because it takes no time to get use to it. The side, ehh... If the buttons are tactile enough, aren't going to wear, and don't protrude out (see the OnePlus One buttons) then it's the best shit ever.        Long time hater of anything Apple for obvious reasons, but I have to say, the S6 was just a blatant copy of the iPhone 6.   iPhone 6+ bow down, poorfags    How's your held up?  I have an iPhone 4, and my god it's so fucking slow and shitty because of all the iOS updates it couldn't handle.  I'm pretty sure they did that so you'll be force to upgrade, but whatever, I want my next phone to be a Samsung s6        Hardware wise? Yeah, I guess the button and curved edging made it look iphone-ish. It's still got a better camera, better specs, but a HORRIBLE Software setup in Shitwiz.  Samsung is panicking, people are getting tired of their shitty product quality and life expectancy.        Way past its contract and still runs like its new    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=wSN<wbr>wA0aQtIA</wbr>  [ ] I mean I'm not an s6 salesman but the shit it can do is pretty cool. I don't know how many of these features the Iphone has because I haven't looked into it.    I hate kikes, but Anne Frank was a cute girl.   Einstein was German dumbass. He fought with the nazis.    The germans were hungarians, dumbass. They fought with the hispanics.    OP is hungary for cocks, dumbass. He fought with 3 pictures of anne frank   This guy stole $1200 from my friend's grandma. She's one of those old ladies that had a family who was hit hard by the Great Depression so now she tends to keep her money in cash at home.  These guys were at my friend's house (his grandma stays with them) and they robbed her of $1200 and left.  All we have left of them is their twitter accounts and phone number.  I know that /b/ is not a personal army, but there's nothing we can do. These guys just ran off with an old lady's money and we need to find them.  Please help. We've already tried to trace them using numerous online search engines but to no avail, so /b/ is the last hope.   <span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/624161267#p624161267">Click here</a> to view the full text.               Set him up to get murdered by an opposition gang.   lol, so you want me to help your grandma.  Who in reality dosent contribute to the us GDP by keeping her money out of the cycle. Why would I help someone who does not help the US economy?  In reality, this nigger helped out by putting that money back into the cycle. With the multiplier effect he will create monies that wouldnt have been created by your greedy grandma.  She is cancer, the nigger is the hero.         Reading through the nigger tweets gave me eye cancer, thanks OP.  4chan. Friday.

This is my rant. This is what it means to be a Southerner Apple has removed all civil war related games due to symbolism of the confederate flag.  Walmart/Amazon has stop selling the flag. Nascar has distanced itself from the flag.  Majority of the people in the country seem to equate the flag with bigotry, racism and nazism.  I grew up in the deep South. I grew up around the flag, I grew up in the backwoods. This flag is deeply ingrained with what I identify with. It is a symbol of my upbringing and heritage.   I feel like my heritage and culture is under attack by liberals, progressives and SJW that think of my kind as backwards.  <span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/624150427#p624150427">Click here</a> to view the full text.

It wasn't about states' rights. They were upset they didn't control Congress to keep slavery legal. The south fought to keep slavery legal in the newly-formed Confederate states so that the southern standard of living for whites could stay high. TL;DR - It was about money and standard of living, not states' rights.    Opinons on da Franku Mannuh  okay faggots, lets hear your excuses   nah you're lame    Haha faggot.
