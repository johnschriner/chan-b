How big are you?</br>  <br>You cut out a hole on a picture of emma watson, and put your dick in it continuously until your rolls got so sweaty that the paper got soggy. While you were doing so did you get a paper cut.</br>  <br>Thanks for the response. I'm afraid not no.</br>  <br>Thanks for the answer OP.</br>  Was she a good fuck, OP?  Why must you turn /b/ into a house of lies?  <br>This</br>  Best guess there's more than one girl in this world with that name  <br>you missed her prime by 10 years</br>  <br>You know it friend. Best fuck I've had in years.</br>  I'll bite. What was her pussy like? Was she shaved or was it like a jungle? Also I feel like she has large nipples is it true?  <br>greentext the story and we will consider if it sounds legit or not. it already sounds fake tho</br>  <br>It's the way of things friend.</br>  <br>I salute you. I've always fantasized about fucking Emma. I think shes one of the hottest women on the planet. So, well done Sir!</br>  <br><br>I heard she's got roast beefy meat flaps. True?</br></br>  <br>hueuehuehuehuehuehuehue<br><br><br>good one anon</br></br></br></br>  <br>Who IS that ugly bitch anyway?<br><br> also saged </br></br></br>  <br>Hang around somewhere else knobhead.</br>  <br><br>She's 25, anon.

Proof or it didn't happen.  <br><br>I don't even understand the fantasy of fucking a girl at least under the age of 15.<br><br>At that point, all girls have the body of a boy. If you could kindly explain to me what's so attractive about it, please do.<br><br>Is it the age gap?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>pics or didnt happen</br>  <br>back to imgur with you</br>  <br>the more pure and innocent somehting is, the more satisfying it is to corrupt it</br>  Why is everyone asking for proof. Is my word not enough?  <br>no, no proof=didn't happen<br>everyone leave thread</br></br>  <br> I'll bite <br>Fucking hell, why? Why would you bother actually spending your time listening to what he has to say when you know for dead sure that he's not serious anyway</br></br>  <br>No please don't leave. Let me just get my proof. One moment.</br>  <br>no you ll stay a fag for the oldfags</br>    <br>I like a good fiction</br>  <br><br><br>I'm re painting my fence tomorrow, should I prime it then go with a cream kind of color or just varnish it and let it get that homey weathered kind of look?</br></br></br>  <br>Does taping a picture of her face to the backrest of your couch make it more realistic, friend?</br>  <br>Ask a guy who just fucked OP's mother anything, I swear Im srs</br>  <br><br> age gap? <br><br>Partially. I think the most attractive age is when the new hormones are making giving them sexual desires but they're still really confused about them.<br><br>By 15 they've mostly built a sort of framework for their sexuality which is by no means complete, but they've resolved a lot of the confusion by that point.<br><br>When a girl is noticing boys and men and is experiencing intense, hormone-fueled arousal for the first time, that's when I want to rock her world.<br><br>Also, I kinda like boyish-looking girls. Just a preference.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Personally i would go for the weathered look. But it depends on the colour of your house and lawn.</br>  <br>How did you call your other hand?</br>  <br>Friend please. There's no need for these words. I'm still compiling my 'proof' for those that asked.</br>  <br><br>House is red brick with a black slate roof, lawn is verdant and green but not artificially so, I think I have enough varnish to cover the whole thing but I might need to stop off at a hardware store. Do you know a good priming solution OP?</br></br>   How to greentext pls?   <br>was she aware of it?</br>  <br>Please wait your turn.<br><br><br>I'm afraid i can't help you. As much as i'd like to i don't have the kind of knowledge you're asking of, sorry.</br></br></br></br>    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;62856879 <br>go back to reddit please</br>  <br>I'm sure you'll get it looking great though.</br>  <br><br>Different person to the guy with the fence, I'm thinking of extending the house out into the back yard, I got planning permission and materials but I'm worried that the back wall I need to knock through might be structural. do you think I should put in some struts before I start or just take my chances?</br></br>  <br><br>Sex is WRONG !<br>Sex is IMMORAL !<br>Sex should be BANNED and made ILLEGAL.<br><br>We need to change the world into '1984' and create 'anti-sex leagues'.<br>Only reproduction through IVF.<br>Anyone engaging in sex or anything sexual should be executed on the spot.<br><br>Sex ed should be BANNED and made ILLEGAL.<br>If we do not talk about it, it does not happen.<br><br>#ABSTINANCEONLY<br>#NOSEX</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Better safe than sorry i'd say.
