Now let's see you do healing with air.</br>  <br>air bending is better then everything<br>waterbending = bloodbending means<br>airbending can be used to destroy everything <br>because its not the air you bend but the elements its made out<br>tl;dr air4thewin</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Heart Bending</br>  Fire, you can basically control energy. <br>Want to heat something? Easy.<br><br>Cool something, just suck the 'fire' out of it.<br><br>Lightning? pic related</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The fuck are you even trying to say?</br>  does earthbending really include bending of metal? thats sweet  <br> Cool something, just suck the 'fire' out of it. <br>wat</br></br>  Earth.<br><br>Lava bending<br>Metal bending<br>Density altering<br>What if everything in the world built on?<br><br>are the other elements even trying</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Id say in practical use, firebending. In being a sneaky assasin waterbending. Air bending if you want to be a vigilante flying through the sky. And earthbending if you have a thing for wrecking shit.  a high level enough earth bender can create a black hole  <br>It's explained better in LoK. Some are capable of bending metal while extremely rare cases they were able to convert earth into lava and sling that around. Also the purity of the metal had a factor in deciding the difficulty. Platinum was too pure and was weaponized because of it.</br>  in an episode of avatar, there were earth benders on a fire nation boat, they couldn't manipulate the metal the boat was made from but could manipulate coal.  <br>You know, fire bending is just energy manipulation. If you can start fires by heating the air, and make your fire colder, why couldn't you suck the heat out of an object?</br>  <br>because metal bending wasn't discovered yet</br>  <br> electromagnetism aka gravity <br> electromagnetism <br> aka gravity </br></br></br>  <br>Gender bending I'd say</br>  <br>Gee bill, I didn't know gravity was electromagnetism. What have I been learning?</br>  Earth bending if you want to be a demi god of chaos.  <br><br>metal bending is high level shit, not every pleb earthbender knows it</br></br>  <br>Water<br> &gt;I almost drowned once and felt really helpless. Waterbending would change the water from being a potential threat into something i control completely. Queue Jaws music <br> &gt;Chi Healing man, that the main want. Just heal shit, no biggie, zap you're better now, no 9 year uni degree <br> &gt;Australia has a lot of water, would be fun to slide around <br> &gt;Get all the beach bitches at the bitch beaches <br><br>Air<br> &gt;Close second, would make my life completely different as I wouldn't be as controlled by gravity anymore. <br> &gt;Gives you access to a whole another way of mobility, bouncing around like the moon lander, running like a nigga outta jail, and flying around being the most amazing. <br> &gt;So many dangerous things would be safe now. Eg, cliffs, mountains, high buildings, motorbike crashes (I ain't flapping around all the time, gimme a break) <br> &gt;Don't want to hurt or kill people, passive element.  <br> &gt;Little bit like Telekinesis and I dig that shit. <br> &gt;You can fly other people can't, pretty damn cool. All other stuff aside. <br> &gt;Mostly for mobility and fun, not much else. <br> &gt;Would use this to do something Nig, like blast skirts into the air then fly off into the horizon like le master troll to get some apple juice <br><br>Fire<br> &gt;Utility wise is good, fire and heat are always useful in clutch survival situations or fights.  <br> &gt;Cant see where it comes in handy otherwise, just BBQ's <br> &gt;Would end up using it to light cigarettes or something else mundane. I suppose I could use it to enforce my PRIVELAGE by lighting ladies cigs. <br> &gt;Don't want to hurt or kill people._. thats kinda fires other main use <br><br>Earth<br> &gt;No, cos i don't really want to wreck the shit outta the landscape to fight or have fun. This is exactly why the earth kingdom looks like shit, fucking earthbenders man <br> &gt;Not sure WHY i would want to be able to build shit outta rocks and dirt. Not a nigger. <br> &gt;Don't want to throw rocks at people. Not a nigger. Evolved past sticks and stones. <br> &gt;Earth kingdom =/= russia <br> &gt;Earth Kingdom == Afrika </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  All the people in here are assuming all benders have equal potential. Seems like many forgot that there were frequently ones with special gifts and then there were others who could barely do anything after tons of practice.  water is best for what i know<br>can heal<br>can control blood<br>can control plants<br>can be ice or gas</br></br></br></br>  <br>and then , there is this faggot</br>  <br>truuu. Basically if anyone here got bending they would change from being a mundane human being to a mundane human being who can't bend so good.</br>  so did Ankh and Katara fuck or what?  <br>anhk.

Already a winrar.</br>  cumsluts thread? cumsluts thread.  <br> Implying I made her do this <br> implying I'll get the money she earns besides paying half of our bills with it. <br><br>Stripping is also a lot more dangerous and has crazy hours. You have to be around people actually willing to spend money in a strip club. Those people have to be crazy to drop that much cash just to look. She is residing with a dancer who also does video. The girl dancing made like $600 a night. Which is less money for more hours compared to the video world. So thanks for that misinformation.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Butts Carlton</br>  <br>I mean prostitution</br>  Dubs only  They know me!  <br><br>Dam Son</br></br>  <br>Chek'd</br>  idk why the last one 404 but pics u shouldnt share    <br>nice u got more?</br>     the year is 2050  <br> 4chan and chan boards are long gone and taken down after an Internet censorship act <br> you go to the grocery store to buy a few items for yourself after finishing up being a wage slave for the week <br> "that will be $27.77 sir" <br> a man behind you in his late 50's possibly 60's says "nice trips"  <br><br>How do you respond?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>/thread</br></br>  <br>turn 360 and walk away</br>  <br>newfags can't triforce</br>  Last one 404'd so poorly described movies<br><br> i love you  <br> ferris wheel <br> wild horses <br> cut dogs head off </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hero</br>  <br>Born on the forth of July/ Benjamin button</br>  <br>yup</br>  My dealer said that this is amnesia haze. Is this true?<br><br>also general stoner thread</br></br>  <br>Being dry is the worst.<br>Even worse is being Dry, dealer going radio silent, backup dealer leaving the country, having no links to other dealers, and being unable to grow due to landlord inspections<br><br>FUCK.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Actually true granddaddy purp is a clone only strain. So it will be very uniform no matter where you get. So you couldn't have chosen a worse example for your point...idiots</br>  <br> IMPLYING that sativa haze has the same effect than indica weed like afghan..... 10yrs old retard detected. <br><br>also amnesia haze is a hybrid between sativa and indica, but tends to be 60-70% sative and 30-40% indica. <br><br><br>So OP if this is Amnesia Haze it should make you high at first for some time and the more you smoke it or let the effect operate in your brain make you stoned aka push you into couch.<br><br>Ofc it can be just another brand of weed which is also a hyrid between sativa and indica and like always when you buy illegaly you are at the mercy of you dealer. <br>Ofc many strains are easy to distinguishable by smell or at least by taste. Like Cheese (the strain) and lets say BlueberryKush smell, taste and effect are different. But you have to know the taste/smell first to say yep its XY. <br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/625351514#p625360500">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  ITT: post your real life SPECIAL system stats.<br><br>New Vegas Edition <br>http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Fallo<wbr>ut:_New_Vegas_SPECIAL<br><br> Strength: 4/10 <br> Perception: 7/10 <br> Endurance: 3/10  <br> Charisma: 5/10 <br> Intelligence: 8/10 <br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/625359251#p625359251">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>   Intelligence: 8/10    Strength: 9/10 <br> Perception: 5/10 <br> Endurance: 6/10 <br> Charisma: 5/10 <br> Intelligence: 8/10 <br> Agility: 5/10 <br> Luck: 5/10 <br><br>Traits:<br>Heavy Handed<br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/625359251#p625360318">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  S: 4<br>P: 7<br>E: 5<br>C: 6<br>I: 9<br>A: 6<br>L: 8</br></br></br></br></br></br></blockquote>]
