I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit.

I got da meenest shit in town!'<br><br>You guys do realize that that shit is fuckig uncool as fuck, right?<br>I know what you're thinking. You think I'm saying it's uncool the same way as 12 year olds say smoking or drinking is uncool.<br><br>But it's different from that guys. Seriously. Smoking and drinking is way fuckin' cooler than smoking weed.<br><br>Legit. Like, you can have a ton of fun drunk. And havuing a cigarette in your mouth makes you look fuckin badass. But weed? If you have a joint in your mouth you look like a retarded fuck who's resigned himself to doing nothing but snacking eight hourse a day and sleeping the other sixteen. At least NEETs feel bad about it. But stoners think they're living the fucking life.<br>Being stoned doesn't even feel good. I mean. If you get stoned 'cause it feels good, you're not doing it right. If it's to calm you down you shoulde be drinking or doing benzos. If it is legit to just feel 'good' you should be doing opiates. You're already fucked up to that point where you need weed to make you feel good. And compared to opiates it's like mainstream music.<br><br>TL;DR: Weed is weak, and it's for the weak.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>      <br>KPP is J-pop</br>  <br>nice try GCSB</br>  so i really dodged a bullet.<br><br> be me <br> be 19 <br> shit tier job making $16/hr <br> be with ex, get her pregnant, she already has a kid that is 2 years old <br> she miscarried <br> we break up <br> i am now living in usa making 6k/nzd a month <br><br>phew. that was a close one. my family even threw me a 'dodged bullet' party before i left nz.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>literally the same thing</br>  <br>shoulda taken her to your room and got your dick up in that son</br>  <br>nah no way hurricains all the way im just saying the way they played was shit and the better team did win to many errors would have been an average win if they did. and thats no fence sitting im not saying "um im not sure whos going to win" i was harricains all the way and still am just sayin they played shit</br>  <br> Saw a girl on Tinder who seemed nice enough, looked probably a decent 6/10 <br> Said in her bio she has a 1-year-old and is looking for someone who likes kids <br> I'm terrible with kids <br> Swipe past her, no way I'm going there <br> A couple of days later, a girl comes in from another store to cover a shift at my work and seems awfully familiar <br> Mentions she's a single mother with a 1-year-old <br> We get along fairly well, she seems cool <br> A day later, someone tells me that she said I was nice <br>Fucking god damn it, why did she have to have a kid?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Shit sucked man.

What'd you have in mind?</br>  <br> Damage control for failing thread. </br>  Best Chapter, comin' through.   mfw spam gets filtered by everyone <br> mfw they keep trying <br> mfw they think they're doing /b/ a favor <br><br>what a bunch of faggots kek</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Our community will perish rapidly without a steady influx of new blood from an open stage like /b/.<br>IRC would be useless for that, where would you have us go?</br></br></br>  <br>Also this. This works just as well. Steer your newbies to the IRC and such.</br>  <br>oh shit</br>  <br>You can get newbies, just keep the cringey shit to yourselves. Discussion garners just as much interest.</br>  <br>I just heard someone mention Warhammer and decided to join in. After all, I got a duty to the God Emperor, Praise Be His Name.</br>  Link to the chat again?<br><br>Also holy shit, where is Deathwatch in all this 40k shit?</br></br>  <br>Blood for the blood god mother fucker.</br>  <br>https://client01.chat.mibbit.com/?c<wbr>hannel=%23LewdERP&amp;server=rizon.mibb<wbr>it.org/</wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Have you been to the IRC? It's even more full of faggotry than the threads!<br>That's like telling some wide-eyed anon to go to leddit or something.<br><br>We need the threads on /b/ and you all do not want the threads on /b/. What options do we have?</br></br></br></br>    <br>Keep going, as long as you keep spamming I keep filtering, when you run out of spam, achieving nothing, you will realize how much of a dumb fuck you were</br>  <br>Not helping, Ren.</br>   Mfw I cannot see the spam anymore <br><br>Because you're butthurt doesn't mean we should all be butthurt, stopping people from having fun is the ultimate cancer</br></br>  <br>...Not cirnofaggot, but I've been in it. You have an ignore button and priv msg there. Quit making excuses.<br><br><br> Being a stuck-up bitch. <br>Fuck you too then.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying anything helps </br>  <br>It's really the best option. You can teach newbies rp etiquette here. I myself as an RPer fully endorse a thread to teach them and show them the ropes prior to tossing them into the IRC. Discussions will arise with it and so on. <br><br>None of us want to see the ERP itself. Or you cringy mother fuckers.</br></br></br>  <br>That's an odd way to spell "Glory to Holy Terra".<br><br><br>The Lamenters fight on no matter the odds! I mean at least until we all get banned.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're right, I'll just let them go on...</br>  <br>That's an odd way to spell "Glory to Holy Index".</br>  <br>Technically all the RPers are avatarfags, and we're all spammers.</br>    <br>In all honestly we're all destined to get banned, so I guess thats the only thing that we all have in common</br>  <br>Are you the same Cirno as in the HG threads?</br>    <br>That sounds more like something a Tech Priest would say.</br>  <br>Nope. I don't browse HG threads. Crino is just best.</br>  <br><br>Not him, but he probably is. Avatarfags can't not avatarfag. Besides, porn seems to trigger him. Just like the HG one.</br></br>    <br>Cirno a cute, but I like Futo best<br>Great taste buddy</br></br>  <br>All we have is excuses. We're lonely faggots doing erotic roleplay on the internet. I'm grasping at straws here, I know.<br><br><br>IRC is a placebo at best. And a temporary one.<br>Non-erotic roleplay thrives, why not ERP? A containment thread would fulfill both of our goals, we have minimum exposure and still get to jerk each other off. Win win</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What about fapbaiters ?<br><br>Like ahri, sona and the others who tease every anon ?<br>They seem to have a lot of success because the people talking to them don't need to rp themselves, they just say dirty things</br></br></br></br>  <br>So even when we're all banned we'll be together! Which means... EVEN IN DEATH WE FIGHT FOR THOSE WE CHERISH!</br>  <br>I get the guy, cirno has the body of a toddler and loli porn is disgusting</br>  <br>Those threads are single-source attention whoring. It is erotic roleplaying, but they just come run here when they get hammered.<br>I don't claim the mistresses, they can fight their own battles.</br></br>  Since it's 4AM I'm gonna say fuck solving IRC problems for now.<br><br>Till then I'm going back to reading Deathwatch fuck this</br></br>  Don't you mean<br>pic related</br>  <br>Death is certain, to feel wanted for a brief time is far from it.</br>  <br>Nobody really likes the HNG RPers either. And the drawthread goes to shit constantly.<br>They both have autism and go full retard against shitposting. Like the tubavore thing.<br>Hell, at least you have a couple of anons trying to work out a way to make this less shitpost and more discussion.</br></br></br>  <br>About 80% sure it is. Who knows? Everybody thinks Cirno a best.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure Chryon said it the way I did after he was forced to become a Blacksheild.</br>  <br><br>I can't get in.</br></br>  <br>What error do you get?</br>  To be fair, we COULD just make our own private board elsewhere...  <br>99% sure it's the HNG cirno. Even have the same filenames.<br><br>Oh. There's the HNG tomoko fag too.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't endorse them. But, we are trying to help you out here first. Mods are cracking down on your threads as is. <br>It's a fickle subject. You could always make a Skype group or steam group to keep connected. Private ERPs in steam messages as well as updated announcements on when a newbie helping post is made. <br><br>youd also have the whe steam group chatbox. You can get 1 on 1 with newbies and public communication still out there. Something other than openly erping on here with no class is just wrong.</br></br></br></br>  all of you guys should get namesync...<br><br>join the real party faggots <br><br>http://milkytiptoe.github.io/Name-S<wbr>ync/</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>I appreciate the temporary truce. <br><br>And it pisses me off too, as an ERP anon, when people get ignored and the circlejerking takes over. We can self-regulate that, to an extent, with drama and shitposting.<br><br>You guys are fucking nuking us out of the sky here, though. And yeah- it is pretty funny all the buttmad, I'll admit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I should really read upon 40k lore beside just playing skrimish mode in DoW.</br>  "Never compromise, not even in the face of Armageddon."  <br>I browse the HG threads sometimes and the filesname dont seem to match</br>  <br>Uhh. Not gonna say names, but there is a Chan that lets you make your own boards out there. Starts with an M I think.<br>I mean, if you insist on doing this on chans.</br></br>  <br>not him but with the same problem<br>it say<br>rizon.mibbit.org/: Could not resolve hostname.</br></br></br>  <br><br>rizon.mibbit.org/: Could not resolve hostname.</br></br>  <br>I'm the only Tomoko fag I know who shows up in these threads.<br><br>So dunno man, I would usually ERP but most of these threads go to shit</br></br></br>  <br>The lore is pretty good as long as you work with the "nothing is totally canon" clause GW slapped on. The 1d4chan has most o it summarized pretty well.</br>  <br>WAUUUUUUUUUUUGH!</br>  what is E? i assume RP is role play  <br>Sorry for ridiculously late response.<br>Whatever you want.</br></br>  <br>Erotic.</br>  <br>You're a terrible role-player, though.</br>  <br>8ch works too. But a steam group is fine, IRC is fine, Skype groups are fine. Just keep the ERP from here. Heck, you can even set scenes on here. I'd stop spamming at that. But leave the actual ERP to private chats.</br>  <br>Erotic RolePlay</br>  <br>Eh. Figured I could check with a quick simple ruse if it was you.</br>  <br>don't do this.<br>trust me</br></br>  <br> I'd stop spamming at that. <br><br>No one's going to bend to your personal agenda.

Why is it that whenever you get a new girlfriend, a shit ton of other girls try and get you to fuck them? And if this has happened to you, how have you dealt with it? The ones I'm dealing with are fucking sexy but I don't wanna cheat. Should I just tell them to fuck off? pic related. It's one of them  <br>I have anxiety so that's a contributor to it.
