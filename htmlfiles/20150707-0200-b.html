Shit wasn't expensive either. A month in Thailand? set aside 3000 dollars, and you will live like a king. 3000 really shouldn't be difficult for anyone even with an average job. I was a kindergarten teacher when I did all of my traveling.</br>  <br>sweet quads, nice dude!</br>  <br><br>Backpacker ESL teacher everyone laughed at.</br></br>  <br>that is so sad. bruh. <br>flying is a pain in the ass? flying has allowed us to travel anywhere on earth in less than a day. you can go to singapore or toyko TOMORROW. you can be on a safari within 48 hours. you could be seeing the wonders of the world by wednesday.<br><br>what are you doing, bruh?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I have traveled the world and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.</br></br>  <br>coz my hostel parties will never be that cool and i dont have enough friends money time or bals</br>  <br>not ESL teacher. Didn't have to "backpack" either. Nice try though. keep up the good work.</br>  <br><br>Big fucking deal. Have you ever been to Singapore or Tokyo? No different than London or LA.</br></br>  <br>but I don't really want to<br>I can just go online in the comfort of my home<br>I own a business and visit the islands off of rhode island and go to cape cod I scuba dive I explore caces and shit I love it here<br>Im not culturally ignorant it just seems like a huge pain in the ass to me for not much payoff<br>I know plenty of people who travel and shit and wouldn't know what to do without it<br>just not for me I guess</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You don't need to have a backpack in order to be a loser backpacker ESL teacher everyone laughs at.</br></br>  Chronic uncontrollable diarrhea  <br>but you do have to teach ESL in order to be an ESL teacher. <br><br>thinking is hard.</br></br></br>  <br><br>No, you don't. You just have to be a white clown that dances for the kids he babysits. That's why everyone laughs at you.</br></br>  cause fuck all those countries full of niggers and towel heads, gooks and faggots, USA USA USA we truly are number 1 why would anyone want to go visit # 16-- Fuck you  <br><br>Exactly. America has everything the planet has to offer.</br></br>  <br>and if we don't have , we will come take it from some faggot country ! The rest of the world is THE USA's fucking nigger bitch</br>  Because it costs money, obviously. What a stupid question, OP.  <br>what fucking part of the world would you go to, the ASSES kicked by the USA or the ASSES SAVED by the USA, fuck all those nigger countries</br>  <br>I have been to London, NY, Ibiza, Prague, Budapest and trust me while traveling in places like South East Asia especially, the parties are fucking crazy.<br><br><br>Idiot.<br><br><br>Every American i met while traveling was equally if not more retarded than you. They are by FAR the most hated nationality by every other natonality, they have their own little gangs with just American people whereas the rest of the world parties. Cunt.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Well of course. Nobody hates #2.</br></br>  <br><br> Ibiza <br> Prague <br> Budapest <br><br>lol so you like to slum it? or do you just have a thing for gypsies?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dont want to be abducted in a foreign land. Also USA is the best shithole</br>  <br> the parties <br>what are you, 19?</br></br>  <br>No i just like traveling the world, and they are places in the world.<br><br><br>What are you referring to? You are hated because of people like you. I don't care about money, politics or military, i'm just saying you are hated because you are so dumb and have zero culture.</br></br></br></br>  just got a motorcycle, I'm getting there.<br><br>That in just 2 days.</br></br>  <br>24.<br>Are parties exclusive to 19 year olds?</br></br>  <br>American here. I've lived all over the world. Japan, China, Taiwan, Nepal, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Germany, Switzerland...<br><br><br>...and this.</br></br></br></br>  Skyline Rd.  <br>Because I just spent 10k on a car and 500 on school.</br>  Skyline Road.  <br><br>I have. I'm 31yo &amp; married now.<br><br>It's easy to get caught up in the rat race, holiday lame places domestically just to say you did it...boring though.<br><br>My son isn't old enough to remember being an where worthwhile. In a few years when he's 5 then we'll start traveling abroad again.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>No, we're hated because that's what losers do to winners. They hate them.<br><br>lol and we're only hated while we're not there. We show up and all you faggots want to do is hang out with the American.</br></br></br></br>  Also, its super easy to get laid by hot girls from all over the world while traveling.  <br><br>That's only appealing to weirdos who can't get laid by their peers.</br></br>  <br> confirmed having never been traveling. <br><br>That's really not what happens, im not even saying it to make you mad but you have no sense of humour and get offended when someone insults you in a jokey way.</br></br></br>  <br>No mate, i'm from England and i will be the first to admit they are the worst girls in the world when it comes to personality and looks.<br>So traveling is perfect for me.</br></br>  I'd most likely go on a killing spree. If I'm doing that might as well do it near where I live remember think globally but act locally.  <br><br>I've been to a few more places than you. When you travel more you'll stop naming the cities and start naming the countries.</br></br>  <br><br>Clearly you've never been to Australia. And Ireland isn't far away. Their girls can be hot.</br></br>  <br>Erm.. up there i was naming party places.<br>I have been to around 50 countries as i have been traveling for 6 years.</br></br>  Because i have too many domestic related issues that have held me back.<br><br>I was planning to go to Germany a few years back and I even learnt to speak basic German but then my mum got sick and died.<br><br>My brothers and father rely on me heavily (even if they wont admit it) and when I have been away for a few days the house is upside down, no one really ate/cooked, laundry is barely done and as always I have to pick up where i left.<br><br>Sad life I live ill admit</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>but i have traveled :(</br>  <br> Erm.. up there i was naming party places. <br><br>Again, when you travel a bit more, lol, and grow up...you won't do that.<br><br> I have been to around 50 countries as i have been traveling for 6 years. <br><br><br>Cool. I've been to more than half the countries that exist in the world today. My parents were diplomats and I've been traveling my whole life. I'm 33.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I've seen some gorgeous women in England, also some minging chav sluts but they're mostly foreigners.<br><br>When cities like London are only 42% white, it's easy to see why you've failed as a nation.<br><br>Too busy listing after hijabi gurlz &amp; scoring ur next curry then procreating with your own kind.<br><br>Ireland is just as bad with women, but fuck ma at least we have the stones to keep shitskins in their place. <br><br>Too much coal burning in England....</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>#rekt</br>  <br><br>The only things good about Aus are: surfing, lamingtons, and the GBR.</br></br>  <br>if you haven't been to America then you haven't been anywhere.</br>  anxiety :(  <br><br> muh parents were diplomats <br> I on the other hand am a pampered NEET posting on /b/ in the middle or the day. <br><br>Great life choices mate.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But I'm in St. Barths now. <br>Also, none of these Frenchies can stay on the right side of the road when they turn.</br></br>  <br><br>And even surfing is meh compared to Hawaii. Fucking poisonous snakes and locals with their...*shudder...accents.</br></br>  because travelling is for pretentious faggots who only care about out-travelling others  <br>/thread</br>  <br><br>Well they died in a plane crash when I was 16 and left me a grip of cash, so yes. Don't be even further jelly of the American.</br></br>  <br>Neckbeard detected.</br>  <br><br>Which America, North or South?<br><br>Which Country on either Continent?<br><br>Peru was cool for ancient stuff, so was Mexico. The USA is a nice place if you stay out of Middle America, Canada is a frozen wasteland for the most part.<br><br>The Americas are great! Which was your favourite part???</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Your basement is next on my travel list.</br>  <br>i dont wanna leave my country because i hate foreigners<br>im a big racist and hate subhumans</br></br>  <br>Rekt</br>  <br><br>the usage as defined by the OED.<br><br>AÂ·merÂ·iÂ·can<br>ÉËmerÉkÉn/<br>adjective<br>1.<br>of, relating to, or characteristic of the United States or its inhabitants.<br>"the election of a new American president"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> parents left me a load of dosh <br> I'm cultured bc I experienced things 2 decades ago <br><br>Topkek, delerious britbong</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>hivemind faggotry<br>so "cultured"</br></br></br>  <br>Because I'm a racist and I hate other cultures. <br><br>Went to London last month.<br><br>What a shithole</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That's not what it means to me or anyone, anywhere.<br><br>Please share where you've been in the Americas.<br><br>:^)</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The world is a tiny little spot, compared with what is on my mind.</br>  because:<br>1. dont wanna crash in a plane<br>2. dont wanna get mugged<br>3. dont wanna get bombed<br>4. dont wanna die from alcohol poisoning from shoddy alcohol in third world countries<br>5. dont wanna use shit tier drugs in third world countries<br>6. dont wanna wake up in a tub of ice missing a kidney<br>7. dont wanna get aids<br>8. dont wanna spend a shitload of money to "build character" - i can do that through learning a skill i.e. piano, and it would cost me a fraction and stay with me for life</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Who said anything about being "cultured"? The more you travel the more you'll see there is nothing new under the sun.</br></br>  <br>/thread<br><br>It's about expensive "one-up-manship" and posting on social media to demonstrate how "cultured" you are</br></br></br>  <br>Traveling is an expensive hassle and most other countries have way more niggers and thieves than there are here.<br><br>Also why is seeing monuments in real life so important to you faggots? Bragging rights?<br><br>I've seen monuments irl and it did nothing for me over seeing pictures of them.<br><br>You're all being shilled by an industry of tourism, so good job.<br><br>Drugs are better than traveling anyways.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Well, it's the meaning as defined by the Oxford English Dictionary, so I guess you should take it up with them.<br><br> the Americas <br><br>I didn't use that phrase, though...</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i never understood why traveling makes you cultured.<br><br>culture comes from introspection, and building of a personal identitiy</br></br></br>  <br><br> nothing new <br><br>I had no idea you spoke every dialect known to man, had an ever expanding naturally inherited culinary prowess &amp; also can build any piece of architecture you come across. <br><br>You should...petition the BBC for a syndicated program mate, I'd watch the fuck out of it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Culture is what you do. How you speak, eat, dress, etc. Everyone has culture, and only Brits are concerned with "losing it".</br></br>  <br><br>money</br></br>  <br> I had no idea you spoke every dialect known to man, had an ever expanding naturally inherited culinary prowess &amp; also can build any piece of architecture you come across. <br><br>But I already told you I'm an American.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Why not, are you grouping 2 continents into one now?<br><br>That's a tad pointless don't you think?<br><br><br>Protip: d'oh is also a word in their dictionary I out absolutely no stock into.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>North or South American?</br></br>  <br>LOL<br>are you one of those people who gets mad when someone doesn't call an insect by its correct scientific nomenclature?</br></br>  <br>Same here. It's just being able to say "oh ive been to [place]" and spend your time between trips planning for your next one.<br><br>While theyre out being "cultured" others have realities/jobs to face.<br><br>Also hate when people say "im only happy when im not in [current city they live in] and im travelling"</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I already have many times and will go again very soon.</br>  Just got back from Europe op it's nice and stuff but it gets boring after a while just like anywhere else  <br> Why not, are you grouping 2 continents into one now? <br><br>Well, no. I'm talking about America.<br><br>Listen, I know you think the word is the source of all our power. Maybe next time use the word in your country's name instead of "Republic"?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>No.</br></br>  <br>see<br/></br>  <br><br>The United States of America was founded to be a union of self governing republics you know.</br></br>  but I have travelled the world. 30+ countries.<br><br>on every continent except south america</br></br>  <br><br> I out absolutely no stock <br> out <br><br>Why should this concern me?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you must be a riot at parties</br>  <br>its not just that.<br><br>you learn so much from mastering skills than you would from travelling.<br><br>if i had 2 weeks, i would get more out of taking a boxing class every day for that 2 weeks than i would if i went travelling</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>See what. You live in an oline dictionary?<br><br>Which Country &amp; in which America please.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>*nods politely</br></br>  <br><br>You entertain people at parties by speaking about entomology?<br><br>That's ace mate.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I cba to correct Autocorret</br></br>  <br>So are you taking any classes just now?</br>  <br> doesn't understand how to have a conversation <br><br>jesus fucking Christ go back to budapest</br></br></br>  <br>But...but...havent you heard? You havent lived/found yourself/experienced life if you haven't travelled? ESPECIALLY if its to some third world country where the alcohol might as well be draino and the water from the shower had an orange tinge to it</br>  <br>university makes it difficult.<br><br>medical student btw. on surgical rotation.<br><br>leave the house by 7am, get back by 6pm.<br><br>no, however i am doing a few lecture series on psychology is that counts.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Money. Also, the US has a fairly low standard of living and wages relative to the rest of the 1st world these days. Rent and property is much cheaper in the US so that helps balance it a bit... but the moral of this story is with low wages compared to the rest of the 1st world, it makes it hard to travel in 1st world countries or fly somewhere.... if you can get to Mexico, South America, or SE Asia; sure, you can STAY cheap on American dollars but the flight is unaffordable.<br><br>I have seen a bit of the world.

All of Pest is a gypsy camp.</br></br></br></br>  not enough spare time<br><br>also fuck staying in hostels</br></br>  <br><br>And Hungarians fail at it just as miserably.

I said those nationalities aren't gypsies, so those nationalities being in America is totally irrelevant. <br><br>As many gypsies as Ireland has, or as Sweden has, or as Finland has, or as any country that allows urban camping has, Hungary has ten times more. All of the Pest side of the river. Every pub.

Really want to go to Tokyo, Bali, New Zealand but really don't want to go oversea's for the first time by myself.

I'm sure the anger that flows through you gives you great feels.</br>  <br><br> scared to travel alone <br> Tokyo <br><br>You'll fit in though as all of their men are pathetix Otaku style neckbeards. Literally. Amazing documentary called "no sex please, we're Japanese" explains the extremely dramatic population decline over the past 30 to 50 years. <br><br>Japan is a formerly great empire. Now it's a radioactive shitehole to dump money in to. It's very expensive to holiday in Tokyo, although fun...I didn't enjoy myself THAT much.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Great! No baggage to hold you back.<br><br>You'd be surprised how many people you meet while traveling alone, loneliness is a choice while backpacking.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I lived in Kyoto for a year, Japan is overly romanticized by Westerners. It's no where near as quirky as it seems from afar. <br><br>Also, most Westerners there are fucking weird sociopaths that didn't fit in in their native countries and are no less awkward and weird in Japan.<br><br>In fact it's the least quirky place I've lived, still a cool place, but not what I expected. You live and learn.</br></br></br></br></br>  Some people, especially Millennials, really take the 'travelling the world' thing too far. No one cares about the fact you deliberately put yourself out to use local busses, sleep in the countryside and eat only from roadside stalls. You are not a local and you never will be, so claiming you 'lived like a local' is just retarded.  <br><br>Outside of their culinary culture I absolutely hate everything about Japan.</br></br>  School  <br><br> implying I haven't deployed with the Navy to East Asia <br> implying I'm not deploying to the Mediterranean/Middle east in September </br></br></br>  <br><br>The US Navy lads aren't that bad.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Dat Hivemind tho</br></br></br>  <br>The problem is that the great food in Japan is super expensive, so when you live there you can't even afford to eat it on a regular basis. The day to day food is actually pretty bland. Korea has much better food that is totally affordable.</br>  <br>Underrated post</br>  <br>Went to Hong Kong, Shenzhen, and Guangzhou this year.<br><br>Also took a couple other trips such as Georgia, Nashville, Chicago, going to the Bahamas and Key West later next month.

I could have accomplished what I needed to in one day, but I dragged it out &amp; lied to my employer about "tough negotiations".<br><br>Looking back that was a terrible choice as Tokyo is boring as fuck even with a corporate credit line to blow through. <br><br>Japanese women are pathetic as well, desperate, sex starved, annoying as fuck.<br><br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/626161812#p626175995">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't have much experience with soldiers.
