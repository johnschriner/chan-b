We're gonna start things of with scenes from a hat.<br><br>"Rejected movie prequels."</br></br></br></br>  Well, about 3 days ago my gf stopped texting me, so I went to her sister to ask if she was okay, her sister said she was okay today, so I asked where she was, and she said she couldn't tell me, so then she tells me I'm on her "shit list" and I'm thinking wtf why you have no reason, so then she says my dad found your vid, I'm quite confused at this point, and then she says "the one with you jerking off", he found it on my gf Instagram dms, so now I'll probably never be able to see her again, what's should I do?  Bang her sister.  It's her fault for letting her dad go through her shit. If she was smart she would've deleted it so she's the one to blame.  <br>tell her father that you two were just fooling around over IG, and that it's not really you because you didn't want her to use it as blackmail. <br>Then you have to sincerely apologize, look him in the eye when you do, and shake his hand.<br>So you acomplish:<br>1.Lying to her father<br>2.Getting away with it<br>3.Getting to see your bitch<br>4.She will probably fuck you afterwards<br>5.You shook her father's hand with your wank hand</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  took a urine test on early thursday morning and it was sent to quest. would i know by now if I failed?

So you should hear back from the prospective employer soon. If they're also doing a background check they could be waiting for those results as well. Hiding just weed? If so what was your method of masking or eliminating?</br>  <br>dilution.. i hadnt smoked in a long time, then on the weekend i had 2-3 bowls and got a call that i needed the test in like 48 hours. so i exercised and drank like crazy. didnt give them the first void and i had some water. I am skinny too</br>  Lets see your cars /b/  <br>Bean Bag Buccaneers is a two player children's game, the object of which is to pick up your treasure chest on the central island and sail back safely.<br><br>Each player has a giant sailing ship as their main game piece. Each ship has a removable sail, two trigger-action side panels, and a huge spring-driven cannon. Players take turns moving forward along a prescribed track and shooting bean bags at their opponent's ship. A hit on one of the side panels will force it to pop off and give the player a free shot at the other side; a hit forcing the sail off becalms the ship for a turn.<br><br>To add to the pirate flavor, each player also has an eye patch. Wearing these will slightly affect depth perception and add a marginal bit of sport to the shooting.<br><br>This game retailed for the somewhat impressive sum of $16 back in 1962. With its huge plastic ships (close to a foot long), giant vinyl play mat, and the eye patches, it may well stand as one of the more overproduced games of the early 1960s. Bean Bag Buccaneers?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Aight.        <br>Custom.</br>  <br>Nice dude. I always love seeing this car in black. I hate any other color. I almost got one. But I didn't like how light weight it was. The engine felt like it would just take control and if you fuck up you're just done. Because it's so light weight. But it's quick. Nice car. I ended up buying a mk6 gti</br>  <br>Must be nice to still live with mommy and daddy.</br>  Too dark out to grab a pic right now but I finally got my '66 Monza on the road.

I commute in a Focus, off road in a Wrangler, plow/haul in a Bronco and have a Ninja ZX-6R for shits and giggles.</br></br></br>    <br>Clean. I like it. How do you maintain your headlights that clean? I always see this car down here (Maryland) and they've got the headlights fogged and yellow as shit. Clean headlights on old cars is so satisfying.</br>  Kinda dark outside, driving honda civic 2000, ehat ia ypur opinion on jeep liberty 2002 or volvo s40 2006, thinking about getting a "new" car  <br>They're called wheels and those ones fucking suck</br>  <br> posting license plate on /b/ </br>  <br>fake its a screenshot, look at the filename</br>  <br>Easy /b/ro.

Regretting it now because the 1.6 liter ecoboost sucks and has no balls for acceleration. Still have a year and a half on my lease, then I'm thinking of replacing it with a wrangler unlimited.  <br>wutchu gonna do about it pleb?</br>  <br>I got new ones last year.

It was extra but totally worth it.</br>  Had this for three months now 04 Mach 1  <br><br>Dunno about that guy's VW but with my '06 Sierra, I like to avoid touchless car washes. The chemicals they use can be pretty harsh. It's also a good idea to get bugs off right away as their guts contain acids.

Sometimes we even share some coke rails, like today <br> Mom's quite cool regarding drugs, tries everything you give to her, trusts me completely in that regard and always enjoys it. She would never take stuff on her own though <br> Talk some more about random stuff <br> Topic changes to some porn movie she found in my VCR when I was 13 or something which I stole from my father.  <br> Have a few good laughs, notice she is kinda rubbing against the chair, ever so slightly <br> She says "anon, it's quite bright in here, can you dim the lights pls? <br> whatever.jpg <br> Real dim in the room now, can't even find my glass anymore and almost nocked it over when I finally found it. <br> She says she's fucked up and wants to lay down a lil bit on my bed. <br> whatever.png <br> Notice she's kinda winding in the bed, tightening her fingers around her body (you know what I mean) <br> She says "Anon, it's already late, shall we sleep a bit?" <br> Was tired and shitfaced, so I agreed <br> Wasn't even a minute in the bed she puts a leg over mine, clearly rubbing her pussy against my leg. <br> Suddenly, and I don't care if you believe it or not, she went straight fir the cock.. <br> I repelled her hand, not sure what to do now. So I caressed her, getting hotter and hotter. <br> Somehow I ended up in her Pants caressing her pussy, getting horny as fuck and supressing al the muh mummy feelings. <br> Slip with a finger in, wet as fuck. Not shaved. <br> She throws her pants away and without thinking i licked her hairy slightly smelly pussy. Shit was cash <br> Then we wanted to fuck but I couldn't get it up, tried a lot of things but it just didn't work. <br> So licked and fingered her until she came, I was to nervous to even get it up, let alone cum. <br><br>Cont</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Didnt read looks good <br>for sure continue</br></br>  <br><br> Wasn't the first time she was being suggestive, but today was the first time I was actually drunk enough to do something <br> She wasn't even that drunk, and she planned it. (Closed blinds, asked me to turn down light, invited me to bed &amp; stuff) <br><br>So yeah, next time I pray to some god of a motherfucker that I can get it up. Would be nice to fuck the pussy I came from.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>it's silicon, nothing illegal about that</br>  <br>Damn...<br><br>Your mom's an "open-minded" one.</br></br></br>  <br>what's up wtih all the huge ass tits</br>  <br>Having kids tends to do that to a woman.<br><br>Also, big tits are nice.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't forget Mama to Doraibu, Demodori Mama, Mother-Son Penis Exercises, and Prefecutural Centre for Sexual Guidance. After that, anything by Juan Gotoh is gold</br>  please keep posting moms  <br>Try Medicine Rubi. Mother+Daughter that doesn't involve anyone else is a lot harder to find than straight shota</br>  <br>yeah but not when it looks like a fucking aliens head. <br><br/></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah for some reason, don't even know why. We never talk about drugs/sex and stuff until we're drunk. Then we start to just do weird things, dunno.<br><br>Weirdest thing was that her husband (not my father) was in the room next door, while I was eating her out. She had to put a pillow on her mouth so she wasn't to loud.<br><br>But I must say, that pussy tasted awesome. Also much tighter than I expected as she has two children. Even fingering with two fingers was difficult because she was so damn tight.<br><br>But it's not only my mom, I also fucked with my sister after a rave on molly. A nice pussy is a nice pussy. Surprisingly i could get it up then, but my sister is also a lot hotter. Was only one time tho</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ayy xonro</br>     be me <br> fucked more women of my family than other grills <br> only had one gf (for 10 years tho) <br> mfw </br></br></br>  <br>Is she hot?</br>  Check at this guys, anyone have sauce?  <br> Surprisingly i could get it up then <br>Were you high on drugs that time too? Pretty sure some stuff (like ecstasy) can mess with your dick.</br></br>  <br>Would like to know her name</br>     <br>yoo bump</br>  <br><br>Well, average I'd say. Considering her age being almost 60 years. But she has a tight body, I'd say 6/10.<br><br>I'll make sure to get some camera for the next time she'll be with me. Happens every month or so</br></br></br></br>  <br>I hear sex on ecstasy can make it hard for you to get it up unless you're on it again.</br>  <br>needs soy sauce!</br>  <br>Geezub. Freud's theory on that has always been jarring to me.</br>  <br>lol sauce?</br>  <br><br>Yeah I was on molly, in the beginning I had a hard time (hehe) to get it up. But as soon as I had a boner it was hard as diamonds.<br><br>I much prefer sex on amphetamines though, fucking brains out for hours. Once I licked my ex for 6 hours straight, sucked real hard. Her clit swell so much I was really worried. But every time I asked her she was like "suck, hard!!"<br><br>Also wanking sessions on speed are amazing, you can fap for hours straight. It's an amazing adventure with all the porn on the internetz</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Damn japs and their genital forcefields</br>  <br>The stories and information posted here are artistic works of fiction and falsehood.<br>Only a fool would take anything posted here as fact.</br></br>  <br>Believe it or not, I don't give a fuck</br>        <br>I thought that was just a myth and pandoras box was a latin/south american man.</br>              <br>I have no desire to fuck anyone related to me, but i get off for some reason on other people fucking people they are related to.
