Both are pretty good  <br>Audiophiles know about this stuff better than anyone.</br>  <br>I like Sennheiser. Pretty priceworthy imo</br>  <br>What's her name?</br>  <br><br>Thanks, I'll have to check it out.</br></br>  <br>I have no idea lol.</br>  OP. Are you so broke that you can't save a bit more? No $20 earbuds are good. Buying the popular buds that sell for that amount is not a good investment. Your buds will break 2 months from when you buy them and then you're back at square one.  Thinking about walking away from life for a while. Been dealing with depression for a long while now. Could never an hero. Thinking about just leaving for a month or two with no contact to anyone at all. Thoughts? Tips? Will be hitchhiking with a couple thousand dollars and using couchsurfing. I play poker pretty well and could make extra money that way.  I've been thinking about getting a rental car, driving to death Valley, abandon the car and just walk right in to the desert. No supplies. No water. Just walk until I can't any more.  <br>Im not truly hally unless im outdoors and in the move. Stay safe OP.</br>  I will document my travels here.

I FUCKING SAID IT</br>  <br> Oh look, a film that has a lot of praise and positive reviews  <br> I must say I hate it now <br>Fucking edgelord</br></br></br>  <br><br>your mad because you just don't get it</br></br>  <br><br>only hipster fags pretend to like it. it's actually a load of bollocks</br></br>  <br><br>i get it. its just stupid. the power of love is not acceptable anymore. Also, the fast and the furious is a praised movie that has done incredibly well. Your argument is invalid. Also also, CRASH won best picture... CRASH... idiot.</br></br>  <br>What makes it so bad in your opinion?</br>  <br>I know this film was got mixed reviews. What did people hate about it again?</br>  <br>Crash, postmodern absurdist bullshit</br>  <br>First half was great then it tried too hard to be smart and I started to get bored.</br>  Pic related is fucking garbage and you know it  These are fine films, don't get me wrong, but seem to be held in higher esteem than they deserve.  <br>crash is just a shit movie all around</br>  <br>the power of love. THE POWER OF LOVE. fuck. when will they stop using it? its so tired now</br>  <br>fine films? really? they are shit</br>  <br><br>i done saw her tits and ass</br></br>  <br>was anyone else disappointed? i know i was</br>  Any comedy movie about black cops<br>Jonah hills drama movies<br>Any Daniel redcliff movie besides harry potter<br>Don Jon , joseth lewit is a wonderful actor.. Butt dam that movie was shit<br><br>Also unpopular opinion : Tom Cruz movies get better and better<br> tl;Dr Gorgon freeman has a ugly voice </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Agree. It was like someone tried to write a Tarantimony flick with some kind of deeper social meaning. Which doesn't work. All of his shit is super violent and over the top because it works with the format. And I fucking love that nigger Don Cheadle.</br>  <br>but harry potter is shit too...</br>    <br>Nah , it had its moments. First movies were totally legit for their release date</br>  Fight Club  <br>no seriously, explain why you hated it. I'm interested in your opinion.</br>  <br>shit tier fucking nonsense teenage blockbuster shits</br>  In the first one, the advisors and experts brought to the park refuse to endorse it (from being dead or almost eaten.)<br><br>In the second one, they try to bring the dinosaurs to the mainland, where the public becomes aware of living dinosaurs, and promptly get eaten by a T-Rex.<br><br>In the third, the publicly known Isla Sorna is still a breeding ground for dinosaurs and isn't made a no fly area or quarantined in anyway. People end up going there on accident and DYING!<br><br>I think pteradactyls escape from the island in every single movie. I can only imagine they have attacked humans in various places around the world.<br><br>So how the fuck did they get away with creating ANOTHER dinosaur theme park?! In fact, it's not even ANOTHER theme park, it's Isla Nublar again. Like they said, well, this obviously didn't work, let's clean it up and do it again. Only this time, without mentioning ANY of the failsafes that the first movie had in place.<br><br>I really couldn't buy that any oversight committee would let that park be operational.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>its boring for one</br>  <br>Yeah, I guess that was my only problem with the film. But they didn't emphasize it as much as other films do.</br>  <br>clockwork orange was somewhat revolutionary in the concepts and presentations it brought to cinnema, at least within the success it had<br><br><br>kinda agree, although have with a Borderline Personality Disorder, who said I should rewatch it<br><br><br>the target audience is teens, of course you wouldn't enjoy it<br><br><br>was thinking of watching it. should I not, now ?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>im not eh person that hated it but I dont like that its silly and weird and I dont get it. It just made no sense to me at all.</br>  Any marvel movie<br>/Thread</br>  <br>agreed. it doesnt make any sense why they would continue to open the park after all the previous experiences.</br>  <br>Fight Club<br>Pulp Fiction<br>Every superhero film<br>Every Star Wars film<br>The Matrix Trilogy<br>300<br>Aynthing with Seth Rogen/James Franco/Jonah Hill/Chad whatever Tatum</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I agree. The whole 4th time is a charm thing is stupid. Kill the dinos. Stop making more.</br>  <br>So you hate hipster in the first place, not the film</br>  <br>didnt emphasize? its literally the cop out to finish the movie...</br>  <br>For one, the film aged really poorly. It is stylized in a way that a great many people just don't enjoy, objectively. I personally didn't care for the dialogue and language choices. I didn't really care for it on the whole, it felt contrived</br>  <br><br>didn't like the pacing? not invested in the character(s)? just too damn long?</br></br>  <br>watch what you want dude. i just think that people who see it more than a visual jerk off fest are retarded. the story isnt good but the visuals are great. people confuse that with it being a good movie</br>  <br> Fight Club <br> Pulp Fiction <br>right in my feels</br></br></br>  Most films in 2014 were shit  <br>some of them are good but fanboys ruin it</br>  <br>the movie was really boring and bullshit the book was actually way more intense and not full of horse shit</br>  <br> I can't understand it even though I pretend to so I hate it </br>  <br><br>you dont like it cuz your a virgin that has never had sex or a gf</br></br>  <br>I really understand why a lot of people wouldn't like it, it's not a film for most people. Why did it seem contrived to you?</br>  <br>i hope youre trolling. that movie sucks</br>  <br> LE I AM A GEEKY GIRL CUZ I WATCHED MAVHEL MOOOVIES XDXDXDXD </br>  <br>is that 2 dudes? like some brokeback mountain sequel?</br>  <br>youre just mad. POWER OF LOVE IS GENIUS</br>  <br>That hardly became an important theme overarching the whole story</br>  <br><br>you don't like this movie because you don't understand 4D and 5D beings<br><br>it's okay, dumb people get mad at things they don't understand.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I liked it and I can't think of a single hipster that I know that would know the film. It's not obscure or annoying enough for them.</br></br>  <br> muh power of love can transcend space and time and also flying into black holes will save humanity because muh power of love will save us all. <br><br>You must be fucking retarded not to understand it when the message is rolled up into a bat and shoved right up your ass. It was so obvious I was cringing at it and laughing about it with my friends on the way home.<br><br>Only some faggot hipster who knows nothing about space will say "you just don't understand" if someone were to tell him the movie was fucking stupid.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>what was wrong with it?</br></br>  <br>Well it has been a while so it is hard for me to give specific examples, maybe I was at at different point in my life when I watched it but that is what I have carried away from it. I picture it as a circle-jerk unto itself. Maybe I am just spiteful lol</br>  <br>them too but you know, im not a hater about the new "geeky girl because i like thor guys" kind of girls because it has actually gotten me laid a lot more. nerds need to stop being mad about it and utilizing it while its here.</br>  <br> Fight Club <br><br>It's fine.<br><br> Pulp Fiction <br><br>One of my favorites, if just for the dialogue<br><br> Every superhero film <br><br>Personal taste<br><br> Every Star Wars film <br><br>Agree. Used to love them as a kid, but I the hype is overblown. Especially since the new shit is coming out.<br><br> The Matrix Trilogy <br><br>They went down a weird road with the story of the trilogy. Feels like a cop-out<br><br> 300 <br><br>It's meant to be stylistic. Don't take it too seriously.<br><br> Aynthing with Seth Rogen/James Franco/Jonah Hill/Chad whatever Tatum <br><br>Personal taste. Although The Interview was better than people said it was.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Even the books were bad<br><br>Battle Royale was way better</br></br></br>  <br>it is literally the thing they use to finish the film. Are you retarded?</br>    <br>Book was nice. Not great, but nice to read. Looking for Alaska was John Green's best book though by far</br>  The Dark Knight (or any new Batman film)<br><br>Honestly, if you take out Heath Ledger it's just stupid. Batman isn't suppose to be 'dark'. He just ends up being more corny that way. Just watch any of the 'Badman' skits on youtube and you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.<br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/FUDHcuLnMVc  [ ]<br><br><br>Though I've always enjoyed the animated Batman series from the 90's. That character was good.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the power of love</br>  <br>Coppola in general is overrated, but for me I liked 2001: A Space Odyssey far less than A Clockwork Orange.<br><br><br>Unfortunately being revolutionary is only good for those alive at the time to see it. Everyone else just hast to respect Coppola's work in a historical sense, but we all know that the viewing experience isn't anywhere as good as people watching his films as they were released.<br><br><br><br>Was heavily disappointed/bored by that film. Are any of Cronenberg's able to redeem it?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>nope. the movie sucks</br>  <br>If they would have said that he was able to visit the room because he had been there before, what would the difference have been? Sure, he said it was love, but I could buy that he would be able to find that space/time location for other reasons. It's not like other cheesy plot lines where only the power of love can defeat our enemy.</br>  <br>you almost got me but you said coppola and cronenberg as the incorrect directors. dont be so blatant next time and your troll might work</br>  <br>This.</br>  <br><br>I didn't see it so I really don't know what you mean.</br></br>  How to make a bunch of people mad at you lesson 1 chapter 7  <br>Barry Lyndon will always be the best movie he made.</br>  <br>Minions<br>Avatar<br>Any Fast and the Furious movie<br>Pitch Perfect<br>Ted<br>The Hunger Games<br>Insidious<br><br><br>Checked</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They're called opinions dude. I heard someone today say that My Cousin Vinny was better than Forrest Gump. People can be inclined to think shit is good or bad regardless of popular opinion. Do you fucking love Pop music, because by your logic that should be the only thing you listen to.</br>  <br><br>Minions has made nearly 1 billion dollars. It's a successful movie.</br></br>  <br>if you didnt see it then why would you want someone to tell you why it sucks? youre not gonna understand it anyway</br>  Interstellar is absolute crap. Nolan sucks. More plot holes than Dark Knight Rises and a stupid as fuck ending. Matt Damon was totally fucking distracting coming up in the middle of the film so you're like who is on that planet? OH it's Matt fucking Damon! Dumb idea.  <br>yea Kubrick's movies are all super self absorbed, probably part of the reason i like them.<br>Sometimes i wonder if he was actually trying to make films for a "normal" audience and just couldn't relate to anyone so all his films turned out feeling completely unnatural.</br></br>  Oh you think Interstellar was trash?<br> Put on your favorite LiL Wayne track <br> Load up GTA on your console <br> Order a pizza <br> Wash it down with a liter of bleach. </br></br></br></br>  <br>The marvel movies are shit, every last one of them.<br><br>I'm going out on a limb and saying all these fucking superhero movies in the last and next 5 years are going to be shit.<br><br>Actually, now that I think about it, Nolan's Batman movies weren't that bad, they had some good points. The others are complete shit.<br><br>I hate the transfomers movies, I hate the new star trek movies (the last one was completely fucked).<br><br>The Hobbit movies sucked. Way too much CG and effect, not enough story. It was one fucking book and they fucking ruined it, nothing in those movies felt real, it was all fake, so I didn't give a shit who lived or died, fuck was Bilbo annoying in it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>youre just trying to defend it because you dont want to believe that part is complete bullshit. you can like the movie but just be honest about it</br>  <br>Forest Gump is crap. My Cousin Vinny is better.</br>  <br>How so?</br>  <br><br> Judging a movie with reincarnated dinosaurs with logic related to the business side <br><br>I swear some people don't know what entertainment is.<br>You have to accept the bullshit to enjoy like 90% of films.<br><br>The whole time I was watching Jurrassic World I was thinking "you know I bet they would put the microchip/tracking device in its actual brain and it would have a kill switch and send out a current or explosives or w/e to instantly kill the dinosaur"<br><br>but I still enjoyed it, because if you sit there trying to pretend its logical you're gonna have a bad time</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>So that I know I'm not missing anything.</br></br>  <br>See<br><br>Idiot</br></br></br>  <br>grown ups has made a shit load of money too...</br>  <br>This.</br>  interstellar was amazing, it literally changed my life  <br>Yeah, that's a good point. Kinda brought you out of the movie.</br>  <br><br>how do you know what happens when you fall into a black hole, have you ever been in one yourself? huh? huh?? yeah that's what i thought</br></br>  <br>There were times when I found it really hard to understand the dialogue because of the accents and dialect but besides that I found it to be a fairly good movie.</br>  <br>the power of love</br>  <br>Fuck mavhel movies!<br>Fuck people who pretend they are geeks</br></br>    <br>I guess I am being an apologist for it. It's a dumb part, but it doesn't ruin the rest of the movie for me.</br>  <br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/1byycwl8qgc  [ ]<br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/enOHraf3LEk  [ ]<br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/01vWvocMc6M  [ ]<br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/HBsdV--kLoQ  [ ]<br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/Svd4fe8HEZI  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Cug<wbr>sup-Ylzg</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Also the problem is they're going to be scraping the bottom of the barrel in a year or 2. Then they're going to move on the villian anti hero bullshit. Fuck.</br>  I didn't think Interstellar was great either. I had reasons why I didn't like it, but the movie was so forgettable I don't even remember them.  <br>clever girl</br>  <br>the ending was so fucking shit, the movie fucking sucks</br>  Saw this in theaters, haven't seen it since. I've seen quite a bit of love for it here and there. I didn't hate it, but I felt like it was trying to hard to break movie rules and ended up being a bit of an eye-roller for me. So yea, no desire to see it again, thoughts?  <br>That's it?</br>  It should have been a realistic sci-fi movie, but it's just a "family love solve everything" set in a boring future.  American pie. Shuch shit film.  <br>Cronenberg did direct a film named Crash</br>  <br>No one cares about your opinion. How surprising</br>  <br><br>Hey I just got back from Yakima today I was there for 3 weeks.</br></br>  you know, I enjoyed a lot of things about interstellar, but two big things kept me from really loving it as a whole:<br>-personally, couldn't get past Matthew McConaughey in such a serious role<br>-the love bit, and the very "out there" ending. I love out there but it really stretched the boundaries of what I was willing to except based on the rest of the film.<br><br>I did like it though, but i think i liked it more than i normally would have because of some of it's visual treatments, and the fact that not a lot of other mainstream movies came out around the time it did.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The name of the movie(s)/series is Jurassic Park. The story is about how they created a dinosaur theme park. The first movie is good because they make the premise feasible. But the premises is entirely unfeasible in Jurassic World. I want to suspend my disbelief. Tell me how we are having adventures with dinosaurs again, because I really want to have adventures with them. But the movie just ignores this question because it doesn't have a reasonable answer.</br>  <br>It's all opinions, man. That would be a widely unpopular opinion but if you really think that then that's what I was arguing. Like whatever the fuck you want, arguing over anything in this thread and getting shitty over it is stupid.</br>  Elysium WORST SHIT EVER!!! Also fucking Hunger games  Fight Club waste of time  Frozen, Minions, Titanic  Everyone in this thread is so mad. Popular movies by definition are widely viewed. You can't define a good movie because it's all opinion based. Jesus Christ just read opinions without getting a hair up your ass. Have a discussion about what they disliked about it, stop shitting on everyone who thinks different than you.  <br> WORST SHIT EVER!!! <br><br>How many movies have you seen? 4?</br></br></br>  <br>Would you prefer Frozen Minions on the (sinking) Titanic?</br>  <br>Thanks anon. Truly the worst movie since Benjamin Button and even worse.</br>  <br>Hunger Games is the bane of Hollywood. Fucking YA fiction garbage. Harry Potter, Twilight, Maze Runner, Insurgent/Divergent/Whatever ... all crap for 14 year old girls.</br>  <br>Around 10000 i guess, and i would vote Elysium worst movie of them all! Liked Battle Angel Alita and was hyped and this shit was a disgrace, kill all ppl involved and no one would be missed.</br>  <br>Yes, so they can die.</br>  <br>Everything this</br>  <br>i watched this with my ex-gf was trying not to puke the entire time the part were he uses the cig as a metaphor wanted me to punch someone in the face.</br>  <br>Go to school, finish English, and maybe dad will let you into his film collection when you turn 14.</br>  <br> Go to school, finish English, and maybe dad will let you into his film collection when you turn 14. <br>More Iron 4 you. Also if you liekd Elysium you are as dump as you sound.</br></br>  <br><br>My list includes:<br>A clockworck organge.<br>2001: A space odyssey (the most boring shit ever).<br>Independence day.<br>Forrest Dump.<br><br>Crash.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I love my iron</br>  All right, let me ask you scrubs this:<br><br>What is worse: 2001: A Space Odyseey, or Interstellar?</br></br>  <br>Your steak is a bit undercooked m8</br>  <br>Add to that<br> Harry Potter Saga <br> The Hobbit "trilogy" <br> Avengers <br> Majority of Marvel Films (excl Spiderman-Toby Mcguire) <br> Mrs Doubtfire <br> Gravity </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So, kinda dumb comparison. 2001 is a historical film that was made before we even landed on the moon. It was competing with Star Trek episodes. So many ideas and images from it have been used since because they were awesome. The effects are fucking outstanding for 1968.<br><br>There's no excuse for Interstellar.</br></br></br>    <br>Don't let him leave Murph!</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=aK-<wbr>QslYKrnw</wbr>  [ ]<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it is still a film even though there are parentheses around it you know</br>    <br><br>i hope this is bait</br></br>  <br>Yeah what was so great about this film? I watched it twice and thought it was pretty meh both times. I only enjoyed watching the stunts. I gave two shits about the characters and Mad Max was a sidekick to that butch chick.</br>  <br> a movie can't have two protagonists </br>  <br>Yeah, Capote should have won that year over Crash. Even Brokeback Mountain.</br>  <br>What a stupid response</br>  couldnt stand it back in primary school when it came out.  <br>the interview was fucking horrible, were you fucking high when you saw that piece of shit?</br>  <br>And then there's this wacky scene</br>  <br><br>calling cw a "movie"<br> pls </br></br></br>  The Shawshank Redemption, boring and over-rate movie  <br>I really like this at the moment but I'm sure I'll get over it just like I got over Inception.<br><br><br>Anyway<br><br>Avatar<br>A Clockwork Orange<br>All Star Wars movies<br>Fight Club<br>All Harry Potter movies<br>All Rogen/Goldberg movies, except Superbad<br>All Fast &amp; Furious movies<br>Jurassic World<br><br><br><br>Those were pteranodons. Pterodactyls are the ones in Jurassic World.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I know you probably left the thread already, but the real reason the park is open again, and not that it's a good or realistic reason, was the funding from the US military as a cover for a black project to test out and weaponize the dinosaurs.</br>  <br>I was high when I saw the Interview and it made it worse. What an absolute shit movie. I wish that North Korea wouldn't have protested it so it could have just bombed quietly.</br>  <br>Yeah boring as shit went on and on and on. The characters were stupid just for the sake being retarded and weird.</br>  <br><br> not a realistic reason to open up a dinosaur theme park </br></br>  <br><br>the only move that can wash off the shame of watching CW is Sleeper by Woody allen</br></br>  <br>Same here, north korea should have just kept fucking quiet. I wasted my fucking time downloading that piece of shit and I didn't laugh at all. This movie made me hate seth rogen and james franco..</br>  <br> implying there is a realistic reason to open up a dinosaur theme park </br>  <br><br>I loved it.<br><br><br><br>Mad Max being a background character made it all the more awesome. Max is dead, now bring on the explosions!</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I didn't come up with the lame ass background story I just have a hard on for Chris Pratt </br>  <br><br>I wasn't implying that I was implying you were retarded for implying that.</br></br>  Jurassic world was pretty overrated. It had the stupid le nostalgic meme t Rex scene at the very end. <br> look guise le t Rex XD saves the day <br> Remember this scene!!1!! <br> LOOK AT LE T REX roar just like old movies:3:3 <br> LIKE IF U A 90S BABY <br> cartoons were so much better then and not now, mhm no doubt about it, look at le t Rex nostalgia  <br><br>also pulp fiction, it's just so bad and cheesy but it's the edgy cult classic meme just like American Psycho or Fight club<br> muh deep meaning <br> muh it's so good, <br> muh cult <br> muh 90s babies xD </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't 100% hate all of these movies, but they have more attention than they should.</br>  <br>I didn't care about the power of love thing.<br><br>What got me with this movie is all the story with the guy and his kids.<br><br>Cried like a little bitch a couple of times.<br><br>Probably wouldn't have cared much about that part, but now I have two daughters so yeah.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gr8 logic m8</br>  <br>I didn't like interstellar either.. it's just mcconahguehuehuhg whispering about his daughter like he only has one kid... wtf is up with that?<br>Btw, Mad Max Fury Road was one of the worst fucking movies I paid money for to see, EVER.</br></br>  <br><br> unless you were saying that actually is a realistic reason for opening a dinosaur theme park cause then sorry for being so rude </br></br>  <br>I understood that plot point. I wish that was a bigger part of the movie. I'm just saying that the cover for creating the dinosaurs was to put them in a theme park. The "theme park" would never have been green lit. It would've been better if the dinosaurs were created purely for the military and there was no theme park aspect at all.<br><br>I know, it's not Jurassic Park without there being a theme park. But the other movies in the series already showed why there isn't a theme park anymore. Besides, this newest movie was a half-reboot anyway. They couldn't changed the premise. <br><br>Instead of the dinosaurs getting loose on a theme park island, the dinosaurs get loose on a hidden military installation island. Ooh, that's good. And the dinosaurs are more dangerous because they are taken out of their cages to be trained all the time. Except something goes wrong, and now you have professional military versus dinosaurs. Have the main character be a scientist still so that he's not considered a scumwad like the other military members.<br><br>See, there's a better movie right there.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>No pulp ficition wasn't just a cult film, it was a film with a different style/ action sequences which changed cinema, along with some of the best banter/dialogue in any movie, it is wholeheartedly worthy of it's acclaim, stop writing off classics just because they're classics.</br></br>  <br> muh deep meaning <br>didn't know there was a deep meaning to pulp fiction.</br></br>  <br>last movie was called Jurrassic World fuckface<br><br>also you are making little to no sense<br>The premise of Jurassic Park was never sound as it resolved getting dino DNA from mozzies stuck in amber (tree sap) as we all know<br>This is not possible</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>They could've* change the premise</br>  <br><br><br><br>Samefag</br></br></br></br>  <br>I feels you anon and if it makes you happy the next movie is definitely either gonna be about exactly what you said or a war between the military and the rogue hirer ups who want to use the dinosaurs while hella civvies get eaten</br>  <br><br>It doesn't make sense because it's a fucking movie retard.</br></br>  <br>any of his movies really. but clockwork orange was just horrible.</br>  <br>Lol <br> reddit the post <br><br> itza classic bro, the type of cinematic directing and dialogue was way ahead of its time, that's why it's like, totally a great movie,  <br> like if you a 90s kid XD  <br><br>literally,kill yourself</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  This one sucked  <br>/Thread ,op speaking the truth</br>  <br>If it makes you happy yes the last two were samefag obviously</br>  <br>U know how cult movies are, they think a suitcase shining when opened is like the mystery to all le comsos and omg so clever and witty just like meXDXD, <br><br> I'm mature for my age tho... <br> bazinga! </br></br></br></br>  <br> See, there's a better movie right there. <br>My god this is the stupidest movie premise right there. You just want another "American military is bad and soldiers shoot things all day" movie? I've seen enough of them.</br></br>  <br>read my fucking posts idiot I was saying he was unintelligible not the fucking movie<br><br>Obviously the movie doesn't make sense, I just posted twice saying exactly that you dense fuck</br></br></br>  Iron man.... I hate that fucking pleb robert downey.. i hope he gets aids  <br> hurr durr, I like mainstream film, popular opinion counts much and you can't go against it, if u do u a fedora tipping edgelord <br><br>Not all of us have 3rd grade science education and enjoy seeing pigs fly or how the "power of love" is a "fifth dimension" and "wins on everything". Not gonna lie, I am an avid movie goer and aside from the great CGI, it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen as of lately. Clumsy dialogues made to make story advance, clumsy storyline where the "best pilot of the world" is a pussy that can't spend 10 minutes of the film without crying, unrealistic scenes where Anne Hathaway speaks about the power of love and is not put on security examination (in space, you can trip for a lot of reasons and such behavior would make you think that there is an oxygen loss, for example).<br>But the worst of all was the "quantum data" they retrieved from the black hole. I'm actually a physicist, and I know where the idea comes from. But a) I don't see how being able to solve the incompatibility b/w GR and QM would allow you to build a rotating space station next to Jupiter, and most importantly, fucking b): being able to come up with a solid THEORY in Physics is one thing, being able to do the engineering related to that theory required AT LEAST 50 years, for example Maxwell worked out his theory in the 1800s and we are still refining it today and discovering new applications.<br><br> TL;DR: an all-round bullshit movie. I suggest you do read the reasons why I wrote above, though. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No that's a shittier movie. Oooh soldiers and guns and dinosaurs - fucking trite and boring. <br><br>What made the original JP so good WAS the theme park element - putting average people in a benign, wondrous atmosphere and THEN having all hell break loose. That's what made it so tense. <br><br>I'm not saying Jurassic word was good - it really wasn't. They could have done a lot better with the suspense. But I am saying that your idea is not a "better movie." It's stupid.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>agreed<br><br>was disappointed by it then i heard disney made them and went oh that is why there wasnt enough bloodshed etc. Just really the whole concept is ruined when you can just send a bunch of CGI attack dogs to kill the kids. Why not just do that and see which one lasts the longest?<br><br>it was boring, extremely predictable, and that ending, wtf who didnt see that coming. ruined everything the movie was about with that ending.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>They were all you because you didn't like that I implyed u were stupid</br></br>  <br>i can see why you dont like those movies and its fine, but i still like fight club and pulp fiction and some superhero movies, but star wars has aged badly for me as i grow older.</br>  <br>Nope</br>  <br> last movie was called Jurrassic World fuckface <br><br>Yeah, and I said:<br> The name of the movie(s)/series is Jurassic Park <br><br>meaning that Jurassic World is one of the movies of the Jurassic Park series.<br><br> The premise of Jurassic Park was never sound as it resolved getting dino DNA from mozzies stuck in amber (tree sap) as we all know <br> This is not possible <br><br>God, are you retarded? It's fiction. I never said it wasn't fiction. I'm saying that, by it's own fictional plot, making a new park would be unfeasible and nonsensical.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Every superhero film </br>  <br>Battle Royale was shit.<br>Everyone states to like it because hating the Hunger Games-movies somewhen became cool.</br></br>  <br>once was enough really. It wasn't horrible just once you see it nothing really that makes you omg i missed that i must watch it again moments.</br>  <br><br> implyed </br></br>  <br> excl Toby mcguire <br>My nigga</br></br>  <br>Has anyone said "The Godfather" yet?<br><br>This isn't a Family Guy reference. I did not like The Godfather. Fucking boring as shit.</br></br></br>  <br>I didn't like part 3 either. Let's just pretend it was never made.<br>1 &amp; 2 were awesome though.</br></br>  <br> Battle Royale was shit. <br>HAHAHA you idiot, if you prefer hunger games over BR please just consider that you are a retard.</br></br>  <br><br>Then that falls on your bad attention span, your lack of capacity isn't the movies fault</br></br>  <br>I'm talking about the original Godfather...</br>  <br>Yeah I watched Godfather I and II and thought they were just okay.<br><br>Taxi Driver was another "classic" that didn't live up to the hype.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, they never did reveal how they applied that data to get the space station off the earth. Not that that would've made sense or anything.</br>  <br><br>These niggers with their big lists of movies they didn't like.. what movies do you think they like /b/?</br></br>  <br>lol. OP has trouble with comprehension.</br>  <br>I couldn't pay attention - the film never caught my attention - it was slow paced and boring. Completely overrated.</br>  <br>Coming out with another movie was stupid to begin with! This 4th movie was just a cash grab anyway. They might as well go a different direction with it because the theme park makes no sense anymore.</br>  <br>Godfather hater here - I actually liked Taxi Driver. The character study of De Niro was interesting.</br>    DID YOU KNOW IT TOOK 12 YEARS TO MAKE?!  <br>I especially liked the first one. As Al Pacino is trying to have a fairly normal life he slowly gets sucked in the maffia life and eventually becomes the fucking don. I thought it was pretty awesome, especially for the time being. If you see it now it would be filled with "clichés" which were pretty new at the time.</br>  <br>The book is great, one of my favourites.<br><br>But I didn't like the movie.</br></br></br>  <br>Faggot, what has the actor's character study to do with the actual movie?</br>  <br>You must have a sad taste in movies. Why are you even here?</br>  <br>Been putting this one off ... might take me 12 years to watch too</br>  <br>Not him but Donnie Darko is an overrated piece of hipster bullshit.</br>  <br><br>everything u fuckwit</br></br>  <br>that reply doesn't even make sense... gtfo you lazy-eyed faggot.</br>   Frozen <br> Frozen <br> Frozen <br> the movie with the two sisters one of them has ice magic or something idk <br> that one movie with the songs that everyone always sings <br> disneys ice girls <br> did i mention frozen </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why would you watch footage of someone growing up? Don't you have a family album? Now imagine looking at somebodys elses family album<br><br>This movie is that exciting. Looking at pictures of someones elses fucking kid.<br><br>FUCK YOU</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, you're right, anon. You can tell by the tards raging at you that you are indeed correct; they are a bunch of "nonconforming" edgemasters.</br>  American Sniper  <br>yeah dude... this discussion again? Frozen wasn't meant for 20-30 yr old basement dwelling neckbeards... it was meant for little girls..</br>  <br>I kept watching it until the end, but I felt it was kinda anti-climactic.</br>  <br>Merf<br>Merf!<br>Merf!!!<br>MERF!!! <br><br>That's the entire dialog of the movie</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Top Gun.<br><br>Has to be one of the most overrated movies of all time. My roommate found out I hadn't seen it and flipped out. Watched it, jesus fuck it's bad. Even has one of those retarded 80s sex scenes with the cheesy music and the slow camera shots over naked shoulders while they slow-hump. They play Danger Zone three fucking times.</br></br>  <br>The movie was a character study of De Niros character, you stupid piece of shit.</br>  <br><br>Look at this faggot who thinks movies have to be based on logic, flawless reasoning, fact, and can't have any imagination involved.<br><br>It's for entertainment you dickbag, it isn't a fucking documentary.</br></br></br></br>  ITT: Edgelords vs. Sheeple<br><br>/thread</br></br>  <br>Did you even watch the movie man?</br>  Every Marvel movie in the last 10 years. That includes all the spidermans, X-men, and every shit movie associated with the avengers. these are the most cliched, predictable, "family friendly" bullshit movies around. Each one has the same tired character arcs, stupid jokes, forced romance, pathetic villians, and irritating side characters, and dumb meta references. The one exception might be Big Hero Six, since they went a completely different route.  <br>How edgy</br>  <br>Sheeple and edgelords... Haha, just leave bruh</br>  <br>Bad movie making isn't "imagination"<br><br>It isn't "imagination" when plot and characters don't make sense.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm gonna have to interrupt reading your shit because they are not the MOST predictable movies around. <br> Hunger Games </br></br>  ITT people upset people have opinions differing from their own instead of just enjoying things that are good and avoiding things that are not.  The Alien films, they are fucking garbage    <br>What I got out of it was predestination and pime taradoxes.</br>  <br>thats the point though; so many people lose their shit over a fucking kids movie its worse than minions</br>  <br>I like that movie.</br>  <br>the brits dont know how to say some words<br><br>what the fuck is an appy polly loggy or yarbles</br></br></br>  <br> implying you've seen Minions <br>faggot</br></br>  <br>ITT: People go to a thread dedicated to criticizing popular films, and get butthurt when people criticize popular films.</br>  This one.

That's why I know it didn't make sense. Maybe you're the stupid one.</br>  <br>I thought birdman was one of the most boring pieces of crap I've ever watched the first 40 minutes of. I tried 3 times but I fall asleep after ~40 minutes every time.</br>  <br>Well, it is a movie about a play. Not exactly the Avengers.</br>  Alright /b/.

(Also, I'm 21 years old and fuck your green text)<br><br>It started with me showing her my beast gaming computer and we eventually watched some movies and played minecraft on it. She got tired of standing/leaning on my seat so I told her she can sit on me if she liked, and as soon as she did I swear my boner was already halfway inside her sweet ass. I'm sure she felt it too as she occasionally wiggled herself which nearly made me cum right there. She giggled sometimes too so I'm sure she knew she was rubbing herself on my dick.<br><br>Somehow we got into the topic of relationships and shit and asked if we've kissed anyone before, she said yes, I said no (I know I'm pathetic). She said she'd love to be my first kiss and literally for the rest of the night we were making out. She ate out my tongue like she was starving for it and even let me 'play' with her for a while lol but I was too scared to go further (so no sexy time)<br><br>I'm seeing her again next week so hopefully we'll take things a bit further. As a reward, roll 69 and I'll post a pic of her :^)<br><br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/630959119#p630959119">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice mate, wish you all the best, don't let yourself get caught, it could fuck your whole life sadly.
