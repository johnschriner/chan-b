I'd be a billionare like him until he decides that he doesn't want it anymore</br></br>  <br>I respect a man of dignity and integrity. Well played good sir.</br>  <br>I'll do it for ten.</br>  High IQ people only. Let's have a stimulating discussion.  what do you consider "stimulating"?  <br> /b/ <br> discussion <br><br>Are you sure you have an IQ over 140?<br><br>This is probably the most retarded thing I'll hear today.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I've never been tested, but my IQ is obviously over 160. I'm an atheist that has evolved beyond that of a normal atheist. I only dress with the utmost class; obviously a sign of higher intelligence. Also, I have a 10/10 girlfriend. She can't resist my smarts. I'll battle any pleb that thinks he is smarter than I.</br>  yes my is iq is over 140  hi guy my eye que is over oneforty    my're IQ is literally 300  <br>Come fight me and my big fat black dick. We are waiting for your reply.</br>  <br>erm smrerter den yuu</br>  IQ only determines ones ability to solve problems. Actual knowledge, intellect, or decision making aren't measured.<br><br> Inb4 butthurt <br><br>I'm right at 140, no hurt feelings here</br></br></br></br>  <br>300 like the Romans :^DDDD</br>  IQ of 9001. AMA.  would it rather be beastiality or interracial to fuck a goblin?  <br><br>i am an intelligemt yung male who woman won't except efen thouh I'm 500lbs of pure love</br></br>   IQ over 140 <br> /b/ <br> lol </br></br>  my IQ is 138 can I still join?  <br>i mean i'm still not sure about that</br>  My IQ is 164, so don't dismiss it when I say IQ tests are complete bullshit that only indicate one type of thinking, anyone who brags about their IQ is probably insecure.  <br>/b/<br><br>Asking the important questions</br></br></br>  i actually beat the iq test  Iq iz 104 so i getz in rightz?    What do you guys think of loop quantum gravity? I find it fascinating but I think that the actual way to discover the theory of everything is to combine the theories of the Higgs Field, the aether, the Cosmological Constant, dark energy/dark matter, and quantum gravity and only by collectively looking at those things, and combining them with the Grand Unified Theory, can the Theory Of Everything be completed.    <br>163 IQ <br>Doesn't mean I'm smarter its mental agility such as memory and problem solving</br></br>  <br><br><br>Morons, you're not even worth discussing important matters with. You can only sit there behind your screens and use petty insults. Well you're not worth staring a kerfuffle with, plebs. Now I shall retire to my lair, as I can already sense that non of you will ever be worthy of my smarts.</br></br></br>    <br><br> So.... " IS YOU ARE IQ OVER 140? "<br><br>That explains more about OP:s IQ than he probably wanted.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Nein, getz out weak minded figgit</br>  <br>I've never had a formal IQ test but I know it must be quite high because my intelligence enlightens me and it is euphoric</br>  <br>The goblin is a humanoid creature, and could be argued as a race of humanity, so it would be interracial</br>  <br>Anything above an IQ 115 wouldnt go on /b/ and waste his time</br>  If you're so smart, how come I broke you?  How does /b/ feel about the sum of all positive integers equating to -1/12?  <br>Ever get the feeing that you're surrounded by retards here, but you can't figure out why you stick around?</br>  my am IQ much high too :D  136 but I'll rek any of you fools  <br> Knowledge, Intellect and decision making isnt used when solving problems <br> 140? more like 90 gtfo </br></br>  <br>Dude, me too! What special school did you go to?</br>  <br> kerfuffle <br> plebs <br> lair <br>autist detected</br></br></br></br>  nigger nigger nigger nigger nigger  <br>I am smart enough to see that such discussion is futile. Forcing up to have stimulating conversation is inorganic, pretentious and subliminally arrogant. I am not a rat put here to answer such silly questions or to prove my intellect as such. I am enlightened.</br>  <br>High IQ doesn't imply good decision making</br>  <br>Just putting fancy words together in a sentence doesn't mean what you're saying actually has any merit to it.</br>  <br>/thread</br>  Hey even though I doubt any of you actually possess this level of intelligence, and I know none of you will think that I do regardless. But I'll hop in nonetheless, what did you have in mind op?  <br>Is nobody going to say anything about the fact that it's 'is YOUR IQ over 140' instead of you're?</br>  <br>well, of course.<br>im a liberal transracial feminist</br></br>  <br>god this pic is hot</br>  <br>140 isn't high, that's above average at best.</br>  <br>At least use the right your OP</br>  Hello /b/. I have a problem. I'm way too smart for my age, and everyone around me is intellectually inferior.<br><br>I'm 18 and at high school, but everyone in my class is fucking stupid. I try to engage them in religious debates (Atheist here) and political debates (Neo-Socialist) but all they care about is parties and Facebook.

It still killed the raptors and roared when the banner fell.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Not to mention it was based off a best seller from Stephen Hawking, so all HIS fans jumped on there too. On that note<br><br> Dreamcatcher </br></br></br></br>  <br>It was a good movie, m8. Nothing spectacular but definitely worth seeing in the movies. Plus<br> zoe saldana in skin-tight leather <br> implying that alone didn't validate the movie </br></br></br>  <br> Stephen Hawking <br><br>kek</br></br></br>  <br>world retconned 2 and 3 fyi</br>  <br><br> King <br> swype </br></br></br>  <br>Muh Nigga<br><br><br>the animated Batman Vs. Robin was a bit shite</br></br></br></br>  <br>I tried to like it. I really did. I saw it 3 times but I just can't see why this is considered the king of all movies.<br><br>If anyone wants to explain why please do</br></br></br>  <br>yeah, it would have been better if it didn't have as much angsty teenage robin (we got enough of that in the movie right before this one) and focused on the owl being bruce's brother</br>  <br><br><br>I can see following the director. I guess what I meant more so of overrated would be in the context of the present day. I know it was unique when it came out, but when someone acts like it's their favorite horror movie of all time, and all they mention of it is the ending, I'd consider it be overrated. I think along the lines of social acceptance and pressure (band wagon jumping) for liking something for it be considered overrated, not for truly liking it for it's other qualities.<br><br>Stephen Hawking threw me off for a second, lol.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>this.</br></br>  <br>you could say it hasn't aged that well, specially compared to what Tarantino has done afterwards.<br><br>But back in the day it was the first Tarantino at full force and blow minds from 14yo to high brow critics. it was something real, not press inflated. it was the favorite movie of a shitload of people</br></br></br>  <br><br>I think that bandwagon thing plays a MAJOR role in their popularity. Much the same as Che Guevara, The Nightmare Before Christmas, The Ramones, and every Hot Topic store in the country. These would be like the indie version of those I bet. What sucks is that I seem to sound like them too, but I just watch a SHIT TON of movies. My favorite director is Guillermo Del Toro. His style COULD be considered revolutionary, for like 2009-2010. But hes getting repetitive just like Tarantino.</br></br>  <br>Just because it doesn't interest you much doesn't mean it wasn't really good. The cinematography and acting are for the most part what makes it so good. It was revolutionary at the time.</br>  <br>quality is only for audio and video, you can't objectively quantify whether a movie is good or not.</br>  <br><br> learn difference between objective and subjective <br> profit from knowing why everyone has their own unique preferences in everything ever yet agree on larger issues like politics </br></br></br>  <br>Trips confirm. I think a lot of people are saying Vertigo is the greatest now. <br><br><br>There are probably plenty of movies from that era that translate better today, making them true classics.</br></br></br></br>  <br>there's good writing and bad writing... good camerawork and bad camerawork... good acting and bad acting...</br>  <br>I agree. It was a decent movie, but not worth the hype. Same with almost every Marvel movie. Watchable, but it doesn't make me cum.</br>  <br><br>I agree with this. For a movie to be considered the greatest movie of all time has to mean it still holds up today. This unfortunately doesn't. The plot is unimaginative and boring. The plot twist (if you can even call it that) made me feel like I wasted 2 hours over nothing. Yet people still say this movie is the holy grail of cinema. I just don't get it</br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=OfP<wbr>NnKEOhJ0</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>this guy is wrong<br> no such thing as overrated <br>That's just silly. Movies get hyped by marketing and plebs go with it. You are saying there is no such thing as bad taste.</br></br></br>  <br><br>these guys get it</br></br>  <br>It's hype has something do with 60's French cinema and them thinking, even to this day I believe, that shit with no meaning is somehow artsy.</br>  <br><br> classics <br><br>There he goes using the c-word. But citizen kane IS a classic, no doubt. Its just that using a word like "classic" only tells others to like it for no reason other than "its a classic". Which breeds more people who like shit like Pulp Fiction etc, but don't know any details about WHY.</br></br></br></br>    Interstellar was a movie that made plebs think they were smart. <br>McConaughey made me want to vomit blood and die.</br>  <br>That's the one</br>  <br>I know what you mean about Del Toro getting repetative. I dunno if it's demands of the studio, pressure from fans, boredom, if they just get their ass kissed sooo much they think they're still original. Tim Burton is a perfect example for me.<br><br>I did like one of Guillermo Del Toro's earlier movies about kids in an orphanage (it was Spanish and subbed if I remember right).<br><br>I've always thought Charlie Chaplin's movies don't get enough praise anymore. Modern Times is what, almost 80 years old? I can still watch that and laugh, it actually holds up really well all things considered.</br></br></br></br></br>  Mad max fury road was interesting modern spin on the series<br>guardians of the galaxy was interesting but not terribly praise<br>worthy IMO<br>pulp fiction was ok considdering the time period it was released<br><br>it all just comes down to how much they hype the movie and how much you as a person likes it<br><br><br>Agreed</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I liked it, but the plot skips were unnecessary. That's probably the biggest flaw.</br>  if i may  I was going to mow my lawn but its raining so i cant. Could someone suggest me a couple movies to watch. If they arent on netflix thats fine. Thanks  <br> I liked it, but the plot skips were unnecessary. <br><br>You are either missing the point or a troll. 2/10 made me post.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh Chaplin is 100% a forgotten jewel in American film. More people need to watch his shit, him and Buster Keaton. <br><br>You mean El Orfanato. Its actually probably my favorite, the style finally matches the story line. But it was horrendously sad, I still bawl like a bitch every time. Same with Pans Labrynth too. His style needs his plot lines in order to work, I think. Like Hellboy was a bad match for him, everything was too upbeat and cheery. His shit relies on having a darker context to bring out the contrast when he includes something a little light hearted like faeries with a twist.</br></br></br></br>  Jack Nicholson overacts almost every role he plays. Not enough to make a movie shitty, but enough to be a little jarring.  <br><br>YES. WHAT THE FUCK IS THE DEAL WITH THIS HORRIBLE SHIT MOVIE?!</br></br>  <br>I said "true classics". Words are used as shorthand for concepts. I didn't invent that. You don't have a point. <br> using a word like "classic" only tells others to like it for no reason other than "its a classic" <br>sure, buddy, that's what they are doing. Watch that edge.</br></br></br>  <br>Alright, nigger, enlighten me.</br>  <br><br><br>welcome to this discussion. so glad you could join us today, plebeian.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Try some of his earlier stuff like Carnal Knowledge or The Last Detail.</br></br>  MAN OF STEEL<br>What the fuck was that?<br>Why does it get a 7.2 on IMDb?<br><br>Marvel can't make a decent for shit compared to DC but this one fucking sucked dicks.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>donny fucking darko. <br><br>What a pile of unadulterated crap I ever saw. I know what the big secret was about that movie that no one can get.<br><br>it was a vehicle for jake gyllenhal to give him cache and mystique.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>nobody knows what you are talking about, fag</br>  <br>This especially on 4 chins everyone busts a nut at the mention of it</br>  <br>fyi the T-rex from Jurassic World is the T-rex from the first movie. She's not in any other movie apart from Jurassic World, and she roams free after the final battle. Fucking retard.</br>  <br><br> Amelie <br><br>fuck you</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He was taking a shot at non-linear story telling in a way that hadn't been done before. Pretty effective.</br></br>  <br>I didn't think man of steel was THAT bad sure had some pretty big flaws and the end was pretty crap but not like the worst movie or anything</br>    You guys are wrong about Donnie Darko but when criticizing it you are saying more about the era it came out. Every teen thought that was edgy shit when it came out. Most of you probably heard about it from older people later and thought it would be great.  <br> cannot make a decent for shit <br>Sure, buddy.<br><br>The only passable live action movies to come out of DC are those in Nolan's Batman trilogy. At least Marvel's are fun to watch.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Anything by quiten tarantino</br></br>  <br>I meant to say *you are not wrong about DD</br>  <br><br>sorry here you go<br><br>ple·be·ian<br>pləˈbēən/<br>noun<br>1.<br>(in ancient Rome) a commoner.<br>adjective<br>1.<br>of or belonging to the commoners of ancient Rome.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> stands on balcony overlooking city <br> thinks about how many people have orgasms <br> show couples fucking <br> 16 <br> so fucking stupid <br><br>artsy French garbage. It's up there with that fuck-awful Perfume: Story of a Murderer</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it was certainly more enjoyable than most shitty ass marvel movies</br>  <br><br>i was still in that demographic they were targeting, all my friends shat themselves over this movie but i still never saw the appeal. i bet its the rabbit, everyone had a boner over that fucking rabbit.</br></br>  <br>Everybody knows what that means. You are just proving how retarded you are right now. <br><br>Please go on about how nobody should use the word "classic" or whatever you mean. It's super interesting.</br></br></br>  Definitely Interstellar, absolute shite  <br>Sure, pretty effective, but it could have done without so much of it, made it seem more episodic than one movie. The concept was well executed, not perfectly done. Still one of my favorites.</br>  Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice is gonna be overrated as fuck. Everyone will know it's bad. Everyone will go in knowing that. They'll still see it. They'll find bullshit things to say about it that make it seem decent, even good. <br><br>"Wow, that scene where Superman was floating there, I really thought a guy was floating in mid-air! 10/10 graphics!"<br><br>It'll be shit and we'll eat it up like mudslimes at the end of Ramadan.</br></br></br></br>  Just going off of the most recent movie I've seen.<br>Ant-man was terrible. There was about an hour and a half of boring drawn out dialogue and about 10 minutes of "make this action super funny" fighting. It was so boring.</br>    <br>you got nothing. cool</br>  <br>Never done before is a stretch. As far as im aware, Kurosawa did it previously in Rashomon (multiple non-chronological viewpoints, none of which are "the whole truth"), and you can bet a movie geek like QT was aware (if not knowingly 'borrowing').</br>  <br>Pretty good movie in my opinion, but also really pretentious, especially with that second title. Too much "whoa that's deep bro" and a little overwritten. Don't know why it got so many awards. Emma Stone is shit in it.</br>  <br>This is a great movie. Just wished it had the last chapter of the book in it. (Also great book)</br>  <br><br> babys first b8 <br> checked though </br></br></br>  <br> implying I have better things to do than respond to b8 </br>  <br>MUUURPH<br><br>MUUUUUUUURPH<br><br>Im pretty sure you could hear McConaughey's pores leaking.<br><br>But plebians that call themselves "nerds" liked it because, on a moron level, some parts of it loosely match up with real theories.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not sure if you noticed but some crazy shit happened in that movie. Also the soundtrack was well implemented.</br>  <br><br>Just like Big Bang Theory.</br></br>  The room.  <br>Almost any marvel movie. Avengers and iron man and iron man 2 was good the rest where ok to who gives a fuck</br>  <br>Even that shit show had its moments. Interstellar wasn't even occasionally funny.</br>  <br>The Room is a god damn treasure.</br>  <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=jKS<wbr>3MGriZcs</wbr>  [ ] <br><br>leaving for posterity</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>you shut your whore mouth. YOU ARE TEARING ME APART, ANON.</br></br>    Rocky Horror Picture Show. I don't get it. It had some cool tunes though.  <br><br>Op here.<br><br>Absolutely none of these superhero bullshit movies are worth any of the hype they're getting. Everytime a new one comes out (ant man Most recently) people go apeshit crazy as if nothing else like it ever came out.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Rashomon was different. It was basically one story, whereas PF was several different stories that loosely overlapped. It was very challenging watching it the first time.</br></br>  <br><br>that movie is going to be fucking retarded, you all bear witness to the prediction. anon said it first, that movie will be shit. Paul Rudds League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.</br></br>  <br>every pile of shit coming from Tarantino and Tim Burton</br>  <br>I thought this movie was "cool and edgy" when I was 14. Rewatched part of it recently, I don't know why I ever thought this was cool. Decent soundtrack though.</br>  <br>For a change, OP is not a faggot!</br>  Gotta go with Life of Brian or Holy Grail. I always enjoy Flying Circus, but those movies bore the shit out of me.  <br><br> <br>thisss. except for holy grail, that one was a household constant for me. life of brian though, not funny at all. flying circus has its moments too but i dont like that one either.</br></br></br>  <br>just saw it<br>was better then expected<br>still capeshit tho</br></br></br>  <br>dat movie was better than a blowjob</br>      <br>yeah, who looks at Ant Man and thinks that won't suck dick?<br>The whole concept is fucking retarded.<br> Awesome </br></br></br>  <br><br>not everything is b8. this movie was shit tier. it was only good in the first 10 mins. the rest should not have been entertaining if you are over 12 and even that is a stretch</br></br>  <br>fuck you that was awesome, go back to The Expendables</br>  even his kids think its stupid  <br>checked</br>  <br>she isnt even that attractive man</br>  <br>witnessed</br>  <br>I thought this was at least entertaining to watch. The future was portrayed in an interesting way. The overall plot wasn't great.</br>  <br>what do you have against the green mile?</br>  <br>I agree that all these superhero movies are getting out of hand. But I will say I am sorta kinda hyped for deadpool. Only because they can get creative with the fact that hes aware of the audience. But I'm pretty sure that will end up not doing as well either</br>    <br><br>it wont, hell end up coming off like a talk show host because they have to keep it PG-13 or some bullshit.</br></br>  <br>No one was ever hyped for Grandma's Boy, anon. Cool your jets.</br>  Rosebud. Maybe  <br>Kate Winslet annoyed the shit out of me so I didn't like it at first glance, but I had to realise that justified Jim Carrey trying to get rid of her memory forever.<br> wish I could erase Jim Carrey from my mind </br></br>  <br>I agree, I thought his job was pretty interesting. It just felt like a generic love story that tried to be more. I also didn't really feel his acting, felt forced like the way he always fixed his glasses.</br>  <br>They announced it was going to be R, I think. Might actually be worth the watch, I'm not getting my hopes up though.</br>    <br>fuckin Kubrick man</br>  <br>Based on the trailer it will suck. The "what the shit" joke was fucking dreadful, cringeworthy to say the least. Ofc I hope it will be good tho</br>  <br><br>it got released right at the end of that "manic pixie" bullshit, thats the only reason everyone got hyped. she was so "lovable and quirky", "spontaneous" etc.</br></br>  just like this too, will be horrible.    <br>did that scene offend you anon?</br>  <br>The only reason why everyone liked GotG so much is because everyone expected it to be bad<br><br>Going in to the movie, everyone had low expectations<br><br>When they saw that the movie was mediocre at best, they fucking ate that shit up</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Every super hero movie<br><br>Citizen Kane</br></br></br>  <br><br>plot summary<br> follow this guy as he spends thousands of dollars on a missing persons report trip across the country <br> to find this basic bitch that disappeared from a cushy middle class life for no reason </br></br></br></br>  <br>He's actually talking about The Devil's Backbone. The Orphanage was produced by Del Toro, but not directed by him. It was also Spanish, not Mexican.</br>    <br>I wasn't familiar with that phrase so I had to google it.<br>worth it.</br></br>  <br>Lord of the Rings<br><br>I assume they stole the plot from watching elderly people walk around the block, but when they made a movie out of it, the magic was lost.</br></br></br>  <br>The Ramones?</br>  <br>Nah, LotR movies were awesome. Hobbit trilogy sucks shit.</br>  Rated ridiculously highly by critics (95% ish on Rotten Tomatoes). Thought it was pretentious as hell and terribly written for an allegory.<br><br>Before anyone complains popularity=/= rating</br></br>  <br>it was shit man, i saw it like 6 months after it was released and people were still hyped as fuck about it.<br>What a god awfull pile of shit, specially the writing that has the clear intention of creating le funny meme xDDDD!!!!! in the future. Hated the raccoon voice acting, the tree, the niggress, the omg he's an autist that's so cute.<br>I mean I'm not as mad as it sounds, im just horribly worried about how shit Deadpool is gonna be.</br></br></br>  <br>This. <br>My mother and I were laughing at the dialogues. Truly the worst film ive seen in a long time. The part when the black chick was like "I want chicken". Fucking hell man</br></br>   godfather <br> kingsman <br> some shit about vampires that just lazed around and wanted to die (don't remeber the title) </br></br>  <br>what is this some kind of chink ass film with a western actor as the lead role?<br> expecting the praise to be motivated by something other than political correctness, and the artsy 'it's not for everyone' meme </br></br>  <br><br> tfw no one ever said it was mexican <br> tfw there was no point to this post other than to horribly mistate facts to correct something no one insinuated <br> tfw orfanato is in a language called CASTILIAN by those who speak it <br> and by Mexicans who hate to have it implied that they're speaking castilian <br> instead of mexican <br> that no one mentioned </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you believe zoos put electrical implants in each animal that shock them; presumably to keep them in line</br>  <br>You're right, that movie sucked. They can't make good SciFi anymore</br>    <br>Ever Transformers movie ever.</br>  <br>That movie is awesome, nice dubs.</br>  <br>aaaannnnndddd youre fucking wrong</br>  Hunger Games. Books and movies.  <br> They can't make good SciFi anymore <br><br>Yeah. Primer and Moon sucked, too.</br></br></br>  <br>Scorsese is a genius and that movie deserves every bit of praise</br>  <br><br>its like EVERY girl from 2004-08. all mimicking this bullshit trope and failing miserably at it.</br></br>  <br>Ehh, transformers hasn't been hyped since the second movie.</br>  <br>too many<br>shawshank redemption since it's top1 of imdb<br>too long too boring expected ending.<br>it was great back then i agree but in the end its just another movie to pass time not a masterpiece or something.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Goodfellas Sucked<br><br>The writer implies Robert DeNiro is only 21 and gives him street cred by explaining that when he watches a movie, he roots for the bad guy. <br><br>But if that's not bad enough the story was based on a massive faggot that occasionally got gang rapped and would do ANYTHING for a beer.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>this one was by king too, wasnt it? and didnt he do green mile as well? seeing a trend there.</br></br>  <br><br>this and twilight, obviously</br></br>  <br>green mile wasn't that bad but i wouldnt put it on masterpiece level.<br>but my taste is weird on movies. i need something to put me out of my mind.<br>i found the aviator really good and i dare anyone to say otherwise.</br></br></br>  Any Will Ferrell movies. Don't get me wrong, he's pretty funny.  <br>dont get started on leo well be here all night<br><br>if you like ball jokes. get hard was hilarious though, but kevin hart kind of saved the day.</br></br></br>  <br>oh god this. i hate this movie.<br>realized the ending in 13 minutes.<br>"it's either doctor or leo".</br></br></br>  <br>nothing worse than a predictable, shyamalan quality twist at the end.</br>  Annoyingly cheesy and ridiculous  <br>i was thinking about it twodae.<br>bad acting bad script bad camera takes.<br>but still its too fucking old.<br>the new one sucked though too.</br></br></br></br>    This faggot's movies  <br>But everyone loved it.</br>  <br> sad autist parroting greentext since he's a butthurt 12 year old who was so excited when his mommy took him to see this shit movie </br>  <br> jake gyllenhal <br>Hey dude's a good actor he's not staying tied down to a one hit wonder cult classic and is in lots of cool movies<br>Prisoners<br>Night crawler <br>Enemy <br><br>Can't wait to see him in southpaw</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>overrated doesn't necessarily mean bad; it just means that it was rated higher than it deserved to be</br>  <br>I have no idea why. Its boring as hell BUT I will say the idea is pretty unique. within certain expectations for Costners shit.</br>  <br>I agree with you, tbh I did enjoy it but for some reason couldn't grasp the plot. Or maybe im retarded</br>  <br> the new one sucked though too. <br> mfw when you aren't a car guy </br></br>  <br> couldn't grasp the plot <br>It wasn't challenging at all, it was literally made for the lowest class in our society</br></br>  <br>All of the DC movies are overrated because DC fags think it will outshine marvel in some way, shape, or form.<br><br>kek</br></br></br>  <br>He looks like he needs a dick</br>  Guys ... Guys... I search a youtube clip where Jim Carrey impersonates a colleague ... who kinda looks like Jim Carrey... and the impersonation says he hates Jim Carrey ...  <br><br>you know what, i watched the first, thought nothing of it, tried the second and gave up on it it was so bad then didnt even bother with the third. <br><br>the trailers for fury road looked like overdone michael bay shit. watched the film, loved it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> implying they are not what cinema is supposed to be, not that Marvel crap </br>  <br>Hands down, Birdman is the most overrated movie in the last decade.</br>  <br> implying it's not fuckin John Wick </br>  <br> first 10 minutes <br>What, when he's dancing around a cave? Killeth thyself OP</br></br>  <br>Good decision, the 3rd one is even worse, literally a waste of time<br>1st one was ok tho</br></br>  <br>This is the kind of pussy bullshit the millenials bring to the table. Don't judge movies, everyone wins at sports. No ideas are bad.</br>  <br>I don't understand how you could like fury, there was no plot or character development and almost no dialog, just random people driving around with a CGI back drop.<br><br>I am really curios, why you liked it so much</br></br></br>  <br>Honestly, I was super excited to see it, made plans, then at the last minute cancelled, and haven't seen it yet.<br>One reason: McConaughey.</br></br>  The Dark Knight  <br>Mexican detected</br>  <br>I don't think anyone ever said John Wick was going to be anything more than what it is. A mindless action joy ride. However, lots of people went frothing made declaring how amazing Birdman is. Bird man is shit, even if you take into account the complexity of it. Just gimmickry trying to prove shallowness as genius</br>  <br>This. Terrible movie</br>  <br>Lawrence of Arabia. Totally unrealistic.</br>  <br>I got bored after 30 minutes of realizing how much bullshit would be in it. Plus, honestly, it wasn't believable despite good acting.</br>  <br>well shit now I'm GLAD i didn't see it. everyones recommending it, was it really that bad? whats the premise even?</br>  <br/>  <br>The fuck? Great soundtrack, Jim Carrey diverging from his typical stuff, great directing.<br><br>Man this thread is full of hipster shits posting great movies as "OVERRATED" so they can feel better about the shitty movies they like</br></br></br>  <br><br>Great b8. You actually picked some heavy swingers movie wise. There's no way those are shit or over-rated.</br></br>  <br>It was Conan O'Brian, Thanks for nothing</br>  Shrek  <br>what you mean is there is no extraneous exposition crap in it, just what needs to be said and lots of action. lots of good ideas in it too that werent as cringey as i thought they'd be.<br><br><br>dont bother its horrible. not even in the same league as 2001 as many keep saying.<br><br><br>birdman's great but the gimmick wasnt that well done, the cuts are plentiful and so obvious. well written and acted though. i like long talky shit like that i know its not for everyone.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>With different actors it could have been good. I hate every character in it though. Especially Kate winslets.</br>  Saw  <br>This <br>But I kinda see it being considered overrated BECAUSE everyone anticipated shit, but then got a reasonably good movie, so there was undue hype in that people were like "JW doesn't suck balls, you gotta see it!"</br></br>  <br>Dark knight was way better than tdkr imo</br>  <br><br>You know what I hate about that? Rape=Ultraviolence. They're different verbages for the same act. The ad guys never read the source book and why would they.</br></br>  <br>Muh Lincoln</br>  <br>are you shitting me? the idea was novel, for the first 30 minutes. After that the twist at the end of "surprise i regret everything i just did" was a LONG time coming. 3/10 max, soundtrack was created by hipsters, for hipsters, since hipsters are the only ones who openly admit that they love this movie.</br>  <br>srsly the movie and McConaughey weren't that bad</br>  Most overrated movie I have ever seen, the story arch was when he discovered the feature "relationship status" before anyone else, if only myspace could have invented it.  <br><br>It's true. There is no deep meaning. After watching it two times, you can nod and say "oh yeah", but it's not close to mind blowing.</br></br>  <br>Dude, the bigger aspects of that movie are actual WWI history. they just shaded in with some narrative.</br>  <br>Kill yourself pleb</br>  Frozen.<br><br>It was terribly underwhelming for a Disney movie. The plot was too rushed, almost none of the characters had any personality, and Elsa and Anna were annoying. The only character who wasn't totally flat was Olaf, the fucking comedy relief character. <br><br>I still don't understand the collective asskissing that it's gotten. Wreck-it Ralph, Tangled, Big Hero 6 and Inside Out were all fundamentally leagues better but only have a quarter of the popularity that Frozen has gotten for some reason. <br><br>I'm not exactly saying Frozen was a bad movie, it was just a disappointment. I think it's extremely overrated for what it was.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>indeed frozen was fucking horrible.</br>  Poorly written characters = I don't give a shit what happens to them.  meanwhile sir arthur conan doyle rolls in his grave<br><br> every Guy Ritchie movie ever </br></br>  <br>I have never seen Battle Royal, should I watch it when it gets to Netflix?</br>  <br>Snatch was one of my favorites, but I agree with the rest.</br>  <br>Wwi was a lie made up by Germans to justify WWII</br>  <br>What about, "wWI," can you give us your opinion on that one too?</br>  Every episode.  <br>It was just an interesting concept for it's time. <br>And I'll take the opportunity to say that Hunger Lames ripped it off. The bitch claimed she got the idea somewhere else but it doesn't matter. The shit was basically already done. I'm not saying she shouldn't have wrote the book but a lot of people would have stopped when they realized the idea wasn't original at all.</br></br>  <br>If you were expecting to see an actually meaningful and good movie then yes it's overrated and gets too much praise. If you were expecting it to be what it was( a flashy, empty, mind candy movie), then it holds perfectly well up to comparable movies</br>  <br>They are decent movies. I wasn't into the whole action aspect at first but what do you expect? <br><br> like Lock Stock and Snatch aren't great movies... </br></br></br>    <br>SHAME ON YOU<br>SHAME ON YOUR FAMILY<br>AND SHAME ON YOUR COW</br></br></br>    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=PLL<wbr>QK9la6Go</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Pretty much the whole superhero movie genre</br></br>  It was visually entertaining. Otherwise it was pretty shit.  <br>I agree with your choice op, I like the movie and all but I thought it pretty flawed.

I recognise oldboy as a very well made movie, but it didn't entertain me so much.

Ded movie.</br></br>  <br>Lock Stock would've been A LOT better if they just focused on a few characters a little more. Instead it was just a hodge podge of stereotypical henchmen pulling off a pseudo 'bank job' with funny quips here and there, boringly.</br>  <br> said nobody in the nineties </br>  <br>i agree but i think out of all the superhero shit that has been pumped out recently daredevil is of the higher quality shit.</br>    <br><br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=mQH<wbr>CEUvc4Q0</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  This piece of shit trilogy.<br><br>Not even expecting any contradictions.</br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=oxY<wbr>89F5oU-I</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>I liked them, but they were massively over hyped</br>  <br><br>If this were't a b8 thread I'd actually be angry</br></br>  <br>I haven"t actually watched Daredevil since I don't have Netflix</br>  Name a hotter female lead singer than Haley from Paramore <br> Professional tip:You can't It is not possible <br> https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=XoY<wbr>u7K6Ywkg</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>what about Hayley, from Paramore?</br>        <br>I love her small tits</br>    Angela Gossow from arch enemy    <br> Name a hotter female lead singer than Haley from Paramore <br><br>And while you're at it, also name an anon who gives a shit</br></br></br>  <br> doesn't give a shit <br> posts anyway </br></br>  <br>that's because you're a faggot.</br>  <br>Easy mate</br>        <br><br>Cristina Scabbia (from Lacuna Coil)</br></br>    The girl from Within Temptation.    <br>Beat me to it.</br>  angela wins every day of the week  Okay /b/ros.

Oh they provide food, shelter, and all the "im a bad parent" guilt based presents they could want, but they dont teach em values. <br>Lets go back to my childhood. I was the smallest, got the living shit beat outta me regularly. Come home, sit down to family dinner. Dad looks at me, says "son, its time you learned how to stick up for yourself." Took me to the back yard and over the course of the next few weeks we listened to iron maiden on the radio and he taught me how to settle my differences. No below the belt, thats for when yer in real danger, dont gouge eyes or bite, same thing. Taught me how to handle myself. <br>Today? OMG JHONNY GOT PICKED ON. HONEY CALL THE LAWYER!! IM GONNA GET HIS THERAPIST OVER HERE ASAP!! <br>(notice how in one story wisdom was passed from one generation the the next, while in the other hes just learned that hes helpless and alone and that even mommy and daddy cant help?) <br>Or worse, there is no family dinner, mom and dad never notice, he stews on it for years, buys or steals a gun, and goes apeshit.</br></br></br></br></br>  How does one have a successful /b/ thread?  <br>Jus got this new Lamborgni EERE. good for Drivin round da hollywood hills. lot mor proud of these new bookshelves I had to have installed.<br><br>DERP</br></br></br>  Here's a video, uploaded it yesterday but it won't be long before they take it down. http://<span>youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ  [ ]  what ethnicity is Tai?<br><br>He looks like a white guy but slightly different</br></br></blockquote>]
