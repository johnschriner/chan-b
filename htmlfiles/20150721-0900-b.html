I can't even pretend to feel sorry. There like mangy animals.  <br>we shouldn't strive to save all the people around the world, we are too many anyways.<br><br>Also we shouldn't take care of the retarded and certainly not act like they are some wonderfully special being that can not be disciplined.</br></br></br>  /lgbt/ should burn  <br> implying unpopular </br>  Israel is wrong.  Human value is like money, and it's heavily inflated.

Shouldn't the feminazis fight that women have the right to do with their bodies what they want?</br>  Most of the muslim population (i mean yihadists) should be killed or atleast put in prison.<br><br>It should be taken off the fact that humans (i mean all humans) shouldnt be killed because of the ethics values that we are supposed to have, i find it stupid and worthless, why dont kill something that kill the same ones from their own species and destroy everything to get power??? Lets kill anyone who deserve it. (Sorry for the bad english)</br></br>  Age of consent must be lowered to 14 and of drinking to 16 if with an adult and 18 without an adult.  Non STEM and Law subjects should be abolished from university. Time wasting SJW trash drag everyone down.  Give autists the right motivation so they don't sit and whine all the time<br><br>A bat seems sufficient</br></br>  <br>This is an unpopular opinion thread, man. The posters know what they're saying is unpopular. <br>Jesus</br></br>  <br>america too "christian" to let women sell themselves</br>  <br>okay go to prison rape there is semi legal :)</br>  <br><br>Everybody is just a mangy animal and i hate humans who think being "civilized" somehow makes them different.</br></br>  <br>So i'm not allowed to scrutinize? Half of them are ill informed opinions.</br>  <br><br>i smoke pot most days, made 96k last yr and spent this weekend at an awesome wedding and then took my family out on my boat, after returning from a kickass vacation to iceland last week. does that make you mad kiddo?</br></br>  The beatles suck ass  <br>I completely agree.</br>  <br> We shouldn't take care of the retarded <br><br>It's okay, we don't mind helping you buddy.</br></br></br>  feminist are right and we should check our privilege.  <br>gr8 b8 m8 i r8 8/8</br>  Does she still like me  <br>I honestly wish these weren't unpopular</br>  <br>Niggers should be sent to Guantanamo Bay and starved to death.</br>  <br>This is meant to be an unpopular opinions thread. Why can't the niggers invent their own way of getting clean water?</br>  <br>Wrong thread lmao</br>  Overpopulation isn't a problem.  <br> feelthebern faggot detected </br>  <br>comes to an unpopular opinions thread to shit on people... WE HAVE A WINNER FOLKS!!</br>  <br>This thread is about unpopular opinions, not retarded ones.<br> <br>Try again.</br></br></br>  <br>Then why are you on 4chan. No one actually likes you. Obviously your family used you for your money, they probably can't stand being near you. You probably smell like most pot heads do, a mixture of shit and cut grass. Your kids are probably embarrassed that their father smokes pot like a fuckwit. And the wedding? They probably invited so that you'll stop smoking pot for a fucking minute and do something that normal people do naturally.But you probably ripped a joint in the bathroom like a fucking failure. Congrats.</br>  Government should provide free health care, abortions, vaccines, condoms, internet, education, car license training, gym subscription.<br>Government should only allow couples who have gone through proper parent training to have children.<br>Government should deport homeless people (if they fail to accept help and make themselves part of society again).<br>Prostitution should be legal.</br></br></br>  <br>That's exactly what it means. Unpopular opinions aren't necessarily based on any facts. An unpopular opinion is "The Holocaust never happened." We have evidence proving it did happen, thus the opinion is false, but still unpopular.</br>  <br>Game of thrones is tedious and boring<br>Lord of the rings (movies) is tedious and boring<br>Pulp Fiction is not that good, neither the Shawshank Redemption</br></br></br>  <br>Unless you're going to college to become an engineer, doctor, lawyer, or anything that requires a grad degree, college should be fucking abolished and people should learn a damn trade. USE YOUR FUCKING HANDS, YOU LAZY CUNTS.</br>  <br>K</br>  <br>Where do they get deported to</br>  you should be able to slap women legally when they are being bitches  <br><br>Please explain. Yes I understand if someone is a stoner and literally does nothing but smoke pot, but EVERYONE who smokes pot? And just people who smoke pot? Not the crack or meth heads who cant even function in life? What about the crippling alcoholics? I know this is an unpopular opinion thread but at least have some thought behind your comment.</br></br>  <br>It's called having a conversation/discussion.<br>This is why I hated /b/ compared to the first incarnations of /r9k/. Everyone's all about hit and run posting with no back and forth.<br><br>Why even fucking comment if you don't want/expect someone to comment back?</br></br></br></br>  <br>India</br>  <br>they are just trolls mate</br>  I like orange juice after brushing my teeth  Black people are a different version of homo sapien. Somewhere in the evolutionary path they took a different turn, and that's why assimilation between them is so difficult  <br>Send them to the Middle East. If they can send their shit over here, we should do the same.</br>  <br>So why make these threads, if not to hold your opinion to the fire, and be questioned on it... Wtf is the point?<br><br>I don't get it.</br></br></br>  <br>cos ur a fagget</br>  <br>Saying methheads are worthless isn't unpopular fuckwit. It's like saying I hate rain then someone yelling "what about clouds. Do you hate clouds? Put some thought behind what you say." Obviously if it's fucking raining there's fucking clouds too. So I also hate clouds. Fucking nigger.</br>  <br>It fucking stinks. I don't drink or smoke for that reason.</br>  <br>No. I literally believe that all potheads should be killed. For once, trust another human on the internet.</br>  <br>Hey man I smoke pot and I make a gorilluon dollars per week. U jelly kid?</br>  <br>It doesn't make me mad, cause I don't take the obvious bait.</br>  <br>Yes, yes, yes, no, no, yes, no, no.<br>No to internet, condoms, license training, and gym subscriptions because those are things that dont dictate your quality of life. You could fight for condoms or gym but thats your choice to have a baby, their are two other holes to use, and you have a free gym membership. Go for a fucking run. Want to lift? Fill up some empty milk jugs with water. Yes to the parent training. Where are they going in the deportation, and sure, why not to prostitution.</br></br>  <br>Me too. Don't forget that drinking whole milk with your spaghetti game, though. Also a goodie<br><br><br>So, what? You don't shit either? You don't eat fish? You don't drive a car?<br>.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice try fgget. I make atleast seven potatoes a week. Match that potterhead.</br>  <br>Yeah, about 90% of their stuff does indeed suck. But Ringo was awesome.</br>  <br>Obviously we have the perfect embodiment of a human who makes not a single scent that can be considered disgusting or offensive. Bravo good sir, bravo.</br>  <br>The vast majority of women are stupid whores and boring as fuck to talk to<br><br>We ought to let all the migrants in the Mediterranean drown<br><br>The EU needs MUCH stricter immigration laws<br><br>Islam is fucking cancer<br><br>Ulster Loyalists are total and utter fucking scum<br><br>Gays should keep to themselves. "Pride" (AKA degeneracy) parades should be banned. They often say that what happens between two consenting adults behind closed doors is nobody's business and I agree, but keep it behind closed doors</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Most of their stuff yeah. But its like any other band, they have some good songs, and some shit ones. Cant stand those fucking people who act like the Beatles shit fucking gold.</br>  <br>Exactly! It's the kind of butthurt mentality that you'd expect from facebook, where you just can't challenge people on all topics. <br><br>I don't recall there being such a vast amount of fragile angsty teens on this board back in 07, shit was pretty interresting... From time to time</br></br></br>  <br>why did one rape you when you were a child?</br>  <br>He probably got arrested high as fuck and blames it on the potheads he was hanging out with.</br>  <br>Took the fucking b8 top god damn kek</br>  <br>Well your obviously retarded. The poster meant, I'm taking a leap here, that the smell itself is disgusting so in order to not smell like shit they don't smoke pot. We all shit right? But no one wants to smell like they just shat so they wipe their ass. People take baths, brush their teeth. Humans like nice smells, and weed smells terrible. You know it to be true.</br>  <br>These opinions are only unpopular with SJW faggots. Most normal people just don't admit to it.</br>  <br>No, I'm not a fucking nigger like you. Go back to your fucking tree cunt.</br>  Pornography should be illegal. It destructive to the human mind. Our puritan society has created a much worse problem by banning prostitution, porno is much much worse.<br><br>I'm partial on photo porn. but video porn definitely needs to be banned<br><br>Prostitution and the like is fine though, that should be legalized.</br></br></br></br>  I don't like Moot.  <br>Of course that's fucking bait. Why would anyone come here if their lives were well off fucking nigger.</br>  <br>You're fucking delusional.</br>  <br>Sure but then again if someone chooses to smell like weed they obviously dont give a shit about hygiene regardless weather or not they smoked. Why crucify everyone for the faults of a few? I know plenty of people who enjoy smoking who you would never be able to tell they smoked.</br>  <br>haha someones hit a nerve, tell B your story mate</br>  <br>I actually enjoyed the Transformers films.</br>  <br>Someones real mad.</br>   communism is best <br> no race is perfect but muslims are the worst by far <br> men are honestly superior to women <br> if america gets a woman as a president the whole country will go to shit <br> carrying a military grade weapon in public should be legal </br></br></br></br>  <br>I agree with you to a point. Violent rape, one in which you cause permanent/semi-permanent harm to the person should be criminal, but in a perfect society forcing someone to have sex with you would not be illegal, the reason being that this emphasis on sex being so important and sacred, and being a virgin meaning you're perfect stems from religious and uneducated times, when marriage was for negotiating treaties and getting land. Sex is not important, it is a primal function that most animals do, there's no reason to insult girls that have sex freely, and there's no reason we should shy away from it, treating it worse than most crimes and less tolerable than violence</br>  <br>Same. I dont care about a fucking plot or character development. I want to see giant robots beating the shit out of each other and that gave me just what I wanted with enough plot to keep the movie moving.</br>  <br>I know what he meant, and he's retarded.<br>Something smelling 'bad' is not reason enough not to do it. People shit, people work on and fix cars, and lube bicycle chains, and chlorinate pools left and fucking right and no one seems to have an issue.<br><br>And, I don't know how you smoke man, but unless you're hotboxing in the same jacket over and over, or have some on you at all times, you're not gonna smell like pot.</br></br></br></br>  <br> implying USA isn't already shit </br>  <br>Someone has a pot charge on his record.</br>  <br>If it wasnt a dictatorship yes.<br>Yes.<br>Yes.<br>I dont know, probably.<br>Why? I mean I dont give a shit about you owning it but why the fuck do you need to carry around some giant deathstick everywhere you go?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>its actually not that bad right now as it could be a lot worse.</br>  <br>I think we've reached an impass. Although I understand that some people can smoke weed and act like regular people I refuse to believe that they're regular.They are mutations and must be destroyed.</br>  where the quints at<br/>  <br>because you never know if some muslims will decide to try and shoot shit up like they did in france</br>  Jews are okay people.  <br>Why? I still dont get it though? Why over everything else does weed get your panties into such a bunch?</br>  I think there should be a one child policy worldwide for at least the next 30 years<br>Also all retards/ people who claim benefits wrongfully should be put down as they're a waste of resources<br>Life sentenced prisoners should be used for human experimentation as they should aid humanity rather than drain resoruces.<br>Kill every sjw and feminazi as they're worthless scum who refuse to see the bigger picture</br></br></br>  <br>8/8</br>  I support the pro-russian separatists and Novorossiya  <br>With that logic why dont we all just live in padded rooms to prevent accidents from ever happening? Thats just some dumb ass logic right their.</br>  Twerking isn't in any sexy.  <br>  in a perfect society forcing someone to have sex with you would not be illegal <br>Are you shitting in my fucking mouth right now, son? Have you thought about this for even a milisecond?<br><br> there's no reason to insult girls that have sex freely <br>Ok, or men, we're in agreence there.<br><br> and there's no reason we should shy away from it <br>Alrighty, seems good.<br><br>I don't see how you could possibly think rape is fine, though. If you have a problem with age of consent laws, or honestly how the court views consent in general, maybe we can talk. (Drunken sex is a huge grey area, I think, and these cases maybe need to be delt with with a lighter hand. Unless you can proove somehow that the 'rapist' is strategically getting their victim drunker than the victim has reason to believe they are, I don't fucking care. It's not rape and SHOULD be very hard to prove it is.), then that's an issue with the laws.<br>But you're not giving me enough here.<br><br>Can you give me a couple of examples of 'acceptable' rape.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh and also i think race mixing and culture blending should be banned as it does't lead to anything good. We can take modern day sweden as an example. Not all cultures are equal and they sould be kept separated</br>  <br>The designs for some of the Decepticons got lazy in the third and fourth films with many recycled designs. I'll give AoE a break because there was a reason for the unoriginality, even if the film doesn't mention it. People are far too critical of the films and dislike them because they have Michael Bay's name on them. Then there's the people who compare the films to G1 and then have the balls to say that the live action films have too much product placement. The G1 cartoon was full of characters who appeared for a single episode just so that kids would want to buy the toy.</br>  <br> see bee in field <br> watch it fly around me <br> gaze in horror as it has made contact with my tender skin <br> see it preparing to cause me pain <br> it penetrates me with everything it has <br> it enjoys it so damn much <br> it leaves part of itself inside me <br> it leaves me bleeding with an irritaed hole <br>You think what now, faggot?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>so if some sandniggers were to pull out guns and shit at you in a cafe or something you would rather wait for police and hope they don't shoot you than defend yourself?</br>  <br>Y'all faggots want a fucking story I'll give you a fucking story.<br> Be me, 24 or so, everything is looking good. Got my degree from college and I'm interning for a doctor in my field.  <br> Also, my girlfriend is amazing. Literally the nicest person I've ever met, would listen to me vent when I was stressed from my job (which the pay was barely enough to live on) </br></br></br>  <br>Maybe not just one but definitely stop these motherfuckers having 19 kids and shit.<br>I agree yes. I worked as an intern at a hospital that took care of a lot of retards and 90% of them are overweight because the parents just let them sit in front of the tv and eat so they dont have to take care of them. At this point it would be putting them out of their misery.<br>Meh, not a fan of experimentation, but labor 100%.<br>Yes.</br></br></br></br>  Anita Sarkeesian is right.  All these 'kids these days' fucks need to realize they had a hand in raising them, setting down the building blocks to becoming a responsible adult, and they do have influence.  <br>FACT</br>  <br><br>I think free trade and things like NAFTA and the TPP are good because manufacturing jobs go to impoverished countries who need the wage more than overly entitled American laborers. If they cared so much about those jobs, they'd do it for significantly less.</br></br>  Obama is the best President EVER  Slenderman, minecraft, pokémon, tf2, elderscrolls, dbz and five nights at freddies are over rated.  <br><br><br>You guys are retarded. Why would you want a containment board that works, gone?<br><br>I don't like /mlp/, but then again, I haven't seen ponies outside of cringe threads for a while now.</br></br></br></br></br>  Anonymous hasnt done stuff in way too long now. We arn't even known anymore. Expect us?  <br> If they cared so much about those jobs, they'd do it for significantly less. <br>Ah, no, bullshit. Some people have a bit of self-worth.</br></br>  <br>Lurk more</br>  This season of True Detective is not bad.  <br> One night, I kept venting to my girlfriend. I didn't notice how late it was (the pay forced her to still live with her mom and dad, y'know.) <br> start freaking out cause her dad is pretty fucking scary. 6'3"; probably 230 lbs of muscle. Basically duke nukem.  <br> Once more she calms me down and I relax but I gotta get her home (You're ass is grass from duke-nukem 3d is blaring in my head.) <br> fast forward cause this isn't going to be super long faggots. <br> Stopped at a red light and waiting for it to change </br></br></br></br></br>  hello /b/ - why aren't you Vegan? - do you enjoy eating murder and being immoral cunts in general?  <br>that's exactly what a faggot would say</br>  <br>I am vegan you faggot.

I'm not going to stop being who I am/change who I am just to fit the artificially crafted standards of a bunch of sheep.</br>  <br>Why should society be up to your liking?

I simply said, 'fuck society and everyone in it.' That's it.

What makes you worth anything?</br>  <br>I mean the word, faggot. To get to the topic of this thread: I hate everyone who uses sheeple in a serious way because they're always immature, narcissic and have a distorted view of themselves, think they're intelligent but are slightly above average max.<br>Also, breaking news, you are part of society yourself.</br></br>  <br>I'm not. Granted I don't give a shit about anyone else (don't pretend you do), but I don't rub that apathetic view in other people's faces in real life. "Selfish" you could call me, but I prefer "enlightened self-interest." Rational Thought Theory is correct.<br><br><br>Yeah, no it isn't. Not for me, anyway.<br><br><br>I firmly believe there's a difference between niggers and black people, but all are useless to me (black or otherwise).</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>how the fuck does that hair even happen</br>  <br> What makes you worth anything? <br>I don't have to explain shit to you, and don't take my not explaining as a sign of being unable to.<br><br><br>Oh, well that's just your problem them. Not really my concern. Granted I'm a part of this 'society,' but only in a very small, minute way...so much so, that I am actively working on removing myself from it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>intj?</br>  <br>So are you a sociopath?

They couldn't talk or anything and seemed to attack to defend territory or something.</br>  <br>Ah, the irrational sexism of childhood...<br><br>As opposed to the reasonable sexism of adulthood, of course.</br></br></br>  <br>badass vehicles but i can't put those ones in the bionicle storyline. It changed a lot.</br>  <br>I have them both and the lil one too! I believe the axalara t9 is the largest set right?</br>  <br>See? Even the music theme for kid's shows like bionicle is something at least half decent!<br><br>If it were today people would be all scared because it's music with guitars</br></br></br>  <br>I've got a box full of these things.<br><br>Wonder if I can find it.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I think so. I think it was about £50 when I bought it, the other was £40 maybe?</br>  <br>Well, they actively were destroying all life on the island. But they had no minds of their own, and it turned out they were doing it because that's what the creator spirit intended for them to do (but the island wasn't supposed to be inhabited when they did it).</br>  <br>still sealed in plastic my nigga</br>  <br>browsed wiki<br><br> The creators of the first Bohrok were the Great Beings. The Great Beings also created the Bohrok-Va and Bahrag and placed them in a series of tunnel networks under Mata Nui. More Bohrok are created when an Av-Matoran life-span ends.  <br><br><br>So they were full mechanical, and only the Krana was organic.<br>They lived in nest.<br><br> In Metru Nui, Onu-Matoran miners stumbled upon a Bohrok nest and found that the creatures were fully mechanical while the Krana they carried inside were completely organic. After a quick check, archivists found there was no evidence of assembly. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>HOLY SHIT I STILL GOT 12 OF THOSE</br>  PS: There was this cd that came in cereal boxes that had a car race game and a bionicle sidescroller game which you would start in the lava level surfing with a rock through lava, anybody has any idea what I'm talking about?  <br>"creeping in my soul" sounds a bit cringy but it was cool af</br>  what about this crazy game<br><br>http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images<wbr>/I/51STRHKBR7L._SX355_.jpg</wbr></br></br>   Be me <br> too poor to get a full set of Bionicles back when they first came out <br> got a lot of second hand stuff <br> fast forward to this year <br> 2015 hype <br> got a job <br> am poor again <br> all because of these pieces of fucking plastic <br> 11/10 would go broke again </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh that's right, Bohrok actually formed when Matoran died or something like that.<br><br>The Bionicle universe had some bizarre mechanics going on in the background.</br></br></br>  <br>Found about half of em, containers and more sets are probably in the closet.</br>    <br>For fucks sake, I hope those aren't stickers I see on them.<br><br>http://www.lego.com/en-us/bionicle/<wbr>characters</wbr></br></br></br>  the original bionicle before everything, Mata Nui.  <br>I see you've got the latest gen too</br>  <br>The new bionicles are shit</br>  <br>They're all printed.

As far as the design goes, that's subjective, but the way the pieces are molded, customization is relatively limited. Plus it's a more generic kid's toy aesthetic than the originals, which some people may like but again, is objectively less unique.</br>  remember those dickheads ?<br>In the film they were just dumb af</br>  <br>damnnn stright dudeeeeee <br><br>i always bought one when new series came out got 9 of them <br><br>the first ever red one<br>and the red ball <br><br>damn fuck the kids today man no real joy for them</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  How much does the new ones cost each?

Damn big too, 1.5x size of most of my other ones.  <br>The rarest Pepe of all time</br>  <br>The new ones aren't bionicle, they're hero factor.<br><br>PS: Stolen</br></br></br>  so... any of you guys know if there's a site with the full story and lore of the bionicles?<br>I was always interested, but back in the day I didn't have internet...</br>  <br> dat theme <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Bqt<wbr>lHUYxhaE</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Also, I'm thinking about buying all the new gen sets at once, what am I in for /b/ronicles?</br></br></br></br>  <br>There's a wiki</br>   tfw I thought these were the bad guys until I watched the movie   <br>but the comics!!<br>I need the comics, man</br></br>  <br>They just recently brought back the bionicles, they aren't called hero factory or whatever</br>  <br>but they look somewhat bad.</br>  <br>But they're still pretty much Hero Factory.<br><br>Just with different names.</br></br></br>  <br>Just because they use the unified building system, doesnt mean they are hero factory.<br><br>By that logic, Bionicle G1 is slizers.</br></br></br>  Im lucky enough that i still have one of every pre-toa inika kind of bionicle there was, even still got the mug and towel  <br>http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/g<wbr>allery.cgi?f=380397</wbr></br>  <br>Rest of mine. I have around 15 complete ones and a bunch of shitty ones I made myself. They start at about 2005 or so.</br>  <br>They are ok I guess<br><br>Onua's chestplate is a sticker that's the bad thing</br></br></br>  <br>damn dude, why didn't you keep the canisters<br>I have everyone of them in their original canisters organized in my closet.<br>my shelves aren't big as they used to be...</br></br></br>  <br>The point is that the style and aesthetic is completely different from Bionicle, and looks more like Hero Factory than anything Bionicle.</br>  remember this?  <br>http://biosector01.com/wiki/index.p<wbr>hp/Comics</wbr></br>  <br>I didn't know to do that. Figured they (canisters) were trash, and I wanted to play with them. Dad didn't like me keeping shit like that either.</br>  <br>THIS WAS AWESOME<br>dammit, isn't there a site hosting this?</br></br>  <br>A lot of the lore is in the novels, rather than the comics. That doesn't start happening til a couple gens in though.</br>  <br>Probably the objectively best Toa sets in the series. Applying the stickers on Onua's chest and Kopakas legs are a pain, but besides that its all really cool. Protectors are way cooler than they look. Lord of Skull Spiders is underrated and a good throwback to the 2001/2002 rahi-style sets. The Skull sets are probably not out in your area yet, but they are fairly hit or miss, with the Kulta and Ekimu set (Mask Maker vs. Skull Grinder) being the only must-have.</br>  <br>http://biomediaproject.com/bmp/game<wbr>s/<br>There is a bugfixed version of MNOG2 on here, as well as every other game the series had.</br></wbr></br>  <br>Why do they suck?</br>  <br>there are novels?<br> living in a third world country takes its toll </br></br>  <br>Probably just your nostalgia induced opinion, I'm glad they are continuing the series.</br>  <br>FUCK OFF ANON! I will never relive these days!</br>  <br>Theres a shit ton of novels</br>  Faves?  <br>They don't, they are some of the best sets we have had in ages, especially when compared to shits like the Phantoka.</br>  <br><br>Also there is this for the full on nostalgia experience <br>http://web.archive.org/web/20061110<wbr>102938/http://www.lego.com/eng/bion<wbr>icle/games/matanuiOnline1.aspx</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Greg Farshtey became the Dunegon Master of Bionicle early on, and wrote pretty much all the lore related stuff. So all the novels are by him.</br>  Also some of the comics are here<br>http://web.archive.org/web/20061205<wbr>225838/http://www.lego.com/bionicle<wbr>/story/2006/comics.aspx</wbr></wbr></br>   be bioniclefag <br> has all bionicles stored in their canisters or showing up on the shelves <br> gardener's son comes to my house <br> asshole bitch motherfuckering tears my bionicles apart and starts messing with them <br> I arrive in my house and see the damage <br> I couldn't even beat that motherfucker to a pulp <br> parents just start saying that I should organize and take them from the shelves <br> parents just wanted me to outgrow bionicle </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He really didn't do that much lore stuff until the later years. He was originally the comic writer, but then took over the books and later the whole story. A lot of the original lore and stuff was from the story team, and some of the most important aspects of the lore should be credited to Christian faber.</br>  <br>He needs to die, anon</br>  <br>quads r the best</br>  man i rly miss theese  My favorite Bionicles were the ones with the maggots in their necks.  <br>he already died, I think.<br>casualty of a gang shoot out or something</br></br>  <br>man, they were so awesome.<br>I have all of them, but the maggots are missing, I think, thanks to the gardener's son</br></br>  <br>Fucker</br>  <br>I think the only bionicles I don't have are the first series' red, blue, black and white ones.<br>plus some missing parts due to that bitch.<br>wich kind of gardener brings his son to work?<br>and what kind of grandmother lets that fucker in my room?</br></br></br></br>  <br>post pics?</br>  <br>these?</br>  <br>I don't know man. I've got 15 or so. <br><br> That's mine.</br></br></br>  <br>WOW THE MEMORIES<br><br>anyone knows these RAKHSHI or something like that?</br></br></br>  <br>I thought the rakhshi were the good guys and the toa the bad guys.</br>  I used to be some kind of moderator on bionicle wiki. Some much knowledge. All this history. All this writing, translating and remebering the events in history. Money spent on books and sets.<br><br>I don't regret it.</br></br>  <br>see<br/></br>  i am <br><br><br>THESE ARE EXACTLY WHAT I MEANT <br>damn the white one was the coolest, i can remember this light blue brain thingy it had</br></br></br></br>  <br>the white one was the coolest</br>  <br>He deserved it</br>  <br>place a bionicle rip-off on his grave</br>  <br>Was there an official ending to bionicle? Is the 2015 bionicle related to the old bionicles in any way?</br>  <br>I won't give any atention to someone like that.<br>he still owes me a couple of parts he lost/broke<br>who the fuck breaks a lego part?</br></br></br>  <br>2015 is a reboot, though there is some weird shit involving how the Toa were summoned with 'The mask of time', and images of the original G1 Vahi are hidden in every single web animation. <br><br>The original story did come to a rushed ending in 2010 where there were two planet sized robots fighting and Makuta Teridax got a moon to the back of the face, and everyone lived happily ever after except there was an assassin killing everyone.</br></br></br>  Always wanted to share this. The part with the bionicles made me lose my shit.  I have so much fucking bionicle that I doubt any of you in this thread come close.<br>AMA.</br>  <br>I have all of them.<br><br>So fuck you.</br></br></br>  <br>motherfucker i've got every single one of them</br>  <br>GENERATION ONE WILL ALWAYS BE THE GREATEST HEROES</br>  do anyone has some pics of the new bionicles?<br>I need to see some stuff before I call them shit whatnot</br>  <br>Still have all the sets including these guys. I remember going to my friends birthday party in second grade and he got one of these and let me build it for him. Everyone thought I was cool because I didn't need to use the instructions. Shit was so cash.</br>  <br>There were some ending books , The quest of tomorrow and some other of title i don't remember. The official site ( bioniclestory.com) was shut down befre this books has been finished. I don't know if they were ever finished.</br>  I was a complete fan of the series until it ended. We had a BIONICLE forum for spanish-speakers.<br>About the sets, I had all the Earth ones until the Mistika, those guys sucked and were expensive as fuck.</br>  <br><br>That's 42 right off the bat...<br><br>add 12 matoran as well and you're still only looking a the good guys.<br><br>12 bohrok, 6 rahkshi<br>it goes on.<br><br>Really?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Not all blacks are nogs   no one said they were you fucking retarded faggot  <br>/thread</br>  <br>If I were black I'd find this patronising as fuck</br>  <br> &gt;/pol/ </br>    <br><br><br>Not all, but definitely most<br><br>Bell curve ftw</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Irony is 2 black prison guards looted a shop in Ferguson.

Him and his sister were raised by an ex-nun and her "sister" after they were given up for adoption by their mother. <br><br> sister <br>Everyone knows they're lesbians but no one talks about it.<br><br>My husband runs his own architecture firm. His sister is a doctor. They grew up in a two bedroom house with a wood stove for heat.<br><br>Last year they find out that their mother has been looking for them. My husband and I, and his sister and brother-in-law all went to go meet the family. She ended up staying with their father and having three more kids together that they kept. <br><br>They were living in section 8 housing (government subsidy housing), they were on wellfare, medicaid, and unemployment. They all had iPhones and iPods though along with a 56" tv and internet that's twice as fast as mine at home despite being an IT professional.<br><br>All of this said and done, their youngest sibling was on probation after serving two years in juvie for an armed car-jacking. Their next youngest was a 22 year old woman with five kids, living in the same house as her parents. There were literally 2 fathers there, but a third couldn't make it on account of being in prison for robbing a liquor store. <br><br>And the older of the sibliings left the house 5 times in in as many hours saying "i'll be back ya'll". My husband's parents had no qualms hiding the fact that he was selling meth.<br><br><br>And to top it ALL off, they had the gall to ask for money.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> o </br>  <br> this is real life, we need all three positions filled. <br>there are only so many courts to gaurd.<br>There cant be a 1:1 ratio for lawyers to defendants.</br></br></br>  <br>here is how it works, you can be<br>white or white trash<br>black or a nigger<br>an eastern europeen or a sandnigger<br>a asian or a gook</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No one washes a rental car.</br>  <br>Yep</br>  <br><br>Facts are racist<br><br>Cover your ears and shout with me anon, we can get through this.<br><br>LALALALALALALALALALALA</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> People have the freedom to choose. <br>But let's not pretend that societal factors don't play a massive role in how you end up. You are not a creature of 100% completely free will. If you're born poor, you're simply more likely to stay poor. <br><br>Couple that with racism in the police, and you end up with a tough deal for black people. Black and white people use drugs at about the same rate, but black people are caught for it far more often, because the police targets them - and since they then catch more black people, they feel justified in targeting them, and on and on the vicious cycle goes.</br></br></br></br>  <br> le cherry picking facts while ignoring essential mitigating factors meme xD </br>  <br>While all that may be true, understanding why negative behavior exists does not excuse the behavior itself. If the animal in question cannot reason their way to the acceptable course of action or behavior, then some form of behavioral condition should be used to remove the drive or will to commit those same negative behaviors. Understanding why a dog bites you doesn't mean you shouldn't beat the dog's ass for biting you</br>  <br>Typical fucking libtard thinking<br><br> use illegal drugs <br> possess illegal drugs <br> get arrested for illegal drugs <br> do time for illegal drugs <br> ITS RACISMS FAULT! <br><br>No, fuck off, you flagrantly and willfully chose to violate the law, there are legal repercussions for violating laws.<br><br>You should have grown out of this kind of thinking somewhere around the age of 6 when the excuse "but johnny does it and his parents don't care" never worked with your father.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>naw they're all niggers. just the other 2 monkeys are playing dress up</br>  <br><br>Police target black people and black people target police. Thug-life culture takin it's spot in black society where for generations children have just repeated their fathers mistakes. Fuck the school, fuck the education, A.C.A.B, joining in gang is way cooler and selling drugs provides better income. Cycle takes it's place when cop gets shot in the face while checking drivers license, or black teenager gets shot because he run away when officer said "calm down".</br></br>  <br> While all that may be true, understanding why negative behavior exists does not excuse the behavior itself. <br>I agree - so let's rectify the massively racist attitudes that drive up the crime rates of black people (i.e. the police targeting "niggers" because they're criminal, thereby catching them in more crime, thereby making them more criminal, thereby justifying targeting them), as well as investing in various programs that help these exposed groups of people.<br><br>By the way, beating a dog that bites you doesn't rectify that behaviour for good.</br></br></br></br>  <br> No, fuck off, you flagrantly and willfully chose to violate the law, there are legal repercussions for violating laws. <br>Did you miss the part where I said that white people use drugs at the same or higher rates as black people, yet black people get caught more, which leads to a vicious cycle that racist idiots think justifies their stupid racism?</br></br>  I have 2 black friends. They're the only black people I've met that aren't ignorant or dumber than shit  <br>le? who the fuck says le? what kind of faggot says le?<br><br>seriously present said factors or go cry somewhere else, everybody has the ability to make something of themselves; regardless of race or gender.</br></br></br>  <br> selling drugs provides better income <br>A lot of these youths don't know any better. Their environment and educational opportunities are so horrifyingly asshole that they're simply not really aware of how you do anything other than this shit.</br></br>  <br><br>the one in the back is probably dominican, the one in the middle has been to jail and the nigglet is about to begin his illustrious rap career with street cred.</br></br>  <br><br>Isn't that because common white male that uses drugs, is quiet pot-head who doesn't make a fuss of himself or anything, and common black male that uses drugs, is usually one who sells them and is a member of a gang and ain't that quiet about drug usage? <br><br>Regards: differfag</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not a vicious cycle, black people commit significantly more crime than white people, and so they are arrested for these crimes proportionately to the rate they commit them.<br><br>It's not racism, cops don't go out on patrol thinking "Gee, I sure hope I see a nigger to unlawfully arrest today".<br><br>If black people want to get arrested by cops less, then maybe they shouldn't blame white people for it, maybe, just maybe they should stop committing crimes.<br><br> Inb4 poverty = crime <br><br>There are thousands of white people in poverty too, yet their crime rate is still significantly lower.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So cops arrest black people because they are racist, and blacks are criminals because they get arrested. Now I understand!<br> I heard someone say rectify last week <br> they programs </br></br></br>  <br>I don't give a shit if a black man or a white man gets arrested for drug use.<br><br>They CHOSE to do drugs. As far as I'm fucking concerned they BOTH deserve to do time. <br><br>If you're flagrantly in violation of the fucking law don't expect sympathy with me because you're doing time when you get caught.<br><br>And as to your fucking point about the vicious cycle. Niggers are much more likely to engage in drug trade as a form of business because of niggerdom. Whereas smalltime white dealers just stick to selling to their friends. i.e. they're not stupid with their shit.<br><br> But anon, how do you know this. <br>BECAUSE I'M FUCKING BLACK and grew up in the hood you piece of shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> everybody has the ability to make something of themselves; regardless of race or gender. <br>Irrelevant. A north korean slave labourer can "make it" with luck, skill, and hard work. Does that mean NK is perfectly fine? No. While the poor in the USA are obviously in a better position, upward mobility in the USA is fucking tiny. The american dream is a joke. <br><br>Being born poor makes you far, far more likely to stay poor. Especially in the USA.</br></br></br></br>  <br>it does when you beat it often enough for the dog to associate an ass beating with biting you, and since in our current society the acts of black criminals are still the negative behavior, it would be much faster to side with police. As far as investing in programs for those individuals, all that will do is continue to reinforce that there is a difference and different rules apply to different races. I am aware that there is no answer that will make people happy, and race issues will never go away. Races have been fighting since the cromagnons and neanderthals, to pretend like we are all magically the same is ridiculous, but at the same time for you to expect me to do things that are directly detrimental to me and mine in order to push up people who as a general rule hate me you have some serious logical holes to work through</br>  <br><br>well they are given opportunity just like anyone else. Who do black youths just make school dropping-rates rise to the roof? Why documents about worried mothers who just wish that fathers wouldn't drag their children to the same path?</br></br>  <br>white people do drugs in the privacy of their bigass houses, black people slang sherm in the park with unregistered handguns</br>  <br> It's not a vicious cycle, black people commit significantly more crime than white people <br>I've already explained why it's a vicious cycle.<br><br>Furthermore, black people commit more crime because they're far more poor, and because there's a culture of racism that targets black people, and because black culture is simply pretty fuckin' shit. It has nothing to do with race, and everything to do with societal position.<br><br> If black people want to get arrested by cops less, then maybe they shouldn't blame white people for it, maybe, just maybe they should stop committing crimes. <br> what is reading what I've fucking said. <br>Black people are targeted more than white people. White and black people use drugs at the same rate, yet black people are targeted, and thus caught, more often. This is institutionalised racism.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Blacks commit a disproportionate amount of violent crime. As such, they require more police attention. Additionally, blacks usually aren't subtle about their drug use like whites. Whites smoke weed in their house, shoot heroin in the bathroom, etc. Blacks roll down blasting ear busting bass while thick smoke rolls out their cracked windows. Big difference. The vast majority of people who get busted for pot actually got visited by the cops for another reason- speeding, traffic violation, domestic violence call, what have you. Since blacks do this shit more, they get busted more, despite doing an equal amount of drugs to whites.</br>  <br> So cops arrest black people because they are racist, and blacks are criminals because they get arrested. Now I understand! <br>I love how you people call "niggers" dumb, yet you're all fucking braindead.<br><br>If my police force specifically targets a group of people over another group of people, guess what group of people will be caught more often doing crime? Guess what group of people will, on paper, look more criminal? Come on Jimmy, you can do this.<br><br>Also, did you not know the word "rectify" before I used it here...?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So you want a socialist utopia? Where everybody gets paid the same and lives the same lifestyle? A pure socialist state will always fail, history has already shown this. <br><br>I'd rather be poor in the US then fucking living in the DPRK. The american dream is not a joke if you actually push and motivate yourself. Not everybody can be a millionaire living in giant mansions and basically shitty out money, that's not how the world works nor will ever work.</br></br></br>  <br> I don't give a shit if a black man or a white man gets arrested for drug use. <br> They CHOSE to do drugs. <br>Obviously. But can you agree that it's hardly fair that black people are targeted more often? Can you really claim that it's not racist for the police to specifically go after black people, even though white people are as likely to commit the crime? Come now.<br><br> because of niggerdom <br>Yes, black youth have very, very limited options, and I hope we fix that in the foreseeable future. Otherwise they'll stay poor and criminal, and they'll have poor and criminal children. A vicious socio-economic cycle.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dr. Zar</br>  <br>I agree it's an issue of the culture, because there are almost twice as many white people under the poverty line in the U.S. as blacks.</br>  <br>What part of maybe they should not commit the crimes do you not understand? The only way to stop being targeted and to stop making yourself a fucking target.</br>  <br>Then why are black crime rates so significantly high all over the globe?<br><br>UK, South Africa, France, Sweden, Canada, There is not a single country in the world where white people (or ANY race) commit more crime (proportionately) compared to black people.<br><br>Unless you really believe that they're oppressed everywhere, in which case I would really have to question how someone who is allowed into College with a lower GPA, more likely to get accepted for jobs in equal opportunity businesses and the police force, and get almost exclusive access to section 8 housing can be considered oppressed.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i'm black and i don't find this patronizing. this was probably made by some black person who thought they created a really insightful and significant motivational image</br>    <br> it does when you beat it often enough for the dog to associate an ass beating with biting you <br>Not really. Such an animal is utterly broken, if you ever succeed, which is completely unnecessary when you can achieve the same results by positive reinforcement training. Look into it before you abuse your animals (or spout more bullshit analogies). <br>Increased punishments do not magically fix crime rates. Or do you suggest we cut off the hands of thieves like fucking barbarians?<br><br> As far as investing in programs for those individuals, all that will do is continue to reinforce that there is a difference and different rules apply to different races.  <br>Not at all. Making education free, for example, and making an effort to aid poor people (not black people specifically) would help immensely. <br><br> Races have been fighting since the cromagnons and neanderthals <br>I'm going to ignore this shit, because the differences between the races are utterly negligible.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Furthermore, black people commit more crime because they're far more poor, <br><br>Wrong. People in India are poor and they don't behave nearly as badly as niggers.<br><br>  and because there's a culture of racism that targets black people,  <br><br>Every place on earth and through all of history. Seems like a credible explanation for the complete lack of negro accomplishments or success anywhere ever.<br><br> and because black culture is simply pretty fuckin' shit.  <br><br>Yeah, it's a shame when this great white conspiracy was handing out all the good cultures, they gave the shit one to you niggers huh?<br><br> It has nothing to do with race, and everything to do with societal position. <br><br>Now why do you suspect (apart from do-nothing make-work government and quota filling jobs) niggers always fill the absolute bottom of the societal barrel? <br><br>Blame whitey and stick out the begging bowl. It's all you sub-humans know.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> well they are given opportunity just like anyone else <br>Laughably wrong.</br></br>  <br> So you want a socialist utopia? Where everybody gets paid the same and lives the same lifestyle? <br>Yup, that's exactly what I said. I said there should be zero reason for hard work. Totally.<br><br>You're a fucking idiot.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>2 black men and 1 nigger</br></br>  <br> Furthermore, black people commit more crime because they're far more poor <br>Not true, blacks commit disproportionately more crime regardless of income bracket. As in rich blacks still commit more crime than rich whites, poor blacks commit more crime than their white counterparts, etc.<br> because there's a culture of racism that targets black people <br>Black people are "targeted" because they do more crime.<br> because black culture is simply pretty fuckin' shit. <br>Yes, it is.<br> It has nothing to do with race <br>Yes it does. You think culture arises in a vacuum? Culture arises from environment and genetics, like everything else. Blacks have a higher incidence of the 2 repeat allele of the MAO-A "warrior" gene. This gene has been documented as causing violent, irrational behavior.<br> http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed<wbr>/24326626</wbr> <br> Analyses revealed that African-American males who carry the 2-repeat allele are significantly more likely than all other genotypes to engage in shooting and stabbing behaviors and to report having multiple shooting and stabbing victims.  <br>Now, do all blacks have this gene? Nope. It doesn't mean all blacks are killers. But it does show why blacks are more likely to do such things- it's because a larger proportion of them have this gene than other races. Ironically, Eugenics could save the black race, but thanks to Hitler, eugenics is "racis", so we can't discuss it.<br> Black people are targeted more than white people. White and black people use drugs at the same rate, yet black people are targeted, and thus caught, more often <br>See:<br><br>Blacks may use drugs at the same rate as whites, but they commit other crimes at higher rates, often while possessing drugs. This explains why police target those communities (we saw what happened in baltimore when the police cut their patrols, all the hoodrats started killing each other freely) and why they get arrested more. <br><br>It's not institutionalized racism, it's reality.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Here the monkeys go again trying to insinuate that they're human. You would think since these apes know how to use 4chan they would also know how to research their own lousy history, and accept their naturally low IQs and animalistic qualities. I work around 30 niggers a day, they are all the same. even the whitest one acts black when its convenient. When are all the niggers gonna stop bitching about shit they cover themselves in and go back to Niger already?  <br>but, you must ask yourself<br> how much nig  <br> would a nig nog nig <br> if a nig nog could <br> nig nog </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> What part of maybe they should not commit the crimes do you not understand? <br>What part of being poor increases your propensity for crime do you not understand? Do you think humans are in no way affected by their environment? Do you think our will is 100% completely and totally our own, and literally nothing at all can push us in any directions? If I torture you for ten years, you're just totally free to not be fucked up, is that it?<br><br> The only way to stop being targeted and to stop making yourself a fucking target. <br>Or for the police to not be racist.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it's called institutional racism you coon. In fact in the UK it was proven that institutional racism was rife in the met police after the inquiries proceeding the death of Steven Lawrence.<br><br>White police officers target black youth due to stereotypes and attitudes deeply ingrained into police culture. This is a known and indisputable fact. There's a reason you don't see cops going around shooting white youth like they do to blacks.</br></br></br>  <br> very little options <br><br>Oh fuck off with your libtard thinking you twat<br><br>There's two fucking options.<br>* Obey the law<br>* Break the law<br><br>Now I grew up in a house with 7 siblings and our mother. There was a constant stream of men in and out of the house along with prolific and open drug use.<br><br>My siblings all chose to use drugs, sell drugs, rob stores, join gangs and not perform in school<br><br>I chose NOT to do drugs, NOT to sell them, NOT to rob people, NOT to beat people up, NOT to disrespect my teachers, NOT to skip school, NOT to hang out with gangs instead of studying. In other words I CHOSE to be an upstanding contributing member of society.<br><br>My fucking elementary school had a god damn metal detector for fucks sake and the administration office had plexiglass seperating the admins from the public side. the average classroom size was 35 students per teacher.<br><br>All of my brothers and sisters either have a handful of kids or a rap sheet longer than my black cock. two brother have served hard time.<br><br>I drive a Mercedes and run the IT infrastructure for a fortune 500 company with 30 satellite offices across the nation. <br><br>It's a fucking CHOICE.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Unless you really believe that they're oppressed everywhere <br>I believe there's a level of racism against black people - because of people like you who perpetuate the "niggers gon' nig" narrative - but I'd never pretend like black culture doesn't have problems.<br><br>When you see black people from the USA being very prone to crime and such, both black people and everyone else are affected by it. It's very unfortunate.</br></br></br></br>  <br>black = negro<br>negro = nigger<br><br>the fuck you dont understand man?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>ALL ppl get to go to the school in USA, in 1,2 and 3 grade there are same amount of black kids and white kids. Then when we jump in to the higher grades, something changes radically.</br></br>  <br><br>Not a single one of those are real.<br><br>Racist rednecks are so hilarious in what they take as "facts" and "statistics".<br><br>Just hilarious.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> because of people like you who perpetuate the "niggers gon' nig" narrative <br><br>So what should I do?<br><br>Would you have me ignore the high crime rate of black people in hopes that it will eventually go away?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> What part of being poor increases your propensity for crime do you not understand? Do you think humans are in no way affected by their environment? Do you think our will is 100% completely and totally our own, and literally nothing at all can push us in any directions? If I torture you for ten years, you're just totally free to not be fucked up, is that it? <br>^ good response<br><br> Or for the police to not be racist. <br>^ shit response</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>All those guys probably paid for your pb&amp;js. Your mom was a whore, lol.</br>  <br><br>There is also a reason why you don't see white ppl shooting police and shit. <br><br>And it's a little bit tin-foilish to say that police in EVERY FUCKING WHERE are targeting black people because niggers can't do shit in USA.</br></br></br></br>  <br> If my police force specifically targets a group of people over another group of people, guess what group of people will be caught more often doing crime? <br><br> Obviously. But can you agree that it's hardly fair that black people are targeted more often? <br><br>You make the mistake of assuming that blacks are wrongly targeted. Victim surveys mirror arrest rates. In other words, blacks are being arrested proportional to the rate they commit crimes.<br><br>Black neighborhoods are "targeted" not because there's blacks there, but because there is more crime reported by residents.<br><br>It doesn't matter that whites and blacks do drugs at the same rate. Blacks commit violent crime at a much, much higher rate compared to their percentage of the population. So police respond to the rash of rapes, robberies and murders in an area and when they throw their wide net they get drug users too. It's not hard to see how that works</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Wrong. People in India are poor and they don't behave nearly as badly as niggers. <br> poor people aren't more prone to crime! <br>Yes, they are. India is not the USA. You cannot magically compare them.<br><br> Every place on earth and through all of history. Seems like a credible explanation for the complete lack of negro accomplishments or success anywhere ever. <br>You pulled the first part out of your ass, and you're ignoring the fact that black people were fucking enslaved for generations. It's not reasonable to think you can just bounce back from being viewed as cattle, and suffering generations of hardcore racism (some of which still lives on to this day).<br><br> Now why do you suspect (apart from do-nothing make-work government and quota filling jobs) niggers always fill the absolute bottom of the societal barrel?  <br>Because they're already there, because racism is still a factor, and because there's a pretty shitty culture that glorifies the supposed "thug life". I've said all this before. Maybe you should start paying the fuck attention.<br> Blame whitey and stick out the begging bowl. It's all you sub-humans know. <br>I'm white as fuck, I just don't buy in to the easy "lol niggers xD" bullshit that you idiots spew.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Of course you will prove that picture wrong whit suitable evidence and arguments? <br><br>I didn't think so either.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think we're done here.<br>/thread</br></br>  <br> claims several sources arent real without evidence to back it up <br> calls everyone a racist redneck <br> acts like its "hilarious" to take the focus off how mad he is at life <br><br>typical nigger</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>my name may be Jimbob but you're in denial<br><br>Despite whatever social situation people inhabit they always have personal agency; choice. There are plenty of spoiled white kids with every advantage who accomplish nothing. Societal factors are for policy makers and reformers to consider, but under the law we should always be judged as individuals.</br></br></br>  <br>but all nigs are nogs.</br>  If you believe not all blacks are niggers then get the fuck off 4chan.<br>I've met niggers in positions and they all have that stupid nigger personality, most of the time they're not even dark black which implies they're part white or mexican.</br>  <br>took the b8</br>  <br> Not true, blacks commit disproportionately more crime regardless of income bracket. As in rich blacks still commit more crime than rich whites, poor blacks commit more crime than their white counterparts, etc. <br>Because they're more targeted by the police, yeah. And probably also because of a negative and pervasive shitty culture.<br><br> Black people are "targeted" because they do more crime. <br>And they "do more crime" (get caught more often) because they're targeted. Isn't it magical how this works? It's almost like I've explained this shit like 5 times by now.<br><br> You think culture arises in a vacuum?  <br>You think massive, generational racism doesn't play a role at all? You think white people back in the day hold zero responsibility for the shitty situation black people are in? Give me a fucking break. I have no white guilt - I'm not racist and I didn't hold black people down - which I have to say because that seem to be the go-to accusations of you people.<br><br> Now, do all blacks have this gene? <br>If you reversed the societal situations, where white people had been the victim of enslavement and subsequent massive amounts of racism, we'd be where black people are now. It's got fuck all to do with race, and everything to do with a perpetuation of shitty societal situations.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, she was a whore. We don't know who my eldest bother's father is, or who mine is. Her longest time "friend" is a fucking pimp.<br><br>I don't associate with them any more because of their nigger 'muh oppreshun" mentality.<br><br> they accuse me of being a sell-out "to the man" </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>Typical niggers</br>  <br> I drive a Mercedes <br> run the IT infrastructure <br><br>You mean you drive a 84 diesel wagon and you have a cisco certification.<br><br>Not saying that bad, you just made me feel insecure</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sorry anon, you clearly dont think clearly. Blacks are more likely to take bigger risks involving illegal activity than whites overall. Get your head out of your asshole, small cock.</br>  <br>No one argues that poverty does not have an impact on crime, however, race correlates more strongly than poverty when it comes to crime rates.<br><br>As you can see, crime rate increases the larger the percentage of blacks and hispanics (the two groups who commit the most disproportionate amounts of crime compared to their population size) living in the area gets. This correlation is stronger than any of the other leading factors.<br><br>I'll put this simply once again. Poor blacks commit more crime than poor whites. Rich blacks commit more crime than rich whites.<br><br>We have a rational, logical explanation for this in the form of the 2-repeate allele of MAO-A, which is known to confer an enhanced risk of shooting and stabbing behaviors, and known to be more common in African American men than any other race.<br>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/<wbr>24326626<br><br>So once again how can you deny the racial component? I don't even deny the poverty component.</br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> There is also a reason why you don't see white ppl shooting police and shit. <br><br>maybe because whites aren't sick of being specifically targeted by police for no reason other than deep rooted, old-fashioned racism?<br><br>  little bit tin-foilish to say that police in EVERY FUCKING WHERE are targeting black people <br><br>No it isn't because, newsflash, that's what fucking happens. It's happening in the US, its happening in the UK (and it's not just blacks over here either), it happens in scandanavia (which is racist as FUCK, man), its fucking everywhere.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> So what should I do? Would you have me ignore the high crime rate of black people in hopes that it will eventually go away? <br>No. I'd have us all acknowledge that there's a problem that has nothing to do with race, and seek to fix it (which is impossible of you think it's genetic - which it, luckily, isn't). I personally believe drugs should be legal, because it makes no sense to fuck up a black kid's life by giving him a criminal record just because he chose to smoke a joint rather than drink a beer.<br>There are many things you could do to better the poor in the USA. Like making education tax funded. Whether campaigns and shit would work, I don't know, but if you're asking me what you personally should do, start by understanding that the problems are due to societal factors, and that they're fixable.</br></br></br>  <br>you're a fucking retard. "because they're targeted" how can you even explain that?<br>so you're saying a cop will just flat out ignore whites gang beating up someone instead of a gang of blacks beating up someone?<br>gtfo you delusional liberal</br></br></br>  <br><br>Only niggers are niggers, that's easy.</br></br>  <br> If you reversed the societal situations, where white people had been the victim of enslavement  <br>I'm pretty sure throughout history there have been far more white slaves than black slaves.<br><br>Also back to the main focus of it all, if you don't want to be a target, simply don't make yourself a target. Its not that hard</br></br></br></br>  <br> ^ shit response <br>It's true. The police targets black people far more than others, as I've explained multiple times.</br></br>  <br>he should have thought about his actions about a week ago</br>  <br><br>There are no men iin this photograph.<br><br>Only negroids.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Not all blacks are nogs <br><br>Good luck trying to convince conservatives of this fact.</br></br></br>  <br>hey uncle tom <br>go away uncle tom</br></br>  <br>What else is new?</br>  <br>This OP does NOT get it. Whites use at dame rate..most mind their own business. Blacks do not have that same temperament. Your "stats" cant stack up equally no matter how you slice it, libby. Blacks are more prone to violence.. Muh testosterone n shit, nigga. Get over it. NOT racist. More white people die by cops than browns. Dumb fucker.</br>  <br> Not all blacks are nogs <br>You'd really have to see how the cop and the attorney behave at the movies or at home to say that.</br></br>  <br> Blacks commit violent crime at a much, much higher rate compared to their percentage of the population <br>Which I haven't denied.<br><br>I'm talking about cops who "randomly" search out black people far more than they do white people. Cops focused on drugs target black people way fucking more.</br></br></br></br>  <br> why won't these crackas listen to the facts?? <br>because your logic is infantile and ignores personal responsibility</br></br>  <br><br>There are no black people. Negroids are not human beings.</br></br>  the worst thing is he notion of "selling out (to the white man)"<br>that and (maybe) the entitlement mentality</br>  <br> in Africa, there are currently more slaves than ever existed at one time in the U.S. <br><br> implying that we recorded exactly how much slaves existed in the U.S. </br></br></br>  Glad someone shares my views. All nogs are blacks, but not all blacks are nogs.  <br> typical niggers <br><br>I was born DeShawn Marquis &lt;last name&gt;<br><br>When I came to the age of majority I petitioned the court to legally change my name to Sean Mark &lt;last name&gt;</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Congrats that's pretty fucking impressive if your not bullshitting, but not everyone has the drive to do that. Just look at all these fags on 4chan. The large majority of them were given much better opportunities than most black families and still waste their lives away shitposting.</br>  <br>The vast majority of them are<br>If you wear your pants below your ass. I will assume you're no good for society and I'll be right</br></br>  <br> Despite whatever social situation people inhabit they always have personal agency; choice. <br>The fact that poor people are far, far more likely to be criminal tells you that their personal agency is diminished in this regard due to exterior factors.<br><br>You think a child raised in a wealthy and educated household chooses just as much to become educated as a child who lives in abject poverty? Or could it be that the wealthy kid was under the impression from childhood that they needed to educate themselves in order to maintain a good position in life? I certainly was. The fact that I study a lucrative field right now isn't completely and totally my own choice. I was influenced by my parents and my upper middle class childhood.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Because they're more targeted by the police, yeah <br>No. Like I said, victim surveys show that police are doing their job. They aren't disproportionately targeting blacks. Blacks commit disproportionately large amounts of crime.<br> And probably also because of a negative and pervasive shitty culture. <br>Of course, but you can't ignore the genetic reality that the "Warrior Gene" makes black males more likely to be irrational, aggressive, and violent, or that black males are more likely to have this gene.<br> You think white people back in the day hold zero responsibility for the shitty situation black people are in? <br>I actually do partially blame whites for setting up the government plantation blacks live on now. However you must understand that by every conceivable metric blacks were better off under segregation. Better educated, more income, less crime, less children out of wedlock, less divorce, all of it. Blacks were doing better WHEN THEY WERE OPPRESSED. So how can the oppression be at fault?<br> If you reversed the societal situations, where white people had been the victim of enslavement and subsequent massive amounts of racism, we'd be where black people are now.  <br>That's pretty much bullshit considering similar enslavement and generational oppression has happened to every group throughout history. The word "slave" comes from "slav". The Russian serfs lived in harsher conditions than the average american slave. Yet they still managed to overthrow their masters, win a world war, and put a man in space. African slaves overthrew their masters and we got Haiti.<br><br>I like how you just ignored my scientific evidence, btw.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I have nothing much to add in this thread other than the fact it's insane how debates on /b/ about race are now more mature and rational than those on YouTube, keep up the good work  <br> but not everyone has the drive to do that. <br><br>To do fucking what?<br>What sort of drive do you have to have to decide not to break the law? <br><br>It isn't hard, what I did wasn't any fucking miracle. I made a god damn choice to be a productive law-abiding tax paying citizen who valued education and production more than Air Jordans and consumption.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> (which is impossible of you think it's genetic - which it, luckily, isn't). <br>Except it's not impossible. Sequence all blacks. Identify all niggers (those with 2r MAO-A gene), and sterilize them and all their known descendants. Continue genetic studies to identify other genes with maladaptive behavioral results. There you go. Within a few generations you'll have clearly identified normal black people and "niggers" who will now die out within a few decades from killing each other anyway.<br><br> I personally believe drugs should be legal, because it makes no sense to fuck up a black kid's life by giving him a criminal record just because he chose to smoke a joint rather than drink a beer. <br>I agree 100%, but the problem is your vision of black arrests is a fantasy. What really happens is little trayvon mugs someone, gets arrested for it and they find a joint in his pocket.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You insult yet you offer no alternative.<br><br>Get a job, ya shitter.</br></br></br>  <br> No one argues that poverty does not have an impact on crime <br>Wrong. Tons of people are making that very claim.<br><br>And again, stop pretending like police targeting isn't a factor. Do you really find it so inconceivable that cops are more likely to find and arrest a member of a group of people that they're used to targeting and arresting, than the member of a different group that they don't target as often?<br>Lastly, I've acknowledged from the start that black people have a shitty culture that perpetuates more crime than "white" culture. The point is that's not racial. It's societal. <br><br> We have a rational, logical explanation for this in the form of the 2-repeate allele of MAO-A, which is known to confer an enhanced risk of shooting and stabbing behaviors, and known to be more common in African American men than any other race. <br>I sincerely, sincerely fucking doubt this has a major impact over environmental factors. I really don't care if we're dealing with a 0.00000001% increase, or whatever the fuck it is (if it's even true - which it very well may not be). Even such a supposed genetic difference does not warrant the gigantic amount of racism I'm seeing from people here.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> because your logic is infantile and ignores personal responsibility <br>No, it doesn't. I never said you're not personally responsible. Are you really this incapable of grasping a nuanced argument? I guess so. Racists being stupid isn't surprising, of course, but it sure as hell is tedious.</br></br>  <br>Hey look it's a stormfag</br>  <br> I'm talking about cops who "randomly" search out black people far more than they do white people. Cops focused on drugs target black people way fucking more. <br>This almost never happens. In fact, such "random searches" are often more focused on finding guns than drugs. This brings to mind another "racial disparity", that of the stop and frisking in NYC. That was stopped because it "disproportionately targeted african americans". <br><br>Well guess what happened after it was repealed?<br>http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/ne<wbr>w-york-gun-violence/2013/09/19/id/5<wbr>26696/<br>http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york<wbr>/nyc-crime/nypd-stop-and-frisks-dro<wbr>p-99-percent-shootings-increase-bro<wbr>oklyn-article-1.1905456<br><br>Shootings went up because cops weren't allowed to stop and frisk blacks who are more likely to have illegal guns. <br><br>Now we can see here that stop and frisk and racial profiling actually worked. Does it suck to be an innocent black man and get stopped and frisked? Yes. But it fucking worked, and yes, such a policy would ALSO necessarily cause more drug arrests as cops find shit on people they stop.<br><br>This is the entire black situation in microcosm. You blame racism. I see a racial reality instead. Blacks were being targeted for their disproportionate violent crime. The policies meant to combat this also end up snagging nonviolent drug using blacks as well.<br><br>There is no racist cop conspiracy to arrest black people for smoking pot. Should it be legal? Yes. But most of these blacks who get charged with possession were being arrested for something else ANYWAY, usually a violent crime.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>smdh tbh fam</br>  <br>  but not everyone has the drive to do that. <br><br>Then not everyone deserves the luxurious life. Why should someone EVER get something he doesn't rightfully deserve and earn? That's negative reinforcement.<br><br>And if anything breaking the law is much riskier, you know, what with the whole putting your neck on the line and at a best case scenario ending in jail, in worse case scenario, down in some gutter.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Do you really find it so inconceivable that cops are more likely to find and arrest a member of a group of people that they're used to targeting and arresting, than the member of a different group that they don't target as often? <br><br>Here's a story from my wonderful childhood living in the ghetto.<br><br> be me <br> be 15 <br> be walking to the store with my brother from the bus stop <br> cops pull up and stop us <br> brother makes a run for it <br> I stay put <br> cop tells me to put my hands up and behind my head. <br> he puts me in handcuffs <br> ten minutes later they let me go and I go to the store to get mom's milk and eggs <br> brother got caught and charged with drug and weapons charges. <br><br>What's the difference? We were both targeted for being black. <br><br>My brother had drugs and weapons on him. He was breaking the law. I WASN'T breaking the law REGARDLESS of being "profiled" (if you want to call it that) and nothing happened to me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>this guy knows wassup</br>  <br> No. Like I said, victim surveys show that police are doing their job. They aren't disproportionately targeting blacks. Blacks commit disproportionately large amounts of crime. <br>When it comes to drug use, yes, black people are much more targeted. I'm not speaking about violent crime - which I'm sure black people commit more of, being relatively more poor than other races.<br><br> Of course, but you can't ignore the genetic reality that the "Warrior Gene" makes black males more likely to be irrational, aggressive, and violent, or that black males are more likely to have this gene. <br> I'll take bullshit for $1000 Alex <br>Not buying it, bro. I've seen and discredited such supposed "studies" before. <br>Besides, even if there is such a genetic difference, I don't believe this creatures very big differences across society, or that they're even remotely as big as the societal factors I've laid out.<br><br> Blacks were doing better WHEN THEY WERE OPPRESSED <br>This reeks of twisted statistics and half truths (which is pretty much all you people have). I can almost guarantee that there's a reasonable explanation behind this, that isn't "niggers were better off when we saw them as subhuman!". I'm going to look into it, and once I find out how bullshit it is, I'll be ready to shit on the next racist, uneducated moron who says it. Won't be you this time, but know that the next idiot will be shat upon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  guess which one is black  <br> sterilize them and all their known descendants. <br>Why not just castrate all men after they hit teenage years? Testosterone makes you WAY fucking more likely to be everything negative in regards to crime and aggression. Let's just take sperm samples from young boys, and we won't have any trouble fertilizing women. What a brave new ball-less, crimeless world!</br></br>  I know personal experience is a shit thing to use as evidence for an argument, but I can't personally account for anything else so here goes anyway<br><br>The local police are currently running an operation in my area to stop underage drinking. I have 3 friends who I chill with in the targeted area. One is white like me, one is black and another is Pakistani. Now because of this operation police searches are much more likely. However, I've been keeping record of the amount of "random" searches I've gone through recently:<br><br> total of 12 searches <br> 0 when it was just me and my white friend <br> 6 where I was with my muslim friend <br> 4 where I was with my black friend <br> 2 as a whole group <br><br>In fact, me and my white friend walked past a car with two officers stood outside. We had bags on and were walking at a fairly quick pace past them, which is considered suspicious here. Two nights later, I did literally exactly the same thing with my muslim friend, saw the same two officers. Guess what; "random" search. The exact same situation was repeated with my black friend (in fact it's happened twice with him). Every single time we had nothing on us.<br><br>Don't say that minorities are not targeted, because I can say first hand that they certainly fucking are.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Wrong. Tons of people are making that very claim <br>Who, exactly? Obviously poor people commit more crime. A hungry man does not think of the moral implications of theft. Where are these tons of people? <br> And again, stop pretending like police targeting isn't a factor <br>I don't disagree that targeting is a factor in larger black arrest rates. However, you seem to believe the targeting is unwarranted, undeserved. I don't. Blacks are targeted because they commit more crime in the first place. Again. VICTIM SURVEYS. If black people were very rarely reported as the perps but still arrested at the same rate I would think something is up. Are the victims part of a racist conspiracy with the cops to target blacks? Don't be absurd.<br> I sincerely, sincerely fucking doubt this has a major impact over environmental factors <br>Really? Why. We have always been a product of environment AND heredity. Those who debate and want to choose one or the other are foolish. Our genes define the canvas, and environment paints upon that canvas. A malformed gene can make the difference between someone being a potato or a normal, intelligent human being. A multitude of mental illnesses have genetic triggers and predispositions. Why is it so absurd for you to believe a gene could make you violent, especially when said people carrying the gene come from tribal societies where violence was commonplace and therefore positively selected for?<br><br>You're figuratively putting your head in the sand here, ignoring the truth right in front of your face.<br><br> I really don't care if we're dealing with a 0.00000001% increase <br>The effect is described as significant, which means statistically significant, which means the p-value is low enough such that random chance cannot explain it. There is a large body of research that shows that MAO-A causes violence. Why do you deny the truth?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That lawyers corrupt and I bought weed from that cop before.</br>  <br>Eh. Lies. Your friends circle is too diverse for this to be true.</br>  <br>So you'd find it fair if I took my police force and were all up in every single Asian person's ass 24/7, constantly checking them, constantly stopping them, constantly harassing them, and therefore obviously catching them in crime WAY more often than any other racial group? That'd just be fine and dandy, because "herp derp just don't do crime!"?<br><br>I break the law all the fucking time, and I'm white. I'm torrenting shit right now. I jaywalk. I take red lights on my bike. I've grabbed a chick's ass without permission. I've stolen bus-trips by not paying and saying that "the machine didn't work". If someone was all up in my grill at all times, I'd be in deep trouble. Simply because I'm a human who doesn't obey literally every single law at all times.</br></br></br>  <br>Both because this picture is black and white.</br>  <br>Not OP, but i also have a sandnegro and a negro in my friend circle.</br>  <br>oh of course, why would anybody ignore stupid stereotypes placed upon different ethnic groups in the name of judging people based on character rather than moronic fucking assumptions?</br>  <br>there was approx. 4 million at the peak of slavery.</br>  <br> The effect is described as significant, which means statistically significant <br>Statistically noticeable and societally relevant isn't the same. Just because you can point to a graph and say that this tiny, tiny difference is big enough to not be random doesn't mean we're not justified in thinking "niggers gon' nig". <br><br>When I'm talking about targeting I'm talking mainly about drug use, though I imagine the fact that the police is demonstrably racist plays a role as well. I wouldn't put it past them to plant evidence on black people, for instance, way more often than on white people.<br>If you think the cops are the good guys you're supremely naïve.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> doesn't mean we're justified in thinking "niggers gon' nig".* </br>  <br>What part of "catching them in a criminal act" do you not fucking comprehend?<br><br>As a kid, on account of being black and a member of my family wth it's extensive criminal history I was stopped and even harrassed HUNDREDS of times on the street.<br><br>And never once was I ever arrested or charged with a crime. Because i never had drugs on me. I never had a weapon on me. I never robbed anyone, I never beat anyone up. I never commited a crime. EVER. And therefore no matter how many times I was stopped or detained I never got in trouble with the law<br><br>What fucking part of "don't do the crime if you can't do the time" do you not fucking get.<br><br>I could have been stopped twenty times a day for my entire life by police and they would have never been able to charge me with a crime because I NEVER commited a crime.<br><br>If anything your argument only serves to prove the point that people of my race are so incredibly stupid.<br> they KNOW they're stopped more <br> they KNOW they're suspected of crime more frequently <br> they KNOW the police have it out for them <br> they KNOW the police will make up any excuse to stop and frisk <br> and they still walk around with guns in their waist and drugs in their pockets. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm not speaking about violent crime - which I'm sure black people commit more of, being relatively more poor than other races. <br>What don't you get about the fact that more violent crime = more policing = more drug arrests?<br><br>Black people are not more targeted because of drugs. Their neighborhoods are more targeted because of real violent crime problems, and more drug users end up getting caught because of it. <br> Not buying it, bro. I've seen and discredited such supposed "studies" before.  <br>You can read to your heart's content, I assure you it is not bullshit.<br>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?<wbr>linkname=pubmed_pubmed&amp;from_uid=243<wbr>26626<br><br> This reeks of twisted statistics and half truths (which is pretty much all you people have) <br>Funny, I feel the same way about you. You can't seem to get it through your thick skull that blacks are more targeted because they do more bad things. No police department goes out looking to catch random blacks on drug charges. They very frequently arrest them for other shit and find drugs on them after.<br> "niggers were better off when we saw them as subhuman!" <br>No, it's more like blacks had actual communities and families before the government replaced the black man as a father figure and destroyed the black family unit. It wasn't so much that Segregation was good for them as Civil Rights and the welfare state were a cure worse than the disease.<br> I'm going to look into it, and once I find out how bullshit it is, <br>You won't. You're going to find that as I said, blacks made more money, had better education, and had stronger families back then than they do today.<br> I'll be ready to shit on the next racist, uneducated moron who says it.  <br> uneducated <br>I always loved the snarky use of this term. I am quite educated. You can tell that when someone uses this term to dismiss an argument, it is in fact they who are uneducated. You can't deal with the information I've given you. It causes cognitive dissonance with everything you believe.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>all blacks nig but not all blacks nog</br>  <br>But niggers DO nig. And we know why. I'm not even racist. I don't hate blacks. JUST NIGGERS. And we know now what gene causes niggetry! (or at least one of them).<br><br>Why do you hate science? Why do you want the black race to be weighed down by crab bucket mentality niggers?</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>This so much. Everyone calls us racists - it's not about their blackness, it's about what they do with themselves. Most blacks become niggers, which is a shame.</br></br></br>  <br> What part of "catching them in a criminal act" do you not fucking comprehend? <br>What part of unfairly focusing on one group of people over another, even if they both commit crimes at the same rate do you not understand? The black dude that's locked up for drugs (which should be legal) wouldn't have been if the cops hadn't been unjustifiably focused on him. It's not that fucking hard.<br><br>I don't give a fuck about your life's story. I got it the first time. The point is that when you focus an unreasonable amount of attention on one group of people, you will catch more people from that group doing crime. How is it fair that me, a white dude, will have a much easier time getting away with drug use than if my skin had been black? It isn't.<br><br>And stop with the little "I'm black" spiel. I don't believe you for a second - and it doesn't matter to my or your argument anyway what race you are.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>okok<br> almost all blacks are nogs </br></br>  pussy close ups  <br>looks like a stab wound</br>  <br>this</br>  What is that hole thing for?  would like a drink of that  <br>Maybe its cause im a virgin but vagina close ups scare me</br>  <br>pee hole</br>  <br>pee</br>  <br>I'm 47, had hundreds of girlfriends over the years and I still think a vagina is one ugly thing!!</br>  <br>Kek</br>  <br>The Urethra you dumb fuck, its what you piss out of</br>  respondents so far in this thread  <br>Ok...
