Let's get a God tier anime thread going. I need something new to watch. Elfen Lied is in my opinion the best fucking anime there is.  I agree. Same with Rin: Daughters of Mnemosyne    <br>YES</br>  <br>spongebob is good</br>  <br>Haven't seen the one you mentioned. How good we talking?</br>  jojo  pic related  <br> Elfen Lied is in my opinion the best fucking anime there is. <br><br>I don't know if there's a hook attached to this post, or just a retard.</br></br></br>  <br>Steins Gate be balling yo.</br>  <br>I don't know whether your a nigger fag or a Jew cuck.</br>  <br>It's as short as elfin lied, and absolutely fanatic in the time frame they provide. They don't over play themes or the action scenes, lots of lesbian sex, the action and suspense perfectly executedc and the storyline alone will make you fuckin cry. If I were to choose a queen of anime, it'd be Rin.<br><br>I don't want to give away too much about the storyline, because not knowing what you're getting into is the best part</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks anon! I will definitely be watching it soon!</br>  <br>I think at this point, suicide is your best option.<br><br>Regardless of whether bait or retard.</br></br></br>  <br>Side note, Red vs Blue is life. Watch it on YouTube in shorts or full on Netflix. The rooster teeth guys are the best banter you'll ever watch. RT did make a series called RWBY and it's hard to get into at first but worth watching</br>  <br> RWBY <br> worth watching <br><br>Even pic related is better than that ham-fisted abomination.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's fucking incredible. The whole show is six episodes long, but hour long episodes. It really knows how to handle a dark atmosphere, and not make it seem too, "Ooh, look how edgy I am." Definitely in my top ten.</br>  <br><br>I've seen all RvB and RWBY. They are fucking gold.

New chapter soon Ayy</br>  <br>Please, enlighten me as to how I don't know shit about anime.</br>  <br>Kill yourself tarki</br>  <br>While I absolutely love SAO for certain reasons, even the first part of season 1 is shit. Half of it is just a brigade of one Girl Of The Week after another that goes absolutely nowhere, the main character is consistently awful even the presentation of it's interesting concept is a total fucking mess. I don't blame the anime for this really (except the dreadful mess that is episode two which is largely a fabrication of anime) as the anime is literally a 1:1 conversion of the light novel. Minus chapter 16.5.</br>  <br>Why Jim?</br>  <br>Yeah I agree but the anime and movies are still great in my opinion</br>  <br>Log Horizon was better than SAO</br>  Mirai Nikki (future diary)    <br>Probably, I haven't watched it yet.</br>  <br>They all skip do much important stuff from the manga, however 3 is worth the watch to see the eclipse animated.</br>    <br>gunsmith cats, tokyo godfathers,yuyu hakusho, outlaw star, big o, trigun, new cutey honey,dominion tank police (original and new) bubblegum crisis series, macross, golden boy, galaxy express999 the series not the movie, berserk, original gundam run, gundam 8th MS team.</br>  <br>Because you're correct, berserk is indeed a much better manga.</br>  <br>Manga is better</br>  <br>All you did was parrot the center-left of mainstream anime fan critique of Naruto. Shows you haven't even bothered to give it a chance or analyze it beyond reading other people review it.<br><br>So you don't know shit about anime. Other people do, and you spout it off as your own understanding.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Monogatari <br><br>No thanks, I'd rather not be a faggot</br></br></br></br>   implying OP will watch all of these recs   The first 15 episodes of SAO should have been the whole anime.<br>It got quite rediculous after that.</br>  <br><br>  Ctrl F "jojo" <br>thank's for being the real nigga</br></br></br>  <br>OH HEY, LOOK.<br><br>SOMEONE FROM THE GOLDEN AGE!</br></br></br>  I want something like Kill la Kill.

It teetered into fan-fic writer 'look at this angst' tier at those points, when she was on screen.<br><br>Nani Sore has best burns, though, no argument there.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Waste of dubs faggot</br>  <br>kek</br>  <br><br>To be honest it's not worth watching the Original FMA unless you really liked Brotherhood.</br></br>  Durarara's having a 2nd season right now<br><br>should I watch the 1st season?</br></br>  <br>That looks like Carnage</br>  <br>I've see 300 episodes of the show. Those critiques of the show are probably so common because they're glaring issues with it. I've taken the time to watch as much of the show as I could, but it can't hold my interest. It's story is tired, and it's action is lackluster at best.</br>  <br>← This</br>  <br> Evangelion <br>stop</br></br>  <br><br>I didn't take it seriously at all, but yeah the angst probably dropped the score by a solid 2-3 points.</br></br>  Boku no pico  <br>You obviously didn't watch it on Toonami with a box of Reeses' cups. It was more of a psychological consideration than anything.

At least, they sort of redeemed him in the last few episodes.</br>  Fuck you all.<br>Great Teacher Onizuka</br>  <br>Pay attention to the thread this time faggot, allot of the mentions here are classics, don't get mad because people have different opinions than you.</br>  <br>I have seen about half of this list and have yet to be majorly disappointed.</br>  <br><br>It disappoints me that very few anime made in the last 10 years can can be considered "good".<br><br>But I guess moeblob weebshit sells</br></br></br></br>  Not seeing Hunter x Hunter in this thread.  <br> main character gets miraculously stronger and wrecks current threat without any repercussions <br>This reminds me to Goku</br></br>    <br>I hear a lot of good shit about Mushishi.

Alas I am but another horny motherfucker.</br>    <br><br>i dont know why, but looking at this, i somehow can really imagine how it would feel like having her sitting on my desk and chewing on my finger, and how i'd would feel like to touch her hair and stuff. This happens to me with some movies, porn, and rarely with pictures. in some cases its like i can literally feel like i'm in the setting, this is the case here.<br><br>what kind of psychological sorcery is this?</br></br></br></br>  <br>/x/ is a godawful board, but presumably that'd be the most likely board to know about that stuff.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Well I'm outta pic, Imma lurging now</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mental retardation.</br>  <br> know <br>Are you talking about paranormal bullshit, or some of the more unexplored possibilities behind hormone and chemical processing and human physiology?</br></br>  <br>know that feel bro, it's fucking wierd as shit<br>PS. music can do it too</br></br>  <br>Autism.</br>  So is there any erp going on in this thread yet?  <br>Nope.</br>  (Reply to Mrs. Johnson)<br>Seeing and feeling this caused his balls to tighten up and shoot out whatever was left. He moaned loudly again as four long ropes of cum shot all over his teacher's face and neck. "That was amazing..." He trailed off as his whole body went limp. "Was that.. good... Mrs. Johnson?" He sounded exhausted but still smiled.</br>  <br>Wait a minute, aren't you the faggot that believes in tulpas?</br>  <br>The latter.<br>It's a totally underrated idea, that the main limit to what we can do to our own bodies by power of will is a lack of neural infrastructure for doing so.<br>I'm pretty sure I managed to deliberately undo weight gain at the time my weight should have been going up, without any change in diet or exercise.</br></br></br>  <br>Define "believes in tulpas".<br>Because anyone who thinks that they have physical manifestation is a fool, they're just weird feats or accidents of psychology.</br></br>  <br>Goddamn it, and here I am, ready to jerk my throbbing cock to some hot anon x anon action :(</br>  Einposting!  <br>Makoto I thought you needed to sleep.</br>  <br>If experimenting on human fetuses is made possible the ears and tail arn't that farfetched an idea, actually it should be as simple as taking parts of a cats genom (the parts for the tail and ears) and inserting them in a virus, then injecting the virus in a fetus. The fetus should now grow non - functional catears and a tail (prob non - functional too, this one is possible to change, because it existed in humans before)</br>  Is this a Catgirl?  <br>"So good," she breathes out, the thick ropes spewing from her cock slowing down now. Her body still quivers from her orgasm, but she leans up, keeping her shooting prong deep inside of your ass. Her lips twitch with a mix of a smile and a blissful pout, her eyes swimming behind a glassy film as she looks at you.<br><br>"You shot a whole bunch for me, didn't you?" she whispers, happily. Her dick slows down inside of you, now just dribbling as it starts to soften. "I thought you were going to beat me in how much you'd cum. Maybe we can do that...but for now, you have homework, don't you? You should be on your way now, but don't think I won't play with you again."</br></br></br>  <br>Foxgirl, you can tell by the bushy tail and the black-forelimb dress style.<br>Still cute though!</br></br>  <br>Nope.

He tries to be serious but still can't help smiling. "And I'll do my homework when I get home, though it might be a while til I can walk normally again Haha."</br>  OH BOY.<br><br>CHECK OUT ALL THE PUSSY IN THIS THREAD!</br></br>  <br> Frigging saved </br>  <br>And end.<br><br>Enjoyed yourself?</br></br></br>  Anyone else want in on the blanketpile?  <br> 3 sec later she rips the guts out of you <br>Know the sauce of the pic you use mate</br></br>  <br>Ein would like to join in too!<br><br>I-if that's okay.</br></br></br>  <br>Full pic?</br>  <br/>  <br>Can I join in too Makoto?</br>  <br>Here ya go!</br>  <br>"Well arent you a cutie!" *wraps arms around your waist*</br>    <br>well, shit. i wasn't expecting 'that'.</br>  <br>admiral_ackbar.jpg<br><br>Also checked.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah I did.

Well at least were all going to bed now right?</br>  <br>Mmmh! * she starts to moan softly, rubbing her breasts with her hand, and a bit of precum has already started dripping from her throbbing cock* "My cock has been sucked so many times lately so mind if I use your backdoor today~?</br>  <br>Go ahead and take care of someone else first, I'm not bothered by that. &lt;3</br>  <br>heh not at all nan but how should we lube this massive member up? <br>*he gets up and leans in for a kiss while gripping at your cock slowly sliding his hand up and down it. *</br></br>  <br>I can wait a long time to taste your member</br>  <br>Nya, you're not Master, don't talk like that. <br>I like your softness better, I just wanna sleep...<br><br>That's the plan -w-</br></br></br></br>  <br>"Master?

(Do you actually want help or is this part of a thing?)</br>  <br>"Your cries for mercy only serve to make my dick harder!

You can feel her balls slapping against your ass when she thrusts, and a bit of moaning can be heard*<br>"Don't rush me.. slut~" she replies.<br>*she fucks you slowly, but she manages to push 20cm of her cock inside you with every thrust*</br></br></br>  <br>Are you all dressed up for me, like a present? I want to slowly unwrap you infront of all these anons. Would you like that?</br>  <br>"Nothing will change if someone comes in to save you... You see, I dont care very much about that... I will make you mine by the end of the night no matter what!"</br>    <br>If  will allow it.<br><br><br>She nodded shyly, fumbling around with her fingers. "Y-yes, E-Ein would like that!"</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>"Alright then!" I rush in and rip the man off Makoto tossing him to the ground. "She said no, fuck off!"</br></br>  <br>Oh, yes, let them use you all they'd like dear. I want to watch you take load after load from strangers when I fuck you.

She placed her hands on her cheeks and spread them apart, revealing her little hole. "L-like this?", she asked shyly, wiggling her butt a little.</br>  <br><br> hides behind Mal with a tiny can of mace </br></br>  <br>That's it hun, just like that... Now slide the shaft slowly inside. You might be in for some pain at first, but when it passes, you wont be able to stop. But, I do not want to see any hands on your cock. Hands-free.</br>  <br>Now that your friend is okay, I think you can give me pleasure<br><br>The man pulled out his already hard cock to the mouth of Ein<br><br>Now I think you know what you must do</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He took a 13"er earlier.<br><br>You won't be any trouble.</br></br></br>  <br>"What do you think you are doing? Cant you see she's busy?"</br>    <br>Please, just go! &gt;m&lt;</br>  <br><br>She nods obediently, blushing as she pushed her ass back onto the cock that was waiting behind her, making her whimper a bit as she took it halfway on the first try. Then she slowly opened her mouth as she looked at the other member that was right in front of her, taking the tip into her mouth with ease.</br></br>  <br><br>She nodded obediently, blushing a little as she pushed her ass back against the cock that was waiting just next to her rump, letting it penetrate her as she moved back, almost halfway through on the first try. Ein then opened her mouth and looked at the other member in front of her, taking its tip into her mouth with ease.</br></br>  Draw thread<br><br>why the fuck are you awake addition.</br></br>  Does Sheriff ever get on anymore?  <br>excuse me fine female, would you mind tell me which fetishes you'd refuse to draw?<br>cause i dont want to request stuff you are not ok with.</br></br>  <br> m'lady </br>  Part three to the hunger games  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;628575317 <br><br>Ya want to get a buckshot to the face as well ya fucker?

Left because I could tell it wasn't for me. Ask whatever you want to know about what it was like, what goes on in a seminary, the training, related questions.<br><br>This is not a thread for discussing/arguing theology or religion though. that is a waste of time on /b/</br></br></br></br>    <br>Genuine question:<br>Did the revelation of the churches involvement with covering up child sex abuse contribute to your decision to leave?</br></br>  <br> Genuine question: <br>How many kids did you molest while you were studying?</br></br>  <br>What kind of boats did you sail on?</br>  <br>no, actually it made me hesitant to even go into the seminary at first. But I did get the feeling that the church really is trying to prevent any of that now. I had a ton of psychological tests and evaluations and things to get in. Along the way, there is constant moderation going on and anyone who seems to be suspicious as a potential molester gets the boot.</br>  <br>0<br><br><br>dont sail</br></br></br></br>  It took you 4 fucking years to figure out that bullshit?    <br>Did you find it difficult to reconcile the idea that the church was supposed to be a force for good yet a lot of it's most powerful senior members actively covered up the abuse?</br>  <br>not really because the church has a human element that can be pretty shitty and rotten at times. I know enough about church history that there have been great saints doing a lot of good and great sinners who did a lot of harm. It's kind of par for the course.</br>  <br>Did any of the seminarians outright dismiss the abuse cases as "a media overreaction"?</br>  <br>hmmm good question. I don't think quite that but a lot would make the point that the media focuses overwhelmingly on the catholic church and that abuse by eg. public school teachers, boyscout leaders, rabbis, etc. would get less attention</br>  <br>I see your point but you must admit that the church is in a very different position to all of those other groups. It actively sets itself up on a moral pedestal and is reluctant to give way to external examination. <br>I'm Irish BTW and in my country the church still has a lot of control over the state.</br></br>    <br>I know what you're saying. For you, that would be very true in Ireland. I'm American so there is a big legacy of Catholicism at its heights here but nothing like the church-state interplay as in Ireland.</br>    do you still believe in god?  <br><br>yes. I didn't lose my faith, just didn't want to be a priest.</br></br>  <br>Peace be with you then brother.</br>  <br>This ugly ass motherfucker is BANGING hot underageb girls, and basically you're fuckin stupid<br> click here to find out how </br></br>  <br>and with your spirit</br>  <br>ooohkay</br>  <br>I'm just kidding, really wanted to.<br><br>Anyways, for op. Are you worried your time on /b/ could in some manner, or it has somewhat corrupted you?</br></br></br>  Was celibacy one of the reasons for you to leave? Is it hard not to even fap during those 4 years? I'm asking 'cause I have some friends who are priests but they don't talk about that, i've always been curious of how you guys control sexual needs.  <br>You felt guilty touching up little boys OP? Also stop making those fuckin "Prove that god doesn't exist" threads. Thanks.</br>  <br>I think that /b/tards think the all of this is way more sktechy and taboo than it really is now. I remember the glory days of old school /b/.<br><br>I think I'm thick-skinned enough.</br></br></br>  <br>Holy fuck what?<br>If I'm reading this right, nofap and no sex for four years? Damn son, brutal.</br></br>  <br>were there any things in your study that genuinely surprised you, it threw you for a loop?</br>  <br><br>Do you rationally believe in an entity that transcends the material world?<br>Since there is no proof of this entity, why do you personally believe in something that is only written in a couple of books? (Which may or may not be amusing romans)<br>No offense intended</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not saying it's "hardcore underground pure edge" but it's not sfw and such.
