Or maybe you don’t even fill in the captcha. Maybe you’re such a disgusting NEET that you actually paid for a 4chan pass, so you just choose the picture. Oh, and we all know the picture. The “epic” Banana guy, isn’t it? I imagine you little shit laughing so hard as you click it that you drop your Doritos on the floor, but it’s ok, your mother will clean it up in the morning. Oh, that’s right. Did I fail to mention? You live with your mother. You are a fat fucking fuckup, she’s probably so sick of you already. So sick of having to do everything for you all goddamn day, every day, for a grown man who spends all his time on 4chan posting about a fucking banana. Just imagine this. She had you, and then she thought you were gonna be a scientist or an astronaut or something grand, and then you became a NEET. A pathetic Bananafag NEET. She probably cries herself to sleep everyday thinking about how bad it is and how she wishes she could just disappear. She can’t even try to talk with you because all you say is “I REALLY REALLY LIKE THIS PICTURE.” You’ve become a parody of your own self. And that’s all you are.

Anyone on /b/ ever seen someone die? Or maybe have someone close to you die?<br><br>How did it change you for the better or worse?</br></br>  <br>Slenderman</br>  <br>Dem skinny jeans though</br>  <br>In the past 2 years ive had one friend an hero, one OD, and one get hit by a car.<br><br>Being at the wake of the suicide victim made me realize i couldnt do that to my family, even though i think about it constantly. <br><br>The OD made me mad that I didnt do anything about it, but he was in thailand so what could I have done?<br><br>And the last guy I saw coming. He was a speedboarder (longboarding down hills going 30mph+) and it makes me sad but he was reckless, like he was invincible.<br><br>None of them changed me, because i'm an athiest nihilist<br> edgelord </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Were you close with those people at all?<br><br><br>You say it hasn't changed you, but has it made you think about your own mortality a little bit more?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I see someone die on /b/ every day.</br>  <br>Had to have my cat euthanized.<br>It's worse than people dying, unless that was your doing, too.</br></br>  <br>I was driving and the car next to me got executed by some narcs.<br><br>Mexico is a horrible place to live</br></br></br>  <br>I meant more so in real life or people you've actually known.<br><br>I've seen plenty of gore and death videos on the internet. I was just wondering how it compares to death in real life.</br></br></br>  Mum died when 14, It's pretty shit. I think I've become much more awkward/shy since then but I don't know if it directly relates.  <br>Iv`e known over 20 people that have been killed, one commited suicide, and have a lot of near death experiences but thank God im still here.</br>  <br>It made me realize the closer you get to something the more it hurts to lose it - or have it killed.<br>I adopted an attitude of the less you have the less you can lose.<br><br>Took me many years to get over it. The problem being the fact I delivered it to execution.<br> then carried home the body and buried it <br>I managed to accept the neccessity of my course of action, but it doesn't make it any more pleasant.<br>In some sense I am proud to have had the strength to stand it all through, be there as it died, take responsibility, and only cried after the fact. After it was dead.<br><br>On the whole it fucked me up pretty badly for a couple of years.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Some years algo, i sat down in a bench next to an old man. The man was to quiet, i left the bench and some hours later i heared an ambulance ( the bench is near my house). The man was dead, and i sat down next to him and i stayed there like 10 min.  <br>We're all gonna die. I really think it helps processing that concept. Your mom, your dad, your sister, your brother, all your friends and pets -- they're going to die. And you're no exception to that rule, either. <br>Death is a part of the universe, and even stars die. What helps me get by in the wake of death is this: you're going to spend more time dead than alive -- so just live up your short, 80-something human years... you'll spend billions more being the immaterial building blocks of the universe.</br></br>  <br>Watched my girlfriend die this past winter. I'm still a mess, but I'm confident it'll get better. It didn't break me or anything.</br>  <br>Saw tons of animals and one grandparent die. Most small animals will be fine, then suddenly become "old" and die, if they don't die young from predation or disease. It's like you can watch the genetic programming kick in. Larger more long lived animals take a while to get older like people do and will just keep going until decrepit and you go get them put down. Sick animals will usually just give up and wait to die. <br><br>Anyway, death is death. The chemical electrical processes stop and that's that. After a while you get jaded to it. <br><br>Point I'm making is, we are just organic robots, machines. And like anything tey break and that's that. No real mystery, which is kind of sad. <br><br>Life becomes somewhat worse in that you stop seeing things as magical. Better for the same reason. It's a trade off.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  was driving in a Friends car when i saw an old lady just drop dead funny as fuck was laughing my ass off with my mate for it for days i hope the old waste of space died was funny as fuck  <br><br>Quite a few all told, it hasn't affected me on way it the other.</br></br>  <br>What is that? A mother fucking enderman?</br>  <br> none changed me <br> made me realize you couldn't do it to your family <br><br>dude, do you even read yourself?</br></br></br></br>  <br>My mother died in hospital in front of my eyes. It was following an accident and she was in a coma for 2 days before the removed the breathing tube. It was horrifying, just watching the heart rate reduce to zero and her lips turn blue. The image is burnt into my mind and makes me sad every time. Every time i get drunk, I usually end up crying.</br>  When I was younger my buddies and I used to go dirtbiking in the hills behind our friends property when they had moved up there. We'd go up pretty much every day after school and got to know all those hills like the back of our hands. Our friends little brother really wanted to start riding and since our group were all relatively experienced since we've all been riding prior to the property riding his mom reluctantly said yes and got him a bike and he started up. We all rode back there for years, went to the desert, mountains, canyons etc and got him pretty confident after a bit. A couple years had passed and we started getting into women and socializing because high school was close to ending and we were riding locally a lot less but the younger brother wanted to get everybody together and do a ride for old times sake. We all loaded up our trucks so we could go straight to the property after school let out. We all met up and geared up and the younger brother lead the way. We didn't know it but a golf course was being built in the area and they had purchased a large plot of the land we would ride on. The younger brother was coming around a blind corner and there was a metal cable strung across the pathway and it caught him by the neck. We all came to a stop and dumped our bikes. His closest friend ran up to him and asked "Anon are you okay!?" and his response was "What?". His brother ran up and took off his helmet and he had bled out in seconds and was dead by the time his helmet came off. None of us knew what to do, we were dead silent for a few minutes. Me and the guy who's dad owned the property rushed back to the house and called 911 and the parents. From there everything was kinda a blur once all the media and officials got down there<br><br>It made me realize life can come and go at any time, even doing the things you love. So if you always do the things that make you happy, you can hopefully die happy</br></br>  <br>Possibly, but you have many more incarnations to come. It's true, believe me because reasons.</br>  Was with gf's grandmother when she died in hospital. Didn't affect. Just she was there in a coma, then she wasn't.  I saw a guy die in a motorcycle accident when I was 13<br><br>He t-boned a car at a cross section and went flying, broke his spine i think and he probably died of eternal bleeding. He was just lying on the floor unresponsive<br><br>I watched until the ambulance came, but he was so dead<br><br>I used to want to ride a motorbike because my dad used to and i thought it was cool but after seeing that, why not just encase yourself in a big, safer metal box while you travel???<br><br>It was kinda cool to see someone die though, I thought it would upset me</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Point I'm making is, we are just organic robots, machines <br>No we ain't. They are just the vehicle.</br></br>  Dad when i was young. <br>Worse: have very little emotion for anyone<br>Better: i have very little emotion for anyone</br></br>  <br>same, they took my dad off life support in front of me, i wouldn't leave the room. he beat cancer, had a lung removed, then fucking phenomena got him and died of septic shock. shit haunts me, i hope no other anon has to go through it.</br>  My father was always a drunk. I never recall living with him. He drank himself to death on april fourth of last year. I'm also an alcoholic, and a NEET, and I know that I will die the same way.<br><br>It sucks.</br></br>  <br>Watched my brother shoot too much H last year, no amount of CPR would bring him back, I just wish I had some naloxone, maybe I would still have my older brother. Not a day passes where I don't think I could have saved him, the guilt still plagues me and alcohol only takes a little of the pain away. Love you Alex.</br>  <br>I saw my dad die of acute pneumonia. All the doctors on the floor rushed into the room to try to save him. I walked in closer after they lost him. He was laying lifeless on the hospital bed I<br>With a pool of blood on the floor. It was the most disturbing thing I'd ever seen and I've never felt pain like I did that day in my life. I'm a very strong person now and things that would hurt or disturb others don't hurt me as much. But I'm also more depressed (I was Bipolar ii already).There are very few things that I actually deem important now. As a result I have developed a habit of making impulsive decisions out of anger and/or depression, such as buying things I don't need or getting really fucking trashed.</br></br>  <br> eternal bleeding </br>  <br>Have a free kick up the arse.</br>  <br> eternal bleeding </br>  <br>It's a meme, you dip</br>  <br>Welcome newfriend.</br>  <br>Thanks!</br>  <br>No, more likely nerve gas.</br>  <br> ETERNAL BLEEDING <br>"Why can't I stop bleeding?!"</br></br>  When I was 15 I saw a girl jump off a bridge onto the car infrount of me  <br>Forgot to say how i guess. Cancer. He died at thw house i was living at while i was in the room with him.</br>  Best friend ODed on china white a few years back. Mostly just survivor's guilt since we used to shoot together a lot.  <br>kek</br>  <br>Fuck it, I've lost too many people to drink and drugs. Oldfag here, and you would not believe the numbers. Just the crew, ordinary guys and girls who just go under eventually. Mate, do something.</br>  My mom died when I was 12, first serious girlfriend comittied suicide. I was a medic in a direct action unit. Now I work in an er. Lots of death.<br>You just gain a different perspective I guess. Doesn't mean I'm at peace with it. In fact I'd honestly like to go into a few research projects to try and at least add a few years on our lives.</br>  <br>Damn Anon. Right in the feels. I hope that it doesn't hurt anymore one day.</br>  <br>Interesting, I'm wanting to become an EMT myself one day. I just wonder what seeing death on a somewhat regular basis is like.<br><br>I can claim that I've seen a bunch of death on the internet, but I think there's a difference whether there's a computer screen separating someone passing on in front of you</br></br></br>  <br>Saw 2 colombians on a motorcycle crash head on into a cab @ like 50 mph.no helmets, best case scenario paralyzed for life. Will never ride a motorcycle for as long as i live because of it.</br>  When I was a student, more than twenty years ago now, I watched a guy who'd been in a road accident dying, I didn't wait until he actually croaked but you could tell he was going to. As indeed he did.<br><br>I might have been able to save him, I could certainly have stayed with him or summoned an ambulance. But he'd refused to bring me a sandwich from the ships a few months before despite the fact that I'd brought back lunch for him many times. . So I just left him there squealing. Tried to ride his sister at the funeral too. She didn't wear it.</br></br>  <br>HAHAHAHA as if calling yourself an oldfag adds any credibility to your statement. I don't care. I lost my father, sobriety, fiance, and house all in one fell swoop. I don't fucking care, I sold my gun, for whiskey. Now it's just a waiting game. Call me a coward or what have you. I'm 25 and I am waiting for death.Fuck you.</br>  <br><br>Bye then. You're unlikely to be missed!</br></br>  <br>Anorexia nervosa.<br>You'd be suprised how far some peolpe can push it without dying. I'm a nurse, I' ve seen them only in underwear. Gives the "skeleton inside" meme a hole new meaning.</br></br>  I have family at mexico so multiple times i happened to be in the middle of shootings, i saw some people die and stuff but you gotta not let it affect you  <br>You seem pretty cool.</br>  <br>Get out of here you edgy piece of shit. No one buys your sob story, especially if it's just being used to "one-up" another anon.</br>  <br>seen my father die in hospital i was 11 and on my own and got rushed out the room when he got resusitated <br><br>my life long dog died in my arms when i was 16<br>lost my other life long dog few month after <br><br>lost another dog only a puppy at 2 year to cancer <br><br>~( my dogs are family to me not pets) <br><br>grandad died infront of me when i was 22 his heart stopped beating but his body kept trying to breath it was inhaling randomly and arraticly but his eyes just stared out not focusing on anything then later on when his body was lying in his room waiting for the funeral people to come take him away i went in and kissed his forehead <br><br>seen him in his coffin embalmed and it did not look like him <br><br>you dont really change that much after you witness death you become numb for a while like a bit of your innocence is gone, like the worlds abit less colourful but all in all your still pretty much the same <br><br>that is if you can accept death and not be scared of it <br><br>if you are scared of dying it will destroy you give you anxiety depression etc <br><br>as for me i do not fear death and i look forward to dying so i can be with my loved ones again <br>but i am not suicidal or anything i just accept its going to happen and realise fearing the unstoppable is pointless</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a realistic stance.<br>In a sense he already died.<br>Takes years to get over it.</br></br></br>  <br>Thank you. I'm sure I'll be okay.</br>    Last september, My mum was in hospital with near total organ failure, So, I sat with her for the better part of a month as she gradually got wrose.. and yeah, That was shit. <br><br>But, I shit you not, I was cleaning my room out about 2 weeks ago, And, I found this photo album i made when i was just a little kid that had lots of baby pictures of me in (I must have made this thing when i was like 8), And, I was flicking through it just out of Nostalgia, And i finished all of the pictures, And, On the page after the pictures, On the first blank page, There was a note that my mum had Written, Saying she loved it and she dated it (The date was like a few months before she went into hospital).<br><br>And to think, She wrote that note, And i would have never seen it until long after she had gone is just so heartbreaking, I just sat on my floor for a good hour crying over that one, I don't cry often, But man that fucking hurt. To think that she saw that book buried deep in my room and actually wrote a note in it.... <br><br>Fuck, Sorry for going on. Just love your mums guys, It fucking sucks when they're gone.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Watched my mother die in the hospital it fucked me up i hope i never watch someone take their last breath ever again.</br>    <br>I guarantee you anything some person in the history of humanity has had it worse than him and still managed to live their lives. The only reason he deserves to be given shit is because he's using it to out-do another anon, which is some 8th grade bullshit and makes his story seem like a bunch of lies</br>  <br>you hvent experienced death first hand but you will and when you will it will break you<br>you think your hard and edgey but death does not discriminate and theres alot of people who wont miss you</br></br>  <br>You had a father? I didn't. I never got engaged, or owned a house. You don't have to believe me, but I've no reason to lie. You're killing yourself for stuff that doesn't mean anything.</br>  <br> be me <br> visiting a friend at college <br> walking back to his dorm <br> hear a motorcycle ripping down the street <br> right next to us tbones a car and launches the guy about 50 feet i don't even know how far he skidded and tumbled. <br> Blood everywhere <br> dead body lays in street for about 45 min before he gets covered up and removed <br><br>Didn't change me at all. People die. It's a fact of life. You don't matter. If you are lucky your death will affect a handful of people on this planet of 7 billion in an infinite universe. Why worry about that shit?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   summer time in Australia and the weather is fine.  <br> women in skimpy clothes, looking fine.  <br> down at the big city restaurant strip, elder brothers birthday <br> drinking, laughing having a good time - a nice family affair in a family that hasn't always been nice <br> end of the meal, group breaking up, my Mum says to me and my brothers "Boys, I have something I need to tell you..." </br></br></br></br>  <br>One of my friend committed suicide, he tied an cable around his neck. This happen when I was in 8 Grade about 7 years ago.</br>  No  <br>It depends on your profession. When my mom and girlfriend died I knew nothing medically. Everyone after that I was focused on logically finding out what was going on. I had a close friend get shot next to me, it never registered til after that a guy I've know 3 years was dying. I was systematically trying to fix him. When I had my first pediatric death I didn't think about the parents. I was wondering how his age effected certain systems and how I should adjust treatment, or if it mattered. That being said I've also seen paramedics and docs break down with patient deaths.</br>  <br>  a Friends car </br>  <br>Mine could be soon. Can't do enough, can't repay.</br>  <br>You're exaggerating.<br>The post he's replying to wasn't very specific. The oldguy could have seen the deaths of thousands.<br><br>The way he replied to it is just a manifestation of his condition.<br><br>And as I said - it is survivable - but it takes quite some time.<br>The quesiton isn't really who survives but who can live a normal/healthy life again.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>not really<br><br>its more about what your mind makes of it, if you calm yourself with the idea the screen makes it different, that excuse is gone of course. but even if its on screen it was real somewhere at some point, if you got the empathy to get yourself into that situation you at least get really close.<br><br>First death for me was irl tho, was 10 and a 6 yr old girl I knew got run over by a car cause she just ran onto the road without looking.<br><br>later 'normal' people start calling you cold or edgy but its really just a matter of when and how your first encounter with death happened and what others tell you how to feel about it. for me no one was there to tell me anything.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> "I've been having trouble swallowing, so I went to the doctor to have it checked out...Doctor said there was something growing in my throat.

I tried to go and help when the man ran off but I fainted and my parents found me in a pool of blood, to this day I have never had a fear of blood and I am not really scared of anything I remain calm in most situations and have been professionally diagnosed as a psychopath  <br>you a drug dealer or something?</br>  <br><br>  A month later - cancer back and worse than before. Growing more aggressively this time. <br>  Like phase 2 of boss in vidya after you kill phase 1 form.  <br>  Sick and getting sicker - can only eat liquids because of throat cancer <br> Doctor starts talking about timeframes <br>  "I'm not ready for this yet, asshole"  <br>  The last night she spent at home, my brothers and I went for a dinner to her place. Pasta - her special recipe.  <br> Next day she had a fall and was admitted to hospice care. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hahaha, honk next time so they'll think you're their friend.</br>  <br>Good ol' grandpappy smoked about a pack a day since he was 15 and died in his 50s. I was almost 13 when he died. We had to drive 9 hours in the middle of the night to go see him one more time before he kicked it, but he ended up dying while we were still on the way. I miss that old bastard, especially now that I smoke pot on a daily basis and he was a crazy stoner.</br>  <br>Saw one of my drunkard neighbors get out of his pick-up one day and just fall down dead. My mother (an LPN) tried CPR until the ambulance got there but they said he was probably dead when he hit the ground. Don't remember if it was an aneurysm or heart attack or what, but no one was really surprised that his "avoid hangovers: stay drunk" lifestyle didn't get him past 50. This was when I was 15 or so.<br>When I was around 20 I saw a guy on a Ninja900 come zooming down an interstate off-ramp right so fast he was laid almost completely over to make the turn. Unfortunately for him there was a semi coming under the overpass he'd just come across and the second he merged into the lane he got hit by the semi and went flying (around 30 feet in the air) into a parking lot on the other side of the road. Splat.<br>When I was around 30 I saw a guy in an old pick-up swerve off the road and hit a random old man on the sidewalk. He made a really loud crunching sound like someone stomping an easter basket (his ribcage) and a woman who also saw it happen started throwing up and later kept blabbering to the EMTs that showed up about "that horrible sound". They were checking her because she was pretty near going into shock and by then there was no helping the guy who got hit.<br><br>Can't really say any of these events affected me. I'd already been conditioned against alcoholism by all my abusive drunk neighbors (no one in my family drank), and being a motorcyclist myself I already knew how stupidly dangerous the Ninja driver was being. I'd also already had that realization that I myself will die one day because way back in sixth grade I had double pneumonia (that means "both lungs") and overheard the doctor telling my mother that there was "a very real chance he won't survive the night".</br></br></br></br></br>  I envision myself dying every day. I die a little inside everyday regretting my miserable life.  <br><br>You seem to be overlooking a lot of facts.<br><br>You comprehend the shallow truth.

She didn't want him dying in the comfort of his own home because that would drive down the value of the house after he died and hospice was fully covered through his insurance.
