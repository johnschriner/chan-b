[ ITT: God-tier metal albums.  <br>Were they going for the edgiest album cover ever ?</br>    <br>FUCK yes! for once OP isn't a faggot</br>  I love this one  <br>this shit is fucking disgusting. so is the music. only an edgy teenager or an insane freak would buy something like that.<br>kil urself</br></br>        <br>Don't forget</br>  <br>isn't it your nap time little kid?</br>  <br>Shag off</br>  <br> little kid <br>l don't listen to metal</br></br>  <br>Guess that means I'm an insane freak because I almost have every CC album in my collection.</br>  <br>He means dismissing an entire genre of music, like an adolescent</br>  <br>Then why the fuck are you here? The purpose of this thread is to share metal albums, from metal LISTENERS.</br>  Best new decapitated  <br>Cannibal Corpse is fucking AMAZING!</br>  obituary is reel good considering they're american  <br><br>Definitely the best CC album. Only Butchered comes close.</br></br>  <br><br>Show No Mercy man...</br></br>  <br>Worst album for the locust. Safety second body last and plague soundscapes i would say are the best</br>      <br>easily god tier.</br>  <br><br>The Locust are gay. Please listen to non-gay metal.</br></br>  <br>CHOPPED IN HALF! FEEL THE BLOOD SPILL FROM YOUR MOUTH!</br>    <br>alot of people think Eaten is the best. I honestly haven't listened to it but so far i've enjoyed Chris' Vocals over Corpsegrinder</br>    <br>WITH ROTTING WAYS COMES DESTINY! FEEL THE SOUL TAKING OVER! BLEED!</br>    &lt;&lt; what I got on  <br>In my opinion TOTM is one the best death metal albums ever. That is when Chris Barnes was at his best, some of the best growls you'll ever headbang to.</br>  <br>I want to fucking marry you right now</br>  <br>Mah nigga</br>    <br>fuck yes dude!</br>  daymn  <br>FUCK YES!</br>  Get on my level plebs  Good album  <br>Yeah I remember being in high school too</br>        <br>  cannibal corpse = -10/10 shit tier garbage metal </br>  <br> cannibal corpse <br>What are you, fucking twelve?</br></br>    <br>Yeah they're really bad at guitar and stuff</br>  <br><br>the niggerism is strong with these two faggots</br></br>      <br><br>No doubt. Corpsegrinder sounds flat and never sounded good as Barnes on TOTM. After this, I thought The Bleeding sounded too commercial and gave up on the buying any CC albums. Anything I've heard since, or even these songs played live with Corpsegrinder are underwhelming.</br></br>        <br><br>One of the best, ever, of all time.</br></br>      <br>these guys know how to make an album that feels like you are being beheaded!</br>        <br>I bet that's "progressive" neckbeard dj0nt with 2deep4you lyrics</br>     god-tier  <br> metal <br><br>pick one faggot</br></br></br>  <br>yeah, still got the tape i bought back in 1990</br>    <br><br>I don't know who that is, but I recognize Jake and Dinos Chapman's art.</br></br>  <br><br>i love cc</br></br>  <br><br>Cannibal Corpse is the most pathetic Death album there is.</br></br>    So many edgelords...  <br><br>ew worse, it's progressive melodeath.<br><br>kill yourself</br></br></br></br>  One of my personal favorites.    <br>I think given that most highly regarded critics consider this one of the best sludge metal albums of all time kinda trumps your pretentious opinion. You'd rink people who make a living off rating music would know a bit more than some kid on /b/ that thinks he's real clever</br>  <br><br>good, but I give the edge to Panopticon. So Did We is one of the best tunes they ever did.</br></br>        Such abyssal shit    <br>This isn't as good</br>  <br><br>Best modern grind album ever. So good it makes my dick hard.</br></br>    <br>my nigga</br>      <br>Oh yes. I love me some Windir.</br>  <br>My nigga \m/</br>  <br><br> cannibal corpse <br> album <br><br>shows how much of a retard you are</br></br></br></br></br>  One of the first, one of the best...      <br>he's just angry because his mom hasn't finished cleaning his favorite MLP shirt</br>    no electric wizard <br>Jews</br>  <br>  play the same chord 10000 times in a row but like really fast or something <br>  slam that double bass pedal <br>  growl like some psychopath on pcp <br><br>I wish I could be as good as CC</br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br>Relapse has pre-orders of the anniversary edition of Prowler right now. Vinyl pressing (hopefully sounds better than the OG pressing) and a 2xCD - one original and one remixed / remastered, with bonus track.</br></br>  Fite me  <br> be a few days ago <br> sitting with frat bros in house <br>  we get high as fucking fuck <br>  I start talking about metal <br> they tell me to play some chill metal <br>  I pop this CD in <br>  we vibe to this whole album for a while while we smoke <br> shit was cash </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>It really upsets me that We Live gets shit on.

Fuck Yes</br></br>    <br>anon your my most favorite person of all</br>    <br>Hell yeah. <br><br>Their cover of Cities On Flame is both hilarious, and actually really good.</br></br></br>  <br>my man...</br>    <br>uh are you for real?</br>  <br><br>one of us</br></br>  Listen to real metal, faggots.      <br>Yep.</br>  <br>Actually kinda agree with this. Mastodon is great but they are kinda metal for people who don't like metal</br>    most overlooked band after anvil    This  <br>underrated Emperor album. my favorite of theirs.</br>  <br><br>The people who say Mastodon is top tier metal are the same assholes who will tell you that Green Day is top tier american hardcore punk.</br></br>  Best metal album of the last 5 years.      <br>Have heard good things about this. Will go listen to now</br>  <br>Which, hilariously enough, includes their lead guitarist. He's got two side-bands, one soft rock and the other rockabilly. Both pretty good, but not metal at all.</br>  <br>Guess again</br>  <br>Alcest does their schtick so much better.</br>  <br>Probably their worst album</br>    ETID  <br><br>Wow surely you mean gayest</br></br>  Not 100% sure if Swans counts as metal, but they're god-tier nonetheless.    <br>If onle Neige sounded good at all, alcest would be god tier.</br>  <br>Let me guess: you can't move on from Imaginations or Somewhere Far Beyond?</br>    <br><br>One of the most important albums of all time</br></br>  <br>woods of desolation does literally everything better. sunbather is macfag tier blackgaze</br>  <br>I like everything up to come clarity. Reroute to remain, STYE, Whoracle, clayman were legit too IMO.</br>  <br>No, but it's their worst release.</br>    <br>Best album by them.</br>    <br>love me some crossover thrash</br>    <br>I started getting into his previous band, Peste Noire, and I really liked them. And then I found out that they're basically Neo-Nazis, and that's disappointing. Pretty much killed it for me.</br>  one of the best Burzum albums  <br>why thank you! As you are mine.</br>  <br>I wish there were a /mu/sic thread on 4chan</br>  <br>Based on what? It's got orchestra and covers everything they've ever done. You're probably just whining because you didn't like it, and that makes it a bad album</br>    <br>Lantlōs is the best Neige project. Especially after he left. Melting sun is fucking amazing</br>    <br><br>Single best Black Metal album. No doubt about it.</br></br>  <br>MY<br>FUCKING<br>NIGGER<br><br>The initial low drop into the drone is fucking CRUSHING</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>dan seagrave doe</br>  <br><br>Last good Deicide album.</br></br>  <br>Based on everything. I also never said I didn't like the album, I said it's their worst one.<br><br>Take your butt medicine and calm down.</br></br></br>    <br>Woods V: I Am Very Sad</br>  <br>God tier</br>  Get ready to feel Gaylord's.  <br>I mean, like, yeah it does, since music is subjective and all.</br>    <br>The song To Hell With God is fantastic you should listen to it</br>  And every other one of their albums  <br>mad marc rude<br>Oliveri<br><br>not metal, too good to be metal, you're a dumb piece of shit if you think that it's metal</br></br></br></br>  You faggots have the worst taste in music.  <br>Basically. I'd say that album is like a message because he knew he wouldn't be around much longer, but ALL OF THEIR ALBUMS were like that, so.</br>    <br>every album in this thread is wildly different</br>  <br>I agree.</br>  Since the topic says metal albums and doesnt specify sub-genres i throw this one into the pit: almost everything with Gamma Ray!<br><br>Now feel free to unleash your hate...</br></br>  How about this?    <br>This shit right here</br>  <br>In so far as they are actually different albums, you are correct. <br><br>You're a faggot, but you're correct.</br></br></br>    <br>MY MAAAAAAAN <br><br>tho Portal of I is better</br></br></br>  <br>No hate.

The bottle's bigger.  wild turkey  <br>facepalm there the same liters</br>  Which one did Hunter S thompson prefer?<br><br>Don't be a faggot op</br></br>  <br>They're both equally nasty.</br>  <br>Maker's. Better. Hands down. My personal favorite sipping whiskey.</br>  <br>I like both, but I would def go with makers mark</br>  <br>That's what I've been hearing, I've heard wild turkey is really bitter with no sweetness to it</br>  <br>Neither. Kentucky Deluxe</br>  Stop being an american and buy some scotch  <br>Seriously bro, buy single malt Scotch. <br><br>BUT if you're set on Bourbon, choose one of the following:<br><br>- W. L. Weller's 12 Year Old (this is the preferred option by a long shot) <br>- Booker's <br>- Wild Turkey 101 <br>- Buffalow Trace<br>- Hirsch Selection Small Batch Reserve <br>- Knob Kreek</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>More or less. I think that Maker's is just more complex. Less one note. Turkey is fine, mind you, but I think of it more as a mixer.</br>  makers is smoother, turkey 101 is stronger and therefore a bit harsher.<br>i'd use turkey for mixing in drinks where the taste of the whiskey doesn't really matter and makers mark for sipping neat or in an old fashioned or something</br>  <br>love that WL weller.</br>  <br>On regular Turkey I'd agree, but the 101 proof is significantly better imo.</br>  <br>Thanks for the recommendations, I'll definitely check those out. I've been wanting to try scotch but I've heard they're expensive and I only have about 35 bucks to play with. Know about any good ones for cheap?</br>  <br> not Buffalo Trace <br><br>Stay pleb</br></br></br>  <br>Agree to disagree, then. Higher proof doesn't mean better booze. Means more alcohol, which means less complexity. I've learned to rarely discount any booze, though. Each has a purpose, even if they're shitty. Sometimes, a shitty alcohol makes a delicious mixer.</br>  <br>Definitely the best Bourbon I've had. I'd read about it in a book I had with me on last year's Canada/USA trip. The very next day me and the Mrs. were in a small bar near West-Yellowstone. I was looking at the whisky and the bartender asked if I was a Scotch man. I told him I was, but since I was in the States I wanted to get to know more Bourbon. He turned around, grabbed the Weller, put it on the bar and said "I'm from Kentucky, and THIS is what you want". I absolutely fucking loved that! Great move on his part. He poured me a small glass for free so I could have a taste. After that I ordered a big one. Still the best bourbon I've had to date and ever since a regular in my whisky collection.</br>  <br>Knob creeks smooth finish keeps me buying again and again</br>  if you're going to post a pic of two bottles of diarrhea then you might as well just get arbor mist and save yourself the money  Seagrams 7  Canadian mist is my shit. Cheap and sweet  <br>Oh absolutely, I agree with you about percentage not being everything. No argument there. I just quite liked the 101 Turkey, but I think the regular Turkey is average.</br>  <br>if you like sour mash get makers if you like spicy get turkey. I much prefer turkey, can't really stand makers unless I mix it.</br>  <br>not seeing 70cl</br>  <br>Isn't 0,75 l. the standard U.S. size though?</br>  <br>I meant Canadian mist, no clue why i typed arbor I don't even drink wine<br><br>my point still stands though, if you're drinking garbage then you might as well get cheap garbage</br></br></br>  Lagavulin  <br>This individual knows what he or she is talking about. Lagavulin 16yo was probably the first single malt Scotch I fell in love with. Still an evergreen to me.</br>   OP asks about bourbon <br> Scotch fags immediately start saying scotch <br><br>Every time</br></br></br>  in a similar price range, ditch the turkey. go for bulleit, maker's, buffalo trace. <br><br>at a price range higher, go for woodford's reserve, knob creek, four roses. they're just the best bourbons.</br></br>  <br>cheers for that woodford's reserve breh</br>  <br>Not at that price in the States tbh. Over here in Holland you can get Glenfarclas 105 or Glendronach 12 year old for roughly 35 euro's. But there's no way you can pull that off in the US. Balvenie 12 would be a good option too, but I expect it to be 45 or more. Same with stuff like Lagavulin, Laphroaig etc.</br>  What is the best liquor that is drinkable while warm?  <br><br>Agreed on this. I forgot to mention it earlier, but Woodford offers great bourbon for a very good price.</br></br>  <br>Rum</br>  <br>Gluhwein.</br>  <br>Get fucked up, 101.<br><br>Drunken masturbate tears you dont have to remember. <br><br>1.75ml per 4hr next 12 days.<br><br>See your face so sweaty and puffy.<br><br>Kinda remember fap in street in fro t of high scool crush house</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>sake</br>  Jameson OP  Fuck all that. Get bottle of Bailey's Irish Creme and mix with Chameleon coffee and chill lounge to the new Beck album  <br>are you fucking serious?</br>    <br>Why would you drink bourbon when you can drink scotch whisky.<br>Fucking pleb.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Thanks anons, but im gonna have to agree with rum.</br></br></br>  <br>I hate Bailey's with every fibre in my body. Whsky cream is shit overall. But if you want a decent one get Edradour Cream. Cheaper than Bailey's and a million times better.</br>  <br> Bailey's  <br><br>not even relevant, gtfo</br></br></br>  Bulleit. Don't be a faggot.  <br>Yeah that's what I was expecting lol. I did a search of best "cheap" scotch and the cheapest results were like $60. I'll just stick with bourbon for now</br>  <br>This. 13 dolla bottle sake. Heat that shit. Karaoke yourself on youtube songs out loud until the cops come a knockin</br>  <br> hot buttered rum <br> hot toddy <br> spiced rum cider <br><br>Yeah I'm fucking serious</br></br></br></br></br>  Drink scotch 1.75ml per 4hr<br><br>Wake up in marque de sage castle naked with butt plug</br></br>  <br> <br>Mah nigga</br></br>  <br><br>Jameson is great</br></br>  spend 5 more dollars and get Makers 46 best whisky ive ever had  <br><br>yeyeye for the rye</br></br>  <br> mentioned hot in post <br><br>you must be a gay pleb here</br></br></br>  <br> 1.75ml <br>do you have any idea what a mL is?</br></br>  <br><br>Its decided.</br></br>  <br>Compared to drinking monkey piss, probably. <br>Compared to drinking other whisky, no.</br></br>  just a matter of time, before someone says Jack Daniel's and everybody flips their shit.<br><br>oh, wait...<br><br>I just did.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not going to pretend it can go up against a higher end whiskey, but for what it is and how much it costs it's damn good</br>  <br>Neither. Buy a bottle of Woodford Reserve. You won't be disappointed.</br>  Neither you redneck fuck, go back to your wincest thread.  <br>One of the shittier whiskys the British Isles have to offer. Sure, chuck some mixer in, makes a nice drink. But anyone drinking that shit straight and thinking it's good has never drunk good whisky.</br>  buy jack, give to 14 year old girls who don't have taste, ????, kill yourself  <br> stirring the pot <br> a faggot you are </br></br>  <br>It's not shit or anything, but even compared to other Irish whisky it doesn't cut it for me. I'd much rather have Red Breast or Connemara any day. It's good for an Irish Coffee though.</br>  <br>Get 750 old grandad.</br>  <br>Honestly, I can't see any difference between JDs and some other shitty American bourbon. All the same pisswater mate.</br>  <br>If it's between Maker's and Wild Turkey, choose Maker's.</br>  <br><br>bulleit rye</br></br>  <br> one of the worst bourbons on the market <br> calling people plebs </br></br>  <br>Does Monkey piss get you high?</br>  <br>I too, see that you have an opinion</br>  ask the liquor store if they have any offers on to save some money if your asking /b/ you don't have great taste anyway  <br> knob creek <br> anywhere higher than midtier <br><br>It's like you guys don't even whisky.</br></br></br></br>  Watkins Select.  <br>Weighing in on Makers</br>  Maker's Mark is shit  <br>All whisky is meant to be drank at room temperature (69F-72F/20-21C).

NO ONE CARES ABOUT SOME SMELL BABOON FACED FILTHY NIGGER  <br> anon never existed <br>this</br></br>  <br>B-but the news.. It says that it's a group.<br>Seriously though I think the whole anon thing was a weapon that was good for one battle. Now it's just a propaganda point. An army without a leader or soldiers that can be used to support any retarded idea.<br>Wait for it, next 'Anonymous supports Hillary 140,000%' will be a thing.</br></br></br>  /b/ is just a trash dump. anon has moved on and away from this bullshit. anon knows real power. /b/ is just stuck as a 20 year old white guy who is sexually confused and frustrated...but actually 45 years old and fat with crooked broken glasses. <br><br>anon has nothing to do with this shit hole.</br></br>  Even when analmoose was a thing it was just a bunch of kids shitting around on the Internet<br><br>Fuck Chanology and what it did to imageboards</br></br>  Anonimoos is real.

Because anonymous never made any collective decisions.<br><br>News media just made it into the l33t h4cker group story that everyone eats up.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, that's the point. Its almost perfect. But when you look at the big picture the odds of someone being hung in their cell by (presumably) a police officer is insanely low, not to mention that there are hundreds if not thousands of better choices. Mix that with the fact that she recently said something like "now they use guns instead of ropes" just makes it obvious that she planned this. Though I would think it was a spur of the moment thing rather than something she planned for months.

If I could erase anything from the history of the internet it would be Chanology, that was what ultimately convinced SJWs that anonymous was some kind of hive of socially conscious edgelords. I seriously want to punch anyone who even owns a Guy Fawkes mask.<br><br>Maybe we should just make Anonymous the new ebaumsworld, just star doing crazy destructive shit and blame it on them and Reddit.</br></br></br>  <br>ANAMOOSE IS KOMING</br>  Forget about the anonymous shit or whether or not she killed herself;<br><br>Pig had no right to tell her to get out of the car or to forcibly remove her</br></br>  <br>ugh don't remind me of chanology.<br><br>And actually, that's an interesting thought.

Let's hear it big boy.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Get that cuck shit outta here.</br>  you people should all be gassed w  Trap...Every time I see a trap thread, I just shake my head and laugh.You severely damaged losers are literally the Bronies of /b/. You know, that sub-group of 4chan kids who obsess over the preschool girl show My Little Pony? You probably don't know since all of you pathetic losers are far too busy fapping to cross dressers.<br><br>Why on earth would a group of you no-lives cling heavily to something as sad as this? Is there some sort of mental sickness in you guys? Did you not have a childhood? Do you not have a grasp on reality? How can you allow yourselves to deteriorate to this? At first, I figured it was one lonely kid making these threads and bumping all day while crying in the basement for being such a useless waste of life... but then, I realized this isn't one kid doing this. There are at least fifteen of you in these threads that are getting hard over men(you think they're women with cocks, but the sane know this is genetically impossible.). There isn't any doubt that all of you autists are fat, out of shape, and friendless.<br><br>Is that the thrill you kids get from these threads? Is it the fact that you can laugh and sing and can't even get off of your bed to empty out your piss bottle? Do you not realize that this board doesn't exist for you and your sick fetish? If not, then WHAT THE FUCK IS YOUR FIXATION? I'm speaking for /b/ as a whole, and possibly, your families as well. Just stop. This isn't healthy. Stop now and try to live a regular life. How embarrassed must your family feel when they have to explain to your aunt and uncle that you want to spend you life fapping to fucking men you force yourself to believe are women?<br><br>Just stop already. Quit with the silly threads. OP, delete this thread. Kids, clear your browser history and delete all the files you have of this bullshit.<br><br>I am telling you this because I am empathetic and I care. Please listen to me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy jezus of gets</br>  <br>did she catch feline aids from all the cat licking</br>  <br>life story kek</br>  <br>Can I get some sauce on that copypasta?</br>  <br>shouldn't it be satan of gets</br>  <br>post confirmed traps are mega satan</br>  <br>WINRAR</br>    <br>b trap threads are for fapping<br><br>stop trying to reinvent wheels</br></br></br>  Bump    <br>hormones are drugs made by the human body.</br>  <br>Satan is that you mister?</br>  <br>She was an important character in Harry Potter</br>    this thread needs moar feminine penises  <br>a) Some are fake<br>b) Real ones are still blatantly obvious<br><br>Your dick is gay.</br></br></br></br>    <br>hmmm, i like this one, would fuck this trap to the end of time</br>  <br>Sauce</br>  <br>http://www.ashemaletube.com/videos/<wbr>200344/ruby-travesti-ecuatoriana.ht<wbr>ml<br><br>"girl" in this is pretty good if you don't mind that god damned burrito music</br></br></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>yes become a trap and i shall rein all powers of hell upon you my child <br>the omnibuses really like you slutty boy toys.</br></br>    <br/>  <br>Satan is laughing at how disgusting and base humans are.</br>  <br>Looked like a man through all his pictures.</br>  rate me guise  <br>Nice get, back there in the 15th century with your satan talk.</br>  <br><br>Poor guy</br></br>  am i pretty  <br> circumsized ruined dick <br>aka post op</br></br>  can i trap you bois  <br>yeah, you need to start main veining nurse shark estrogen asap cause ur still masculine af<br><br>great potential though</br></br></br>  YOu're a fucking faggot  can i be a grill  <br>At least ots not a loli thread</br>  hey bee  rate my pretty face  The people defending mental illnesses such as these always throw around words like 'uneducated' and 'ignorant'.<br><br>I could go on about the billions of years our universe has been around, and how everything from the spread of matter from the singularity every atom in it was once part of eventually resulted in our solar system, which resulted in our earth at one point, and with it, at some time millions of years ago, organic molecules. These organic molecules eventually evolved into life as we know it today, through chemical reactions resulting in bacteria/ very small sea life which eventually through natural selection/ 'survival of the fittest' grew larger and left the sea after early amphibians grew legs and survived/ reproduced on land. Now fast forward a bit (just by our monkey ancestors) and you get us, the human beings.<br><br>The male has the XY chromosomes, and the female XX. Everything scientific points to that. Everything in the body is determined by that perfect DNA/ chromosome pair. I can guarantee you scientifically that if you have the XY chromosomes at birth, everything in your body was geared for a male homosapien life, from your reproductive organs &amp; hormones to certain parts of your brain and your skeletomuscular system, even to your nerves and sensory organs. The same goes for the females with the XX chromosomes.<br><br>Now come to the late 20th and ongoing into the 21st century, there's a very current societal culture of people claiming to be the opposite gender. It goes against everything we know about science and biology, but it's a social trend with a massive following and victimisation stigma attached to it in order for society to accept and integrate it to be a norm, and naturally it becomes stigma and 'ignorant' to question this as normal. Kids growing up today are being fed in schools and through the media that this is all normal and perfect, and anybody who says otherwise is a 'hater', 'ignorant', or even a bully.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kek, racism, misogyny and little homophobia but transphobia that's steppin over the line somehow.</br>  i feel beautiful  <br> The people defending mental illnesses such as these always throw around words like 'uneducated' and 'ignorant'. <br><br>But the irony is /b/ is already intolerant, but for some reason transphobia turns them all tumblr.<br><br>Racism, sexism and even a little homophobia is fine somehow.</br></br></br></br></br>  tee hee hay guise    <br> The male has the XY chromosomes, and the female XX.
