This fucking annoys me so fucking much. I thought maybe it was a joke picture for his profile but, it's completely serious. <br><br>ITT: adults unsuccessfully trying to live the dream.</br></br>  He looks pretty badass, probably cooler than you  <br>Why should they? Let them live their stupid lives. You're the loser for worrying so much about what stupid people do.</br>  Lulz. I'm 38 and will never grow old... I'll just get older. When you get to your 30s OP, you will realize that men never grow up We just get older.  It's just so fucking trashy. Ugh.  <br>I'm 23, i know I'm still pretty young and people constantly tell me I act like a kid, because I refuse to take anything seriously.<br>But for real tho, what's the point in worrying about stuff?</br></br>  <br>So are a lot of things, but you can't stop people from doing it, so why spend time thinking about it?</br>  <br><br>Worrying about stuff is pretty important when you put on adult pants and have responsibilities. I would never hire the guy is OP's picture... and it's common for employer to check out the Facebook of soon-to-be-employees.</br></br>  <br>I find that the people telling us we should "grow up" are the people who did just that and are now boring, miserable farts.</br>  <br>What do you know about that guy anyway? Maybe he has a high-paid job or owns a house.</br>  <br>He's probably doing a pretty basic job. DO you honestly think he cares about moving up the corporate ladder or something like that?</br>  <br>Because they look like scum. I just don't understand why people fucking associate themselves with trash like that.</br>   NO_FUN_ALLOWED.JPG   <br> &gt;Why do some adults refuse to grow the fuck up? <br><br>Said no hetero male to another hetero male, EVER.<br><br>You are either female or gay, am I right?</br></br></br></br></br>  Define grown up.  <br> moving up the corporate ladder <br>is not really an achievement of any merit.</br></br>  <br>They probably look at you and say the same thing since you seem like such an asshole. You think you're better than that guy, but he probably works hard and just wants to have some fun when he's not providing for his family.</br>  <br><br>Go back to your low level recruitment job please and leave the real employers with some dignity.</br></br>  <br>I'm 38, got tats, wear my ball caps backward, and I got a big dick, big bank account, fuck mad bitches, and I don't give a sugar frosted fuck that you think I'm immature. I'll be sure to think about you when I take my boat out on the fuckin Lake this weekend ya fuckin pleb.</br>  <br>Neither, I'm just not garbage and don't understand why people choose to present themselves like that. I'm taking in the answers people are paying and everything. ..I'm just still astounded by how trashy some people can be.</br>    <br>You can have fun and not simultaneously look like trash while doing it. So I don't understand where you're going with that.</br>  Here's some OC. Dude deleted this the morning after and changed his picture to a noble shot of him sitting on a couch like a good kid. <br><br>I'm starting to think there's a severe amount of autism in my city that's going unchecked.</br></br>  <br> &gt;Neither <br>I dont believe you.<br><br>You are either female or gay, or you have been so strongly influenced by them and have modelled yourself off their behavior that you ended up thinking and acting like one.<br><br>Your attitude is completely antithetical and abhorrent to male hetero broship.<br><br>Men don't judge each other like this. We understand that all of us are still kids inside, and we are ok with that.<br><br>I pity you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe that's his idea of fun is what I'm saying. And you don't have to associate yourself with people like that since you're obviously too cool.</br>    be 31 <br>growing up is overated</br>  <br>I bet you think observing another mans appearance makes you gay, amirite?<br><br>Enjoy the summer while you can babe.</br></br></br>    <br>observing it doesnt.<br><br>making judgements about "maturity", do.<br><br>this is something you will never understand about being a hetero male bro.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That new superman tat with the new house glyphs is the shit. I was thinking about getting one. Why does that make me trashy? Nobody sees my tats at my job, and I'm an engineer working in a corporate environment with a ridiculous salary. So I'll say it again, I don't give a sugar frosted fuck about what people like you think. My shit is tight.</br>   Be me 29 <br> Playing vidya and doing nothing all day <br> Collect 1000$ from welfare each month + medical insurance paid + rent paid <br> Make people rage every day when they learn about my situation <br><br>Totally living the dream OP.<br><br> inb4 you don't make 1000$ + insurance + rent with welfare. <br><br>Well, everbody doesn't live in that shithole you call your country, anon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Something you'll never understand about stereotypes. They exist. Please go back to Tumblr with your equal human rights bullshit.</br>  <br>Thank you for conforming that you do indeed have a professional appearance and care what your corporate environment thinks of you, idiot.</br>  <br>don't just drift through life bro. take initiative and make something of yourself.</br>  <br> &gt;Something you'll never understand about stereotypes. They exist.  <br><br>Yes.<br><br>You proved that.<br><br>Its clear you fit the stereotype of a female or homo, and do not understand what being a hetero male bro means. At all.<br><br>Hetero guys don't give a shit about the inane shit you do. We don't go around judging each others "maturity".</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yet here you are judging.</br>  <br>Shit nigga, I act all a fool when I'm not at work. That doesn't mean anything. I'm just smart enough not to act all a fool at work. I learned a long time ago that you don't shit where you eat. That's why I earn 6 figures. Thing is tho, you don't know shit about dude in that pic. You think he looks trashy and he's garbage because he has tats and wears a ball cap backwards and what you may not know is he could be a fucking lawyer or doctor, or in my case an engineer, making bank. But he's considered trash because he posts pics with no shirt in tats on fb. Who's the fucking idiot again?</br>   being this autistic <br><br>I tip my fedora to you OP</br></br>  <br>You're ignoring parts of his post you don't want to read.<br>You cannot argue against someone's cropped quotes.</br></br>  <br>nigger?</br>  <br> complaining that people won't grow up <br> doesn't read a few sentances <br><br>Pot, kettle.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Im observing that you are not a hetero male.<br><br>I'm not judging you, just pointing out what you are not.</br></br></br>  <br> Be me with guy friend <br> Just sucked his dick for lulz <br> Goin to movie cause bored <br> He sucks my dick in theater for lulz <br> Total brosuck though <br> Both hetero n we know it n thats all that matters <br> Fucking Justin Beiber comes on screen for new singing movie thing <br> "Uh I simply dislike the manner in which this young star took his opportunities and wasted them like a young child" says my friend <br> "Horey shit! Fuck off you female faggot!" I say. <br> What kind of bro comments on another bros maturity! <br><br>Seriously, try to keep your opinions to yourself as you get into junior and senior year, especially if you talk how you type. <br>It'll give the bullies less to work with. <br><br>Also when someone asks what color the sky tell them to look up, dont scoff in their face and make some maximum autismo snide comment, its cringey. <br><br>Also<br><br><br>Obvious samefag</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>try again</br>  <br>That was some gay ass shit you just posted bro</br>  <br> especially if you talk how you type. <br><br>look at how you type.</br></br></br>  <br>Answer my question you feculent maggot</br>  <br>See that index finger on his left hand? That is the thing he should be most ashamed of in this pic.</br>  <br>What question?<br><br>There is not a single question put to me in your post here:<br/></br></br></br>  <br>Thats the problem dude. Why do you even care about the private life of your workers? As long as they show good working spirit and competence it doesnt fucking matter how they look, dress or what they think is fun. Even if he looks like this at home and publicly shares it on facebook, nobody should give a fuck about it as long as he is professional in a working environment.</br>  <br>Find any question mark you haven't addressed and kindly answer them faggot.</br>  <br>There is not a single question put to me in the post.<br><br>Are you mentally deficient somehow?</br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure you're a troll.</br>  <br> &gt;nobody should give a fuck about it as long as he is professional in a working environment. <br><br>this would be true of hetero males.<br><br>women and homos however give a great deal of shit about how someone behaves OUTSIDE the working environment, as well as in it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>When you make enough money so that it matters then you can decide what others do. Until then and it's clearly not now, you can piss the fuck off, I can behave however the fuck I want as long as I produce for my employers. <br><br>Get over it faggit.</br></br></br>  <br>So you still live a t home, have never had sex, are to fat to find your penis to masturbate, you have no job, your poor dear mother pays for every thing, and the trailer that you, and your mother live in leans from side to side depending on where you are in it. Got it.</br>  <br><br>People like this faggot, OP?</br></br>  Just turned 30.<br> house is paid off <br> cars are paid off <br> kid is paid off. JK. He's super smart and behaved. Great kid.  <br> wif is behaved as well <br><br><br>The whole point in being an adult is doing what you want, whenever you want, and not caring about other people's opinions. If you made it to adulthood and forgot this, you're doing it wrong. <br><br>I do what I want. I buy Legos by the stack. Thousands of dollars per year. I have an arcade cabinet in the living room, play vidya from NES to PC with my son. Eat burgers whenever I want. Ice cream for breakfast. And I fuck bitches on the side with my wife. Most days, I never even put on pants.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>alteast he doesn't spend his days stalking people's facebook pages and then coming to /b/ whining that they are not "mature"</br>  <br>You should check out model rockets, those are fun as fuck, especially if you just launch engines at shit.</br>  <br>lol</br>  <br>you sound kind of butt hurt by that</br>  <br>Really? How are you sure I'm a troll and not just a dude calling out your fuckin bullshit.</br>  <br> alteast he doesn't spend his days stalking people's facebook pages and then coming to /b/ whining that they are not "mature" <br><br>that's describing you, fyi.</br></br></br>  The sad thing is this, so many people are so PC that they've gone into faggit zone. Before 9/11 friends and I used to launch model rockets and do all kinds of shit right in the middle of NYC and it was all in fun.<br><br>Now the unfortunate thing is that doing the same shit would be considered terrorist activity and our kids have their hands tied by a bunch of whiney ass hollywood faggits.</br></br>  <br>Will do. <br><br>My uncle and I were supposed to do that when I was a kid, but then he ran off with his Secret Family. My phone auto capitalized secret family. It didn't do it the second time. HOW DOES IT KNOW.</br></br></br>  <br>Launch Big Bertha and see where it goes m8.</br>  <br>Lawl, so by asserting myself, you take from it exactly the opposite of what I said. Enjoying summer vacation newfriend?</br>  <br>Let her fly!</br>  <br>its a person who stalks facebook pics and is greatly disgusted at the "immaturity" they see there.<br><br>not really surprising is it.</br></br></br>  <br> The whole point in being an adult is doing what you want, whenever you want, and not caring about other people's opinions. <br>/thread</br></br>  <br>Why are you racist against people with low IQ? There are people with IQs from across the Bell curve, with 50% of people below 100 IQ. Some people even have 80 IQ. So what if they have low IQ and act exactly as they should, you are just intolerant and ignorant for not understanding that, and for thinking all humans are equal.</br>    <br>Niggers aren't a race, they're a different species you dumb nigger. You're trying to make excuses for the niggers that you're part of.</br>  <br>lego are pretty cool, I'm not as rich as you nor have my own family but I kinda... know that feeling</br>  <br>ITT: More fucking ISIS doctrine.<br>Girls shouldnt wear short skirts, adults shouldnt look like this, people shouldnt drink so much.<br>Honestly for a bunch of young kids you really are the most prudish stuck up bunch of miserable cunts</br></br></br>    <br>my money's on him letting go of the slide and then immediately pulling the trigger after.</br>  <br><br>Just sayin, there are many white people who have low intelligence, they most likely had parents whom both also had low IQ, because intelligence is genetic. So when you have accept there are 2% of whites who have 80 IQ, you should recognize they do not act their age and that of a very young immature person.</br></br>  <br>God I hate people like that OP. I mean there's "young at Heart", and then there is acting like a child. My wife's older brother is like that. He is 48 all most 49, and still works at the gas station he was working at after high school. All his money goes to weed, clothing, and parts for his car. I mean it wouldn't be so bad if he was a manager, but he isn't. He "claim" that they will not promote him to an assistant manager because the owner just doesn't like him, but I really doubt that. Ok like last week he "borrowed" from his mom all most $2000 to pay his rent, and bills but he some how ended up with a new Xbox1, Samsung tv, and blue ray player 3 days later. When my wife asked him about it he said "Oh I made the money up at work." Really He mad that much working part time for under $9.27 an hour. All he ever does is try to get us to "loan" him money, when my wife and I have bills we have to pay, so he can go to "A work related training trip to Vegas." or what ever lie he thinks will work. The man(child) Stays out late, has been know to show up to work drunk, and complain if he has to work more than 25 hours a week. With the money he has wasted over the years he could have paid off his car. But he would rather just spend money trying to impress 19 year old girls that he is cool, and that he has money, when in reality he lives in a 1 room apartment, and drive a 99 dodge neon.</br>  <br>IQ and "maturity" are not related.</br>  <br>are you homo or female?</br>  <br>I am with you sir, I am for the first amendment and I support free speech and freedom. It also does not bother me when young drivers rice out their cars. Not a little. I don't care what other people do with their monies, their cars, how they dress or how they act. I say let them do what they want under the freedom of the constitution. Say no to oppression and tyranny.</br>  <br>You've got me beat. Most of my sets are "investments" and I pull from the stash for my kid's birthday or Christmas. I sold my Super Star Destroyer and a couple other sets for a G. Spent it all on more Legos. I've got like 5 Slave Ones piled behind my couch.</br>  <br>Like I said you sound a little butt hurt by what I said. Like maybe it hits a little close to home. Maybe you are a fat, lazy man child with no job, and no real hope of ever getting laid.</br>  <br>You're a nigger by calling what you consider isis as something more like il or better daesh. <br><br>By calling them isis you're giving them credence and the legitamicy of a state and they're not a state. That faggot terrorist orginanization of daesh hasn't been recognognized by any legimate nation or group of nations such as the UN as a state, so stop calling it a state. <br><br>That's the first step to killing it. Stop recognizing it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Good story anon, I can relate, I know of low IQ people in real life also. I say let them learn from their own actions and beliefs. They must be held accountable for all the bad decisions and evil acts they commit.</br>  <br> &gt;Maybe you are a fat, lazy man child with no job, and no real hope of ever getting laid. <br><br>or maybe im a trim, healthy, active man with a good job and education and who gets laid regularly by women i meet.<br><br>that would collapse your narrow universe, wouldn't it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm 38 also and you are correct.</br>  <br>nobody gives a fuck what they are called.<br><br>its not legitimizing anything.</br></br></br>  <br>The day I can't pull a 19 yo hottie... Getting old has its disadvantages. <br><br>Remember how gross it was when chicks in high school or just out of it would date men in their 30s or so?<br><br> That feel when you've become that guy. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Enjoying summer vacation newfriend? <br><br>Yeah it's nice to be able to go on vacation with my family this time of year. Next week I'm taking my kids to the coast. My wife found a good deal on a beach front condo in Port Arthur</br></br></br>  <br>Not all of us want to get laid for the sake of getting laid by some random chick. When you get a bit older and wiser and fucking random bitches with no meaning is done you'll realize that you might have lost love in there. That's really the point and something sandniggers forgot long ago.</br>  <br>you are the epitome of a FAGU<br> FAKE.ASS.GROWN.UP <br><br>Growing the fuck up is a matter of being responsible and accountable and besides that just being yourself. I imagine faggots like you come across things you consider "childish" and have a semi panic attack not understanding why you are getting enjoyment. Like a faggot who wont admit it but loves trannys. You are the worst type of people and I ignore people like you anytime I can</br></br></br></br>  <br>I disagree. That's you and that's me, I won't call them isis, daesh or il at best. I wont put state in their name since they're not a state.</br>  <br>I mostly see trailer trash people hang out with other trailer trash people. They are always loud in public and arguing, not caring at all that everyone can hear them scream and curse at other. You can read their facebook posts and literally see how stupid they are. IQ and Google did statistics and measured people by how intelligent and educated they are, just by their likes and groups on their list.</br>  <br>I'm 35.<br><br>I've not yet met a woman I want to spend my life with.<br><br>There is nothing more to it than that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> nobody gives a fuck what they are called. </br>  <br>how old are you and do you pull 19 year olds?</br>  <br> My wife's older brother is like that <br><br>i think he's a dude, but nice b8 m8</br></br></br>  <br>then why does he act like a fucking homo/femanon<br><br>he's describing a shit guy with borderline criminal behavior.<br><br>has nothing to do with "maturity".</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How is OP superior? Tell me how you are so accomplished.</br>  <br>No not really. But I'm still going to call you fat.</br>  <br>About the same, and have met one but was too stupid to marry her. Don't make the same mistakes that I've made. Have some fun in life. <br><br>The fact is the older one gets the harder it is to meet hot chicks, that's just a fact.</br></br></br>  <br>but you are wrong.</br>  <br> <br>But women and homos are denied professionalism in the workplace by hetero+males, clearly. Madmen is a testament to the overall attitude, now deep seeded in thought, and carried out through acts like rape, stalking, basically anything creepy or generally wrong. <br>There never was equality in the workplace, so stop acting like our reality today reflects as such.</br></br></br>  <br>wat</br>  <br>That's why we will not let him in our house, or use our cars, lend him money. I mean I have a good ojb, and so does my wife but the point is that he needs to take accountability for his own actions. He has to grow up.</br>  <br>Yes they do. Especially the islamic cunts, if you call them a state when they're not a state they'll consider themselves to be one when they're not. <br><br>They really don't understand what our allied nations are capable of and don't remember WW II. They don't want that and we don't want that so stop calling them something that they're not you warmongering faggit!</br></br></br>  Heartily agree OP. I don't care if you're into weird retarded shit but if you can't act like an adult then you deserve no respect. A guy in my social circle genuinely has the emotional and social maturity of a 12 year old. He's 24 and spends 90% of his free time playing computer games by himself whilst his disabled girlfriend cleans and does chores. He is pretty much incapable of having a conversation, most of his interactions consist of him listing of shit he's excited about in games. He can't take any criticism without screaming like a retard, swearing and or throwing shit. He's been known to scream at his girlfriend in public too. I can't fucking stand the fact that social retardation has become semi-accepted in society.  <br>Ppl like why we got fatties and trannys running around everywhere<br>Stop trying to hipster so hard</br></br>  <br>I'm 38, and am banging 2, 20-25 year olds. <br><br>Getting younger girls is easy.</br></br></br>  <br>you've never traveled abroad even once, have you</br>  <br><br>The fact is, the older and poorer you get, the harder it is to meet hot chicks. lol pleb.</br></br>  <br><br>I'm 30 now, and she's 20 now. She's long distance and I'm not paying air fare to "hit dat". She's for the D. Her and the wife even flirt and sext. Known her since she was 18. I really should make some effort to get sexual with her, but I have a 30 minute radius rule, and she's definitely passed that. <br><br>My no 2. Is 24 now. I've had her for 3 years now. If polygyny was legal, I'd put a ring on that finger.</br></br></br></br>  What alternatives are there to growing up and working 9 to 5(+30min pause)?  <br>Shit son how you juggle 4 girls like dat</br>  <br> just being yourself <br>This is the main thing imo. Being generally responsible and accountable is really important but everybody has minor slip ups every now and again. But just being happy with who you are and not giving a fuck what anybody else thinks means you've made it.</br></br>  <br>They're not denied anything, they just want special prividges because their women or lisping faggits. Look, if I have to deal with a lisping faggit in the workplace I'll probably crack up laughing.<br><br>They worry too much about "muh rights" and shit and not about getting the job done. That's the fuckin' issue. Some lisping faggit, especially an H1B one will never write as well professionally as I do or have done, that's a fuckin' fact, jack!</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;wif is behaved as well <br><br>As far as you know.</br></br></br>  <br>has nothing to do with "maturity".<br><br>the guy sounds like he has emotional and psychological problems.<br><br>i don't consider you to be a "mature" person either.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't concern yourself, it's gender studies gibberish.</br>  <br>Well post a pic with a time stamp buddy. Only way to prove that you are not a fat ass.</br>  <br>Why should I, the USA is a beautiful nation, why should I expose myself to sandniggers?</br>  <br>I bet that you've never travelled around the USA, have you?</br>  <br>One is 20, the other is almost 25. <br><br>The 20 year old is essentially my slave, and does whatever I tell her. So, she has no say in me fucking other girls. The other girl doesn't know I have a slave. The 20 year old has daddy issues, and wants me in control. The almost 25 year old is a good girl who just likes the sex.</br></br></br>  <br>not really just sounds like an man in his mid to late 30s to me</br>  ITT:pic related  <br>Mate i was making fun of your shit english<br>I dont give a fuck about your lie</br></br>  <br>And yours is so much better, Limey?</br>  <br>nobody is bothered about being called a limey in the UK you stupid cunt</br>  <br> I'm 38, and am banging 2, 20-25 year olds. <br><br>Yeh deffo son</br></br></br>  <br>If growing up means having to abandon what makes you happy just to gain the approval of other people, I'd rather never grow up. There is a saying that being well adjusted in a profoundly sick society is no measure of health.</br>  <br>hang on, are you saying you get <br>1000$ + insurance + rent with welfare<br>for sitting on your ass?<br><br>if so, how do you sleep at night knowing you owe your parasitic life to hard working people while you get fat and depressed?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you lose</br>  <br>She was a slut when I was out of town on a job. <br><br>Made her sleep with the dogs. Also got the belt and other things. She seemed to get off on it, to be honest. Basically to remain in this relationship I own her. I almost wish she didn't like it, but I know that's just spite. Like I said, everything is paid off, we have a kid, top tier sex life, and she's indebted to me eternally. I could leave her, lose half my shit, and let some other guy have access to my kid, or I can come to terms with the fact that all women are untrustworthy whores and deal with it. <br><br>I don't want to have to train a new wife, especially in my 40s, 50s, or 60s...<br><br><br>You can either be alone by yourself or with a woman in your life. Your call.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>haha high elf/10</br>  <br>Ok so your not fat, but do you have a job? Do you own, or pay your own rent?</br>  <br>Nice photochop, do it on pic related</br>  <br>Fuck off spouting shit about your fat wife you 30 somthing neckbeared</br>  <br>Just remember that you'll be 30something someday too, wont that be funny when little kids are making fun of you?</br>  <br>wheres your pic with timestamp<br><br>deliver, as I did</br></br></br>  <br>Getting angry at these types of people is never actually beneficial. The thought you really have to have is does that lifestyle suit you? Fuck em. With working, volunteering or earning your way you meet people, see places and get more out of life. I know sure as hell i'd rather work, get stressed, have work parties, feel good when I get promoted. <br><br>People who live off benefits live an empty lifestyle. I have many friends who do it and really isn't "the life" they all brag about.</br></br></br>  <br> This so much. I climbed the ladder in the aerospace biz starting in engineering. Got close to the top at the 4th place I took a position at, realized I was surrounded by boring cunts and left it all behind. <br><br>Well into 6 figures, close to a half million in stock options. Cashed in what I had, about $150k, walked.<br><br>Working a low stress job for 70k now, surfing, hanging out with my kids and GF, riding the motorcycle. Starting a side business because fuck corporate life.<br><br>Growing up is for boring fucks and simple minded dollar chasers. There is much more to life.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You didn't deliver, that was an easy internet thing. Do a random pic like this...<br>On the lower right.</br></br>  <br>Wont be on /b/ m8 but atleast your having fun i plan on maturing soon</br>  <br>... pic related hahaha fuck you!</br>  <br>its delivered and legit, timestamp and all.</br>  <br>Not everything is fun. When one gets older people start dying, especially people in family, that's no fun and might not make me grow up gives gives me a reason to drink beer.</br>  <br>Bullshit faggit</br>  <br> i plan on <br><br>Good luck in all your future endeavors. I'm sure everything will turn out as you plan.</br></br></br>  <br>turning 29 and banging an 18 y/o<br> what what!</br></br>  <br>you lose.</br>  <br>Wat</br>  <br>If you have to 'plan' maturing then you're just a fucking idiot. Not the original guy you're trying to burn but you sound like an 18 year old moron who took sociology at uni.</br>  <br>I don't think that you understand the way verification works, we pick the picture, not you. You sign the picture that we pick.<br><br>Get it? Now fuck off back to your mother's basement.</br></br></br>  <br>I mean you're alone regardless. Grammar might not have made that clear. The only person you can rely on 100% is yourself. This is why people have relationships with God. Another entity (non-tangible, but still) that someone can "fully rely on".<br><br>Also, dogs. Dogs won't fuck you over the way people will. <br><br>These Captchas are making me hungry</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sharpie in the pooper and pics to boot!</br>  <br>what the fuck is that even supposed to mean.<br><br>leave. its clear you are either a homo or femanon and slumming it here from tumblr.<br><br>if you wont deliver timestamped pic, you lost.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit anthor one<br>Fuck off</br></br>  <br>30+ /b/tard detected</br>  <br>That means that I've already matured enough to take care of myself, but I'm still myself and always will be regardless of whether I'm making nothing per year or hundreds of thousands of USD per year, the shit doesn't matter once you're still young and people older than yourself start dying off.</br>  <br>21 so you're 9 off. No points or prizes for you i'm afraid</br>  <br>To me, you're the one that hasn't been here for too long. Care for some jenkem?</br>  <br>You're right, OP. He's the one that needs to grow up, not the faggot whining about what others do with their own lives.</br>  <br>i delivered.<br>you did not.<br><br>you lose.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You could be richer if you didn't waste the money you got on over priced plastic</br>  <br>K i believe you brah<br>Im also 21 and not living with my mom but you go kid</br></br>  <br> &gt;Im also 21 <br> &gt;you go kid <br><br>you refer to others exactly your age as "kid"?<br><br>what the fuck is wrong with you samefagging all over this thread.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You delivered spooge up your own asshole you faggit!</br>  <br>Keep believing that and you'll keep being a minimum wage shift worker for the rest of your life you fucking lisping faggit!</br>  <br>I don't need your belief nor do I want it.<br><br>If you think living away from home is an achievement then you're clearly deluded. Thousands of braindeads "live away from home" when they sign over 9k a year debt to themselves.</br></br></br>  <br>you are a pretty sore loser.<br><br>wonder what you are trying to hide when you refuse to deliver a timestamped pic.</br></br></br>    A thread about adults who refuse to grow up devolves into the most embarrassing slap-fight I have ever witnessed on this board.   <br>I'm not debating with you, but it is fun once you get your own place, then it's up to you what to do and when to do it, that comes with responsibilities like paying bills and stuff and that's a good thing.</br>  Why do you all care so much about what other people do? I mean, how does some dude posing on his fb picture effect you in any way? If you have your ideal of maturity and think it's right and super important, than by all means: live that way. But what's the point in hating on people who have another concept of maturity or don't care about it at all?  <br>men don't grow up.<br><br>we just grow old.</br></br></br>  <br>I didn't lose, you're a faggit, no straight human can lose to a cocksucking fagit. By definition, you're useless.</br>  <br><br>I'm 50, you don't need to tell me.</br></br>  <br>you are 21.<br><br>you don't know a fucking thing about life or being "mature".</br></br></br>  <br>Go back to reddit faggot</br>  <br>Maybe.</br>  <br>This faggit is pulling out the go back to reddit card again, just shut the fuck up.</br>  <br>I live in my place and pay my own wages with my partner. I'm moving into my first house out of rented in August. <br><br>Yeah it feels good, but i'd sure as hell wouldn't mind staying at my parents when life was easy.</br></br></br>  <br>I'll tell ya one thing m8, the more the you don't stay with them they more they'll respect you and be there for you if an emergency happens. Look at it from their point of view, they were young once too and likely want some time to themselves once again. It's weird to think of our parents and grandparents and further as being romantic and all but they were doing it way before we were.</br>  <br>let me alone</br>  <br>I have some good normal friends, and I have many friends who are dumb. Like clinically low IQ. One is a black guy, who thinks it is normal to ask people to borrow their cars. He asks people with cars if they can drive it and borrow it. He is a real piece of shit.<br>I let normal people and friends drive my car but I won't let bastard scum destroy my stuff.</br></br>  <br>yuppers... let me alone</br>  <br>I have never moved back - moved out at 19 and I wouldn't go back unless I had to. Having a house that pays itself and food which cooks itself sure is a luxury</br>  <br><br>You had a good example of a stupid person, but I also know this guy, who is 25ish, 6'0 350-400lbs, he is obese! he wears the same clothes everyday, he lives with his parents, who appear to be healthy but they are on disability and get free welfare. his house is disgusting! like the tv show hoarders! It is very gross to me but I know that many people in America choose to live like that. At work, my friend Daniel is totally normal, we talk on the phone all day and he sounds smart and articulate. Many of the garbage human beings to don't bathe at my job sound like completely normal people on the phone. I don't know how to categorize these filthy people who choose to live and act like retarded retards.</br></br>  <br>woow didnt know they had cameras 2000 years ago smh</br>  <br>can you tell us more please? how do you do it? are you not making it all up? can anyone do it? do you live in America? I know some guys who live for free off of social security / disability/ medicare, they play video games all day and go to restaurants and never leave tips. my friends are black by the way. they got free college too but didn't go to class.</br>  <br>Don't take it for granted, I had one in NYC, 3 bedrooms and all kinds of shit that I could afford when my mom and sister decided to move out but I had made enough to keep the place so did. Sometimes shit happens so keep some savings.</br>  <br>It was the crab people!</br>  <br>I am in absolute tears about how you type. Please write a book or something man. I'm imagining you as a bemused but well meaning eastern european.</br>    <br>Most of them can't successfully integrate the "adult" world because of character deficiencies. <br><br>They are rejected by the adult world, but the brain has a lot of tools to make your ego feel better. Denial is a powerful one. <br><br>Thus they think they are rejecting the world because it's "shit" or "fucked up" or whatever, when it is the world who's doing the rejecting.<br><br>Same goes for fat guys who'll say stuff like: "yeah I haven't had a gf yet cause I'm too picky".</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I know people who make about $200/day from idiots on the NYC subway, I don't do that because I'd rather get a regular job and likely make more, but I have nothing against them for doing that.<br><br>If people on the subway want to give folk money then that's their problem not mine, same in Times Square, just wear some current costume and you'll make mint from tourists that want to have pictures taken with you. Just remember, always remember if someone doesn't want to pay, get on with the next thing and don't get weird about it.</br></br></br>  <br>/endthread<br><br>that should be a sticky.</br></br></br>  <br>He sounds like a faggit from howard stern who's become one of the hollywood faggit hypocrite people that he used to make fun of.</br>  <br>Have recently just been approved 133k for a 200k house. Managed to save 60k through selling shit on ebay and working stupid hours overtime but IT overtime pays very well. Bit nervous though that HSBC will have thousands of debt on me though!<br><br>Good luck on your travels, I think you're the first /b/tard who has managed to debate me without going down the &gt;edgyfagit route etc</br></br></br>  <br> the brain has a lot of tools to make your ego feel better. Denial is a powerful one. <br><br>It's not working, anon. I don't know where to go from here.</br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck lame as socialigy nigger suckup class in school did you get that one from? Do you think you'll get paid for that in the real world instead of becoming a pc howard stern faggit?</br>  <br>The old saying is true...the only difference between a boy and a man is the price of his toys.</br>  <br>I'm asking about how a person can abuse the US welfare system, and live off for free such as the majority of black people do. I know many white trash people who get free government housing and free foodstamps, they have many children from many different fathers. Is there a way to live for free of welfare without having to make many children?</br>  <br>I think the way, not that I do it would be to claim all kinds of disabilities and fool the doctors. Then you'd get free disability money. Also since obama is in office claim political oppression or some shit like that, the combination of political oppression and disabilities of course from tourture would make one a proper obama democrat candidate for government assistance.</br>  <br>Also claim to love obama so that you might likely vote for someone in his party. That'll help you to get assistance from the current federal government.</br>  <br>Ahahahaha... you think you have it so great. I hope you enjoy being broke with no way to improve your situition. What do you say when you meet new people and they ask you about your life? <br><br>Uhhh, I Uhhh... sit on my ass and don't equate to shit. I have just enough money to feed my doritos and mountain dew habit.</br></br></br>  <br>I like getting free things for free without having to work for it.</br>  <br> What the fuck lame as socialigy nigger suckup class  <br><br>I hate sociology you gigantic faggot. <br><br>My post seems to have resonated with you, though. Ironic that you'd revolt against it while at the same time illustrating what denial is.</br></br></br></br></br>  What are you commie? What someone wears or does is not your problem. Some people have weird fetish of dressing up as babies some others like bdsm. What people do in the privacy of their house is not government or anyone business. Moan about Isis or someone doing something negative  <br>weird thing about real life, I know a bunch of deadbeat guys who have girls. I mean, some of the girls are fat and or not very attractive, but my perpetual jobless friends still get poontang. I know this one black guy has this fat white girl paying everything for him, cell phone and clothes and he drives her car. What do these guys tell girls?</br>  <br>Free shit is funny but back to the point of the bread, someone has to pay for it. Maybe pay for your own shit instead of others?<br><br>Just sayin'.</br></br></br>  <br>Those $15 an hour niggers better shut the fuck up. They all gonna get fired and Mcdonalds use robots and retards to do the work.</br>  <br>You responded to the wrong anon</br>  Saying someone is "immature" or telling people to "grow up" is really just a secret way that bigots complain about how other people are different from them.<br><br>Do they still wear diapers? Play with toy fire trucks? Sleep with a night light? No, they just dress and act differently.<br><br>As far as I'm concerned if you support and/or raise a child, you're an adult. Any other criteria used to judge their "maturity" is pointless.<br><br>So what, you don't like some dude's style? Well you can get fucked, because you ain't all that.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>what the fuck are you actually trying to say?</br>  <br>A question. How does one go about defining these character deficiencies? I mean, I know that the world is rejecting me and I don't have the luxury of denial, so the only option is to fix it. I'm 27 so I don't think it's too late to find a way into the adult world, I just need some direction.</br>  <br>They'll stuff oreos in their folds of fat for a quick fuck and $2k</br>  Choice. People who are billionaires abuse taxes too. Corruption is in every country. Stop moaning about welfare cheats and do something positive like help charity or soup kitchen.  <br>Ahh<br>tl;dr YOU ARE A FAGGIT!</br></br>  <br>don't you think having adequate social skills is an integral part of maturity? How can you consider yourself to be an adult if you can't interact with them?</br>  <br>Abuse is a strong word when it's not done flat for everyone and some folk can afford lawyers on the subject and others can't. <br><br>I nice flat tax would sort stuff out pretty quick but there like MJ laws have a lot of entrenched interestes that go along. So understand that part of it.</br></br></br>  <br><br>How are black people getting so much free welfare?<br><br>Why aren't you actively trying to stop all that waste of monies? Do you like paying for taxes and seeing your tax dollars pay for lazy people? What kind of hypocrite tells others to get a job when he doesn't give the same advise to black people. Racist liberal.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Wll yo uchnge muh diapr?</br>  <br><br>I think the concept of maturity is ridiculous. What do I care if someone can't interact socially? As long as they support themselves and/or raise their kids, I couldn't give a millifuck.</br></br>  <br>Because their niggers and a very small part of the population, most white people especially the ones in government controlling that are too scared to tell them to fuck off and get a job and stop being niggers.<br><br>Did you not expect the truth from /b?</br></br></br>  <br> A question. How does one go about defining these character deficiencies? I mean, I know that the world is rejecting me and I don't have the luxury of denial, so the only option is to fix it. I'm 27 so I don't think it's too late to find a way into the adult world, I just need some direction. <br><br>Start by taking a free online IQ test. From that , it will tell you why and how your past failed and assess your current situation. By knowing your IQ, you can customize your life learning more efficiently. By knowing what you can't do, you can start narrowing down on what you can do.</br></br></br>  <br>Because we live in a society and we are social creatures. If somebody comes up to me stuttering and mumbling like a retard, not being able to read the environment etc then I'm not going to consider them my equal.</br>  <br>That's bullshit, you take that shit in NYC in like 9th grade and they don't give you the results. Enough with the fucking tests.

What you call maturity is just your way of pointing out how they are different from you.<br><br>Equal? Who gives a shit. What do you go around constantly rating other people against yourself? I think that's sort of crazy and not too admirable of a trait.</br></br></br></br>  <br>There's different types of maturity. It takes maturity to understand that being fairly socially adept is an important part of adult interactions. Social maturity is a component in an overall mature person.</br>  <br><br>disguised hate speech</br></br>  <br>Who the fuck are you to dictate maturity?<br><br>Pretentious, condescending fascist piece of shit.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm talking about respect, I'm not going to respect them as an adult if they can't interact with people effectively. Maybe you're right, it is a little bit crazy but I do believe it has a logical basis. I suppose my points apply more to situations where there is a potential for a friendship or a relationship, I don't go around judging people I briefly interact with. If I'm really getting to know someone and find out that they are really socially inept/shy then I'm not going to respect them as an adult.</br>  <br>you sound like an autist trying to explain empathy.<br><br>you really have no fucking idea how ridiculous you sound, and how devastatingly badly what you are saying reflects back on you?</br></br></br>  <br><br>So you're saying that social skills aren't an important part of being an adult?</br></br>  <br>so now maturity=respect?<br><br>where the fuck are you pulling this shit out of?</br></br></br>  <br>well I'm not going to respect an adult who isn't mature am I? Jesus fucking christ</br>  <br>Please enlighten me</br>  <br>Fuck off brit, go eat some faggots!<br>This is an American discussion on an American message board!</br></br>  <br>If you really want to get into it at a PhD level here...</br>  <br>Im saying your concept of "maturity" is self-serving and subjective to your own definitions of it.<br><br>Social skills are not a mandatory part of being adult, or even of being human.<br><br>There is no requirement anywhere for that.<br>People can be as asocial as they fucking want.<br>That is not always a bad thing, as long as it does not harm or infringe on others.<br><br>The very fact you have this attitude, demonstrates that you actually don't even have these social skills yourself, and that you dont actually understand what underlies them interms of meaningful and conducive interaction.<br><br>as i said, you sound like an autist trying to explain empathy.<br><br>you have no fucking idea what you are talking about and how wrong you are.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  don't want to grow up. 29 and living the dream  <br> cunt detected, I bet you're a real blast at parties </br>  <br><br>What do you mean exactly by respect? Because, in my opinion, all humans deserve a certain amount of basic respect. Do you mean like admiration? Because that's fine, you can choose whoever you want to admire and it would be ridiculous to say otherwise.<br><br>Myself, I tend to admire people based on actions, and not social interactions. I do not value social skills as much as I do practical skills. I do not enjoy small talk.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't respect you either, due to your fascist attitude.<br><br>And as you can see, neither does anyone else here either.<br><br>So much for your "social skills" and "maturity" you claimed to have, fucking asshole.</br></br></br></br></br>  ITT: young summerfags and beta males over 30 posturing to be more manly than each other...  <br> l <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=gZo<wbr>1We9FJRM</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I say that you're a homosexual you doesn't have a clue except to define his own homosexuality through others lack of acceptance of your immoral ways that you want to push on others.</br>  <br><br>Yes. Not having social skills makes fulfilling adult responsibilities more difficult, but not impossible. It is not any part of the criteria I would use to judge "maturity" or adulthood, which, as stated above, is based more on fulfilling expected responsibilities than how smooth you act in public.</br></br>  <br>What exactly is your opinion? <br>What companies have you worked for and have you ever been paid for your opinion? <br>I suspect that the answers are you're an asshat and no therefore your opinion is meaningless. Get over yourself intern.</br></br></br>  <br>lololol. In engrish please. "you doesn't have a clue" seems right at home in your run on sentence, homophobe.</br>  <br>I'm talking about a complete lack of social skills when acting with other people in a social setting. I feel like I've expressed myself poorly here.</br>  <br>You're just the type of faggit that thinks that anyone that disagrees with it is a "phobe" of some type. How typical. <br><br>You're still a fucking faggit and unacceptable in real society, go lisp somewhere else you fucking degerate, it's too bad that we can't burn you at stakes!</br></br></br>  <br>how did they take that picture 2000 years ago?</br>  <br>Just shut up.</br>  <br>For all of what you say about "social skills" you lack the ability to just shut the fuck up and stop lisping like a fucking faggit.</br>  <br><br>My opinion is as valid as your opinion. Personally I think it's more valid. But I'm biased. At least I'm not a bigot.</br></br>  <br>Space aliens!</br>  <br>I'm gay because you're a homophobe and can't use basic grammar or punctuation.<br><br>Seems legit. Please send a pic of your asshole so I know how much lube I need. I'm guessing it's loose and doesn't need any.</br></br></br>  <br>Then because you have the opinion of a programmed "non-bigot" with no experience in life you must know more. Keep that up and do a dissertation on it. <br><br>Get a job working with McD with some niggers because you "FEEL" them.<br><br>Dumbass idiot.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Older than you, and it's the truth. Keep having fun bro.</br>  <br>You're just a fuckin faggit because you suck cock and take cock in your ass, get over it.</br>  <br>Only Jesus can prevent you from going to hell you fucking faggit!<br>REPENT!</br></br>  <br>What a faggot. Bet you're much concerned with taking off adult pants than putting them on.</br>  <br><br>did I make you angry?<br><br>you sure are acting immature. (based on your own bigoted definition) why can't you just grow up?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Women hit the wall and get all pissy, men get more mellow and cool.</br>  <br>Is it just me or does damn near everyone have that same style facial hair?<br><br>Don't have camera now, but I got this</br></br></br>  <br>Is this person from Missouri? I know the last name and I'm pretty sure I've heard of this particular person before. If so then I'm familiar with his family and they're some batshit crazy motherfuckers. He probably behaves that way because of all the meth he does.</br>  <br>That's how all adult Mexicans look.</br>  <br>damn near everyone here*<br>Fuck</br></br>  <br>nice quads</br>  <br>No, you made me laugh, thanks for that.<br>I'm not acting ya know, what's you're definition, I live on my own and pay my bills as I have done since I was about 20 or so. So I'm the one that's immature?<br><br>How exactly do you define yourself? <br>Your response should make me crack up.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i don't have a "facial hair style".<br><br>this is exactly how it grows.<br>all i do is trim above the lip so its not in my food and every month or so i trim it with the shaver set to the longest setting.<br><br>thats it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks m8</br>  <br>might be one of the ugliest beards/hair combos i have ever seen, congrats</br>    <br>Hey little grill, want some candy?</br>  <br>  I live on my own and pay my bills <br>This really is no indicator whatsoever of maturity<br> &gt;since I was about 20 or so <br>and how old are you now?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Old enough to say if not answering your questions will piss you off then I'm answering shit. Let's just say, you're too inexperienced to say for #1 and for #2, enough.</br>  <br>G-G-Grandpa?</br>  <br>Show me your beard then faget</br>  <br>you might want to trim the scragglies a bit.<br><br>just to keep areas of it all an even length.<br><br>also try brushing/combing it down and along the skin, rather than outwards.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Old enough to say <br><br>Im asking for a specific number.<br><br>Do you have fucking difficulty answering simple and direct questions?<br><br>That is considered a "mature" trait, you know.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>From what EXACT lame ass sociology nigger book do you define maturity now? I know niggers need excuses but what are you attempting to give yourselves now?</br>  <br><br>I define myself as anonymous. Seriously, I could write anything here, and you'd either believe it or not. What is the point of this little "maturity" dick-measuring contest?<br><br>Not sure what your deal is anyway. You've failed to sensibly refute anything from my original post that you had some sort of problem with.<br><br>Whatever. Stay mad, bro.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Naw look at the filename.<br>I combed it out on purpose that day because friends suggested it.<br><br>This is just the quick pic I took to send to 'em.<br><br>Like I said I'd take a pic now but tfw no camera</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm asking first though, why would it matter to you? Are you a faggit?</br>  <br>i think maturity is something only women and homos are concerned with.<br><br>no real hetero guy ever thinks of his or his bros existence in terms of "maturity". <br><br>a man simply does what a man has to do.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So then why ask? Why would the answer matter to you, are you really that stupid?</br>  <br>Nothing wrong with that, but some faggit will try to pick it apart, just wait.</br>  <br>I love it when you talk like that. It makes me hard. Can you send a pic of your face and/or ass so I know which summerfag I'm fapping to?</br>  <br><br>ever hear of something called a rhetorical question?<br><br>don't bother answering.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Bangin!</br>  Let´s share our facebook faps /b/rothers  I´m sharing this brazillian beauty  And another one  Forgot to upload it but here it is  Last one of her  her name op?  <br>Monica santos anon, she has some great dancing vids.

Set in Japan it's all about psychics, possession, demonic entities, and ancient rituals. It's extremely well done, there's foreshadowing for the finale that is present right from the start of the movie, it's one of the few films that I understood the plot much better the second time, and even more was revealed to me on the third time I watched it!<br><br>Ju-On: The original japanese Grudge.
