[ something about trump  Faggotry!  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;627053956 <br>I'm not convinced the SATs are a good test of political qualification; the things they measure aren't insignificant by any means but they don't have a lot of bearing on political qualifications. It's also worth keeping in mind that the average SAT score has gone up over time both on account of score inflation and on account of obsessively rigorous examination. In any case, using that as a standard more or less implies you want people like me to run for public office, and I'm quite sure I'm not qualified.<br><br><br>Yeah, that.<br><br>Switzerland is not a manufacturing economy by any stretch of the imagination and most of the nation's necessities are provided by other countries in the EU.

Ill have you know I graduated top of my class in conflict resolution, and Ive been involved in numerous friendly discussions, and I have over 300 confirmed friends. I am trained in polite discussions and I'm the top mediator in the entire neighborhood. You are worth more to me than just another target. I hope we will come to have a friendship never before seen on this Earth. Don't you think you might be hurting someone's feelings saying that over the internet? Think about it, my friend. As we speak I am contacting my good friends across the USA and your P.O. box is being traced right now so you better prepare for the greeting cards, friend. The greeting cards that help you with your hate. You should look forward to it, friend. I can be anywhere, anytime for you, and I can calm you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my chess set. Not only am I extensively trained in conflict resolution, but I have access to the entire group of my friends and I will use them to their full extent to start our new friendship. If only you could have known what kindness and love your little comment was about to bring you, maybe you would have reached out sooner. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now we get to start a new friendship, you unique person. I will give you gifts and you might have a hard time keeping up.

I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didnât want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. <br><br>He said, âOh, like youâre doing now?â <br><br>I was taken aback, and all I could say was âHuh?â but he kept cutting me off and going âhuh? huh? huh?â and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying. <br><br>The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like âSir, you need to pay for those first.â At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. <br><br>When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually âto prevent any electrical infetterence,â and then turned around and winked at me. I donât even think thatâs a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not like Junko would even consider letting someone as generic as you in~</br>  <br>Watch that...<br>But it is hip though the way people dance now<br>Ya know, you can just,<br>It's called doin' whatever you want to do<br>Just get up, the weed get to ya, just get up an just<br>Throw your arms in the air<br>Watch that...<br>But it is hip though the way people dance now<br>Ya know, you can just,<br>It's called doin' whatever you want to do<br>Just get up, the weed get to ya, just get up an just<br>Throw your arms in the air<br>Watch that...<br>But it is hip though the way people dance now<br>Ya know, you can just,<br>It's called doin' whatever you want to do<br>Just get up, the weed get to ya, just get up an just<br>Throw your arms in the air<br>Watch that...<br>But it is hip though the way people dance now<br>Ya know, you can just,<br>It's called doin' whatever you want to do<br>Just get up, the weed get to ya, just get up an just<br>Throw your arms in the air<br>Watch that...<br>But it is hip though the way people dance now<br>Ya know, you can just,<br>It's called doin' whatever you want to do<br>Just get up, the weed get to ya, just get up an just<br>Throw your arms in the air<br>Watch that...<br>But it is hip though the way people dance now<br>Ya know, you can just,<br>It's called doin' whatever you want to do<br>Just get up, the weed get to ya, just get up an just<br>Throw your arms in the air<br>Watch that...<br>But it is hip though the way people dance now<br>Ya know, you can just,<br>It's called doin' whatever you want to do<br>Just get up, the weed get to ya, just get up an just<br>Throw your arms in the air<br>Watch that...<br>But it is hip though the way people dance now<br>Ya know, you can just,<br>It's called doin' whatever you want to do<br>Just get up, the weed get to ya, just get up an just<br>Throw your arms in the air</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you worthless heretic?

 God damn you, /b/. I fucking hate you. I've been noticing how you've been fucking with my head, making me see memes everywhere, and now it cost me my job.<br>I used to work at a pizza joint called Papa Gino's, which is a chain here in New England. Today, two guys came in, and they were very obviously a couple. Never in my life have I seen people this blatantly gay. Now, I'll be the first to admit that I'm a bleeding heart liberal hippie treehugger commie bastard, and I'm even bisexual myself, but DAMN these two were gay. Everything was going fine, right up until I served them their food. Instead of the usual "enjoy your meal" bit that I usually say, /b/ seized control of my brain.<br>"There you are, guys. Enjoy your AIDS." As soon as that A passed my lips, alarm bells went nuts in my head. But it was too late. I didn't realize what I had just done until I had finished speaking. The two guys just stared at me in shock for a momment, and I went pale. I knew that my days of free pizza and all the Mountain Dew I could drink were over in that one instant.<br>The two dudes go DIPSHIT. My manager comes over, and there's screaming about hate crimes, bigotry, lawsuits, and one of them even stood up and threatened to beat the shit out of me. We got into a fight, and my manager got scared, and said youre moving with your aunte and uncle in bel-air.<br>I whistled for a cab, and when it came near, the license plate said "fresh" and there were dice in the mirror. If anything I could say that this cab was rare, but I thought "naw forget it, yo home to bel-air!"<br>I pulled up to the house about seven or eight and I yelled to the cabbie "yo homes smell ya later!" Looked at my kingdom, I was finally there. To settle my throne as the prince of bel-air.<br>[edit]</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Alright.

For my whole life, I've always wanted people to wrap their lips around my rim and slurp the sticky juice out of me. But not too much. I stand upright everyday, 24/7, to keep my juice from spilling out of me. My family and friends think I'm stupid, but that won't stop me! I know who I am, and no one can tell me otherwise. I've called several plastic surgeons to have a blender implanted inside me, so that I can swallow whole oranges and make juice inside my body. I'm also hoping to get my doctor to convert my urethra into an automatic pulp filtering machine. From now on, please refer to me as "Tropicana". Accept me for who I am.

I was captain of the football team, and starter on my basketball team. What sports do you play, other than âjack off to naked drawn Japanese peopleâ?

I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through." I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because your post gave me cancer anyway.<br>7 commentsshare</br>  <br>Thank you for your kindness Hanzo.<br><br>Wonderful.

Fixed it for you</br></br>  <br>people eat fried gator in the south bro..... it's actually pretty good. Sharks are a delicacy in Japan.... never been to super xenophobic weeaboo paradise, so can't judge. Polar bears.... you got me there.</br>  <br>  never been to Asia <br> never seen the shark fin trade <br> what is shark fin soup <br> people do eat polar bear, If they are crazy enough to fuck with them, same with crocodile <br>Bait/10</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> "It's ok if you want to be vegan, but you should respect my right to eat meat." <br>What if I'm a dick about it? Do I "win"?</br></br>  <br>you are right OP i would much rater eat other humans</br>  I thought white people were already vegetarians.  <br>Domesticated animals were bred and "created" to serve our purposes.<br>If they are not eaten their existence cannot be justified.</br></br>  I'll eat anything stupider than I am. Its basic evolution.  <br>Have you ever gone bear hunting? Probably not, but when you take down a 700lbs black bear from 20 feet away that is getting ready to kill you, you find that it's pretty satisfying. <br><br>Plus, you get a shit load of meat, oil (shit can be used to predict weather), and hide.</br></br></br>  I'll take the bate.... and say this.... the salad you retarded vegan assholes love so much... with such fresh crispy lettuce..... the reason for that is because it's still fuckin alive when you start to eat it... just because a cow has a face doesn't make it any more or less of a life form.... you stupid fucking assholes library fuck sticks  <br>Vegetables are NOT yours.</br>  <br>Nigger.<br>I would love to eat me some fucking Sharks, Polar bears and crocodiles.<br>Who the fuck are you trying to kid?</br></br></br>  <br>*It's</br>  <br>2 of those animals are endangered and must be preserved for future consumption and crocs don't taste good to begin with</br>  <br>Humans are biologically omnivores. It's completely natural for to consume both meat and plant matter. To act as if only one or the other is the only correct option is to deny a basic fact of biology and reality. Humans really are meant to eat both plants and animals.</br>  <br><br><br>False equivalency.<br><br>/thread</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Bad logic considering many people do eat bear and shark.

Happy birthday. The best years of your life are ahead of you. This is coming from someone 10 years older than you - make the most of early adulthood  <br>What's this girls name? Also happy birthday</br>  somehwere, out on this Earth, there are children suffering, wars being fought, trans people fighting for their rights, gender fluid people being misunderstood, Africa is in ruins, Europeans are being eurofags, jews corrupting our youth, and you're happy for being young as fuck?<br><br>But allow me to play doubles advocate here for a moment. For all intensive purposes I think you are wrong. In an age where false morals are a diamond dozen, true virtues are a blessing in the skies. We often put our false morality on a petal stool like a bunch of pre-Madonnas, but you all seem to be taking something very valuable for granite. So I ask of you to mustard up all the strength you can because it is a doggy dog world out there. Although there is some merit to what you are saying it seems like you have a huge ship on your shoulder. In your argument you seem to throw everything in but the kids Nsync, and even though you are having a feel day with this I am here to bring you back into reality. I have a sick sense when it comes to these types of things. It is almost spooky, because I cannot turn a blonde eye to these glaring flaws in your rhetoric. I have zero taller ants when it comes to people spouting out hate in the name of moral righteousness. You just need to remember what comes around is all around, and when supply and command fails you will be the first to go. Make my words, when you get down to brass stacks it doesn't take rocket appliances to get two birds stoned at once. It's clear who makes the pants in this relationship, and sometimes you just have to swallow your prize and accept the facts. You might have to come to this conclusion through denial and error but I swear on my mother's mating name that when you put the petal to the medal you will pass with flying carpets like itâs a peach of cake.</br></br>  <br>Natalie lust</br>  <br>gorergousssssssssssssssss</br>  Whores of Italy      La mogliettina  /B/ros I love here in Bombay (India) 22 years old , bitches here tell me I am ugly AF and never wanna date me I got rejected over 3 times in 3 yeras , I want your advise , am I that ugly and please do rate me out of 10 (be honest )  <br>agreed</br>  <br>I don't doubt you, but Jesus Christo that one cracked me up</br>  <br>yeah pretty much this</br></blockquote>]
