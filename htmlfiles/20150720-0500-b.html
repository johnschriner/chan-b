And besides. We just met. A Duel will not suffice. This is something that I will thoroughly secure. Because Love is what made me a phantom.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because you got me out of hard times. I want you to have this, I also balanced it. Very slow Übercharge rate.

Can't complain!」<br><br><br>「I see I see! Drei is the serious type when it comes to love... I can respect that! Maybe in time a loser like me could prove his worth to you! And as to whether I can handle you, I'll just have to try and find out.」</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ok~!<br> fell asleep on her <br> zzz </br></br></br>  <br>all good</br>  <br>I only mean it endearingly, NTR-sama.</br>  <br>I hate it too now that you point it out.

If you do it right, it will go right in like honey. <br><br>Downshifting is harder.

You could post your exploits in 4chan. Then you could post you address and go out guns blazing in a moment of glory. You could even live stream it so we can see the final shootout.  Will you roll dubs before you die?  <br>dude its a matter of luck and your genetics..ive known old dudes in their 70s and 80s healthy as fuck with 2 packs a day and ive met people that got lung cancer without ever smoking..go figure</br>  <br>lemme check.no</br>  We are all dying u stupid fuk  <br>You can smoke 3-5 cigarets a day with no real risk.</br>  <br>He's dying harder and faster than u nigger</br>  <br>No problem there.

I've read two a week, but I'm not even sure that I believe that. It's a retarded thing to argue about though. Smoking is detrimental with absolutely nothing good in exchange. Just don't do it. Or if you already do, quit. Try Chantix, worked like a charm for me.</br>  <br>Longcat is loooooong</br>  <br>Have you ever had a masturbatory fantasy involving your sister?</br>  <br>why not just replace the longs with too 3dprinted ones?</br>  <br>i dont have it in me anon..ive got a pretty cool family,,i would not want my daughter remembering me for torturing or killing..the world is fucked up enough as it is,,,,,i would on the other hand want to have an orgy with tons of weed and latina s</br>  <br>lol'd at this</br>  Shine on OP.<br><br>If there's a fucking afterlife, smoke a bowl with syd!</br></br>    <br>this guy tho</br>  <br><br>i already did bro..already did</br></br>  <br>Not really, you can smoke 60 cigarettes a day and not get cancer and die of a stroke at 80.<br>Or you can smoke 2-5 a day and get cancer when you're 30.<br><br>Anyway, why smoke; there are so many better drugs out there?<br>Anxious? Benzos!<br>Depressed. in pain or just bored of life? Opiates!<br>Trying to get a new perspective on things? Psychedelics!<br>Want to feel like you're on top of the world? Cocaine!<br>Want to stay up all night masturbating/reading/studying? Speed!<br>And much much more.<br><br>All cigarettes do is give you a small nicotine rush when you start smoking then the rest of it is just smoking to stave off nicotine and MAOI withdrawals.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>because you're probably beta as fuck m8</br>  <br>just a little</br>  <br>spoiler alert:<br> there isn't </br></br>  <br>i used to steal panties</br>  <br>After the first time I did weed I never smoke a cigarette again. It was just sooo boring.</br>  <br>Fuck Heroin is actually safer than cigarettes.<br>The only problem with Heroin is purity, bad cuts and money. Problems caused by the so called war on drugs.<br><br>Make _everything_ legal and deaths due to drugs would go down. The only problem would be that the booze and cigarette industry would lose a _lot_ of customers.<br><br>Fucking politicians, they'd rather do what keeps them in office rather than what's right.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>you guys are too rude for pics i fear the judgement more than i fear death</br></br>  <br>no sisters but ive jacked off to a first cousin..close enough?</br>  <br>OP here...im listening....</br>  What do you feel like doing with your life in the last days/weeks/months ?  <br>If everyone just became a druggie the world would go to absolute shit for everyone</br>  <br>then what is there??? maybe an alternate life??</br>  <br>Nothing.</br>  <br>Nothing that we know of<br> spooks </br></br>  <br>Nice dubs.</br>  <br>honestlyi dont have many options ..i will most likely be bed ridden and on drugs,,but before i reach that stage i want to travel a bit mostly europe..but most likely i wont..</br>  <br>but nothing is something..</br>  <br>It's a concept we can't wrap our minds around<br>sucks, right</br></br>    <br>Thats you OP?<br><br>Nice hair bretheren!</br></br></br>  So i'm starting dole work (forced labor to receive tax payers money) in roughly 7 hours because i'm a broke 20 yo.<br><br>The thing is my anxiety fucks up big time whenever something job related happens so I can't exactly sleep atm and I really don't know what to do without completely screwing myself over.<br><br>Any advice or whatever people can say that might help would be appreciated.</br></br></br></br>  <br>UK or Aus?<br>You know that shit is not mandatory, right? You can say no and they cannot sanction you.</br></br>  Aus, They just rolled out all this new law/management shit so they had to send me to one of the job sites and make me do 25 hours a week of work otherwise they can fuck with my payments all they like which would end up making me homeless.  <br>Unlucky.. in the UK many "advisors" try to tell claimants it's mandatory and it MAY effect their benefits if they do not, a few tried it on me when I was claiming on another note just get a fucking job</br>  Where I live it's fucking impossible if you haven't been working since you were like 16 or can actually stick with something and not bitch out after a week. I need to see a doctor but even trying to call them makes me anxious so I have to hopefully git gud or i'm fucked.  <br>Grow some balls, you think you're the first person to have to work through social anxiety? It gets easier and easier. Man up, Bitch.</br>  <br>tell them you are seeing a doc for anxiety problems and you wont have to work.</br>  I agree I have to grow up like it will only get harder not being able to actually make a living and they know I need to see a doctor they just want me doing something so they can get paid.  Get a job and quit being a faggot  Point taken i'll bug my friends to see if they got any work for someone with a very limited work history.  <br>Holy shit, twenty-five hours' work.<br><br>You poor snowflake.</br></br></br>  Closest I have gotten to work is stacking shelves 3 years ago so yeah it is a bit of a hard transition for a guy who just plays vidya games all day.  <br><br>where r u doing ure work for the dole?</br></br>  St Vincent De Paul, normal warehousing stuff and hey I get a free police check.

Animals in zoos would be changing into new animals. <br><br>Obviously this isn't happening.</br></br>  this is not how it works, this isn't how any of this works.  You would see these things if you looked up from your bible.  <br>i know this is shit bait, but dumb people actually do think this way, sadly</br>  You're right! You've disproved atheism and evolution, I am now converted! Praise Christ!  <br>religions = all the same</br>  <br><br>summer plz go</br></br>  Evolution affects an entire population, so no.  Please kill yourself  You can see different kinds of humans, what about asian people, or latin people? It all depends on where we were born and raised, on our geographic zone<br><br>And you can't see animals on zoos changing into new animals for two reasons: <br><br>1- They don't need anything more so they can survive<br>2- Evolution can last more than 3,000 years just to change a color or just to become taller or smaller</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>much respect for your quads but you're wrong<br>a single religion isn't even uniform. a gnostic and a contemplative christian and a baptist and a mormon aren't anything alike.</br></br>  This faggot is the manager of the Port Charlotte Florida Walmart.

You're obviously autistic. Where's your handler? Are you even allowed to be on the computer?</br>  <br>Not my manager.
