STOP FAPPING TO TRANNIES AND LISTEN FOR A MOMENT<br>Obama just signed a law allowing him to fast track TPP and other "trade agreements", allowing him to accept it with just a simple majority.<br> What is the TPP? <br>The Trans-Pacific Partnership is a disastrous trade agreement designed to protect the interests of the largest multi-national corporations at the expense of workers, consumers, the environment and the foundations of American democracy. It will also negatively impact some of the poorest people in the world.<br>Here are the list of nations that will be affected by the TPP:<br>United States, Japan, Mexico, Canada, Australia, Malaysia, Chile, Singapore, Peru, Vietnam, New Zealand and Brunei.<br> TPP threatens fair use <br>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/<wbr>08/new-leaked-tpp-puts-fair-use-ris<wbr>k<br>From chan culture to youtubers, this could make bethesda's paid mods something you'd call "good old times".<br> TPP will allow a corporation to sue a state over potential losses caused by its legislation <br>This won't happen in a court of your own country, this will place an international court above your laws. Consumer rights, from food to your favourite hobby, will be raped mercilessly. Think it's bad now? You haven't seen anything.<br> TPP will make it easier to outsource labor in asia <br>From governmental contracts to code monkeys trough services, you will be competing with third-world slave labor and buying its products. Should you be able to afford it and have some free time as your working hours get closer to those of Vietnam<br> AHAHAH I will still be pirating stuff anyway <br>No you won't. TPP can force your ISP to monitor your activity, and fine you or even send you to jail. It will be possibile to fine you even just for copying a DVD you own to your hard drive. It's SOPA and all that shit right back from the dead.<br><br> TL;DR WE STOP THIS SHIT NOW OR NO MORE MEMES, NO MORE 4CHIN, NO MORE HAPPINESS IN THE WORLD <br>WE GOTTA STOP THIS SHIT, RIGHT NOW.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>oh gad domnit shite shite shite balls</br>  <br>This.... this is....

The TPP got signed today in Europe. It's not on the news, it's only on obscure news sites or a small article in the MSM.<br><br>To me this is prove the EU and US don't give a fuck about us, it's corporations that run the game all the way through.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I mean..you didnt think that the corporations would do whatever the fuck they wanted and completely fuck you in the process? where the fuck have you been?</br>  <br>trips pls help me</br>  <br><br><br> Here are the list of nations that will be affected by the TPP: <br> United States, Japan, Mexico, Canada, Australia, Malaysia, Chile, Singapore, Peru, Vietnam, New Zealand and Brunei. </br></br></br></br>  <br>You know I wish I could take you seriously because this is a fucking serious issue.

Can't wait to get americas famous chloroform chicken here too!</br>  <br>And the best part is, they'll sue anyone who tries to compete with them!</br>  <br><br>I just couldn't believe it, but it's true...<br><br>http://sputniknews.com/business/201<wbr>50708/1024379027.html<br><br>"The European legislature voted earlier in the day in support of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) by 436 to 241, with 32 abstentions. Although lawmakers do not directly negotiate with Washington, they can propose changes or veto the final text."</br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>I understand all the other shit,<br>EXCEPT how it affects 4chan. Please explain somebody</br></br>  Is it still too late to hope its b&amp;?  Hey, why not use your Second Amendment right and rally up to overthrow this shit?   Live in the UK <br><br>What the fuck are the police gonna do nigger, they're too busy tackling all the pakis.</br></br>  I think it's time for a revolution  <br>  Trans Pacific  <br>  us and eu signed  <br>Wut?</br></br></br>  <br>It's too late<br>Too much proof</br></br>  <br>basically the trans-atlantic version of the same thing, called TTIP</br>  <br><br><br><br>The most important thing is to spam this all over kikebook, twootr, instawinsta, etc. All the kike social media networks.<br>Then organize some protests, fling shit around, etc, get things noticed so that people will be so pissed off that the gubment has no choice but to listen.<br>Only way we don't end up screwed is if we at least TRY to do something</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Yup. There were protests I n europe but the media selectively never covered it or interviewed only the retards. I am debating using my life to take as many people responsible as possible with me. This I some serious bullshit right here, and It's making me sick.  <br> 2015 <br> posting same thread on all neckbeard sites <br> believing this is the best way to get the word out <br><br>I'm watching you faggot</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah keep on dreamin' buddy</br></br>  <br> You can go.... <br>to the streets <br>protest this shit</br></br></br>  <br>That doesn't do shit anymore. If you try to exercise your right to bear arms they fuck you up in court. All you can do is protest like a bitch.</br>  <br>not now faggot, this shit is too serious</br>  <br>This</br>  <br>I'm going to make a new country then, anyone else?</br>  <br>Porn threads will be illegal<br>You can be sued from copyright on half your memes<br>etc</br></br></br>  <br>count me the fuck in</br>  <br>I'll go</br>  <br>Fuck...</br>  Im pretty retarded what does this all mean exactly ?  <br>Go kill yourself kid, this is some real shit we have hitting the fan.</br>  <br> not posting it on the greatest maymay raidz site of all time </br>  <br>FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU<wbr>UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU<wbr>UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK</wbr></wbr></br>  <br>No 4chin<br>No porn<br>No memes<br>See </br></br></br></br>   Supreme Court rulings on gay marriage and Obamacare subsidies overshadowed the fact that Congress finally granted President Obama fast-track authority over the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and other trade negotiation   Come on guys we have to do some thing  <br>Time to learn how to use TOR</br>  <br> Tl;dr george orwell was right </br>  <br>Nobody even listens to protests anymore. The same corporate interests that are behind these laws are also control of the media and can run however big of a smear campaign they need to against any protest and make you all look like a bunch of faggots. Make protestors a laughingstock and nobody will want to protest.</br>  So in short, we're getting Deus Ex without the badass augments.  I guess half the world World will go to jail for watching or uploading porn  <br>correction: it WAS serious...it has already been signed into law it is now officially too late...</br>  <br>Let the newfags go all batshit anoonemuese?</br>  <br>move to Britain? I'm not even kidding this is making me consider it.</br>  <br> implying the government hasn't been using irrelevant shit to cover up important shit for the past couple years </br>  <br>TTIP bro, basically the same thing also goes for the entirety of Europe...</br>  <br>brah you are not safe there<br/></br>  <br>Who's gonna do that though? I get what you're saying, I'm just trying to visualise in my mind how this is going to work. Is it going to be like the RIAA where they sue a few people to make an example of them and try to scare everybody else? If they sued everybody who distributed porn for free or posted an image macro, they'd go bankrupt.</br>  <br><br>Can't you read? The G.B. already has it since today.</br></br>  Grab a megaphone, grab a gun. Rally people on the streets that it's time to initiate the Second Amendment right to put a stop to these shenanigans. Sorry you guys just aren't doing it right in the first place, you know.  if this has been signed already, then how long does websites like 4chan have?  <br> Legionfags unite <br> Just like the old days </br></br>  this ttp shit is just sensationalism. the copyright stuff is aimed at china which currently does fuck all to protect western copyright.  <br><br> TPP can force your ISP to monitor your activity, and fine you or even send you to jail. </br></br>  <br>I don't care about this shit. I'm an asexual. All you pedos are screwed B)</br>  <br/>  <br>Not long</br>  <br>Everyone is screwed. Corporations can literally sue countries now. No one except them benefits from this.</br>  I've got shit saved from 2011-present<br>Should I hide my hdd?</br>  Can someone sum this up for me? What kind if internet activity is now easily punished and why exactly?  <br>Political leaders are smart, they always manpiluate and time it so well. Here in germany they always fire very unpopular new laws through the months long process in 2 days everytime there is a big football tourney going on.</br>  <br><br> Not long <br>Unless we grab the megaphones and the pewpews</br></br></br>  <br>Pretty much everything on 4chan from what I've gathered</br>  <br>Naw, I doubt my life will be affected. Corporations can lick my taint; I'm joining Irish Isis B)</br>  There are so many faggots replying with irrelevant information, the main part of this law, the part that has everybody up in arms is the provision that will now allow private entities to sue governments. What does this mean? Essentially if Germany finds that a chemical like say BPA is harmful to its citizens and tell various companies they need to find an alternate plastic to use then the company can sue Germany to force it to allow their toxic products. This is the main and driving force behind this new trade agreement, private businesses will be placed above government entities and their laws and now governments will be beholden to corporations for which laws to pass and implement.  <br>read <br>basically, everything fun is illegal, you can get sued for anything and your job will now be competing with 3rd world slaves.</br></br>  <br>This is more than the memes /b/ros</br>  <br>In short, corporations rule the world now. Welcome to 1984, /b/ros.</br>  <br>I like this idea, lets do it.</br>  <br> Obama just signed a law allowing him to fast track TPP <br><br>Didn't he do it a while ago? You just heard about this shit? Really? It's been in the news for ages man.</br></br></br>  <br>OK so they just backed up century old practice with actual laws now.<br>Program as usual, everyone back to the trap threads.</br></br>  I guess now I'm becoming a republican.  So, we can't pirate anymore?  <br>Guess not</br>  <br>going to be underrated post</br>  <br>Kill yourself</br>  2012  <br>Excuse my shitty knowledge, but can we use a VPN not to get caught?</br>  Mfw literally nothing is going to change.<br> I have no face <br><br>Keep moving boys, it was "Signed" today but it's been around for the past 15 years. Nothing new</br></br></br>  <br>Fining and arresting people costs money. If you fine a bunch of people who have no money to pay those fines, the court loses money. If you sentence people to jail, you have to pay cops to go and arrest them, do the paperwork, etc. etc. <br><br>I'm not saying this doesn't suck giant horsecock. It does. I am saying that this scenario of the Meme Gestapo kicking in people's doors and shutting down 4chan because Comcrap caught people sharing banana pictures is probably not going to happen, if for no other reason than it's not worth the trouble. They will first and foremost crack down on things that cost them money. How is 4chan costing them money?</br></br></br>  <br>They already can.<br>Let's expand more on the TPP and the international court OP mentioned.<br>It's Called the ISDS: Investor State Dispute Settlement. This fucking court allows companies to sue entire COUNTRIES. A Czech company sued GERMANY because they wouldn't bail out a bank that the Czech company had a stake in. This kind of shit has been going on all around and it's actually really serious. <br>In their attempts to increase "free trade" they're actually allowing the largest corporations to bypass laws and regulations such as what chemicals can be used in certain products. So even if the U.S. bans certain chemicals in certain foods, that company can take their best lawyers to the ISDS and override the laws of the U.S. and practice what they want. Literally, an organization has more power than entire countries, including the U.S. who usually doesn't budge in the face of anything. <br>This is ridiculous and the fact that those who created the bill and are signing it are unwilling to show us what's in the document is even more suspicious, because the information we have currently now is what they chose to reveal or what was revealed to wikileaks. This is bad, this is really bad.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And you won't have a job</br>  <br>No, the fast track was delayed about a month ago, but it got put back on the road to being passed.</br>  <br>Your comment just shows how screwed this planet really is?<br>"Can't piratz no muhz??"<br><br>Dude - do you even realize the absolute and utter severity of what just happened today? Good luck getting healthy food to sustain your body or lifesaving medicine at a cost that won't take a years worth of life savings for one dose<br><br>This trade deal is so unbeleiveably severe it is going to change the world as you know it while you are still worrying about pirating gay porn <br><br>We all deserve what's coming to us for being so complacent for so long</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  How does one stay sane or safe in a dystopia like this?  <br>No more loli, no more teen threads, no more Siberian mouse, no more cheese pizza. Sorry, pedos. Best wishes from a human without a primal drive to procreate. ;)</br>   Obama just signed <br> Obama <br> Cant do shit to different countries outside USA <br> Implying i care </br></br></br>  <br>Its true trips followed by dub dubs dont lie</br>  ALRIGHT FAGGOTS LISTEN UP<br>OP here.<br><br> The most important thing you can do is spread this like wildfire over the kike social media sites so that all the goyim will see it. Make sure it appeals to them personally, so they feel like they are being attacked by this. <br> Lead some protests, join some activist groups, etc. Better to be faggots than to be enslaved faggots <br> Make such a massive deal that governments will be forced to comply and even law enforcement, militaries, etc will be on our side. <br> Always try and resolve situations peacefully so as not to give the kike media any fire, however at the same time always be prepared to deal with worst case scenarios. <br>Anon out, I'm becoming a legionfag again.
