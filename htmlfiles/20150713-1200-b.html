We all thought he was a super happy guy. I thought he was cute (femanon here) and my friends and I invited him to hang out with us all the time. Soon, we realized that he was actually depressed and he cut and burned himself to cope with his anxiety. We stuck with him and helped him work some stuff out. I met him 6 years ago, and now we're married. I hope you can find friends who can see the real you and think that you're worth enough to help.</br>  <br>thoughts?</br>  <br>This makes me happy to hear. Mostly for his sake. I have little hope when it comes to my self, but I honestly feel happy for you at least.</br>  <br>From context, I'm guessing this isn't the case.<br>More like, they really didn't understand how broken you were, and how badly you needed to unbreak yourself.

But my siblings and I were lazy fucks, so it got pretty stinky. You've got some cute rats there! Mine were Flash and Black Hayate.</br>  This is the first feels greentext I ever read. It still gets me everytime. I hope some of you enjoy.  <br>Ask her and see</br>  <br>I know, right?<br><br>"Suicide<br><br>I'm sorry"</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Shit, well, at least you try.<br>I dont know why the people have to marry even if they dont like, just for the kid.<br><br>Thats bullshit, if i get pregnant some skank by accident, im not marry her, im going to take care of my children everything he needs, but in not going to live with someone that i dont love or at least like.<br><br>He can be a big boy and paid for the checks of his son without getting married with the girl, and thats when you get in the game and marry her.<br><br>I hope thats stuff goes to some better way.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Everyone in this threat should die. Now. Please.</br>    <br>Dank memes keep me away from those feelings. Still I get them alot.</br>  <br> mfw "threat" instead of thread <br> mfw you tell us to die <br> mfw you're a fucking idiot </br></br></br>  <br>We've heard it already, friend.</br>  <br>Hey, are you that ladywhale with the rats that posted nudes an year or so ago? I showed you mine back then ;_; they were long dead by that time tho</br>  <br>This shit's a mess.</br>  <br>Uuuhh<br>I haven't had my rats for a year<br>About 7 months, and recently started posting instead of lurking<br><br>And I am no ladywhale i'm skinny and petite</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yEAH I KNOW ANON<br>it'll get better<br>I have plenty more years to live</br></br></br>    <br>Then it's not your problem anymore.<br>Hate the irony btw</br></br>    <br>Yes you can still make more friends. Get out there and take part in activities faggot. Go to pubs/clubs/galleries, start conversations, take classes, get a fucking job.</br>  <br>Uh well, anyway. Last of my boys died in my hands covered with muh tears and stuff. Some kind of bacterial infection of the lungs, common illness. Vets kept them alive for a while, but their lifespan is so short. Will never get rats again. I had 12 at one point.</br>  <br>I am the same way, my normal friends don't know me that well and when I'm with them I feel like I'm invisible. Last week we were going to a volleyball match and a girl asked if I was coming too, but I was standing right in front of her, she told me she didn't notice, eventually everyone laughed, might not seem as much but it hurts, it's like I'm nothing, and this shit happens all the time. Sadly my other friends, which I know since elementary school are also in the state that I am, one's a weeaboo the other is just plain lonely as fuck. But if I didn't have them I would not be able to take it.</br>    <br>rolling</br>  <br>Because it's your last day and you finally realize you wasted your life, doesn't matter what you wanted to do, it never happened and it never will, of course at that point I'd be a lot more scared of death itself rather then a failed life.</br>  <br>Live alone and for yourself. Go to college get a degree and a good job. Make cash dollar and get a place of your own where nobody has any power over you. That's what I've decided on and so should you.</br>  <br>Shit, some of these hit me hard</br>  1/6  2/6  3/6  4/6  5/6    ilikethis/6  <br>I could write a book about this one.</br>  contributin'    <br>It's called Myco.<br>It's something that stays inside of their tiny bodies<br><br>That's how my bunny passed away when I was about 8<br>I kept telling my grandparents to dig him back up just to make sure he's not actually dead<br>He outlived most bunnies<br><br>3 years isn't so bad but after these babies pass away I'm just gonna get a tortoise or something that will outlive me lol</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>      This Is quite possibly the deepest feels thread ever. Anons haven't cried in 4 years, now I am. My god, incredible...    <br>THIS<br><br><br>Also this was on my feels thread last night<br>It kinda touched me</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>le epic 9gag meme</br>  I used to cry like a little bitch at feels threads...<br>I guess I can't do it anymore, Im starting to feel even more empty...</br>  <br>I dispense kitkat bars</br>  Who would've thought, all these fucking years listening to parents/ adults, studying hard, doing projects, working your ass, wasting your time and energy to become something in life, to make some fucking money and for what now? To go back to your shitty lonely life.... when the real happiness was just around the corner, back in the moments when you could enjoy an ice cream with your friends, back when you had someone to actually enjoy it with, back when you got a hug from the girl you loved and thoufht that maybe you'll be together one day, but she's gone now. From this point on getting motivated to actually do something after college is almost impossoble, life's a journey not a destination, but man does it suck when you don't have a fucking destination.  <br>quads of sadness</br>  <br>QUADS CECK EM</br>  <br> thoufht <br>I blame it on the phone + alcohol combination.</br></br>  <br>That thread was epic. When I got back looking for that pic (forgot to save it at first) it 404'd. Thanks for that thread and for sharing the pic. :)</br>    I will save this thread for future anons to look upon, to look upon in wonder, to look upon it and wonder how many tears their /b/rothers shed that day.  <br>holy shit, out of all of them this is the one which got me</br>  <br>No problem, anon!<br><br>He seemed really genuine. <br>I'm so glad not all /b/rothers are so corrupted and mean</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know, man. I'll take the knowledge of what could have been over the whole torture and fire stuff</br>  <br>Beautiful speech<br>I read it in morgan freemans voice</br></br>  <br> just be social, faggot <br>See </br></br>  <br>Malcho &amp; Ares, behind them is Twin 1 (or 2, can't tell). <br><br>I had most of my dead animals (I also had a lot of gerbils and lizards) put in the freezer. I was burying them in groups, lol.<br><br>Yeah, get a tortoise..it will probably outlive you. I have one, but its species lives only for like 30 years, and I have it for 15. I work and study anguid lizards tho. So in the not far future I'm planing of getting myself some babies. These bastards live more than 30 years. Currently I have a slow-worm, no more than 5 years old. I think it can live up till 60 years or so and I'm 26. It won't even notice when I die. The perfect pet.</br></br></br></br></br>  At least you guys aren't me.<br><br>Enjoy this, my text messages from the last 1 year +<br><br>15 threads<br>5 from people<br>2 from non family</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Your right hand?</br></br>  <br>That's just downright depressing</br>  <br><br>Lawl fucking faggot thats sms box.<br>Now show us your whatsapp.</br></br></br>  <br>Aww<br><br>I love ratties ~<br><br>And slow worms are terrifying anon just look at that eyeball<br>I'm sure it'd notice if you stopped feeding it<br>I had one hamster we put in the freezer, her name was Sora<br>I had bunnies and cats, birds, dogs... <br>I had a garter snake</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Be me <br> Order pizza <br> Pizza comes <br> No cheese, no tomato.  <br> Inside box was a note <br> "We ran out of toppings" <br> I paid £15 for a pizza base and a box of chicken wings.  <br><br>MFW i had to work for two hours for that pizza.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't use whatspp/facebook/twitter</br>  <br>So edgy.</br>  <br>Hang in there. Because if you dont look at all the cp/raids/rekt threads... we have a hearth and we will always be your /b/ros. Stay safe.</br>  <br>rest in pepperonis</br>  <br>Never forgetti.</br>  <br>Me too, it's always good to see nice people helping the other /b/rothers. May I contact you via Snapchat? (just got it yesterday).</br>  <br>that "wrong number" got me real bad<br>good luck out there buddy</br></br>  <br>Sure any of you can as long as you don't show me your peepees. I'll instantly block no hesitation<br>My snapchat is cuntfishsalad</br></br>  Its the worst thing in the world to surround yourself with people who make you feel alone  <br>thanks pal</br>  <br>Lol, don't worry. Thanks a lot!</br>  I've been living with some weird, undiagnosed or undiagnosable heart problem for years. I've been in and out of hospitals and clinics in three separate cities and two states, and it's always the same thing: You have a slightly irregular heartbeat that's somewhat fast. We have no idea why.<br><br>I get mild chest pains pretty much every day, and serious episodes several times a month. When the serious ones happen, I have to stop whatever I'm doing pretty much immediately, even if I'm driving, because the pain is so intense I can't focus at all, and sometimes I pass out. Ever since it started, I've been almost constantly fatigued. I eventually got fired from a good paying factory job because I had to leave or not show up so often - I even got taken out of there by ambulance. Three times.<br><br>I now live on my parents' dime and insurance at my brother's house. I had no skills outside of physical labor, so finding employment is almost impossible.<br><br>The worst part, though, is not knowing. I don't know what it is, I don't know if an episode is going to be an actual heart attack or just feel like one, I don't know how much longer I've got left.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>well, now i'm crying</br>  <br> terrifying <br><br>Well I had almost every kind of animal there is in my crappy cuntry.<br><br>Most of my animals had god names. I thought it was pathetic giving them human names. They are not human.<br><br>But yeah, reptiles are good pets. They do not move much, fairly cheap to look after, do not need attention, will probably outlive you. Perfect.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>cute snake bro</br>  I like these kind of threads.. it is a small thread to just get some things off your chests. We maybe wont even speak to eachother after this, or maybe we will but we wont know.

All of you on /b/ are some of the densest assholes ive ever met. But all of you have the worst stories and have seen the most shit. And I realize it, life has taken its toll on us, that's why we come on b, it allows us to finally escape from the shit we are subject to and allows us to see a bit of freedom, even if it's through some stupid greentext.

Funny thing is she met her younger sister around this time last year, they get along great and her family are all really nice, its good to see cos my mum's a bit of an emotionally twisted psychopath a lot of the time but she gets pretty normal when she's with her sister. Anyway that aside they both hated their biological mother when they met her and my mum didn't much like her adopted parents either, they were harsh on her and it kinda shows, I don't really know if any of this will be relevant but what I'm trying to get at is it doesn't matter who raises you or who gave birth to you or any of that, you be who you want and you find your own stability from your own life, build a family among your friends and peers, you don't need official documents to feel comfortable.</br>  Short but good story<br><br> I was 15 when my granddad died. <br> He had terminal cancer, refused treatment and told no one about his symptoms for a few decent months <br> I remember seeing him a few months before he died. <br> The last thing I heard him say was "For the niggers? give me my fucking money back" when my brother talked about the charity work he was doing <br> He never got his fiver back <br><br>A few months later<br><br> Funeral service happen <br> Song was "My Way" by Frank Sinatra  <br> I wrote a poem, don't have a picture so here is what I remember. <br><br>I can remember all the good times we've had,<br>Granddad, dear granddad.<br>You knew me since I was a little lad,<br>Granddad dear granddad.<br><br>And now, your'e not here,<br>So I shed my tears.<br>Granddad dear granddad.<br><br>I am sad you have gone,<br>And you know that it's true<br>I will see you once again<br>And I will always love you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So cute!! It's femanon back again, :3 <br><br>Terrifyingly cute &lt;3 <br>My mother had a turtle I met once, she set her free after about a year of having her. She only had 3 legs</br></br></br></br>  I'm tired of people 5+ years younger than me constantly reminding me that I've never done anything with a girl<br>I know I never will, people don't have to fucking remind me</br>  Well since everyone is confessing here we go. <br><br> Be me 8 <br> Dad dies of MS  <br> Go to funeral, mum doesn't bother because she is divorced and has principles  <br> Meet family, never fucking knew  <br> I have to be friendly with them.  <br> I get back, mum doesn't bother to talk about it, orders me to clean the dishes and go to bed. <br> Fast forward a week  <br> Grandma dies, on mums side.  <br> Mum breaks down, cries.  <br> All her friends are at the house telling me to comfort her.  <br> I have to be nice to her, and comfort her.  <br> MFW i had to do the fucking house work for a week because she was too distraught  <br> I've had alot of problems growing up because of my dad's passing. One being i developed anger issues and was prone to violent outbursts.  <br> My mum sent me to a physiologist to see what the problem is <br> Physiologist says i'm not expressing my emotions.  <br> I tell mum i'm annoyed at how she disregarded the death of my dad.  <br> She tells me to man up.  <br> MFW, mum who broke down at the passing of her parent tell's me to man up. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   meet a girl the first day of high school <br> never talked to her for the first year besides "hi" and "bye" <br> in the end of the second year i admitted my feelings to her <br> she said "we'll talk later, ok?" and went outside <br> never talked again for another (last) year of high school <br> now im in the 2 year relationship with other girl <br> still think about her every single night and cry myself to sleep </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>also I'm 22</br>   never had gf <br> i've been an isolated shut-in 99% of the time for about 3 years now <br> no job <br> i have friends but we only hang out once in a blue moon and they always end up giving me bad feels one way or another <br> feel i'm going more and more insane as the months go by <br> i have really intense and freaky nightmares for the first couple of times i fall alseep at night <br> i just want to go to the middle of nowhere and scream as loud as I can for as long as I can <br> i am so frustrated and unfufilled <br> i plan on killing myself when my parents die </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you feel that low about it try a prostitute or something bro</br>  <br>Turtles are fucking great.

I didn't have any friends, and just kind of went home every afternoon and sat around doing nothing. But I met a kid in my computer science class. Typical nerd, but he opened up to me. He and I became good friends. I was always a little better than him at computer science, so I would help him out with schoolwork. I was a little better with women, so I helped him with his ordeals. <br><br>I graduated a year ahead of him, and took off to a college out of state. I still helped him out wherever I could, but we began to grow apart. But I always tried to be a role model to him. <br><br>I hid the fact that I've dropped out of college. I hid the fact that I was forced into marrying someone I didn't love. I hid the fact that I suffer from severe depression, and have been for a very long time. I was his role model, and I wanted him to succeed where I had failed. <br><br>He was found dead in his apartment last weekend.

I feel dead. Sometimes when talking with family members I literally lose the ability to connect together words and spend like 5 - 10 seconds going "uhhhhhh .." trying to think of what I was just saying. I'm in a bad way, don't get me wrong.

I never heard of a v-tech</br>  <br><br>tits or gtfo</br></br>  what is your full name and address?  <br>Is it you on the pic? <br>Then this </br></br>  <br>I am an assistant for veterinarians. However I am not a nurse. I know about as much as a human doctor would due to the fact that we have marginally less to work with than human medicine. I know dentistry, blood work, how to write and give prescriptions, as well as the anatomy of multiple spices</br>  <br><br>Do you find it hard to psychologically cope with having a job where you spend 90% of your time euthanizing pets?</br></br>  worst part of your job?  <br><br>No, I'm actually a dude.<br><br><br>Filli Vinnilie. at 12345 three way street.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br> as much as a human doctor  <br>keep believing that.<br><br><br>hahahah, where'd you get your certificate</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't spend 90% of my time doing euthanasia, but it is certainly emotionally taxing. I just have to keep in mind that I am doing this for the greater good and to put the animal out of the suffering.<br><br><br>All the shit, puke, and piss I have to clean up. So much.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>hahaha man is an animal nurse. Not buying it, tits or gtfo.</br></br>  <br>Seriously. Doctors have a lot more to work with than we do. Most doctors don't know how to do dentist work while also knowing how to pump fluid out of the heart and how to read a radiograph.</br>  <br>I am a dude. Sorry to disappoint.</br>  <br>Most doctors can't fuck up treating a patient and then inject it with succinylcholine to hide their mistakes and claim that it was for the greater good.</br>  <br>Sometimes that happens, but personally it has never happened to me. Usually the only times I put down an animal are due to old age, cancer, or kidney failure (which can be caused by us, but I don't do surgery so I can't be held responsible if the vet acts like a total idiot)</br>  <br>Can a dog that's gone blind still have pain in there eyes? <br><br>My dog has recently gone blind, retinal degeneration or some such shit,but before that she suffered with inflammation of her eye balls. Should I still give her eye drops, even though her eyes don't work anymore?</br></br></br>  <br>It depends on if there nerves have been degenerated. I would assume they have been so it's highly unlikely that she can feel much in her eyes. Is she showing signs of pain?</br>  <br>Most women are to squeamish to do the things vet techs do.<br><br>nice almost trips</br></br></br>  <br><br> a lot more to work with <br><br>The fuck does that even mean?<br><br> Calls it a radio graph instead of an xray.  <br><br> most doctors dont know how to do dental work and pump fluid out of the heart <br><br>Not sure about the second thing but duh a doctor isn't going to know dental work among other things. There is so much damn information in every medical field that it would be impossible for anyone to expect a medical student to have in depth knowledge of even two fields. <br><br>tl:dr if you had the ability to recall more medical information than a doctor then you'd just be a doctor (or nurse) instead of a technical certificate havin ass vet tech</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Raw feed? <br><br>Yes <br><br>or <br><br>No</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>kid thinks he absorbed more information in an 18 month course than a medical graduate of 6+ years</br></br>  <br>No but I took a close look at the eyes today and the whites of her eyes are red as fuck. <br><br>Also my other dog is loosing her fur, there is a bald patch on her front leg that has been like that for eight months since the vet shaved it for a blood sample. What the fuck would cause that, why does her fur not grow back, any ideas? <br><br>They are both really old dogs and I have spent thousands upon thousands on vet bills the past year. I really don't want to spend more money on these two bitches.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That they have more access to current meds, more equipment, more man power and the like<br><br>That's what it's actually called. It emits X-rays, but the system itself is called a radiograph.<br><br>I have my CVT. And veterinarians and Vet Techs are nearly the same except I can't make a diagnosis or preform surgery. Other than that we are pretty much equal.<br><br>As for the rest, we have to be educated in a wide variety of specialties. Most doctors will only learn 2 maybe 3 specialties in depth but I had to learn 9-10 different fields in depth.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Spices huh? Bay leaves too? Cayenne? You reallly know all about cayenne? How about paprika, mustard seed and cinnamon?</br>  <br>fuck, I hope you're trolling and aren't actually this retarded.</br>  <br>No.<br><br><br>I went to school for 4 years, plus an extra if you count my training to get my CVT. It was super difficult and if I were to transfer to human medicine right now, it would be a cake walk for me.<br><br><br>I would do it then just to be on the safe side. If she shows improvement great, if not you may want to look at it more deeply.<br><br>That's strange. In all my time I can't say that that has ever happened after I took blood. Has her skin changed color at all?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Stupid auto correct got me. You know what I meant.<br><br><br>What did I say that would make you believe that?</br></br></br></br>  <br>wow and this wasnt even me<br><br>me being==</br></br></br>  <br>confirmed for radiograph information but also confirmed as a fucking retard. Vetrinarians are not solely the same as a vet tech minus the diagnosis and surgery. You are living in a fucking dreamworld Scotty and 10 out of 10 vetrinarians would knee you hard in the testicles and tell you as much.</br>  <br><br> 4 years <br><br>mfw</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's what I was told. And most of the time when the vets get busy the shove all the work onto us. At least from my experience, the only differences are a lot more schooling and diagnosis and surgery. But I am not a Veterinarian so maybe there is more that I just plain am not aware of.</br>  <br>forgot face</br>  <br>Everything you said makes me think you're trolling. No way any sane person thinks that a fucking vet tech is basically the same as a vet.</br>  <br><br>Very amusing. But that's the time I took for me to get my CVT.</br></br>  <br> if I were to transfer to human medicine right now, it would be a cake walk for me. <br>Holy motherfucking troll messiah. What would stop you from being a world class surgeon or cancer doctor pioneering treatments that save millions....?
