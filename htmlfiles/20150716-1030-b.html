AMA.  Oh that's noting, Back in 1993 I was there at the Headquarters/Office of the ID Software I had the chance of meeting { 'John Romero' } not once but twice, and I am now working at I.D. Software now.    <br>How is this even b8<br>wat<br>I'm literally just saying to ask me anything, faggot.</br></br></br>    Haters can Hate.  <br>Nah...you're the faggot.</br>  Are you talking to yourself?  <br>Nah, just to faggots.</br>  <br>which band faggot?</br>  <br>Queensryche</br>  <br/>  After I'm finished with college I plan on moving to Scandinavia. Not sure which country though. I've heard that Sweden is a bit xenophobic and Denmark is over run with sand niggers. Norway sounds pretty good. <br><br>Can any scandifags give any insight into the pros and cons of each country? Also is there a language that people primarily speak or is it strictly Swedes speak Swedish, Finns speak Finnish, Norwegians speak Norwegian and Danes speak Danish</br></br>  Denmark is xenophobic and Sweden is overrun with sandniggers.  <br>they're all xenophobic, and everything is expensive</br>  <br>If you're having trouble with language, I'd say finland is out of the question by default. Their language isn't related to any other european language (or any other for that matter).<br>Sweden (my fatherland) is like a less superior version of Norway nowadays.</br></br>  <br>Germanfag here, can second this.</br>  <br><br>Please do NOT come. Stay in your cesspool, white nigger. We don't want your cowboy-style fatness and gun-loving manchild tendency for traps.</br></br>  <br>No, you just want imported nigger dick and a quran as a mouthgag.</br>  <br>All scandinavian countries are filled with sandniggers and/or niggers. Finland and doesn't have that many yet but in 5-10 years it'll just as fucked as everywhere else. Meanwhile Iceland, despite the mostly cold weather is quite nice.</br>  <br>Dane here and I can confirm, although we are quite getting there at being overrun too.<br><br>OP, Norway is arguably the nicest place, it is also the most expensive one though.<br>Denmark probably has the most comfy weather all around, as we don't get as much snow as Sweden and Norway.<br><br>Stay the fuck away from Finland unless you like saunas, snow, vodka and getting stabbed.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Finnfag here.<br><br>Why would we want you?<br><br>What work would you be doing?<br><br>Also, Swedes are the least xenophobic people on the planet. They would rather bend over and let you fuck them in all their holes with a toilet brush than you call them a "racist" or a "sexist".</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>bump</br>  <br> Sweden is a bit xenophobic <br>that's why sweden is a great country</br></br>  Norwegian here. Most people would go to Sweden, and if you want to live next to thousands of muslims, that might be right for you. Norway is almost the same, but a more expensive place to live (but it's not a problem if you get a job, the salaries are nice).<br><br>Not sure if you care about nature, but if you do, Norway all the way. We can have a pretty rough climate though (around 15 degrees celsius all year). The people here are nice and the girls are cute, but we can be a bit hard to get to know.<br><br> Finland is too eastern european-ish and Denmark is very generic.<br><br>We all speak different languages but if you know one, you can pretty much understand the others. If you got any questions, feel free to ask.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  OP here. Anyone know how doctors fare in Norway? I'm studying to be an orthopedic surgeon right now. In America orthopedic surgeons are the top paid doctors and idk about other countries' medicine  Sweden is great, beautiful cities and beautiful people &lt;3 Sweden is magical  <br>Most finns know english really well, the young population anyway.<br>And you only need basic finnish to get nationality if you plan to stay for good, which<br>can be learned moderately easily. It is a hard language to speak properly and to master though.</br></br></br>  <br> Denmark is very generic <br>You're just saying this because we have no mountains.<br>Brænd i helvede, fjeldabe.</br></br></br>  <br>You'll probably get a job, more or less, day one.<br>not trolling, they are incredibly sought after.</br></br>  <br><br>That view looks amazing, if only it weren't upside-down.</br></br>  <br>You will never get stabbed or even punched in finland unless you delibirately try to start fights.<br>We're peaceful folk unless drunk and even then<br>not violent unless provoked.</br></br></br>  <br>You will not worry about getting a job no, and the paycheck is pretty sweet (at least here in Norway)</br>  <br>Norway is quite expensive, but the money you may earn and quality of living is great. If you want to live cheap and work in Norway, you can settle near the Swedish border and drive to Norway to work.</br>  <br> russia <br> love <br>Russians are niggers in white skin</br></br></br>  <br><br>We hate sandniggers as much as Americunts. So, you too stay away, redneck scum.</br></br>  <br><br> Stay the fuck away from Finland unless you like saunas, snow, vodka and getting stabbed. <br><br>is this true fin guy? some other question, wtf is your language? do i need to learn this or everybody speak english?<br><br>Your country seems very nice, every pilot in "nen" are really coldbadass great guys<br>I like ski saunas and vodka<br><br>I'm curious about the food too, I love nothing.... what are you used to eat?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  If you don't have anyone in Norway or have loads of money/luck it won't work for you.  <br>ok, you have no mountains and your culture is boring as fuck, and the language is a fucking mess.</br>  <br>Guess they get gud money since German doctors are leaving for scandinavia for more money<br> mfw we get all the eastern and southern Europe doctors and nobody is left in these countries </br></br>  <br>By the sound of it you can't get enough of them, leftist halfbreed.</br>  <br> wtf is your language? <br>Finns speak fucking Finnish. It's some bastardized language that has its roots in Russian.</br></br>  <br><br>We stab Swedish women with our cocks, right in the pussy. That's about it, negro.</br></br>  <br> sweden  <br> xenophobic  <br> denmark  <br> overrun with sandniggers  <br><br>m8 sweden is the running joke of europe. even the french are laughing at how utterly cucked they are when it comes to immigration and how they are probably going to go extinct. <br><br>denmark just had a right wing coalition with a VERY immigrant unfriendly party win the elections (second biggest party in the country), and your average dane dislikes immigrants. <br><br>you got those two mixed up.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>rissian are the best guys, they just drink too much.<br>they hate niggers and fags, traps deserve goulag, this country is perfect.</br></br>  Does anyone else think Scandinavia looks like the Arabic word for Allah?  <br>Norway, Denmark and Iceland would be your safest bets.<br>Sweden is turning into the worlds most politically correct refugee camp. And in Finland all they care about are knives and fish pretty boring.</br></br>  <br>OP u cant afford to move here, stay where you are</br>  <br>by wtf I meant, is this the DIFICULTEST language ever? looks like it.</br>  <br>Another one I took. My fucking phone turned the pictures.</br>  <br>Fuck you</br>  <br>Born and raised finnfag, it's really nice here.<br>Quality of life is excellent, folk are friendly and most know english really well.<br>We eat everything to be honest.</br></br></br>  <br> kill all of the americas <br> leave cuba <br>lol</br></br></br>  <br>no danish is</br>  <br><br>It is not my problem that you live in a trailer park, fatso.</br></br>  <br>Wrong dickwad it has roots in Hungarian</br>  <br>Leave Estonia now you dirty fucking russian scum!</br>  <br>see<br>sweden is so flooded even the eu questions their sanity.</br></br>  <br> is this true fin guy? <br>its true.<br> wtf is your language? <br>finnish<br> do i need to learn this or everybody speak english? <br>everybody speaks english<br> what are you used to eat? <br>same supermarket shit as everywhere else.<br>we don't have national cuisine except for a few dishes. fish/mushrooms/berries you can aquire yourself from the wilds in summer.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>that looks more like a ballsack to me.</br>  <br> DIFICULTEST <br>Go fucking kill yourself.</br></br>  Norway is probably what I'm gonna go with. Is north better than south? Here the further south you go there are more niggers and spics.  <br> &gt;has its roots in Russian. <br>has absolutely no root in russian whatsoever.</br></br>  <br>finn fag, yep</br>  <br>I think you will find that of the scandinavian languages the hardest is Icelandic. Because it is the most archaic language it is very close to old norse and thus not like any mordern languages. Danish is infact very closely related to english.</br>  <br>shit.<br><br>cannot unsee.</br></br></br>  <br>Stupid nigger.</br>  <br> DIFICULTEST <br>English, apparently.</br></br>  <br>What about Canadians? Do you guys hate us too or just Americans? (It's OK we hate Americans too)</br>  <br> norway  <br> flooded with muslims  <br><br>you don't know what you are talking about man. norway is nowhere near flooded unless you go into some big city and even there it is not as bad as you make it out to be. <br><br> sweden  <br> thousands of muslims  <br><br>try more like hundreds of thousands to millions.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>oslo is mecca for rag heads</br>  <br>That's a lamia with bare tits holding a staff</br>  Thank heaven we're not in NATO. Day fucking Americunt soldiers bring their fatness here I'm off to Russia.  <br>But Norway also is not a member of EU so you'll lose all the benefits of living in a EU country. Also very small country population wise.</br>  <br>what is your profession</br>  <br> Finland is too eastern european-ish <br><br>Fuck you. Estonia is even better, if you look at the ladies. If you go to Helsinki or Tampere or Oulu in Finland, they're packed with lot's of fuckable students. <br><br> Norway has pretty mountains and is fucking expensive. <br><br>In Finland you can use english and 90% of the people aged 10-40 will understand you and can keep conversation going. If you are nigger, then most of the 40-60 aged population may hate you, but they can barely speak you in any meaningful words that may offend your ass.<br><br>Sweden has beautiful blondes but there's also ghettos you can't even go to. <br><br>Iceland has volcanoes and ice and smart politicians.<br><br>Denmark HAS POTATO IN MOUTH and legoland. Also you can visit Germany from Denmark easily if you want quality beers</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>kek</br>  Nature? expenses? Let's be honest. People move to Scandinavia primarily because of our women.  <br>I thought Mecca was Mecca?</br>  <br>if you want food <br>don't come to any nordi c country</br></br>  <br><br>Canadians are cool in our book.<br><br>Just don't behave like a stereotypical American and you'll be loved, pampered and surrounded by friends and pussy.</br></br></br></br>  http://animmigrantinsweden.tumblr.c<wbr>om/</wbr>  <br>see<br/></br>  <br> tumblr  <br><br>get the fuck out</br></br></br>  <br>Although Finns mostly speak Finnish there are alot of them who speak Swedish aswell, and all the languages of scandinavia except for Finland can pretty much communicate with people who speak the other with no real issues. You're probably best of learning Swedish though as it is spoken by the most people, not to mention Sweden probably being the best place to live in Scandinavia alongside Norway.</br>  <br>Op if your moving to Norway you will need at least 30k in ur bank to survive the first few months after rent bond food etc. Most expensive in the world. Sweden is half the price</br>  <br>we will suck your cock. <br><br>but in sweden they may not hire you if you are not brown</br></br></br>  <br><br>Or cock. Lots of gay Germans come here to get the D.</br></br>  <br>This is wrong, we are like the original swedes but our government is a massive assliker that refuses to upgrade any of the tech</br>  <br>Estonia or any of the baltic countries are not and will not be or become members of scandinavia ever.</br>  <br>Are Canadian welcome to get a work visa in Norway? I'd love to go live and work there for a year. I think my country would be much better if we were more like you guys.</br>  <br>If you speak swedish you can make yourself understood in all of the nordic countries, since it's a second language in Finland and Norwegian, swedish and danish is pretty much the same language that have evolved in slightly different directions.<br><br>As a norwegian I would say that we are a pretty reserved people that might not be the easiest to get to know. Unless we are superdrunk as we often are on weekends. Then we are best-friends with everyone around us.<br><br>Danish people are very likeable and more outgoing and easier to get to know. Probably because they drink more beer than us.<br><br>Most swedish people I've met have been really nice people. Youths like to party. Hard.<br><br>Don't know too much about the finns.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>everybody's country would. That's why i'm moving there</br>  <br> Denmark-Alcoholics <br> Sweden-Liberal cunts <br> Finland-Alcoholics and psychos <br> Norway-Rich assholes <br><br>Norway obliously for hot chicks, friendly atmosphere and Anders Behring Breivik of course</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oslo (the capital) is probably the worst place if you wanna stay away from niggers, try the west. The weather is shit 80% of the time, but it is never too cold or too hot. Bring an umbrella. The north is too deserted and very cold. Don't go past Trondheim.</br>  <br><br>You know nothing about Finland.<br><br>The Swedish speakers are a minority and speak archaic Swedish which the Swedes laugh off.<br><br>The majority of people, like normal folk in the streets, will not muster Swedish even if paid. My Swedish friends here speak English with everybody because it is easier for them.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Norway is pretty cool, but it's very expensive for foreigners. If you can get a job with norwegian pay you're good though. Don't know if it's still true but I read a few years ago that Norway had the most expensive McDonalds in the world. <br><br>Other than that, great nature, free health care and so on. Be prepared to pay a fair amount of taxes though. It's not unusual to pay 40%.</br></br>  finland frequently rates as one of the best places to live on the planet across any number of criteria.  Im a white South African, also planning on moving to Scandinavia. How do you guys feel about us?  <br>Made a mistake, meant that Norway was pretty close to Sweden culture wise, not the muslim bit. I live in Bergen and I almost only see other Norwegians.</br>  <br>What is Magyar?</br>  <br>It's mostly central and east-Oslo that are overrun with niggnoggs, but west-Oslo is mostly white, but hella expensive (+drunk teens), I think the best thing to go with is Trondheim, it is central and the people are normal, don't go with Bergen tho, they say ERRRH instead of R, it reeks of fish and it is always raining</br>  <br>Please finns originate from the Finno-Ugric people which are by definition slavic also your language is closely related to hungarian. In DK, NO and SWE you are not even considered a part of Scandinavia.</br>  <br>Swedish is not the fucking second language in Norway you retard.</br>  <br>Tromsø isn't nice? Thought that was supposed to be a good city.</br>  <br><br>And that's due to the fact that we have no Americans here.</br></br>  <br>wow, taking this seriously.</br>  <br>You get quality for your price though, and once you get a job it's all good.</br>  <br><br>You are Dutch. But worse. And we hate Dutch. Everybody hates Dutch anyway.</br></br>  <br>I did this on purpose...</br>  <br>This. Come to Bergen.</br>  <br>Excellent. You'll find we are far more respectful than our southern neighbours. One more question, what are the primary languages there? If I only know English will I be OK? (Not that I don't want to learn, I'm just not very good at other languages)</br>  <br>Norwegian and Danish are far more close than Swedish and Swedish douchewipe.</br>  <br> which are by definition slavic  <br>false.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, I would welcome you as a Norwegian, as long as you speak english and isn't colored I'm fine.</br>  <br>Tromsø is nice, could be a bit warmer tho. Not as many niggers and muslims as the south of norway.</br>  <br> &gt;you are not even considered a part of Scandinavia. <br><br>because we aren't.<br><br>finland is not a part of scandinavia.<br><br>nobody claims otherwise, least of all finns.<br><br>finland is a part of the nordic region.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, I have no afrikaans blood in me, im just white and born in sa</br>  <br>everybody in denmark buys their shit in germany tbh</br>  <br>Didn't write that. I wrote that Norwegian, swedish and danish pretty much are the same language.</br>  Been thinking about moving to Iceland, how is it?  <br>Magyar a nomadic tribe is the ancestors of the modern hungarians</br>  <br>This. British people are much worse<br><br><br>  everybody speak english <br>Yes, mostly. Our language is suomi<br><br>The basic food is meat and potatoes, although many people will eat kebab, pizza, indian, mcdonalds and other restaurant stuffs. There's not much places in finland where you can get original finish food. You can try to ask someone if you don't find one, they're like 5-9 euroes per meal. <br><br><br>Has nothing to do with russian language. There's words from Estonia, Germany, English and Swedish, but barely any russian. <br><br><br> knives and fish <br><br>More correct answer would be beer and sausages <br><br><br>This, but as a native finn, its fucked because finnish people don't speak to other finnish people, only to foreigners.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>swedes education is nowhere near ours, and at least we aren't overrun by nogs<br>Norway and Denmark are ok with us, it is only the worst part(uneducated teens) that shout the stupid shit</br></br>  <br>If you like rain-deer, sure.</br>  <br><br>Socially, yes. But, for work? Don't even dream it. No Finnish no job, unless you're into something which is heavily connected to foreign markets, like a hyper qualified social media consultant, experienced sound engineer, or stuff like that.<br><br>You're a doc, right? I'm afraid that you must chew some decent Finnish, unless you'd be doing research at the uni.</br></br></br></br>  <br>in denmark everybody speaks english, everybody.<br>theres no sandniggers if you live out in the country</br></br>  <br>Prove me wrong</br>  <br>scandic languages are some of the hardest in the world if ur coming from US denmark is beat but language is hard, swedish is easier</br>  what is generally frowned upon in norway? Like what do you mean by stereotypical american  <br><br>I told you what the image of white SA is, not that you are Dutch.</br></br>  <br>smells like farts</br>  <br>That is a lie many on Zeeland buys in Sweden Germany is too far off.</br>  <br>I think you're confusing Danish with Dutch, because a lot of Americans I know have better understanding of Dutch and recognizing cognates than Danish. I could be wrong though.</br>  <br>you didn't prove your statement in the first place, and now you expect me to disprove it?<br><br>what kind of woman logic is that?<br><br>furthermore, i'm a finn myself, i know what im talking about.<br><br>you don't.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I love cold weather, even in summer. Sounds like my kind of place.</br>  <br>Indeed. Finns, Danes and Norwegians should enter a military alliance and shut Sweden down.</br>  <br><br>Right wing, Bible loving, gun crazy, fat, ignorant, loud, etc.</br></br>  <br>fuck off you leftis scum</br>  <br>no fuck off, dont come here... enough immigrants as it is</br>  <br>And the niggers are pretty decent about living in ghettos so you can avoid them :D</br>  <br>Don't sneak in queues. Don't get physically very close to someone in a public space. We don't like to be crowded. Skip most of the unnecessary pleasantries when dealing with someone for a few moments, we don't care about them.</br>  <br> this country is perfect <br> weak democracy <br> weak civil society <br> weak economy and industry <br><br>Not only Russia sucks, but it is also getting worse.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Sweden is fine as long as you're not brown or black and stay away from Malmö.  <br><br>Sure. Just stay away from my country, trailer park trash.</br></br>  <br>So just by being part of a culture makes you an expert on the subject? Now there is some fucked logic.</br>  <br>for work denmark is ur best bet. sweden and especially norway will want u to speak the language before u get a job</br>  <br>lol are you serious? that would be perfect!</br>  <br>Not too many benefits now when greece is going to shitter and IMF pump money out of tax payers</br>  <br>Don't do this OP. Stay by the coast, that's where the beautiful landscape is</br>  <br><br>this sounds amazing<br>kinda sucks about the no guns though but whatever</br></br></br>  <br>And their language is related to?</br>  <br>This. And the number system wtf Denmark</br>  <br>I am Norwegian you dipshit</br>  <br>STUPID SCANDIES<br>SOCIALSM DOESN"T WORK.<br><br>MARGARET THATCHER: THE PROBLEM WITH SOCIALISM IS SOONER OR LATER YOU RUN OUT OF OTHER PEOPELS MONEY.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I am a Dane buddy XD<br>Danes and Brits have a long history old norse -&gt; old danish happened partly by being exposed to old english. There are many common words and phrases which the languges shares. Dutch is more close to german not english.</br></br>  <br>finland has among the highest firearms per capita in the world.<br><br>getting a license is a very long and tedious process however.</br></br></br>  <br>Actually, no. In Norway there are tons of English speaking workers who don't speak Norwegian very well, even within the service group</br>  <br><br>Yeah, well, we have LOTS of guns. It's just that we don't worship them. Just hunt, you know.</br></br>  yugoslavia  <br>nah im an ex pat that has lived in all 3 also google it.</br>  <br>Confirmed. Norwegian (Ålesund) here btw</br>  <br><br>Stay away from my country, oil-drenched simpleton.</br></br>  <br>Knives, Fish, Beer &amp; Sausages<br><br>I'll tell you what... it's sounding better and better all the time.</br></br></br>  <br>yeah we do own guns, it's just that we don't point them in each others faces on a regular basis. Pretty much only on aims and for hunting.</br>  <br>Finland has kebab/chinese/pizza/hamburgers everywhere <br><br><br>Estonia is like southern / eastern Finland, almost the same language. Only problem is that there's fuckload of russians in Estonia. <br><br>Much like Finland if you compare the Estonian people and the food. They are a little bit poorer, but they are kind of wiser also, because they have not had the same luxury lifestyle as here in Finland. <br><br><br>99% of the Finns DO NOT understand swedish, in fact they hate swedish. <br><br>Only use for swedish to the basic finn is flirting/fucking swedish women on boat cruises from Finland (they last 24 hours and there's cheap booze) There are people who do this frequently.<br><br><br>Yeah the finns are much better at english than in swedish. <br><br><br>Lol Denmark is so fucking south it's barely even a country. Like Germany, but with uglier people, if possible. <br><br>Also Finland has Sami people, and they have the hottest genetics</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Finnish and Hungarian :D<br>Pretty sure latvian. estonian and livonian also.</br></br>  Do swedes like crawfish?  <br><br>Are you kidding? Swedes ARE crawfish.</br></br>  <br>try being an ex pat u´ll then see how its not so easy</br>  <br>I am Danish and I agree with this statement</br>  <br><br>If you guys say so.</br></br>  I forgot to mention. ALLAHUAKBAR motherfuckers!<br><br>lol no, just kidding. stay away from Itäkeskus if you come to Finland.</br></br>  <br>Yet they are far better off than the rest of the world. Funny how that works. Plus Margaret Thatcher was a hag.</br>  <br><br>Not only does your English suck, but you yourself probably suck nigger dick too</br></br>  <br>Not very friendly towards danes there buddy.</br>  <br>to my knowledge its unclear where the Magyars originated from.<br><br>they tribes just sort of popped out of and over the Ural Mountains out of nowhere between 8-5 century BC</br></br></br>  <br>We know.</br>  <br> sami people <br><br>like native murricans, except with white skin so we think their rugged outdoorsyness and simple low-tech nomadic herdsmen lifestyle pretty cool.<br><br>lol</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well the most likely idea is that they are the product of tribe consolidations all over the eastern steppes and uralic areas.</br>  sami people are mixed with raindeer and eskimos. and do witchcraft. their kingdom is at war with the gypsy principality, sending waves of horror throughout the realm. they fight with horned bullfrogs attached to spears.  <br>We do have quite a bit russian origin words, but as you said we also have many loan words from other languages</br>  <br>Finns and Norwegians should get them nuclear weapons and terminate Denmark and Swedeland<br><br>Sorry. <br><br><br>Yeah but in Finland, people actually hunt their food. They're not FOR HOME PROTECTIONS like american gun idiots- in Finland you GO TO JAIL if you shoot anyone, from any reason. It's fucking illegal, no matter if you we're attacked first. <br><br><br>This. <br><br><br>You can forget about the knives and fish already. The knives are only problem if you are alcoholic with your alcoholic buddies drinking 30 years straight vodka and getting into a fight. They will not harm normal people, just each other.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>True. Natives are primitive shitskins, unless they look like this.</br>  <br>norfag here, norway is booring but nice if u like nature, norwegians ,swedes and danes usually understand eatch other, atleast if we slow down, icelanders speak a language simular to old norwegian, but is hard to understand for modern norwegians, finns have a totally different language, but many of them speak swedish so its ok</br>  <br>If you move to Finland be prepared to work on a construction site, in a bar, as a cleaner or on a shipyard, or then you just learn good (flawless) Finnish.<br><br>More often than not people don't want to take foreigners to work because<br><br>A) they don't want to interview you in English because most aged 40+ Finns speak the same English as Finnish rally drivers.<br><br>B) A native Finn is probably a better candidate since we have very high level of education here.<br><br>Food is shit and expensive, no real good and relatively cheap restaurants here. If you don't want to pay 18+ € for a good basic restaurant meal plus 6€ for a beer, then tough luck you'll be eating kebab or in a shitty restaurant in which they charge you 15 euros for a basic pork beef and french fries</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why the fuck are everybody moving to the nordic counties? It's not like they need more immigrants.</br>  <br><br>They're called puistokemistit and it is a sacred institution of Finnishness, lol</br></br>  <br>The fuck Denmark do?</br>  <br>We need western immigrants not eastern!</br>  <br>Basically every Sweede speaks and/or understand English in Stockholm. <br>Sweeds are pussies and wont tell you if you are acting against the norm or the "Swedish way", so fitting in can be hard.<br>don't talk to random people without an excuse they will think you are a weirdo.<br>Swedish whimen wants "respect" for the most part, that means no cat calling or buying dinner without you've spent some time getting acquainted. if she isint drunk.<br>A drunk sweede is a happy sweede and the weekends are the only time it is "ok" to bee wasted in public.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Dude, I need some variety, tired of kebab and chinese joints. Some Greeks cooking here wouldn't hurt.</br></br>  <br>They don't, they really don't look like that</br>  <br> &gt;Yeah but in Finland, people actually hunt their food. They're not FOR HOME PROTECTIONS like american gun idiots- in Finland you GO TO JAIL if you shoot anyone, from any reason. It's fucking illegal, no matter if you we're attacked first. <br><br><br>I'm a fucking finn living in fucking finland, vitun pässi</br></br></br></br>  <br>Problems?<br><br><br>check this out</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Plus that's a fat, ugly sami chick.</br></br>  <br>Noni ginosti vitusti jos oot vihanen ni mees nukkumaa internet ei oo paikka sulle</br>  <br>What are the Sami like?</br>  <br>kuulostat neekeriltä</br>  <br>like native americans.<br><br>only angrier and even less talkative.</br></br></br>  <br>and no casinos</br>  <br>a little less inteligent, but rather normal ppl</br>  britbong with experience of all<br><br>finland <br><br>people are weird, compeltely reserved/unfriendly no social skills, dont like outsiders, ugly women, shit country, basically russians.<br><br>swedes, nice people, fun, country over run by immgrants, amazing women<br><br>norway as for sweden, but far less immigrants, expensive<br><br>denmark, as above, more german though, best looking women.<br><br>iceland, very friendly, ugly and expensive crap weather.<br><br>norway/denmark best but denmark wins due to cost. finland by a distance the worst, may as well go russia or some other baltic slav state</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  M  <br>Vores talsystem giver perfekt mening, vi kører bare i snes (20) stadig. Tre snes, tres. Det halve af den tredje snes halv tres (50) det halve af den fjerde snes halv fjerds etc....</br>  <br>He wrote it poorly but he meant that its the second language in finland and then went on to talk about how similar swedish, danish and norweigan is</br>  Sweden is by far the best of the Nordics. I've been to all of them, and Sweden is like Norway, but more affordable.<br><br>Just stay out of Malmo and you'll be fine.</br></br>  FB fap thread  Rate them?      <br>moar of lefty?</br>      <br>Is it just me or has all the girls become slutty af</br>    <br>... i dont mind at all.. this is her new IG avatar pic</br>  <br><br>It has always been that way.

I hope I die before I get that old</br></br>  why, so they could sit in jail &amp; waste taxpayer money? <br><br>eye for an eye I say</br></br>  <br>12</br>  <br>this<br><br>i dont think some people do derserve to die. nobody deserves to die. but some people are beyond saving and will cause more harm if left alive.</br></br></br>  <br>This. It's fucking expensive otherwise. OP is mad because he's on deathrow</br>  <br><br>Bullets are fairly cheap round hear boah</br></br>  death penalty is a big deterrent to crime. if we didn't have it, the country would be overrun with murderers  <br>the people that disagree with the death penalty are the same that vote for hilary. they have no real world experience and have never seen a human horror in their life. Kill em all and kill em fast</br>  <br>when i was about 7<br>back then i realized that death penalty is a softer penalty than beeing imprisoned for 100 years and/or beeing tortured</br></br>  the entire US justice system does not work. <br>death penalty is the biggest fuck up society has done.</br>  <br>how is high school going?</br>  <br>When I was a child I thought an eye for an eye was a good policy.<br>When I was a teen I believed some totally stupid shit about how incarceration was bad.<br>Now I firmly have solidified beliefs of harsher punishments, death penalties and forced castration as a good thing.</br></br></br>  <br>I almost cut myself with that post</br>  David Milgaard proved it to me and he wasn't even on death row. I don't trust the justice system one fucking bit. There is no 100 percent for sure case. Even Paul Bernardo is not 100 percent he was a sick fuck yes but we don't have him on tape killing those girls.  <br>A eye for a eye</br>  <br><br>....sensible chuckle...</br></br>  You faggot realize it costs over 300k a year to hold a death row inmate? Add to this the several thousand dollar drug cocktail to kill the inmate so the dont feelany pain  <br>Said by no one ever.</br>  2 and a half. I remember the day because it was the last time I shat a diaper. Once I knew the toilet was where I needed to think hard, bam, yo, "nigga, tha deff penalty gay shit".  <br>So if someone came in your house, tormented your whole family (parents, siblings, cousins, nephew, etc.) raped them, killed them, and made you watch the whole thing, you believe they don't deserve to die. I think retards like you need to die. What the fuck is the point of wasting any time of having them in prison? What, are they ever going to return to civilized life after killing a whole family? No. Fuck off.</br>  <br><br>MODS</br></br>  plenty of crimes deserve the death penalty. but police and prosecutors have been proven to fuck up or just lie in the past and then execute innocent people. so I'm against it.  <br><br>you have it all figured out then? The solution is simple and cheap in your opinion?<br><br>Why have the supreme court then, better yet, do away with the cost of courts and judges<br><br>We can save more money and not have politicians who pass laws<br><br>so the cheapest and best way is to do what I say!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I wish I could buy a Lethal Injection legally so I could be spared from the faggotry that is /b/.  <br>Careful with that edge there kiddo</br>  <br>This</br>  <br>Says a faggot who never been to prison<br><br>i'd choose death over 10 years in a box. hell, i'd choose quick death over 1 year in a box</br></br></br>  <br><br>The death penalty is pointless because it only speeds up the process of going to heaven or hell depending on the conviction</br></br>  <br>no, they dont deserve to die. but yes i would love to see them get the death penalty. <br><br>nobody deserves to die, but like i said, some people are better off dead.</br></br></br>  <br>is it not true or what?<br>didn`t you all realize it?</br></br>  <br>12 or so. Then at 19 I changed and understood vengeance then I read some facts and yeah, it doesn't work to deter anyone and it's just a bunch of bullshit that puts like a third of the people on death row to death even though they might be innocent. <br><br>If be for it if the law said "without any doubt" vs "reasonable doubt".</br></br></br>  <br>Are you for euthanasia? If not, burn in hell hypocrite.</br>  <br><br>innocent until proven guilty is a technicality<br>innocent unless proven guilty the defendant has a chance.</br></br></br>  <br>Plus, death is far asier than a life of incarceration . If i was convicted of murder, id kill myself on the first night and die a free man</br>  <br>If we did it in a meaningful way like shooting or hanging them and didn't dick around and wait multiple years to give them a shot it might deter future criminals</br>  i support death penalty but only for traitors  <br><br>would be cheaper, just walk around with baseball bats and no worries about police, jail, judges and all that money gone to waste</br></br>  <br>are you refering to the lenght of time it takes to enact the death penalty? About 16 years old. <br><br>Inmates should not have to wait 15 years between sentencing and execution, that is cruelty.</br></br></br>  <br>your statement is true, but you are missing the point. We want a better place to live in and you're talking about torture, punishment and shit</br>  7th grade.<br><br>It's hypocritical and it's dangerous. For now we murder only those who commit horribly evil acts, but in a corrupt system that perspective can slowly be warped. There's no protection against a corrupt justice system that deems you worthy of death when you might not be. Why risk killing the innocent, which we know we have, and why risk allowing the state or your peers to determine your right to life? Isolate them and keep them alive in an environment where they are so bored and miserable and cut off that they wish they weren't alive. They can take their own life if they so choose.</br></br>  <br>I never trusted the government with the power to kill people.<br><br>Although there are things that I believe the people should be able to kill you for.<br><br>For example, if I catch you raping a woman in the act causing serious life threatening harm or kidnapping someone's child I'm shooting you in the face, and where I live I'd be legally in the clear.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>and pass up all the free food and lodging?</br></br>  <br><br>They should just put a bullet in death row inmates instead of spending 300k a year on them and letting them live a little longer.</br></br>  <br>I'm not that anon , but that wasnt that edgy . he has a point</br>  <br> Waste Taxpayer money <br> It costs more to kill someone through our court system in America than it does to feed and house them until they die slowly <br> The amount of people we've killed that have later been found innocent is extreme <br> The waiting lists to be the one to pull the lever for the one on death row is a testament to how disgusting the death penalty system is  <br><br>Good conversation 4chan. Really excellent testament to how Summer really brings out the middle school logic in us all.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> he din do nuthin <br> he was spreddin jesus' word <br><br>doubt v reasonable doubt<br><br>there's always doubt because people don't want to face the facts that their child is a heartless fucker. imo it seems like people who are anti death penalty for reasons other than that it is fucking expensive and poorly managed are retards who are anti punishment in general. <br><br>how hard is it to stay off death row, just don't kill people in cold blood. or don't be black, one of the two</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i thought we were talking about death penalty.....it´s still used because of various reasons; one of them is because people think it`s the worst possible penalty</br>  <br>Thing is the criminal justice system is far from perfect. You can get out of jail, you can't get out of a hole in the ground. <br><br>Many,many times over people who had been innocent had been put to death, which sure they weren't the best person on the planet, but many didnt deserve death as a sentence.<br><br>Bush JR. Put a lot of people to death in Texas, including mentally sick people, to pad his own stats, then prayed the guilt away, cus he's a good "Christian" yet he behaved more like an Old testament goat screwing kiker. <br><br>Again, since police lie, and they lie a lot to pad their stats and conviction rate, the death penalty is not only inhumane but cruel. Basically what the goat fuckers in the middle east do to people they capture.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>20 and still counting.</br>  <br><br>Always like the idea of justice, so yeah never<br><br>Speaking of ISIS fuck yeah those guys know a thing or two and instant payback</br></br></br></br>  <br>the problem is not the penalty, the problem is the justice, it fails a lot from cops to judges</br>  The death penalty is good. It's just the way we do it. I don't know why we ever got rid of burning ay the stake. Fire is cheap.  <br>How was what I said edgy at all? It's an entirely valid question.<br><br><br>So... You just said that you want to see them die, and they are better off dead, but they shouldn't die.</br></br></br></br>  <br>All though prisoners eat better than most of us, i am not a cat. To me, a meaningful life consists of more than just good food and shelter</br>  <br>You assume that it is "retarded". A question that assumes an opinion on an issue like that is not even worth answering. You are probably some leftard who thinks of himself as morally superior. So typical.</br>  <br>30, still pro-death.</br>  <br>Cruel and Unusual punishment.</br>  <br>whatever age I was when I watched John Oliver's Last Week Tonight on the death penalty<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Kye<wbr>2oX-b39E</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>Who the fuck cares. If you did something bad enough to be killed you deserve cruel and unusual.</br>  <br> All though prisoners eat better than most of us <br>u wut m8?<br>prison food is made of stuff that cost $1 per meal</br></br></br>  http://www.cbsnews.com/news/inmate-<wbr>david-zink-lauds-death-penalty-befo<wbr>re-being-executed/<br><br>This guy thinks it's good, I think he deserves it</br></br></wbr></wbr>  <br><br>well it does cut down on recidivism</br></br>  <br>Around 11<br>I'm 20 now.</br></br>  <br><br>When I realized that we don't use it on retards who can never produce in society, and only drain resources. <br><br> We should also use it on faggots <br> and pedophiles like OP </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Add to this the number of innocent people that are on death row right now.</br></br>  <br>Thus why the founding fathers were smarter than your inbred ass. <br><br>VIIIth Amendment of the Constitution.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm sorry? Have you eaten prison food? You ever watched that show "Beyond Scared Straight", where at risk teens spend a day in the jail? Out of all the episodes I have watched, not once have I ever see a kid enjoy the food. Most of them refuse to eat, gag as they eat it, cry, and some throw up. I highly doubt that prison food is even remotely close to a decent meal. McDonalds serves better food than the prison system and McDonalds makes "hamburger" out of absolute bullshit.</br>  <br>If the pet does something bad.... then yes. But why murder innocent pets?</br>  <br>Never.</br>  <br><br>There is nothing cruel or unusual about death.<br><br>It is part of life.<br><br>Allowing certain types to live is however cruel to those who want to live prosperous lives.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I don't believe death penalty is a good method of punishment. I trust more torture. Also all muslims should be dead.  Execution is an inexpensive and efficient way to rid society of scum<br><br>It's the appeals process that is expensive and time consuming<br><br>If there is any doubt at all that the person committed the crime give them life in prison<br><br>But if you know beyond a shadow of a doubt (Lots of reliable witnesses, confessions, etc.) that they did the crime - Put a couple of bullets in them and be done with it</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh good gosh no. It would be cruel, sadistic and inhumane to deprive a human being of even a single serving of the nutritious food that is recommended by Canada's food guide. Yes, we feed our prisoners better than we feed ourselves. Look at the pictures of prison meals compared to school cafeteria meals for a good laugh</br>  <br>In a perfect society, where the Justice system isn't corrupt or lead by people who are corruptible it works. We don't live in an ideal society and many people are put to death who deserve it but many as well for political pressure or otherwise are put to death who are politically pressured or silence by the justice system. <br><br>People who are convicted of heinous crimes.
