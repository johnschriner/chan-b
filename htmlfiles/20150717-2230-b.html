A friend of my younger sister from some small hick town in Ohio; she's in South Carolina with her family for summer break.<br><br> posts this photo of them eating out for dinner <br> her bitch friends from Ohio jump in and say that it's too much for a girl her age and size <br> she gets upset and agrees  <br> her family jump in and defend her saying its a normal portion for a girl <br> dad goes full blown CYBER POLIZEI BAKTRAKING CONSEQUENCES <br> she messages my sister saying she is having a shit summer and her 4th of July is ruined <br><br>Is this really a child's/girl's portion in the US? I mean she ate it all and was happy with it, so no problem there. I couldn't eat all that in one sitting though. Could you? What exactly do you feed a pre-teen girl to keep her healthy?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  This is a pretty stupid thread. That's red robin, used to serve there. Gross as shit. Everyone who eats there is a shitty fattoid downy. "10000 FRIES FOR FREE PLEASE!!!"  <br> What exactly do you feed a pre-teen girl to keep her healthy? <br><br>I would give her some re-heated pasta. Just like you have served to us.</br></br></br>  <br>This has to be the weirdest pasta ive seen</br>  Why is /b/ just shitty pasta now?<br><br>And a "healthy food portion" completely depends on her activity level</br></br>    I'M SO TIRED OF SEEING THIS FUCKING THREAD  <br>You couldn't eat that in one sitting? <br><br>5 meat units, some coleslaw that no one ever eats, and like a cup of orange something.</br></br></br>  <br>I usually eat once a day, if that. So yeah, I might be able to eat all that in 1 sitting. What hick town in Ohio is she from?</br>  weak copy pasta  <br>looks like cheesy potatoes or macaroni</br>  <br>If she sits around doing nothing, that may be a bit too much. But on the other hand if she does sports that's fine and she'll likely be hungry when they get back home from the restaurant too.</br>  Going by the fact that she's thin (not to mention exceptionally attractive) I'm going to have to say that, no, that is not too large of a portion.  <br>i don't know but she moved to Toledo for junior high school. All girls school and they give her so much shit.</br>  <br> So this pic came across my newsfeed on FB. A friend of my younger sister from some small hick town in Ohio; she's in South Carolina with her family for summer break. <br> &gt;posts this photo of them eating out for dinner <br> &gt;her bitch friends from Ohio jump in and say that it's too much for a girl her age and size <br> &gt;she gets upset and agrees  <br> &gt;her family jump in and defend her saying its a normal portion for a girl <br> &gt;dad goes full blown CYBER POLIZEI BAKTRAKING CONSEQUENCES <br> &gt;drives all the way to OPs house and beats the shit out of him for posting such stale pasta <br> &gt;she messages my sister saying she is having a great summer because her dad beat OPs faggot ass <br> Is OP a faggot and a certified nigger?.

Why must you faggots repost shit. And act as if oh I made this post never posted it before HAHA  NZ Thread  <br> .gif </br>  <br> .fag </br>  <br>H-how did you know?</br>    oh cool a NZ thread. Cos I have got something to show you motherfuckers. It is a Wellington only thing but once I show you, you will be all like, holy shit balls batman, and you will literally stop what you are doing that instant to go and check it out. I'll brb, I need to upload the photo to my laptop.  <br>Did you shit in the bucket fountain?</br>  <br>nah. I don't think the bucket fountain is there at the moment. but this is wayyyyyyyyy better. It's gonna blow your mind.</br>  <br> It is a Wellington only thing but once I show you, you will be all like, holy shit balls batman <br>So you made a gluten-free, oragnic, craft beer?</br></br>  <br>omg shes scrumptious etc</br>  <br>Did you fuck NF?</br>  <br>Here it is motherfuckers. It's a half kilo of Spanish chorizo salami I got at Chaffers New World. They are giving these things away for 99cents each. That is fucking cheaper than mince, and it's salami, from Spain. I got all this for just under $5. Now if that is a steal then I don't know what the fuck is.</br>    <br>I've eaten arse than looked fresher than that.</br>  <br>Pedo.</br>    Sup all, in Dunedin streaming the rugby and playing some Burnout. How is everyone? And how much do you think the All Blacks will win by?  <br>Id like to say 12. I feel more like a 7 tho since its a new season and the team wont have had too much time together because of super rugby.</br>    <br>That filename tho</br>  <br>Drinking and watching Some Like It Hot. Fuck Marilyn Monroe was sexy.</br>  <br>Did you play ruggers at school, NF?</br>  <br>Yeah I'm thinking 1-12 too. Pumas will win a game this year, but not this one<br>In other words. Get up McCaw<br><br>Nice! More of a Grace Kelly man but big ups to ya. I'm on Speights, what are you drinking?</br></br></br></br>  <br>not sure when the evening ends and night begins.<br>not sure if saying good night is only customary to say before going to sleep.<br>not sure how to react to your reply.</br></br></br>  <br>Lunchtime shit at primary. Loved it. Couldnt play anymore when I got to college because a little guy like me would end up fucking destroyed by Samoans and my various physical problems got worse so I just switched to caring more about professional shit.</br>  <br>I'm drinking Mystic Ridge box wine, as I've said in previous threads it's the cheapest way to get drunk.</br>  <br><br><br/></br></br>  <br>Ah that's right. It's depending on where you live, pretty sure we've got a trash beer that's nearly 1/1 dollar to standard. How much is it dollar to standard wise?</br>  <br> Loved it <br> Couldnt play <br> various physical problems got worse <br>I'm sorry to hear that. Ever thought about being a reff?</br></br></br></br>  <br>i think he mentioned $24 dollhairs to 31 standarsd.</br>  <br>Correct.</br>  <br>That'd be too much too. I have ligament and asthma problems. Getting fit can only do so much and prolonged running fucking kills me.</br>  this thread needs more goof  Any oc nudes?  <br><br>Actually the quickest way to get drunk is with fortified wine like port or sherry. Its the optimum percentage for getting drunk on. Any lower percentage of alcohol and it'll take longer, and higher percentage alcohol doesn't get absorbed any quicker.</br></br>    So what has NZ given the world except a set for lotr?<br>Give us something to admire, sheepfuckers</br>  Hi friendz &lt;3<br><br>who here is running windows 10?</br></br>  <br>Jesus christ that's insane. Should get into it but I cannot stand Goon</br>  <br>  <br>cardio kills gains</br></br>  <br>Ernest Rutherford and climbing a mountain for the sake of it.</br>  <br>Oh, guts.<br><br>Become a coach.<br><br> "why would I want to become a bus?" </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I said cheapest, not quickest.</br>  <br>I recently found some cheap wine that is cheaper than a bottle of scumpy and has more standards.</br>  <br>You sound like you need a cute boy to protect you</br>  <br>Windows 95 is the best as long as you know how to use it.<br><br>http://windows95tips.com/</br></br></br>  <br>God lol. Only thing Im qualified to coach is littelies and Im not sure Im ready for the stress of teaching a rugby team or children how to pass a ball.</br>    <br>Is it canned? Becuase that's the 3rd best dollar to standards ratio I've ever seen</br>  <br>canned?<br><br>its just a normal bottle of wine. scrump was like 9.80 and this bottle of wine was like 8.60.<br>14% 8.3 standards.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Geez you are difficult. Just suck Ritchies cock then.<br><br> "he's a cheat" <br> "he probably wouldn't cum" </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>At $25 its still pretty cheap and probably tastes better than cheap wine</br></br>  <br>If you drink it through a straw you barely taste it.</br>  <br>How much for $25?</br>  <br>Nah. Ill just be content watching the Hurricanes blow it season after season.</br>  sweet as  <br>Oh damn nice. I've found $10 for a box of 12 cans of wine. 14%, tasted like ass. Got me good</br>  <br>Probably won't bother. Like I love wine and can skull most forms of alcohol, but goon does something to me</br>  <br>They sell canned wine?</br>  <br>can't say I've seen a can of wine.</br>  <br>Yes. It's hard to find now but some massive conglomerate who thought it was a great idea. It flopped and it tasted like ass. Sold ridiculously cheap to get them all out</br>  <br>Well if Canadians drink bagged milk.</br>  <br><br>750ml bottle, but there's no feeling like being drunk from downing one bottle. You can get 2L for $16 in some places tho</br></br>  <br>http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/<wbr>news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=11<wbr>482639&amp;ref=NZH_FBpage</wbr></wbr></br>  <br>http://wineinacan.com/<br>It was this shit. they tried to entertain the thought in some Liquorlands and it got poopooed</br></br>  its illegal to troll in nz weak  <br>fuck I hate indians</br>  <br>I finished a bottle the other night.

Prove it  <br>So much this. Sooo muuuch........ My dearest /b/ros. I'm ttelling you.</br>  <br>Conspiracy theories?<br>Aliens in korea?</br></br>  <br>are you native in south land?</br>  <br>Yes, native. I am in America, studying abroad.</br>  <br>all the conspiracy in korea is related to the north</br>  <br>몇년 사셨어요?</br>  <br>why are you being an attention whore?</br>  <br>The X-Files is popular - of course, it is an old series, but we even call rumors/gossip "X-Files".</br>  <br>Did king john un invent prawns?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;628537141 <br> What i was asking, despite all the possible economical and ideological problems of a reunification, do you people still think that the poeple from west and north belong together? <br>Not sure if you're still here. Since the end of cold war the fervour for reunification has died somewhat, especially with the younger generation but its still there. South Koreans generally still consider the North Koreans as the same Korean people, only divided by a political border.</br></br>  <br>아니요, 지난 가을에 도착했어요.</br>  <br> Conspiracy theories? <br>Some. The one in my recent memory is regarding the sinking of the South Korean patrol ship "Cheonan". Bunch of people in subways handing out pamphlets about how North Korean torpedoes can't melt South Korean ship hulls<br><br>http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/p<wbr>eterfoster/100042229/cheonan-sinkin<wbr>g-top-ten-conspiracy-theories/</wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>아직 오래 있으시지 않으셨네<br>한국 어디에서 오셨어요?</br></br>  <br>still here, thanks for the answer...</br>  <br>Hows kim jong un?</br>  <br>Ah, I was splitting my ideas up among several posts, so you may not have clearly understood my point.<br>From what I hear from the elders in the family and their friends, the older generation favors reunification despite the war because the North Korean citizens trapped in that country have closer relationships to them than to my generation. People of my generation do not think much of reunification, since the North has been well established since our birth. Personally, I just take the North for granted and do not actively promote any sort of reunification. However, it would not be bad for such a thing to happen. Of course, there are many factors that determine whether reunification would benefit the South. Emotions overflow the older generation's judgement, so all we younger ones have to base our preference toward reunification are facts such as the two countries' economics, cultures, etc. Please ask more if you want.</br></br>  <br>나는 김정은 을 사랑깜둥이 새끼 의 성기 입니다</br>  <br>a fat fag</br>  <br>why do asians look like they have downs syndrome?</br>  <br>Does your infrared vision help you catch prey?<br>Do you rattle or hiss to scare away predators?<br>What kind of things eat koreans?<br>Why do you have a rainbow poop museum in your country?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why are you so fucking useless?

No dice, should be atleast 17.5ft before i consider it.</br>  <br>This post makes me think of a jurassic mcdonalds.</br>  Not hungry, but wanna snack, there's cheap pizza or Chinese food that wasn't really my favorite (Shiggen teriyaki).<br><br>Gotta go put clothes in dryer.</br></br>  <br> 6 pc. dino McNiggers <br>Where do the nuggets come from?<br> ROOOOOOOOAARRRRRR </br></br></br>  <br>Guess that means you should be eating cheap pizza.</br>  hold on ill bake new bread  where's the bread  <br>Just grabbed some cheap pizza from the kitchen, and holy fuck, does it taste bad when it's cold. I never have this problem with my pizza. I'll go finish off my chow mein instead.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;628522812 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;628522812 </br>  <br>It's only 1. You should just go get something fresh and reward yourself for not kicking in someone's door today. <br>It'll probably be the last time you get to really enjoy yourself with that car debt</br></br>  <br>Nah, I don't have any rage whatsoever today. And I didn't buy the pizza, and I have insurance, just my deductible will be what rapes me.</br>  <br>So then you have no excuse to eat things you don't like and to go get something tasty</br>  <br>I have no car, so no drive through for me! I got some good food laying around, just lazy as fuck. Though I'll probably just get some more A&amp;W and relax.<br><br>What about you?</br></br></br>  <br>A&amp;W is pretty good.</br>  <br>It's my second favorite way to relax. After work, a cold can of A&amp;W, some comedy shows or anime, and I'm set.</br>  <br>Oh I see. A&amp;W actually sounds pretty good right now. <br><br>I just ate a pepperoni and cheese stick. Frozen pizza in the fridge. I had japanese for dinner so I'm not too hungry</br></br></br>  <br> Japanese <br>Shaaaaaaaaare!</br></br>  <br>But it's all in my stomach!</br>  <br>There's no leftovers?</br>  <br>None. The only thing left is some flavor on my tongue I'd say</br>  <br>......................<br>I kind of want to taste. <br>No homo.</br></br></br>  <br>That's pretty homo<br>I'll just believe it's the taste you're after though.</br></br>  <br>Haha, if it's not Miso Soup, I'll be sad.</br>  <br>Miso soup, salad with bacon bits(what?), chicken and shrimp with a ton of vegetables, fried rice, a couple scallops swiped from my friends plate and rounded out with orange sherbert icecream <br><br>Sure you'll get one of those.</br></br></br>  <br> That amazing feast <br>I wish I could have been your friend. Dammit!</br></br>  <br>It was fantastic! Even the chef was super friendly. <br>They have to compete with several other japanese places within three blocks so they had to come up with a way to out do the others. Turns out quantity was their delicious thinking</br></br>  <br>Oh, you went out to eat? That's even better! And those type of restaurants I've noticed tend to give out big as fuck portions. <br><br>Goddamn, it sounds like you had an amazing dinner. I'm super jealous now.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah! My family can't possibly pull off japanese. Everyone at my table had to get a box outside of my friend and I. <br>Probably the best dinner I've had in 6 months (since the last time I was there) <br>Next big family/friend gathering you have head out and hit one of those places up!</br></br></br>  <br>I went to one like 2 months ago, wasn't sure about what I wanted to eat, but I was given miso soup and some sushi, so I was content. Then others shared their food with me, to try, and I found it amazing.</br>  <br>Did you figure out your favorite thing from there so you know what to order next time? <br>Also I like that you're such a big fan of miso soup. Honestly not a lot of people pay attention to the soup they bring out at first and it's a bit of a bummer since it has so much flavor to it. I'm not even a big fan of soup but I will take miso any day.</br></br>  Beep.  <br>Faggot.</br>  <br><br>You are convincing.</br></br>  <br>Back when I attended college, they made miso soup there fresh, and I dunno if they made a slightly different version or what, but it was delicious! It was the usual stuff, with green onions, seaweed, and tofu inside. A 20 oz cup was only like $1.70, so I could get a drink and eat for cheap! Then one day, the college restaurant stopped serving it. I asked why, and they said they weren't selling as much, and I was sad as fuck....<br><br>And you're sexy.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I would post a witty image but...</br></br>  <br> Not joining the other spammed thread already in progress <br><br>You getz no love from me!</br></br></br>  <br>People just don't appreciate good soup. That's a good deal for that too. I wish I had a place I could just buy a couple cups of miso at and just go on about my day. <br>Guess it's time to just start making it myself.</br></br>  <br><br>That happened last time. Ill scope it out.</br></br>  <br>In between classes, since I had no job, but financial aid, I would budget myself to only spend $2 a day/night on snacks while attending, to hold me over until I got home and enjoyed my late dinner. Miso soup until it ran out, then I would just buy two small bags of chips. Cool Ranch Doritos and Funyuns.<br><br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;628522812 </br></br></br>  <br>Your school didn't have some kind of meal plan? I didn't attend an actual university but the ones I know of tended to have something to feed the students. Another good way to gouge them out of money but since it was covered in tuition no one cared that much. <br>Every time I would visit my friends at the end of the semester they would just shove their card in my hand and tell me to go help myself. <br>I miss Funyuns. I should get a bag later</br></br></br>  <br>I think so, but I still had to pay for it or something, kind of or whatever. But I had to pay for this card, and I attended evening classes, so the cafeteria was always closed when I arrived.<br><br>I can share Funyuns, they're so damn good. <br><br>But yeah, no free food for me, just all my classes covered and money to pay for books, and anything extra was mine to keep and/or spend.</br></br></br></br></br>  *crosses arms*<br><br>Like, what even is this? If they wanted to piss us off they could post gay porn. But instead they post g/fur/! Why?</br></br>  <br>Because most straight furs hate penises.</br>  <br>Ah alright that makes sense. No point in spending money if you're never going to benefit from it. Hopefully you got a nice coverage check and was able to at least do some celebrating at the end of the year.<br>I'll save some for you. So you don't have to kiss me to enjoy. <br><br><br>Always good to stick with the theme man.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Don't have to kiss me to enjoy <br>I wasn't thinking of that until now....hahahaha<br><br>I really didn't party much during college, was too busy playing Ingress and watching anime.</br></br></br></br>  Huh, it got pruned.  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;628527473 <br><br>Still up here.</br></br></br>  <br><br>What do you do with your life? Like, so I can slowly build up a profile to send to the CIA. <br><br>I mean so that I can build a sense of comradeship within our social hexagon. <br><br>I mean because no reason.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Haha, it's a strong flavor, so i'm sure it would stick around my lips and mouth for a good while. It would probably be pretty fun trying to get it all. A pretty heavy make out session. <br><br>Nothing wrong with that. You didn't try to attend any of the local anime clubs?</br></br></br>  <br>Watch that next thread, waiting for Wizard to finish my dox.<br><br><br>Stahp your temptation, dammit! Hahhaha<br><br>And no, I don't like anime clubs or furry conventions, too much cringe, man. I just like enjoying it on my own or with very few friends and that's it. Like, just how I am.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Heh, I'm just saying. It would be a pretty good time. <br><br>I've seen a few clubs out there that aren't so bad, but yeah the one's that make it big on the net drive me away too. No club for not spegs. Things are better in small groups anyway.</br></br></br>  <br>I do like funyuns....but I mean, can't beat that crunch. I'm perfectly fine on this place, but once I close the laptop, I'm back to "normal".</br>  <br>A let down. Fresh is best though. <br>That's how I feel the majority of 4chan users are. Still able to tell the difference and what is appropriate outside of the web.<br>Of course with how many memes and shit fall outside the net now the lines getting more blurred. Still a ways away from being accepting of otaku or furs though I think.</br></br></br>  <br>I refuse to believe I'm a true furry, because I hate the conventions, I'm afraid of the fegits in the suits and cringe hard, and only fap and admire the artwork.<br><br>Though the round chips are big enough to share.</br></br></br>  <br>Keep that shit at home. I wouldn't mind going to a convention though, honestly. I think it would be an interesting experience. Could at least get some good rare art from the sellers. <br><br>Would you like to share? You take half the ring and I take the other? We could meet in the middle and feel embarrassed</br></br></br>  <br>If I want artwork, maybe. But I just...can't stand that environment, and would be panicked the whole time.<br><br>I mean for sure I'm not going alone. Or I might. But holy shit man....I'm feeling uncomfortable just thinking about it.<br><br> Feeling embarrassed <br><br>I'd need all my half for sure, so it's not my fault your lips touched mine, right?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But you would be the most normal thing out of there. You could just pretend to be some confused local wandering around until you bought the artwork. That's kind of cute though. <br><br>Exactly. I'm not going to let you just take my half either. Might have to get a bit aggressive with it.</br></br></br>  <br>I guess so. I mean, as long as I didn't get recognized, I think I'd be okay. But I swear to god, if anyone but Gorsha or a Gorsha suit tries to hug me, I'm fucking swinging. Ewwwwwwwwwwwwwww. It's just really not my thing.<br><br>I'm very skilled with my tongue, I'll assure you, that this is my chip. They're just too delicious.</br></br></br>  *sits cross legged*<br><br>This night has been thoroughly unproductive.</br></br>  That's because you refuse to live.  <br><br>*remains seated*</br></br>  <br>Just Jason Afex getting cucked by Kaiber.<br><br>The more popular they get and the further they collaborate, the more corrupted they become.<br>Pretty sad, really.</br></br></br></br>   Not sitting on a dick <br/>  <br>I don't think people really just hug strangers randomly at those things. I think people who want a hug motion to the suiters first, or if it's a cute girl someone wants to get close to. Of course I'm sure there's exceptions from a few weirdos. Are you famous in the fur community outside of 4chan?<br><br>I will just have to steal it from your mouth then if I lose. <br><br><br>Would you like a hug or something? <br>I haven't even bothered keeping up with the other threads.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not famous outside of this place, and I'm not even famous here, I'm just an infamously gay person who changes the filenames of images.<br><br>That's not all you'd steal~</br></br></br>  <br><br>Arrent we all?</br></br>  <br>I dunno, are you straight and change the filenames constantly?</br>  <br>No reason to worry then! Besides I'm sure you can take on your average fursuiter. Hell probably multiple. A pretty weak and timid group<br><br>Heh oh yeah? What else might I get?</br></br></br>  <br><br>No, wait. <br><br>To the escape pod! <br><br>*Jettison's self into the zone.*</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I forgot to post my cringe proof.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=xHZ<wbr>9SwTk2UE</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>And yeah. It's just...meh. They're grown ass adults dressing up and pretending they're the animal.<br><br>And well...uh....well...&lt;3<br><br>Well, there goes my buddy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I believe every news group for anything not popular is there to just make people cringe. Might as well exploit them for cash. <br>Maybe I'm just weird though since I don't find this completely horrifying. <br> all these looks from the reporter <br>Should have probably just called in sick today<br><br>You're pretty cute &lt;3</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She probably got stuck with it unwillingly because she fucked up a report or was almost fired. She looked as uncomfortable as I would, just I'd be even more obviously uncomfortable.<br><br>I just didn't like the "leader" furry how he fursonafied as a "puppy". And the one with the purple suit with a moving mouth, like, his logic annoyed me. <br><br> You can't just walk up to someone and just go "Aaaaahh, oh my god" in public without a suit, you know!? <br><br>As if a suit makes it any better.<br><br>And you know nothing of me!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I would like to see a news report from someone as uncomfortable as you apparently. That would be really good. <br>The suit hides your identity. It's almost the same as being anonymous in public. Except you know, if you're wearing the suit you stick out a whole lot more, just no one knows who is actually inside so it doesn't come back on you (unless you're arrested)<br>Also I'd be a lot more terrified if someone just started yelling at me if they were not dressed as a cartoon character. <br><br>Oh sorry you're right. I guess you just seem cute based off the nights interactions. Maybe you're a monster.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well...I would never wanna do that. Ever. I mean....it's just too much cringe for me.<br><br>And I'm Mexican, how can that be cute? I just like Funyuns. And you.</br></br></br>  <br>Heh that's fine. I like weird and embarrassing things, so I might try to attend the big convention. Depending on how much they cost. <br><br>Mexicans can be cute sometimes. You like me? Enough to share your Funyuns? <br>And your lips?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think they're very expensive. <br><br>And uh.....yeah....I-I mean, it's just sharing chips, right? Not lips...?</br></br></br>  <br>50 bucks for a few days isn't bad. If I never return from the convention next year don't look for me. I'm already dead. <br><br>Oh yeah, of course. Just chips. Willing to risk lips for the chips.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd miss you if you died....no homo.<br><br>If I held a chip sticking out of my mouth, you won't try to grab it, would you?</br></br></br>  <br>Same. Just a touch of homo<br>Not with my hands no. Maybe with my mouth, but I don't think I can be blamed for that can I? I can't resist the flavor. <br>Lips are moving on their own.</br></br></br>  <br>I uh....well...I mean...that's solid logic for sure...it's only because of the delicious chips...</br>  Right. and if there happens to just be a delicious person attached to the other side of that chip. You know, what can you do?  <br>I'm only doing it to make sure to clean off the crumbs off your face. I have to be a nice host, you know~</br>  <br>Of course! You wouldn't want to embarrass your guests with a messy face. <br>Sounds like you might be moving your lips on places other than just mine though when you put it that way.</br></br>  <br>You know how messy those chips get, the crumbs get everywhere, and I mean everywhere, and we can't waste that taste, can we?</br>  Not a single crumb can be allowed to escape our mouths. <br>I felt my blood rush somewhere else. I'm starting to think the chips might be a bit of a distraction.</br>  Just relax, I'm only licking your face, that's not bad or gay, is it? I mean, I love funyuns...  <br>I don't think so. but what if I ended up dropping funyuns down my shirt? Would you go after those?</br>  Let's all go farther down the rabbit's hole  <br><br>lets not</br></br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br>Nah rather a horse cock.<br><br>Apartment living??<br><br>Ahh well maybe it's not for you.<br><br>We shall. Got 3 more exercises to do.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Yep</br>        <br>i guess it isnt. still willing to give it a shot at home, just need some recommendations.</br>  <br>Adjustable dumbbells with a adjustable bench. Small and you should be able to do everything.</br>  what fuck??      <br>Hmm, maybe.</br>            <br>See <br><br>Or get a set of kettle balls and use them.<br><br>Saved!<br><br>Saved!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>      <br>Never heard of those.</br>      <br>heh, no money for pretty much anything. alright, ill figure something out, thanks<br>more tigers are needed</br></br>      God dam I love face pulls!<br><br>Heavy weight with 1single wide handle. Use both hands and swing it from behind and below your knees to above and in front of head. Works whole body.</br></br>  <br>Uh okay</br>  <br>is there anything you recommend w/o equipment</br>  <br>Lies!! Fill milk jugs with dirt / sand. Bam insta dumbbells!</br>  <br>Ah okay.<br><br>I need to get into a routine that doesn't hurt my shoulders.</br></br></br>  <br>stick ice cubes in your bum, it's great.</br>      <br>imagine going outside and filling jugs with dirt, that sure would be funny<br><br>ice cubes?<br>in MY bum? its more common than you think...</br></br></br></br>  <br>kek</br>  <br><br>i'm being completely serious here.</br></br>  Picture is coming along<br/>  <br>Jumping. 4x15 jumps as high as you can. Then piah ups till failure.<br><br>Did your ACL?<br><br>Done that. Now onto ginger.<br><br>Saved!<br><br>Imagine not carrying what others thought of you. Fuck you get some shit done huh?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br>That's not a rabbit.<br><br>I bet his butthole smells nice, though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Naw, just was in some car accidents and popped both out of the sockets.</br>  <br>g-ginger? like the vegetable? o-okay..</br>    <br> torn between wanting to believe you and not wanting to look stupid if false <br>is this something anyone else here has tried?</br></br>  <br>yeah, imagine that. would be nice, but i cant seem to "want" to get there</br>  <br>sticking substances in your butt is usually not a good idea</br>  <br>No I honestly did it a few nights ago, it's pretty great. At first it's cold, but you know, that's to be expected. If you jerk off with it up there it feels great.</br>    <br>here<br><br>point taken, but how fun is life w/o risk</br></br></br>  <br><br>I mean it's literally just water, the worst that's gonna happen is that it'll melt.</br></br>  <br>Yes. It. Burns sop good.<br><br>Then stay where you are and be happy with what you got. I know I was for years, then I was not happy and wanted to be buff.</br></br></br>  <br><br>ok<br>will try with small amount and see how it goes<br>thanks for the tip</br></br></br></br>  <br>make an icecube of vodka and stick it in your butt.
