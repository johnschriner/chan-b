That's a strong common ground there. <br>Doesn't sound too much unlike this group. I don't see the roleplaying here as much anymore but for a group of straight people there have been a lot of cyber sessions. <br>Sounds great. I know how to make a hobo stove so we can make it man. I'm just too nice. Lent out money to friends who were having a rough time. I'd say it probably comes out to around a grand. Not the smartest move when you make minimum wage, but maybe I'll get it back. Glad you're only going to have to pay 500. Not that bad. <br>I'm a well wisher. I wish no ill, even if I have to filter pictures of old man dick when he's around. <br><br> select all images of skateboards <br>What's this shit now</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yay!</br>  <br>The glory of Bratwurst is for everyone!</br>  <br>I'm playing the ultimate danger game. Lurking an sfur thread not ten feet from where my grandmother is cooking lunch. And she keeps moving around. <br><br>Speaking of, does anyone know any good places to post furry writing? I've tried SoFurry, Weasyl, and Furaffinity, and on those sites users freely disregard anything that isn't porn.</br></br></br>  <br>Your mascot better be Osama.</br>  <br> I hate admitting it, but /g/ is right.

You'll get it back, niceness tends to come back the hell around when we need it most. We could just roast hot dogs on the hobo stove and tell stories and try not to die!<br><br>I would never filter you.<br><br> Not having a pass <br><br>Mmmmmmmm, German sausage....<br><br>You like to live dangerously?

My government doesn't even have the decency the NSA do to hide it, they're open about wanting to spy on people, and people are completely happy with it. <br>So Win7 or Win10, I'm not sure it matters to me.</br></br>    <br>Than Cuddle King it is.<br><br><br>Well fucked that up.<br>You should definitely pursue if she was cute. Just hold out long enough for her to get her shit together, or maybe persuade her to your side a bit while it's still going on. <br>A rough situation. Is that how you ended up falling for traps?<br>I sure hope so. It's a risky game that I don't like playing but I love my friends so I'm going to. Though honestly if they didn't pay me back for a good while it's not that big a deal I suppose. Sounds like fun. We can just pretend we're out camping and anyone who spits at us are just lizards or something. <br>Never say never friend. <br><br> having a pass <br>It's like you WANT to support Israel<br><br><br>Cuddle King</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Don't get the nazi garb but that dragon belly is fine and I would love to end up inside it.</br>  <br>Obviously its nazi dragon porn.</br>  <br>First off, you need a grill. A big hight adjustable one, ideally a tipod with a roast hanging down freely, allowing it to move.<br>Then you need fire. For meals taking less than an hour to get ready, a wooden fire is the best, ideally beech wood. It's also good for longer grilling, but will result in lots of work, so substitution with charcoal is an option. <br>Now you need meat. We usually get marinated pork (with some nice strands of fat). There are different ways to marinate them, and thickness may vary. <br>It is important to grill them slowly on the moving roast (going over the fire and away from it again all the time). For some really thick piece of meat this may take two hours upwards, but the resulting "steak" is so tender and juicy you'll not want anything else for a long time.<br>Picture of glory coming in later. Phone takes time.</br></br></br></br></br>      <br>Nice wall of text.</br>        <br><br>Twice in a row, damn.</br></br>    <br>This offends me.Cats and Dogs should not mix<br><br>Morning thread</br></br></br>  <br>It's microsoft selling your every move to advertisers though. And they have means implemented to recognize you based on how you type (no matter on which programm), so their advertisement contractors will always know who you are. No escape.</br>  <br>Hello, Waterson.</br>    <br>Now I'm Cuddle King!<br><br>I need to work on getting my shit together first, clean up my homefront before invading more territory or whatever. <br><br> Is that how you ended up falling for traps? <br>I'm laughing pretty good right now! Nah, the two I really cared about more than anything were just really sweet and just....gah! But I wasn't lonely at the time, just talking to people!<br><br>Just make sure that they remember is all, the money does help. <br><br>We can retreat into the box, we're safe there, until it gets repossessed. Then we're screwed and happy...<br><br>So you want me to filter you? &lt;/3<br><br>But I have a pass and I love it!<br><br>THIS IS WASN'T I WANTED! <br><br>But I can't understand this...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just woke up and now it's time for me to do my thing.surf 4chin</br>  <br>I like my current setup better anyway, so I don't think I'll be switching in the foreseeable future. <br><br>However, I've been meaning to install Linux, since it'll kick my productivity into high gear. I'm too stupid to install anything on it.</br></br></br>  <br>fuck.<br>age of the machines is starting, right?</br></br>          <br>We're losin' him, doc!</br>                <br>Maybe an image will help<br><br><br>If you need help with linux, I just installed it on an old desktop as a dual-boot.<br>It's pretty simple really, unless you want some fancy stuff (such as partitions available to both systems)<br>And even then I can tell you how to set it up and you should be fine.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We need to put him under first, doc!</br>    <br>Well. Google tracks what you do as we'll. If I image search the name of an animal it will usually find furry porn</br>    <br>Arnold's coming</br>  Hello thread! :3  <br>Any help you can give me is great. But I need to go for now. Later, everyone!<br><br>Doha, out. Or something...<br><br>I'm not quite sure how this works yet.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> All those weiners <br>Hahaha, faggot in training!<br><br>But seriously though, that looks super good. Is that a swinging grill?</br></br></br></br>    <br>Time to start protecting privacy it seems.<br><br><br>Hi there!</br></br></br></br>    <br>Hello, Eridian.</br>  <br>Bye Doha!!!</br>  <br><br>Hows it going? :D</br></br>  <br>well, huge corporations controlling the world instead of the estates we know doesn't seem to be such a dark future.<br>oh wait, it does.<br><br><br>good, it's not that liquid metal thing.<br>it can be killed.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a pretty fitting name I feel. <br>Yeah that would be a pretty good idea. Having a girl to take to your personal home is much better than sneaking around. Maybe she'll even have a job and want to move in sometime down the road. <br>They must have been extremely sweet in order to make you question your sexuality and not be lonely. Did the one ever return?<br>I won't let them forget, believe it. The red number on my account won't let me. <br>If we're having boxes repossessed we're doing something extremely wrong. <br>Of course not. You never know what could happen though. <br>I'm not going to lie, it does seem pretty nice. I should purchase one at some point.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Later, Doha.<br><br>I'm good, in a skype with Cuddle King over here.</br></br></br>  Windows 10 is out,should I uprgrade?  <br> that fucking cat <br>Katia please show me the pineapple yoyo trick</br></br>    <br>M'Ress. A character I find way too hot for only getting a few minutes of screentime in total.<br><br>Too bad Star Trek is dead, and they'll never bring her back.</br></br></br>  <br>No, don't!</br>  <br>Add me to the call nerdo :3<br><br>If you want to turn your computer into a cellphone.</br></br></br>  <br>Come back soon</br>  <br>Done.</br>  oh shit, I think I started the win10 download<br>abort! ABORT!!!</br>  Install gentoo?  Windows 10 at it's best  <br>Those are not Wieners. They wouldn't hold up well on the grill. It's a different kind of Bratwurst.<br>High amount of sausages because that meat needs two hours on the grill and everyone was hungry.<br><br>And of course the grill can swing and should do so whenever it can.<br><br><br>Nothing unusal here. Read up the terms and conditions of Windows 10 and decided that I won't use it if I can avoid.<br><br><br>See you!<br>Ask for Gears if you need help.<br><br><br> good, it's not that liquid metal thing. <br>Not YET</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do they make you sign your soul away?</br>  <br>A cell phone that's confirmed spyware and a huge security risk.</br>  <br>Jesus christ...<br>Win10 is the ultimate virus.</br></br>  <br>oh hells no.<br>at least we have grenade launchers and stuff.<br>and we know the catchphrase.</br></br></br>  <br>Not yet in any case. <br>Probably better to avoid it anyways...<br><br><br>Wait... <br>That wasn't just some furry's attempt to make a furry version?<br><br><br>They are not even trying to hide that they log your keys and get reports all files on your computer...<br>So yes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh for sure. She is a coworker actually, so we hang out all the time. She actually works tomorrow, so I might stop by tomorrow and whatnot.<br><br>Well, yeah....the first one was the sweetest trap I had ever met! And not sure who the one is...if you mean Sapphire, I haven't heard back in forever... &lt;/3<br><br>Nigga, you in the red? That's fucking terrible, why would you do that?<br><br>Who knows how long we will be broke, so they may take the boxes from us, even though they're boxes.<br><br>I know what will happen, you'll become too awesome.<br><br>And yeah, saves time and data to be honest. Very useful if you frequent this hellhole.<br><br>That's a fancy ass grill then, with a lot of free will! And shit man, all of it looks amazing.....what type?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Dat belly <br><br>Mmmmmmm</br></br></br>  <br>its literally<br>something<br>fucking<br>someone drew that in like a minute, and you like it?</br></br></br></br>  <br>this "getting user data to improve services" thing has gone too far.</br>  <br>I wish I could draw something like that in one minute.</br>  <br>Yes <br><br>That a problem?</br></br></br>    <br> what type? <br>These grills are the dominant kind here. Usually they are a bit smaller though.<br>What type of what?<br><br><br>Yep, way too far.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What's not to like? &lt;3</br>  <br>but cant you just open the windows firewall ( open the start menu and type wf.msc ), block everything by default, remove the allowed stuff and just allow the stuff you need<br><br>every unlisted program would be forced offline</br></br></br>  <br>Well, it's not like every piece of software being made today collects personal information of some sort. And as far as I can read, that only applies to the technical preview of Win10 and not the actual release.</br>  Dick rate thread?  <br>I'd suck it. 8.5/10<br><br>8/10<br><br>7.8/10<br><br><br><br>7.5/10</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>8.5 ain't bad i guess. one more for you, thanks.</br>  God Tier Album Thread<br><br>I'll Start</br></br>  Anyone up for a guro thread?  <br>what in the goddamn?</br>  <br>Yes, more?</br>  ayy    Anyone want anything specific?

He also lied straight to me and i was standing right infront of him. Of course it wouldn't have been so bad if they had invited me too. I was hinting all the time if I could come with them but he just kept telling me they don't know what they're going to do.</br></br>  trust us, we are all just as sad that you think we would give a shit  <br>They want to be alone, faggot.</br>  <br>It's okay, i don't care that you don't care. I just needed to open up somewhere. I'm not going to whine to him because I don't wanna look like a little bitch.</br>  <br>Sometimes people are inconsiderate assholes, anon. It sucks. You just need to decide whether you'd rather ditch this guy as a friend or keep him for whatever works out but not rely on him to always keep his word</br>  <br>There was a third guy too who I don't know and they asked their another friend too if he would want to join. But not me.</br>  <br>Yeah I know, I can't ditch this guy i've been friends with him for too long. But I'm not going to be that third wheel either.</br>  He told me he cannot hang out with me this night because he needs to go to work tomorrow. But apparently he can hang with random people who he met like a month ago.  Does he think he's too cool to hang out with me? A while ago when I was hanging out with him and he was constantly getting messages to his phone he asked me "Why do I have to be so popular?"  <br>How'd you answer?</br>   be me <br> with gfs family <br> dinner night out <br> gfs dad decides on steakhouse <br> ready to order <br> dad orders some barely cooked piece of meat <br> cringe on inside <br> ask waiter which one of the preparations is the cooked one <br> order well done <br> actually enjoy steak texture for once <br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/631195879#p631195879">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Medium is cooked the best.
