We are the smeg cult, and we are here to create the world's biggest smegma block. Once every three years (one full smeg cycle), we congregate at our secret location and peel our yields, neatly placing them on the smeg block.<br><br>We call this smeggca. Here at smeggca, you will be a true smeggman, and you will donate all your smegmas to the worthy cause. Once our smegblock is large enough, we will airlift it and drop it on either Raqqa or Pyongyang, hitting the target precisely. Another place we may drop it is Nigeria, and we can watch the wogs dismantle and eat it. We can record this in 4k and submit it to MOST SHOCKING ™. Upvote plz for visibility</br></br></br>    Hello smeglets,<br>My name is Smeggman, and I hate every single one of you. All of you are fat, retarded, no-lifes who spend every second of their day making sure you have no smeg. You are everything bad in the world. Honestly, have any of you ever gotten any smeggies? I mean, I guess it’s fun making fun of people because of your own clean helmets, but you all take to a whole new level. This is even worse than taking smeg and feeding it to a pigeon.<br>Don’t be a stranger. Just hit me with your best shot. I’m pretty much a smeg lord. I was chairman of the smegfarm alliance, and chief taste tester aswell. What shit do you farm, other than “muh dank weed”? I also get straight A’s, and have a fucking huge pot of smeg (Just inhaled some, shit was SO cash). You are all smeg-free faggots who should just kill yourselves.

Why? Because there are ZERO benefits for men in marriage. If you get married, there is at least a 50 percent chance that your wife will divorce you, kidnap your children from you, and steal all your money in divorce.<br><br>So, what are the alternatives to marriage?<br>1. Learn how to game and seduce women<br>2. Fuck prostitutes<br>3. Masturbate to porn<br>etc<br><br>Did you know that it's cheaper to fuck a prostitute once a week than to maintain a wife? You will get bored of fucking your wife after the first six months of marriage but with a prostitute you can fuck a new one every time.<br><br>There is already a MASSIVE anti-marriage campaign worldwide, with men basically giving up on marriage and refusing to get married. Here are two recent articles on it:<br><br>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/a<wbr>rticle-3046350/Why-men-refuse-marry<wbr>-Women-complain-chaps-today-won-t-s<wbr>ettle-Sorry-ladies-s-fault-argues-w<wbr>ickedly-provocative-new-book-Denigr<wbr>ation-Men-PETER-LLOYD.html<br><br>http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015<wbr>/05/01/why-men-wont-marry.html<br><br>Now, there are THREE main ways we can destroy feminism forever and take women off the massive pedestal they are on. We must fund and promote the following three technologies:<br>1. Virtual reality sex programs<br>2. Artificial wombs<br>3. Sex Robots<br><br>Once these three technologies are in place, women will no longer have any power in society. After all, why would you waste time chasing after fat women in real life when you can fuck hot supermodels in virtual reality or fuck a female sex robot? And since women's main power comes from their reproduction capacity, if we REMOVE that capacity from women through the technology of artificial wombs, then women will have ZERO power left in society and thus feminism is finished forever.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  PART 2<br>THIS is the solution, gentlemen! Now we must do our part and spread the above message to as many men as possible so that we can raise the consciousness of men worldwide. I am the guy who created the famous Boycott American Women blog, which reached around 40 million people worldwide through the internet campaign I created. Therefore I know what I am talking about.<br><br>In summary:<br><br>Do not ever get married. Simply seduce and bang women, or fuck prostitutes, and help promote the above three technologies, and we will DESTROY FEMINISM FOREVER! Thank you!<br><br>If you still have doubts about WHY you should not get married, I strongly recommend you to read the following article:<br>https://dontmarry.wordpress.com/</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The only issue is robots cant make babies<br><br>we would end up extinct in the process<br><br>and dont forget the whole disney ending where people realize that woman have more emotional bonds then a robot<br><br>just for history to repeat itself later on</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>otherwise im with you, i hate feminism too</br>  <br> deliberately overreading "artificial wombs" </br>  <br>we can make babies in laboratories</br>  <br>see its 6am and i haven't slept, thanks for the response, i guess.</br>  <br>did we ask for excuses? no we didn't.</br>  <br>Sure</br>    <br>haha</br>  <br>fuck you anon, you're probably some fucking 12yo watching spongebob waiting to catch the fucking bus.<br><br>Im on your god damn side, retarded faggot.</br></br></br>  <br>Hows your relationship with your mother?<br><br><br>Why do you hate feminism?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Tits or gtfo</br>  <br>Go look at feminism and feminist propaganda (not to mention feminist themselves) and come back to me with an answer, /b/ro</br>  This thread reminded me of the movie How to Murder Your Wife  <br> If you get married, there is at least a 50 percent chance that your wife will divorce you <br>Yeah, no. That's wrong.</br></br>  <br>I'm a guy. Just wondering what led you to have so much hatred.<br><br><br>The feminist movement was a great step in the right direction towards equality.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Amen</br>  <br>You're not a guy. Ur a little bitch cause ur talking like one</br>  <br>ohhhhhh i get it<br><br>you're one of those guys who can't get laid, but by agreeing you're shit compared to them is under the impression it will increase your chances amiright</br></br></br>  I'll just keep fucking trannies.<br>No pregnancy for me!<br>Chicks are for faggots anyway.</br></br>  <br> Ur a little bitch cause ur talking like one <br> ur <br><br>O-kay?</br></br></br></br>  I dunno, he seems happily married to me and I don't see her filing for divorce...  <br>sheeeeeiiiiitt re-read that and detect the irony anon</br>  <br> You're not a guy. Ur a little bitch cause ur talking like one <br>you got me man.<br><br><br> ohhhhhh i get it, you're one of those guys who can't get laid, but by agreeing you're shit compared to them is under the impression it will increase your chances amiright <br><br>I agree with feminism because I think it's right. Women needed the right to vote and later feminism dealt with how women are treated sexually.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>U wish u fucked women like this</br>  <br> and later feminism dealt with how women are treated sexually. <br>We have reached a point where it's getting bizarrely. It isn't about equality anymore, but supremacy. I simply can not support a cause that wants to force woman on top of society just for the sake of it, they are not better suited for that kind of responsibility.</br></br>  Hahahahahaha, you are literally the saddest person I have ever come across. Someone's bitter about not getting laid, enjoy fucking non existent robots your sad fuck.  feminist hate thread?  <br>I wish I fucked anything living.</br>  <br> wearing same shoes as OP pic <br> wizardry </br></br>  <br>  they are not better suited for that kind of responsibility. <br><br>There are a lot of intelligent, talented women out there way more qualified than you are.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>jesus fucking wept. have not seen that picture before. didn't realise the mother already had those eyes. and that potato she's holding... just stop!</br>  <br>I like this pic, added.</br>  <br>Sure they are, and they are free to do my job anytime soon. You know what, my company would hire them right away, we do have a shortage of workers. But guess what, no woman ever applied for my job because it's blue collar work. I'm currently at school getting my degree and all my classmates are male. There is no oppression, we have the same opportunities, but not everyone wants to actually grab these opportunites.</br>  <br>Did you miss the artificial wombs part?</br>  <br>What are you even saying? Why have you not applied to work as a hairdresser? Not grabbing your opportunities mate.</br>  Moar  <br>Why would I? I don't want to be a hairdresser, I never wanted to be one.

Are you retarded? Do you not thank a teacher or military personnel once in a while?</br>  <br>I like how feminism always puts the blame away from itself. If woman can't do a job because of their sex, it's sexism. If they won't do it because it's not a wanted job, it's stereotyping. Why not do it like men and do whatever the fuck you want?</br>  I dont know if this is the answer to feminazi but it sounds equally deranged  Asian girl  <br>anyone can take scissors to their head, not everyone can lay down asphalt or construct a house</br>  <br>fucking beautiful pic anon, I hope it gets around more.</br>  <br>Feminists are fat and ugly</br>  <br>Because most women are coddled by society. The only reason modern feminism is a thing, is because they are enabled to act that way and rape culture is a thing.</br>  <br>Agreed. Men must stop tolerating this shit</br>  <br>Hows your relationship with your mother?<br><br><br>Trying to sort jobs in a list of importance is really dumb. We need a combination of jobs to have a running society. <br><br><br>Well I'd say a lot of guys are afraid of strong women who can challenge them, the men feel inferior. Of course its sexism, women who are taught they are less of a women or less feminine because they like to do traditionally blue collar male jobs. This isn't just for men, men get stereotyped too depending on work. <br><br><br>Don't minimize someones work like that it takes a skilled hand to do a perfect haircut.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i bet my left nut OP is fat and ugly</br>  op is not a fagget  <br>Have u ever even fuxjed a real woman?</br>  <br>You sound summery.</br>  <br>I've never fuxjed anyone.</br>  <br> Of course its sexism <br>No, it's not. Sexism is a buzzword, nothing more. If they feel bad working a blue collar job, it's they fault, not that of society as a whole. Claiming it's society's fault is just an escape to not do it afterwards.</br></br>  <br>My relationship with my mother is fine. She's apart of the generation where it was Okay to be a woman. Nowadays women act like men, guess what? We don't need more men. We need women, REAL women. The kind that don't exist in modern feminism</br>  <br>Amen</br>  <br>Post nudes of this dirty scuz or gtfo now</br>  <br> Don't minimize someones work like that it takes a skilled hand to do a perfect haircut. <br><br>you are definitely right, however I can live with a shitty bowl cut it i had to<br><br>there is no option but excellence when you build a skyscraper<br><br>clearly one is about glamorous fashion and the other is about human needs, so dont tell me a hairdresser is as important as the foundation of society</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>posting flip whores</br>  <br>"Listing importance of jobs is really dumb"<br><br>What a female response. <br><br>"The president doesn't have a more important job than me, I'm just as important, We shouldn't even be comparing, this is stupid"</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I feel sorry for people not understanding what love is.</br></br>  <br>Goddamn, this!</br>  <br>Would extinction really be a bad thing?</br>  <br><br> If you get married, there is at least a 50 percent chance that your wife will divorce you, kidnap your children from you, and steal all your money in divorce <br><br>If you're the kind of person who says/believes any of the following things, then yes, this will probably be the case:<br><br> 'triggered' <br> 'you have autism'/'you have downs' <br> 'go back to tumblr' <br> 'hitler did nothing wrong' <br> 'nigger' <br> 'such a pussy'/'such a beta' <br><br><br>You know the kind of mentality I'm talking about. The mentality that has no morals. The kind you see that browses /b/. The kind that makes jokes about rape, cp, and the like. <br><br>It is THAT mentality that cause women to hate you. What happens is they think you're a decent person but when they marry you your lack of moral fiber and character really start to show.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Already married for 2 years. I tell her that I'd hunt her down I'd she leaves me.</br></br>  <br>Good man.</br>  So you're urging every male to not get married because you dislike feminists. As though to imply that all women are feminists. As though to imply that all women who consider themselves feminists are just evil cunts that hate all men and want us to become their slaves or some other bullshit paranoia. Sounds well thought out and rational to me.  Women are nasty manipulative whores that know exactly what they are doing. They are not innocent, they are not funny, they are shitty and they need to realize what they are becoming or else more of them are going to die each day.  <br>the day OP got burned<br><br><br>I dont hate woman, but a lot of them need to be put in their place</br></br></br></br>  <br>So do you think there a certain societal pressures if a man wanted to become a hairdresser or a makeup artist that would persuade him to do something else in his life even if he was passionate about it?<br><br><br>Feminism is about stretching what it means to be a man or women, it's not a war on petite, feminine women. You can find tons like that. <br><br><br> clearly one is about glamorous fashion and the other is about human needs, so dont tell me a hairdresser is as important as the foundation of society <br><br>A lot of work goes into how skyscrapers work they are just big piles of metal that are plopped down. Why go with the bowl cut when there are professionals out there?<br><br><br>Basing jobs in a list of importance off arbitrary means is really a time consuming waste. I never said a person who flips burgers is as good as the president, but between the choice of a doctor or the president its a tough choice that is based around personal preference.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  OR, you can just sign the paper that makes it so if you DO divorce, the woman gets NOTHING from you!<br><br>Well, you can in glorious Britain, anyway..</br></br>  <br>This guys on the money</br>  <br>How are they manipulative? Women are fine it seems like you have some issues.</br>  <br> if a man wanted to become a hairdresser or a makeup artist that would persuade him to do something else in his life even if he was passionate about it? <br>Of course there would be people commenting on that, but people comment on anything these days. The difference is that a man goes and does in anyway and women start a movement to make these statements illegal. What sound more reasonable?</br></br>  Asian girl....  <br>Feminism is a movement to not make these statements illegal, but to try to change peoples mindset that its ok for a guy to become a hairdresser.</br>  <br>I can't tell if you're joking or if you are serious. Every single woman I have ever been with or trusted has ended up fucking my life up in some unrecoverable manner. women think it is funny to tear you down and to make you not a man anymore. they want to break you. Well I don't want to be broken. Now to be specific, I am mostly talking about the new generation of women.</br>  <br>tits or gtfo</br>  <br>We've grown babies outside of people before. <br>Mom's dying of cancer have been able to safety remove the entire womb with fetus and the baby is born months later completely healthy. <br><br>To remove the woman entirely is not that complicated these days. <br>We can grow uterus/wombs in a lab<br>Can feed nutrients thru artificial ambilical cord <br>It'll be just like the matrix</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> A lot of work goes into how skyscrapers work they are just big piles of metal that are plopped down. Why go with the bowl cut when there are professionals out there? <br><br>I dont know if you fully understand what I told you.<br><br>You attempted to convey the message that all jobs are of equal importance.<br><br>Fashion matters not when stacked against a massive structure that, with flaw, could kill thousands.<br><br>A bad haircut is just that, yet a bad architecture is absolute failure.<br><br>it takes way more skill with a lot more on the line to make a building then it does taking scissors to someones hair.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Love is that hormone induced state that makes you want to get together with someone and reproduce your dna<br><br>It's an ephemeral illusion <br><br>Married 20 years here, getting divorced, thank fuck</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> b8ing this hard </br>  <br>How so what did they do to fuck up your life?</br>  <br><br>My belief is that a lot of it comes down to the kind of girl someone wants to be with.<br><br>Most of the guys who come here are looking for an attractive girl who is sex crazed. As a result they end up going for girls who usually partake heavily in the party lifestyle and play headgames.<br><br>The guys who deal with unstable women do it to themselves really.<br><br>It's not hard to find a nice wholesome girl to get into a relationship with, but some people are so obsessed with sex that that's all they end up making it about</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd like to see some budget numbers on the having wife vs buying prostitutes <br><br>This is assuming your wife doesn't work?</br></br></br>  <br>I never said all jobs of are equal importance. <br><br><br> calls me a troll to discredit valid arguments.  <br><br>Keep being rational. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I've got rice fever but where are you all finding these scrappy looking Asian bitches</br>  <br> The kind that makes jokes about rape, cp <br>you forgot niggers, nazis, school shootings and 9/11</br></br>  <br>Are you serious? Open your eyes. There are so many good men out there that have been completely screwed over by their ex wives that it's not even funny. I am NOT going to go into my personal life on 4 chan but, I used to like girls. I'm serious, I actually used to like them. Now I hate them. And for good reason.</br>  <br>You can turn any girl sex crazed, women are just as sexual as men. It's just they fear they will be judged and called sluts. If you take the fear of being called a slut from her and really care about her feelings she will come back to you for sex. You have to be a good lover.</br>  <br>Said no feminist ever.<br>By the way, you can't force people to change their mindset, but that's what they are trying to do. Oh, and it is completely okay for men to become hairdressers. I'm a regular at an all-male barber shop and guess what - they do a better job at that.</br></br>  <br>This.<br><br>Married a quiet, curious girl. I got the most supportive and understanding wife out of it. And she can even out-shoot me.</br></br></br>  I am a feminist, but I want nothing more than be a 50s housewife to my husband. Cook and clean for him. Clean his shoes, sit at his feet. He can use me however he wants whenever and I'll always obey because he is the man of the house.<br><br> tfw men nowadays are pussies </br></br>  <br>You're never heard of bitches fucking her man's best friend?<br>Or getting the alimony money and house while the guy moves into a cheap 1 room apartment?<br>Dude, manipulation and life ruining I'd like sex for them</br></br></br>  <br><br> Trying to sort jobs in a list of importance is really stupid and importance to who? - <br><br> Trying to sort jobs in a list of importance is really dumb. We need a combination of jobs to have a running society. - <br><br>Yes, yes you did.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Most men turn into softies once they get married and never argue back and put up with their wives behavior. If you marry a women just because she likes you for money then expect the marriage to not last. A women will always choose a guy who cares about her deeply and understands her rather than a guy with a shiny car.</br>  <br>Feminism seems to be about women doing whatever they want, but if a tumblrite read that, they'd have a fuckin stroke trying to talk you out of it. Good on ya.</br>  <br>Wheres your evidence? There are still stereotypes towards males doing typically female only jobs. A lot of things have changed in the result of feminism, men are able to show more emotions and arent expected to die in war.</br>  <br> Keep being rational. <br><br>Thats all you have to say? Sounds like you have admitted defeat.</br></br></br>  <br>What you are saying is the exact opposite of the truth. Many men who love their women and love their families and want nothing more than to just be good husbands get shot down and treated like complete crap just because they want to be good people. Women are naturally gold diggers and all they care about is the damn money. Right now with my best friends family I am seeing a marriage collapse and it's the most disgusting example of why feminism should kill itself. makes me want to puke.</br>  And they say girls are messed up. Yall got some mommy issues or whatever yall projecting on women.  <br>An alternative to getting married is simply not getting married. You can have a relationship with a woman and retain legal control without turning to "sex robots" and prostitutes.<br>Virgin, autismo, and faggot detected.<br>PS: Tl;dr</br></br></br>  <br><br>I know, women can be just as sexual as men. The difference though, is that for the reasons you mentioned, most aren't. Or they aren't outwardly sexual.<br><br>Therefore the ones that are...which are the same ones that guys like OP want...are almost always surrounded by horny guys. <br><br>That's what makes them crazy, or eventually cheat on guys like OP, or only care about money, or only go for bad boys, etc etc etc.<br><br>So I think it just comes down to realizing there is more to life for sex. Which, of course, someone like OP will never do.<br><br>It's a vicious cycle!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Wheres your evidence? <br>Because I have yet to see someone being outcasted for doing a job. If someone says he's becoming a hairdresser it's a job, so it's a good thing. Again, there is no social oppression, it's just useful to see it everywhere.<br><br> men are able to show more emotions and arent expected to die in war. <br>Great, that didn't benefit us in any way. By the way, men are still expected to die in war, there's just no major war going on as of now.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you cant ignore me, give a valid response or admit you're wrong.<br>Ill help you, these are the post.<br><br><br/></br></br></br></br>  No thanks. My gf is my hot best friend who I can fuck, she earns more than me and does a job I don't even understand the title of. <br><br>So fuck you, I'm locking that shit down.</br></br>  <br>That was a valid answer, take it or be butthurt about it. I won't support feminism, neither does my wife or anyone I have befriended. Guess I'll just live my life now.</br>  Had to answer to that as it hits the nail for me.<br> me being almost 40 <br> living with a steady 7 for 15 years <br> the kind of girl you d think doesn t exist <br> anon i want to pay this dinner we had <br> anon i wanna read the books you read, and even watch sports with you <br> overall the dream wife, ain t it? <br> 10 years ago: anon we re almost 30(both same age) you MUST make me a baby <br> i get along with it after some resistance and arguments <br> bitch starts changing shape the moment she gives birth <br> she s no so confident i m there for her and that s the only explanation -a sad one tho <br> nowadays bitchy wife fucking some alfa like 15 years younger than her <br> dun care bout her sour vagina anymore but it s kinda degrading, ain t it? <br> can t drop her, cuz everything went to plan-she has that little remote control over my life <br> as mentioned we ain t married so when the kid grows i hope to be the one laughing <br><br>So here s a story, from a non 12 yo feg, take it as you want anons, hope it ll help some of you make their minds</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>just how distant partners are where you live OP?<br>Love and sex aside, marriage is about having a partner whom you fight life's battles with. If you can't connect with someone enough to consider them as a "teammate in life" with who you plan to build your future together, by all means, don't marry.<br>But if you can, it's worth it.</br></br></br>  <br><br>now im getting confused, are you the person i was arguing with or are you just using the same format of<br><br> greentext <br>response<br><br>???</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well of course both genders cheat equally. Alimony is a old system setup when women typically stayed at home, It's not a system femininst made up. <br><br><br>Well someone who really likes mcdonalds might believe that mcdonalds employees are up there with some top tier jobs. Its a matter of preference. <br><br><br> good people <br>typically means being a white knight and agreeing with the women too much and acting like a slave. Women will choose the guy who cares about them and understand them. Not the guy who fakes nice as a strategy to get into her pants. <br><br><br>Agreed I used to be all anti female and hate women too, I found advice online that changed my whole perspective. I'm now happily with girl of my dreams. <br><br><br>Most women will have twice as much sex as men will. They are good at hiding it. Honestly, if you tell a girl you don't want a relationship with her and its all about sex with her and that you won't judge her for wanting sex with you then she will be all over you. You cant be judgemental, being horny is completely natural for both genders, but people who are afraid demonize women for wanting to explore their sexuality. If you weild the hammer of non judgement your life changes women can trust you that you wont brag that you had sex with them and they;ll be returning for sex when they're horny.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That would make sense if that was what was going on. it's not. I'm talking about genuine love and care. just honest respect for the person they are with.</br>  <br>my sister is a femenist<br>she gets 'triggered' whenever I say autism or retarded</br></br>  <br>Lrn2type.</br>  OP IS RIGHT AND WISE  Sexy  Op is not a faggot. Or maybe he is now because too many feminists made him hate the pussy.  <br>Of course it benefits all men, men dont have to live up to crude standards anymore. <br><br><br>Grats to you man!<br><br><br>Your wife should it gave her the right<br> to vote. <br><br><br>What are you responding to?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  OP is cool.  <br> Well someone who really likes mcdonalds might believe that mcdonalds employees are up there with some top tier jobs. Its a matter of preference. <br><br>That is literally a biased opinion, you cant actually tell me you defend a fucked up haircut being equally as tragic as a fallen building with thousands dead.<br><br>Construction workers, Architects, and all workers of the sort play a much higher role then a bitch holding scissors, and it scares me that you believe they are equally important.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe if you didn't respond to 75 different posts in one single post you might know.</br>  <br>you fucking retard.<br>it gives tax advantages and some shit<br>like i gon marry a bitch for "love"</br></br></br>  <br>Who said I did? I said its completely arbitrary, its up to personal opinion.</br>  <br> Being this stupid. </br>  <br>You have bested me sir! Here is the deed proving so! Faggot.</br>  <br><br>You know nobody waits until marriage to have sex, right? Marriage literally has nothing to do with sex nowadays.
