Where abouts are u from?</br>    <br>Blueberry is the shit me and 2 of my mates had some once was one of the funniest nights ever</br>  <br>word lol</br>    <br>500 euro, and Ireland, shit sucks I know. I used to deal and I was paying 450 an ounce, I stopped dealing mainly because I felt so shitty selling off grams for 25 but thats what I had to do to make any money off it at all, needed to pay rent</br>  <br>Lucky fuck</br>    <br>Covered in jelly do also fuck 3 different hooker on your way home</br>  <br>You must have gotten a shitty grow of it then, blueberry so yummy.<br><br>I would get a nice sack of trainwreck, but ever since I moved from NorCal to WA it's been hard to find a decent grow of it.</br></br></br>    <br>that's a nice price man, what was the quality like? is that far out from Amsterdam? I've been 7 times but never outside the city... are the prices still the same</br>  <br> not a food </br>  Have any of you ever seen this in coffee shops wanna try one when i go to Amsterdam    <br> &lt;- this guy<br>Yeah man pineapple chunk is the shit, its from a coffee shop thats won cannabis cup like every year, pineapple chunk never won but I think it should have, shit is so good</br></br>  <br>What a waste of dub dubs</br>  <br>that's expensive man... I live in essex and pay 230 for the best super lemon. I know what u mean about feeling bad for the price you're charging lol</br>  <br>Thanks but i know how to make these. I prefer to make "S"-tips because the spirals often loose up and you end up with a "hole"-tip which mostly let something through</br>  <br><br>Oh Yung Lean. That's this guy right?<br><br>For phone fags, this video shows this faggot smokeing a blunt in his car.<br><br>Also his rap fucking sucks and his name is retarded.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=DOZ<wbr>LAJkqMuU</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Haarlem is like 20 to 30 minutes by train from Amsterdam, the quality is quite good, the local dutch recommended it so that's a good sign right? Prices in Haarlem are basically the same as Amsterdam maybe 1 or 2 euro cheaper although you can get really cheap decent stiff in Haarlem that you can't in Amsterdam that I've seen</br>    has anyone with a tabletop vape ever experienced a strain or particular run of weed that just doesn't really smoke well? Not at a low, mid, or high temp. It just doesn't create clouds. I ran two other strains at three different temps and all of them worked significantly better. Any ideas of what causes this?  <br>THIS LITTLE BITCH AINT EVEN INHALING WHAT A WASTE</br>  BTW for those that care in Ireland a hippy stoner who sent every member of parliament a blunt in the post and walked outside the dail (government building) with a cannabis plant in protest was elected as a member of parliament, ming Flannigan is his name there's a documentary on YouTube  <br>They're delicious actually.<br><br>Right?</br></br></br>   so high right now <br><br>my room8 is out of town for work all weekend, I got the flat all to myself fer four whole days</br></br>  <br><br>multi pass</br></br>  <br>ayy</br>       Select all images with grass   I know it sounds dumb but why does mixing hash and a weed on a joint make a better high than both smoked separately?  <br> using flash this close to the trichomes <br><br> SHIGGYDIGGY </br></br></br>  <br>higher thc content in the has</br>  <br>Königsmische ayyyy</br>    <br>nice provenzal of yours</br>  <br>any fellow california patients here?<br>looking for dispensaries that hook it up in/near OC</br></br>  <br>now that's paranoid</br>  <br>Fuck I could never play hockey while I'm high unless I was goalie, I was always paranoid of getting slammed into the boards or having the puck hit me when I wasn't expecting it.</br>    <br>i started smoking after I stopped playing hockey but I feel like I would have the same thoughts</br>  <br>Well, depends on where in the OC.<br><br>Check Weedmaps bro..come on now.<br><br>hahaha those are the least of my worries.<br>I'm D, so when I'm baked it's a lot more calming.</br></br></br></br></br></br>      <br>I played right wing high once and never again.

Voting is hard enough for them.</br>  <br><br>Wow ... these dubs.<br>OP, you need to write a ProCon Argument for school? Or is/are you/your partner pregnant?</br></br></br>  <br>No, let's talk about sex OP, let's talk about you and me.</br>  <br>No, this is related to the planned parenthood news.</br>  <br> Some nig nog cums inside your wife <br> You decide to keep the nig nog baby and raise it <br> MFW </br></br></br>  <br>Okay how about we have sex and you get pregnant. Do you want the baby?</br>  <br>If a single living cell was found on a distant planet, scientists would exclaim that we have found life?<br>elsewhere in the universe. <br><br>So why is a single living cell found in the womb of a pregnant woman not considered life?</br></br></br></br>  <br>yes</br>  <br>a bastard then<br>are they not a part of life?</br></br>  <br>Your dandruff is full of living cells.<br>Why do you not care about those?</br></br>  <br>It is considered life - part of the woman's life.</br>  <br>It is considered to be a sign of life. Not human life though. Human life doesn't start till the little faggot gets his own apartment.</br>  Well, you fags prob don't even know this but...<br>You should have been aborted if abortion were 100% accepted at the time.<br><br> I'm 100% 4 it </br></br></br>  <br>my ex scraped two of my spawns, didnt really want her to, but here we are, and here they are not... them feels bro</br>  <br>kek</br>  <br>but is the life of an unwanted fetus so insignificant it is okay to kill it for convenience?</br>  <br>we;d still have the ability to make a choice<br>That life is independant, while when in a woman's uterus, it is still parasitic.</br></br>  I personally think it's wrong, but a woman has the right to kill whatever she wants that's growing inside her. Once old enough to survive on it's own however, it should be protected.  <br>Not based anon here but i agree with what he said also. Ok yeah skin cells are "alive" but they will never be conscious, they will never create an actual living breathing human. And you never know, what if this little cell inside this woman's womb ends up growing up and curing cancer or being the next Ghandi? A little skin cell is completely unrelated in that context and i think you know that.<br><br>So my answer is apples and oranges. That's a different scenario</br></br></br>  <br>How about the father, is the life equally part of the father's life?</br>  <br>I like giving women a choice, and I also like killing babies. For me, abortion is a win-win.</br>  <br>it's not a baby yet, it's a fetus.<br>http://www.abortionfacts.com/facts/<wbr>7</wbr></br></br>  <br>do you have the right to go to the doctor and get circumcised? Yes.<br>Whether you do it or not is your choice.</br></br>  <br>A fetus turns into a little baby if it is not aborted.</br>  Abortions should be illegal except in cases of rape. Murdering a human is, obviously, wrong and these whores have no accountability for their actions. Buy protection, fucking sluts.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Q69<wbr>qWqBBcoU</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>could also be a nigger in africa who ain't getting food cuz you gotta feed someone who ain't alive yet.<br>Just sayin' there are already 7 billion people who coulda done it. What makes your zygoats so special? And what if they grow up to be a freeloader? A homeless man? A neckbeard? What then? Waste of life, or wasted chance?</br></br>  <br>Unless it miscarries or comes out deformed or something.</br>  <br>My unchecked foreskin will not grow into a person. If it was going to I would keep it and thank the heavens for my child.</br>  <br>problem is do you want dumb sluts shitting out babies? they never learn</br>  <br>The claim that unborn babies are "just clumps of cells" was always a lie, and one that has been repeatedly disproven through medical imaging and fetal scans.</br>  <br>And stem cells if it is, to help a person already alive. <br>your argument is like treating an 8 year old like an adult because they'll grow up to be one.</br></br>  <br>90,000 niglets were aborted last year. KEEP IT LEGAL FOR THE SAKE OF CIVILIZATION</br>  I don't give a shit about a goddamn fetus<br><br>Especially if my tax dollars are going to prolong its miserable existence because mommy fucked too many randos</br></br>  <br>Regardless what I personally feel about the issue, I still don't think the government should infringe on those people's rights to do it.</br>  <br>So you deny the rights of the living for the rights of those who do not yet exist?<br>Why do you get to eat food then if it's food that those not yet born could have eaten?</br></br>  <br>agreed, even if you don't personally get one, why do you care what others do?</br>  My ex got pregnant and had one. I thought the baby was mine and we were going to keep it but then it turns out she fucked some other dude when I was on vacation. It was a pretty fucked up roller coaster of emotions to say the least. She got the abortion back in Feb and is already pregnant again. Glad to be rid of that sack of shit out of my life...but goddamn she was a hot little Asian 18 year old.  <br>Definitely. Pull the welfare out from under them too and make them take responsibility for their actions.</br>  <br>Trips of truth<br><br>Even if we do call a fetus a "person," its existence is still coming at the expense of pain to the mother, and money to the state if the mom is poor, and one of the main reasons people will get an abortion is due to financial distress</br></br></br>  <br>No my argument is more like an 8 year old has a fair chance at becoming an adult.</br>  <br>THIS</br>  <br>Its wrong and especially with these videos coming out showing how planned parenthood is harvesting the organs and the body parts of aborted babies and selling them for medical and research purposes makes it even worse, a bunch of old witches standing over cut up baby parts its disgusting and anyone who supports abortion supports baby murder</br>  <br>it's right</br>  <br>Oh, ok. So it's perfectly alright to kill people who can't support themselves or of your existence inconviences. Got it.</br>  <br>for my dubs</br>    <br>someone played SPORE a bit too late I'm afraid</br>  <br>no, you're treating it like a baby. You're making it indistinguishable. A bunch of cells, no matter what they could be, are cells. To treat them as a baby, you are treating them as they could become. Same with the child, treat it as they could become. Yes, they're intended to be, but you cannot treat it as a baby until it is a baby, independant, at a point of its development where it is no longer a fetus, same with the child.</br>  <br>kek</br>  <br>We kill bugs with more cells for convience and animals in all stages for food so why not</br>  <br>Yes it is we have to much humans on this big blue marble.</br>  <br>Fucking this.<br> Inb4 "HURRR DURRR EDGY" </br></br>  <br>what makes a fetus a person? A person is defined as an individual being, meaning its vital functions are independent, which a fetus is not. Until it has a heart that beats on its own, it is a bunch of cells. It is a part of the mother, like an organ, and yes, you can remove an organ if it is too expense.</br>  <br>I believe the right of life outweighs the right to take life away.</br>  <br>Yet you browse /b/...why?</br>  <br>Because I care about others and I want others to do the right thing.</br>  <br> implying earth is not overpopulated </br>  <br>Are you a vegan then? Is the rights to a life of an animal enough that you can't eat them? And if so, then why deny evolution?</br>  dam that muthafuckas guts fall out  <br>Why do you think denying someone the right to their own choice about their life is the right thing? Why is putting restrictions on situations that have nothing to do with you the right thing. Why is telling someone "no, I don't understand your situation, but my beliefs outweigh your needs" caring?</br>  <br> implying humans will ever peaceful </br>  why hasn't someone loaded up pictures of those two pinhead girls, its one of the strongest pro choice arguments around (I don't have them on me)  <br>It's like those awful people are the same ones saying abortion is okay.</br>  <br>Yes, you can retaliate against someone who is causing you physical pain. And if an uninvolved third party doesn't have a say, the directly involved party should at least have a right to design what happens to their body. A fetus is a fucking part of a body. If I want to cut my dick off, I should have that right.</br>  <br>It's a fucking disgrace after 10 weeks at most.</br>  <br>By that logic it's wrong of me to donate my body to science after death. Even when it can be used to benefit others.</br>  <br>Fucking this. As much asI love Star Trek, we'll never evolve into that. If we don't kill ourselves (which I sincerely hope we do, preferably without harming the other life on the planet too terribly much in the process) then the aliens will kill us once we get into space and are still behaving like the same belligerent and amoral cocksuckers we are now and have always been.</br>  <br>I legitimately thought the previous post was sarcastic</br>  <br>Because I know it is wrong when a mother abandons its young.</br>  <br>It is wrong<br>Killing an innocent human being is wrong<br> Yes, it is alive <br> yes, it is a human </br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably was but I took the b8 anyway<br><br>Then again, you can never underestimate the stupidity of some people</br></br></br>  <br>without it, kids would be sleeping on the streets, and the retard population would be doubled and suicide rates would rise</br>  if life is a collection of cells, not conscious, but alive. then you think abortion is wrong because it removes a life from the universe?<br><br>same people, eat meat, eat plants, use antibacterial soap. It's the same fucking thing.</br></br>  <br>No that is YOUR CHOICE do you think those aborted babies have to give their consent to become medical waste no they dont fuck you for even making that comparison, i never knew so called progress looked so barbaric and backwards, ya its ok we can kill babies for scientifically purposes fucking scumbags</br>  <br>I just mean I reevaluated when you posted. I'm unsure now.<br>Hope it was.</br></br>  <br>It's wrong if you're doing it purposely or "because you can" if you're going out and getting knocked up "just because you don't like condoms and I can abort" then you're a dumb cunt. However if you know that you're not in the best spot for a child (I.E. No job, no car, no house.) Then you have the right to decline this baby.</br>  Aborted "fetuses" are literally less developed than egg yolks.  <br>Who gives a fuck what the collection of cells wants, the only person whose choice matters is the person whose body it's using<br><br>Also men should be able to opt out of child care if women can opt out of a pregnancy but that's a different can of worms</br></br></br>  <br>because i &lt;3 u guys<br><br>not getting pregnant is the answer instead of killing<br><br>that doesn't discredit peacefulness</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying if a fetus is aborted we shouldn't take cells from it to save lives </br>  <br>Then why is planned parenthood able to harvest their eyes, hearts, brains, organs and etc if theyre so underdeveloped as you say</br>  <br>Not getting pregnant is plan A. Abortion is plan B. Duh.</br>  <br> implying rape isn't real </br>  <br>It's not rape if you cuddle after.</br>  <br>But what gives you the right to decide that? Why is it that you think you can play god with this? Do you go to every abandoned kitten on the street and force it back to its mother?<br>Think of it more like Euthanasia. Do you fight every adoption agency who practices it? Are those not abandoned creatures who depend on a human adult for their basic needs? The difference is the suffering. In both cases, the supporter cannot support the dependant creature. Do you force the owners to take back their pets? No, you respect their decision and mourn, and move on.<br>The difference between the two is how long the poor creature has to suffer.</br></br></br>  <br> implying forced cuddling isn't real </br>    <br>Depends on the skin color</br>  <br>RAPE IS NOT FUCKING FUNNY! Joke about anything else you want, /b/...<br><br>Joke about loli, joke about murder, joke about drugs, joke about yourselves but DON'T FUCKING JOKE ABOUT RAPE! Rape DESTROYS a woman, do you fucktards realizse RAPE dehumanizes a woman as if she were not human, RAPE STRIPS HER OF HUMANITY! It is disgusting, inhumane, regressive and insane. RAPE IS OFF THE FUCKING TABLE, /b/, NOT EVEN YOU FUCKING VIRGIN ASSHOLES CAN BE SUCH FUCKHOLES THAT YOU JOKE ABOUT A WOMAN'S WOMANHOOD BEING VIOLATED!<br><br>And no, I am not some lesbian dyke cunt, I am a woman. I was raped. My virginity taken from me, I can never give it to a man I love. I was raped again and again and again and again and again by a random stranger when I was 15, And between you and me something amazing happened...and now I can talk to animals! Its really cool! But totally a secret. And you know what? Life's never been the same</br></br></br></br></br>  Abortion should be an option for women and men(because its fucked up that a father doesnt have a say. Its a womans body but it takes two to tango). The same goes for not wanting to abort. But I feel if one parent wants to abort and the other doesnt, the parent whos for aborting relinquishes the rights to that child as well as any obligations towards it.  <br>we don't need anymore people on this planet, so abort away....</br>  <br> RAPE IS NOT FUCKING FUNNY! <br>indeed. If you don't take it serious you risk getting caught.</br></br>  The greatest crime you can commit is to bring another human being into this world. Abortion is wonderful.  <br> implying women a women is human </br>  <br>Patau's Syndrome, or a trisomy of the 13th chromosome pair. Also called OP's disease.</br>    I have no gripes about killing unborn babies. It's allowing females to make a decision that does not sit well with me.  <br/>  <br>I watched True Detective too, m8<br><br>...I agree, though.</br></br></br>  abortion keeps the nigger population down, make it free on every street corner.  <br>For some reason I'm hungry for wings</br>  PRAISE ABORT<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=QWE<wbr>_M0CX9So</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>I can decide what is right or wrong because I have a sense of morality. I think abortion is playing god. We don't euthanize humans (legally in my country) even when they beg for it. I have nothing against abandoned creatures.</br>  <br>Your ex is trash. I bet those weren't her only two either</br>  <br>its only ok if its mixed, mentaly or physically retarded, a rape baby, or the mothers life is in danger</br>  <br> ProCon Argument <br>Hmmm... Let's take a brief look at the advantages of murdering a completely innocent baby.</br></br>  <br>ohkek</br>  <br>Fuck it, who cares, just post more mutiled babies pics</br>  <br>Or for any other reason too.<br><br>Nice dubs.</br></br></br>  <br> implying morality doesn't hold humans back </br>  <br>This is the only fukken answer you can give!</br>    <br>prob, feels bad man I thought she was a decent chick too, then logic and reflection kick in and then here we are</br>  <br> implying fetuses are self aware </br>  <br>population control. seems ok to me.</br>  <br>doesn't matter nothing wrong with killing humans in my opinion so fetus is nothing</br>  that's not even a real aborted fetus go to a gore site get a real photo then we'll talk  <br>Dogs aren't self aware either.</br>  <br>what's the difference? Are humans not animals? <br>Why should humans suffer?<br>And what you decide is right or wrong is right or wrong for you, not for everyone. <br>What if I decided it's wrong that you stepped on ants. What if some people agreed with me. What gives me the right to force you not to, when it doesn't hurt me at all?</br></br></br></br>  <br>It could also be the next bin laden or Ted Bundy so your point is irrelevant</br>  <br>Actually had sympathy for you for a bit, til I got to the end and kek'd the kekkest of all keks.</br>  <br> implying I care about dogs </br>  My ex had one. She told me she was pregnant and that she was getting an abortion. I had no choice but would if made the same decision i think. We broke up after, her choice again, and I don't feel bad about it. Don't regret it for a sec. I still think what if but I know it was the right decision. But seriously wear a condom. I nearly had a kid with i women i didn't love for 5 minutes of fun.  <br>It might, if we had any.</br>  <br>But dogs are conscious. And awesome.</br>  <br> implying women don't poke holes in condoms </br>  <br> implying a 13 year old edgelord's opinion matters </br>  <br>[Citation Needed]</br>  Realistically it's up to the parents to decide. It's none of our business. No one's business except the parents.  <br>the inevitable argument that you give is that your moral beliefs are so strong that you think you get the right to impose them on others. <br>You think that you're so special that your way of life, your culture, and your thinking is worthy of law of people you don't know, and don't care to know. Why do you insist on restricting people, when you simply don't know who or what they are?<br>Why not allow someone to have a different opinion? I'm not saying "abort every third fetus" I'm saying if the means call for it, make it an option.</br></br></br>  <br>underrated post</br>  These aren't random cells, nor is the DNA that of the mother. Human reproduction, abortion is the killing of unborn children. Pretty simple, just inconvenient for a lot of people, which is what this is really all about - not morality, but convenience.<br><br>If we laid eggs to reproduce, would there be an issue smashing the eggs before they hatched? If someone broke into the house and smashed the eggs, would it be murder?</br></br>  <br>Some people have them. For instance Stevan's son is the anti Christ he should kill it but instead raises it anyway because he could never kill a child.</br>  <br>Go to 10min in and tell me you're still ok with women doing this shit <br><br>youtube/watch?v=Xw2xi9mhmuo</br></br></br>  <br> implying I'm 13 </br>  <br>your ex sounds awesome<br>altho not discussing it is bad manners</br></br>  <br>Dogs are awesome, but they will never discover the cure for cancer or invent a way to travel faster than the speed of light. Every fetus has that potential. All I'm saying is it shouldn't be so easy to get an abortion, just because you don't want the responsibilities.</br>  <br>suffering is part of life you won't get rid of it with abortion<br>humans are not animals the same way cucumbers aren't fruit<br>as a society we have to have a sense of what is right and wrong for example murder is wrong even if I think it is right</br></br></br>  <br> implying you act any more mature </br>  <br>The advantages are that there is one less mouth to feed and more food for the people who have already been born, are already aware of life and death, and are starving. People who care about fetuses are the same people who pretend to care about starvation when they don't even realize why people are starving in general.</br>  <br> implying that non aborted fetus isn't become Mao 2.0 </br>  <br>it's fucking retarded what you are saying let's throw a dice if 1 i give up on my dreams and life and become servant of little nightmares.<br><br>next night roll again...</br></br></br>  <br> implying I care </br>  <br>bro, cucumbers are fruits.<br>And yes, murder is wrong, and yet we have a right to defend ourselves. Lethal injection is legal. There are times where the death of a man is justified, and legal. Even straight up murders are categorized by how bad they are, in different degrees with different punishments, and sometimes, with little to no. There is a time and a place for it.</br></br>  <br>I told you to start the fucking reactor!</br>  <br> Says he doesn't care <br> Responds anyway. <br>kek</br></br></br>  <br>1 white fetus &gt; 1000 niggers<br>people aren't starving in the US or Western Europe, and abbortion isn't a big issue in Africa</br></br>  <br>People are starving in the US and Western Europe. Asia as well.</br>  <br> implying I'm not replying to make someone kek </br>  <br>It's just clearing out a parasite that causes numerous, sometimes fatal, side effects.</br>  <br>Humans are shit tier creatures, bro. It's just that simple.</br>  <br>Here's an advantage of aborting a fetus/baby - girls that get impregnated before they have fully grown/developed. Humans on average stop growing when they're 21. And I think humans should be limited on how many abortions they can have.</br>  <br>Then an hero and stream it faggot.</br>  <br>That's actually true but I still fell like that there is a higher chance of that person/fetus becoming a well functioning member of society that a serial killer.<br><br>I have no idea what the fuck you're talking about though</br></br></br>  depends on the circumstances of impregnation  <br>Wrong unless the baby is retarded, non-white or being manufactured artificially for a gay couple.</br>  <br> implying that once a bitch exceeds this limit of yours and is forced by law to keep a baby she will suddenly be worth a shit as a mother </br>  <br>This argument isn't about me it's about society.</br>  <br>A humans most natural urge is to dominate why do you think we love winning. Anyways there will always be more bad people than good people.</br>  <br>Nah man I'm having fun while this lasts. If I did an hero though I would totally stream it for the /b/ros. I would hope you'd do the same for me.</br>  <br>nice thread, OP</br>  <br> every fetus has that potential. <br>Well no not really</br></br>  <br>no, it's about you, limiting the choices people of society are allowed to make based on your beliefs.</br>  <br> hurr durr just don't get pregnant  <br>Accidents happen retard. If I trip and fall and break my leg. I'm not just going to sit there and be like "oh well I guess I'll just sit here". No I'm going to go to a fucking doctor and get a cast. And no I'm never going to run again just because there's a chance I might fall down because that's ridiculous. I will be as careful as I can but sometimes it's just unavoidable. And on the off chance I break my leg you're goddamn right I'm gonna get a cast</br></br>  porn webm    <br><br>bump</br></br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>sauce?</br>  <br> Porn webm <br> Starts it of with a .jpg </br></br>  <br>Spagetti Sauce please</br>  <br><br> &gt; this </br></br>  <br>bump for sauce</br>  <br>thats a jpg</br>  <br>faggot, this picture aint no webm</br>  Ive seen like 3 mwebs of this chick over the last 2 days, what the fuck is her name  Kati3kat ya fags.
