Just kill yourselves already you unemployed leeches. You're nothing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    Hello friends. I had a root canal an hour ago. I just want to curl up and try my hardest not to exist for the rest of the day, but here I am, lurking in hopes of fur.  <br>no fun allowed<br><br><br>hey<br><br>fuck that sounds painful</br></br></br></br></br></br>    my folder is too small im always posting the same shit  <br>Less painful, because anesthetic, more uncomfortable. There's an odd sensation knowing there's somebody drilling into your skull via your teeth. <br><br>I don't like even the simplest of dentistry either, so you can imagine how well I took this lol.</br></br></br>  <br>I have over a thousand and I always post the same shit. Not sure why, I try to be random but I always just click the same stuff, even when I'm trying not to.</br>  <br>fucking hate dentistry too and both my parents are dentists. Teeth are just too sensible. Good thing i was basically forced to take good care of them since i was very new. Ive seen some really bad teeth in some /r9k/ threads</br>        <br>I think it's a pretty damn logical fear to have. In the wild, if a bear loses it's teeth, it's dead. We've come a long way, obviously, but that evolutionary thing is there there, someone drilling into your teeth is just something to be scared of. <br><br>That's my opinion at least.</br></br></br>      <br>that makes me wonder if there is any fetish involving teeth or dentistry in anyway</br>    <br>there has to be</br>  <br>I wouldn't be surprised. Probably comes under an offshoot of vore.<br><br>There's basically a fetish for anything these days.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Good afternoon, Fluffy. How are you today?</br></br>    <br>aight</br>  <br>tl;dr</br>    <br>Ashens?<br><br><br>Good afternoon, Artyom. How are you today?</br></br></br></br>      <br>I've been doing well. Still a bit groggy. Just woke up.<br>How are you?</br></br>    <br>I'll never understand why furries judge bronies, and why bronies judge furries. We're all basically the bottom of the barrel, so why take pot shots at eachother like this? <br><br><br>My face can't decide between being numb or being in pain, and I just want to bury myself until it's all okay again.</br></br></br></br>  <br>:D<br>you recognize!</br></br>  <br> furries judges bronies, bronies judge furries <br>I'm a brownie, or rather I was, but I don't give a shit. We fall into the same category, and much like you I don't understand why we hate each other. <br><br>What the fuck is wrong with your face? That doesn't sound fun :(</br></br></br></br>  <br>i dont know actually. I guess its just a way of justifying being a furry<br><br>"Hey im a furry but at least im not a disgusting brony"</br></br></br>      <br>I watch the show and stuff, but can't stand the fandom so I don't know if I can say I've ever been one. <br><br>And I just had a root canal an hour ago. <br><br><br> "Hey im a furry but at least im not a disgusting brony" <br> "Hey im a brony but at least im not a disgusting furry" <br><br>I guess I see your point, but I find it kind of sad that people have to put others down in order to feel okay about being themselves.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>just basic human nature tbh. Also not everyone descriminates so its gucci</br>    <br>I get you. I jumped onto the fandom at the end of season 2. That was a couple years ago, damn time flys. Anyway I stopped participating in the fandom last year around this time because it came too unbearable, and I don't really refer to myself as a brony anymore. That shitty fandom went downhill fast.</br>        <br>I guess. I have a big problem with social anxiety, so maybe I'm lacking the part that makes people act that way, since I don't really many friends. <br><br><br>Yup. It's just a vile hive-mind now, like most fandoms. If you don't agree with them, you're the worst person in the world. <br><br>I just enjoy what I enjoy and ignore what I don't. I wish people were more able to live and let live, y'know?</br></br></br></br></br></br>      <br>hey silly, and the other one?</br>  <br>yeah. To each his own.</br>  <br>Personally, I have a pretty substantial braces fetish. It's quite rare as far as I can tell.</br>  <br>im just taking these from e621 /order:score</br>  <br>Good afternoon, Dash. How are you today?</br>  <br>I'm alright. You?</br>    <br>Root canal 90 minutes ago. Face hurts. Want to eat but too paranoid I'll fuck something up and I'll have to go back, and I really don't want to go back.</br>  <br>Hey dash</br>  everyone on 4chan is a bot except you.  <br>That sucks. I wish I had enough money to go to the dentist. My teeth are horribly fucked up, and I'm too poor to fix them.<br><br>Hey, how's it going?</br></br></br>    <br>you need to wait about 6 hours</br>  <br>shit dude, fucked up how? I wanna go brush my teeth now. <br>Thing on my end are quite well, what about for you?</br></br>  <br>hail satan</br>    <br>At this point I wouldn't be surprised. Those bots on Skype are getting pretty good.<br><br><br>That sucks. UK, so free dental for poor people like me (for now). Uber right government got in a few months ago though so I'm getting all this shit fixed in preparation of them taking that away. <br><br><br>I was told 2. I probably won't be eating anything for the rest of the day anyway.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>woops</br>  <br><br>Zazas Zazas Nasatanada Zazas! Vedar-Gal Tiekals Somdus Azerate!

My dumbass hippy mom never gave a single fuck and never took me to the doctor or dentist. The only reason I ever got stitches is because I was at my dad's house when it happened.<br><br>I'm well enough I suppose.<br><br>Yeah, I hate living in the U.S. Freedom my ass.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>holy shit man! If i had enough money to pay for your medical bills I would, because that's fucked up.</br>  <br>how do people even survive in the US if for every health issue you have to spend your life savings</br>    <br> health Insurance <br> It's not cheap but it's better than not having any, cause then you don't blow all your money on a broken arm or something.</br></br>  <br> i forgot to type my name <br> also get <br><br>at ease, soldier</br></br></br></br>  <br>sounds dumb but w/e<br><br>its almost as if your country is trying to scam you</br></br></br>  <br> ns y u no work </br>  <br>Thanks. Yeah, this place is completely ass backwards, and everyone is too stupid to see what's really going on.<br><br>You don't. They already kill you by forcing you work stupidly long hours (at least compared to European countries), for absolutely nothing. And everyone else is going to die from being too poor and having no jobs because of outsourcing. The few that aren't poor as dirt are filthy rich and kill innocents in any and every country they can to gain control, and those fucks are working with the government and spying on their customers to give literally every piece of information they can to the NSA. Welcome to the land of the free.</br></br></br>    <br>Now you're getting it.</br>    <br> capitalism <br>it is! That's what capitalism is all about. This country is so corrupt it's unbelievable. The big corporations get their say every time, because they pay the government to look the otherway. It's bullshit.</br></br>  <br>We're not bottom of the barrel. I'm a fine member of the community, with a full time job for a respected global company, I have plenty of 'real' friends that I hang out with and plenty of other activities and hobbies. Furries shit talk other furries way more then non furries do.</br>  <br>Insurance. Also a banking system that is structured around debts owed by companies and individuals.<br> It is, though.</br></br>  <br>looks like someones from 9gag</br>  <br>I lold a lil. Haven't seen that show in forever.</br>  <br><br><br><br>my condolences but to be fair no country is perfect. Yours is just a bit more imperfect than the rest but still pretty perfect</br></br></br></br>    <br>Or rather, a banking system that functions around formal debts owed by companies and individuals, and the status of the banks as the primary creditors.</br>    <br> all this good art wasted on furfags </br>  <br>Of said companies and individuals, that is.</br>    <br>Since we're on this topic, you should look up the Trans-Pacific Partnership if you don't already know anything about it, and tell everyone else as well. /r/Conspiracy is extremely helpful, if you can actually find something about the TPP that hasn't been deleted. It's literally where all the Multinational Corporations have rule over the government. I know this isn't exactly the place for my Tinfoiling, but this kind of shit is super important, and is pretty relevant to what we're currently discussing. It's really interesting.</br>  <br>this is true. Our country is better than the majority.</br>    <br>its where the money is and also you know what they say. Artists arent the most sane individuals</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>oh yeah. it's total bullshit. I'll have to read about it a bit more.</br>    You people need to Google 'Crony Capitalism'.      why does furry porn is so attractive jeez it's a drug    <br>This is our economic system. <br><br><br>nice grammar. welcome new friend.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Wrong thread</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Its well drawn</br>    <br>cause benis</br>  <br> The U.S. is amongst the least corrupt countries <br>I wonder who's behind this article?</br></br>  <br>Pone porns are most hotter.</br>  <br> RIghtinthebenis.gif </br>  <br>not all of it. In fact most of it is shit.<br><br><br>n-n-not benis!!! DDD::<br><br><br>it's probably true. Think of all the countries that are way worse than us? There's lot of very corrupt countries, however that doesn't mean ours isn't shit either.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>im not sure about the US but here in Europe most of the shit is corrupt as fuck</br>  <br>dump comic please based anon???</br>  <br>If you're going to post, at least post the good stuff.<br>Atryl is meh.</br></br>    <br>Good afternoon, Gears. How are you today?</br>  <br>I dont really pay attention to the bad stuff anyways</br>  <br>Nooonoooooo<br>hy you do dis, why benis?</br></br>  <br>woops gay stuff again</br>  Pone = Shit  <br>Keep posting it.</br>  <br>Nooo Benis!!! nnooohohohhhhoooo</br>  <br>I'm not so sure about that. Upon further reading, that's just the perception, not the actual value. Meaning that it's probably WAY worse. Those Jews are some crafty motherfuckers, and they're good at hiding their motives. I can definitively say that the U.S. is at least in the top 20%, if not top 20 total.<br><br>I'm not surprised. I feel like Switzerland and the Scandinavian countries are the only one that aren't super corrupt. But on second thought, that's probably what they want us to think.</br></br></br>  <br>Shitty<br>really really shitty<br>Thanks to an intense allergic reaction I'll get to enjoy at least 1.5 days in bed, with considerable medication.<br>Both my feet have swollen to an enormous size, taken an odd color and are itching heavyly.

Private campaign financing and heavy corporate lobbying were some of the primary catalysts for the change in government policy with regards to the complex relationship between the government and the private sector to so heavily shift in favor of large corporations and their interests that's occurred over the past several years.</br>  <br>That's just like your opinion.</br>  <br> tfw no massively swollen cock <br> yfw you realize you cant beat it </br></br>    <br>i've been violated</br>  <br>that blue horse looks like the hardblush mascot</br>    <br>Good, good.</br>    <br>Where the fuck are these things coming from?

I shall do the same.</br>  REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE</wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr>  <br>I hope you get in and if not, I'll see you next game, brotha.</br>  <br>Don't worry, I'm sure you'll find one this game.<br><br>Have I ever told you you have the loveliest dead eyes?</br></br></br>  <br>Ya know it, ma nigga</br>  <br><br>SOON U FUCK<br>NEED 1 MORE!</br></br></br>  <br>you are just the worst attention whore that ever step in hg.<br>thats all</br></br>  <br>Nope, but i watching you guys all this time. Don`t mind if i join?</br>  <br>A couple times, actually.<br>The first time was a while ago,<br>the second was more recent.<br>Things always shape up.</br></br></br></br>  REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;62814552 <wbr>8</wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr>  <br>Indeed. It happens on and off. But we will endure.<br> plus I'm unbannable </br></br>   wife of 4 has been getting sick the past few months <br> gets pregnant <br> a month later she gets terribly sick  <br> go to doctor <br> has lung cancer <br> wife passed away last week with my unborn baby <br><br><br>Where can I stream a suicide</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Fucking deliver OP, stream that shit live.  <br>Frankly, I dont see your problem. <br>Both of those little energy-vampiric leeches are dead and you're free to do as you please. <br>I mean, if you really want to kill self, I'm totally gonna watch and egg you on, but it sounds like you have it pretty sweet, so why bother with suicide?</br></br></br>  <br>dont mind me but that's a potato fetus and im a doctor</br>  Would you date a girl with a child?  If she was hot enough yeah for sure  <br>im to young for this</br>  <br>i'm already dating your mom so yeah</br>  fuck no  id probably financially support her in exchange for sex, but i wouldnt get in an intimate long-term relationship with her.  <br>REKKKKKKKT</br>  <br><br>Depends on what the situation is. For example my general policy is no because I don't know what the status with the ex is. See at this point in my life the kid doesn't scare me its the dickhead lurking around.<br><br>So, I once met a woman with a kid. Started as just friends until I found out her situation and that is that her ex was a total nutjob and just disappeared. Him gone permanently with no chance of reconciliation equals play ball on my end.</br></br></br></br>  Used goods, shows she's worthless and loves to fuck around. Side bitch only  well, if she had that child with nobody, if is just "puff" happend, yes i would.  2 pussies better than one  Not even if it was my own  <br>-I did<br>-I'll never do it again</br></br>  <br>Rekt<br><br>and yeah OP, I would. <br>Wouldn't get too commited though, maybe a few fucks</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Might wanna look up child support laws there bud, you'll end up paying it without even being the father when you leave her.</br></br>  What a stupid question, OP.<br><br>The child is proof that she sucks at making good decisions.<br><br>What more evidence do you need?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Wait when is summer over again?</br></br>  <br>I'd rather be alone most of the time, don't want to raise bastards. I would consider adopting child more than dating woman /w children. ( Unless she was a widow)</br>  <br>DAMN !!<br><br>And yes dear OP, if she is hot, why not?</br></br></br>  <br>If they were older and established yes if they are just some chick who got prego early nope, I have banged many of them though</br>  <br>What if previous partner got killed through no fault of his own? Like a drunk driver ran him over or he got stabbed by a mugger?<br><br>Sometimes shit happens.</br></br></br>  <br><br>It means she fucking puts out for real, no doubt brother.</br></br>  <br>No. I'm not one for playing baby daddy.</br>  <br>Summer is a myth you know.</br>  <br>All the cucks in here wanting to raise another's child and getting a rekt gaping pussy after popping out a kid.</br>  <br>No</br>    <br>It's like buying a game on a flea market, and resume playing on the former owners save. No thanks. I would not.</br>  I've banged a few single moms all between the ages of 18-24, but no I would not get in a long term with her BC I'm not taking care of someone else's kid  <br>You watch too many romance movies</br>  <br>pretty sure my lawyer and history of dealing exclusively in cash will make a mess out of that.</br>  <br>No</br>  <br><br>No.<br>I did'nt get a vasectomy for nothing.</br></br></br>  <br> waiting used goods  <br><br>no thanks i'm not a cuck.</br></br></br>  <br>sure. but I wouldn't let it get serious. there's no way I'm taking on someone elses baggage.</br>  <br> banged a few single moms <br> mfw its a fleshlight </br></br>  <br>Depends how old the child is. Nothing over 6 I reckon.</br>  <br>Make cps think mom is crazy.<br>Put the child up for the adoptions.<br>Build mom back up, but no refunds.<br> make new ones.<br>Good to go</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck? Yes.<br>Date date as serious business? No.</br></br>  <br>underage B&amp;</br>  depends on if the kid is gonna grow up to be a sex kitten... fer saaax...  <br> Haters gonna hate us cause they anus </br>  <br> some girl had a kid 5 years ago <br> she hasn't dated anybody in ages <br> somehow, fucking her makes you a cuck <br><br>I don't think you know anything about anything.<br>Get out there and stick your dick in places. It's fun.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you are literally retarded. adopted children are bastards too.</br>  <br>and by that, i mean the child</br>  <br>yes, as long as were not merging our assets or living together. Time and emotional energy is one thing but I'm not going to actively invest my money in someone else's kid.</br>  <br>yeah, but i understand why a lot of anons wouldn't</br>  <br><br>Definitely. If she's got teenagers stay the fuck away. Remember what a fucktard you were as a teen. Yeah, who wants to listen to some little shit disrespecting you and telling you that can't do shit cause you ain't their daddy.</br></br>  No, especially if it's mine.    <br>Is it my child?</br>  <br>on the other hand, you then get to give her a spanking :3</br>  Leave before the kid calls you daddy  <br>OP said date not fuck, learn to read fucking retard.</br>  If the kid was a nigger, no  <br>Games don't work like that. Its more like buying a used console that's been duck.</br>  <br>That's like playing another dude's savegame</br>  1 chold yes. 2 no. Every woman I've slept with that had more than two the inside of their pussy is a gaping hole. The sex sucks. You can definitely tell a large object was in there  Boy, no<br>Girl, yes...but only if she's really young...like before they can talk.</br>  <br>dont know, didnt had a threesome yet</br>  Sure, why not? Seems like /b/tards only go for girls who are, like themselves, virgins.  <br>the one you want to date or the child?</br>  <br> Games don't work like that. <br>I guess you were not around for the cartridge eras</br></br>  <br>You're fucking retarded, I've banged chicks that have had 3 kids with tighter pussy than those with none. Its about muscle control and kegals. My ex had three kids, but she had the kung fu ninja grip with the pussy. You're dating lazy chicks or have a small dick.</br>  <br>At least you're playing a game.<br>If we're going for the game analogy, why only play one game?<br>Play allllll the games</br></br></br>  <br>why not both?</br>  <br>I 2nd this.. I dated one for 2 years, fucking nightmare. Don't ever think for one sec that seeing a single mother is a good idea. Guys listen up, she's gonna try and suck up to you on a level you've never seen before to make you 'buy the used car', don't. This bitch sucked my dick like she needed it more than air. She cooked well. She did everything to try and make the sale. None of it was worth the shit I had to deal with. I'm out now and look back and wonder what the fuck I was thinking.</br>  <br>this <br>wife was a horrible lay before the kid. After kegels she's tighter than ever and we can do a lot more positions since it does not hurt her anymore. I swear she could crush walnuts.</br></br>  <br>What are you? 12?</br>  <br>Well no one is being specific.</br>  <br>Nah man. If we're doing this, then let's do it. There ar ehundres of games out there that are terrible and not even worth looking at, let a lone playing. I don't play shitty games at all.<br> I will fuck literally anyone though. </br></br>  <br><br>Holy shit this is exactly what I was going to write.<br><br>She had two daughters 15 and 14.<br><br>She sucked the living life out of my dick, took it in the ass and let me fuck her anywhere. But fuck me the baggage was unreal</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>sure, but not for the mother :^)</br>  <br>from the context of the original statement he could have only been talking about a cartridge with internal memory. (n64 GBA some snes and sega games)</br>  <br>Fuck you kid. COD is the only thing worth living for. BattleToads and old cartridge game are horrible like sex with you mom, but I still hit it just to let you father watch me cum on her.</br>  <br>Fine, play alllllll the (worthwhile) games (that you can afford)<br>Including the oldies but goodies. N64 anyone?</br></br>  if depends if i have to hang around the kid, then no fucking way. if i dont have to see that shithead then sure. <br>i fucking hate children.</br>  <br>literally the worst system! That's like the asian hobo category of sex</br>  <br>Well, you got me.</br>  <br>in principle, no.<br><br>if she's very special, the kid is alright and there is no asshole father interfering, maybe.</br></br></br>  <br>worst system was GBA without a doubt. 90% of it's catalog were movie games and stuff on par with flash games. Only a handful of decent rpgs and most of them were not even localized.</br>  <br>Koptek</br>  <br>Obviously never heard of Panasonic CDO...</br>  <br>mine had a boy 8 and girl 11. No one in that house knew how to communicate without screaming, besides me. From the time they'd wake up until they went to school it was everyone screaming at everyone. 'YOUR GOING TO BE LATE, HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU!!'ect. I learned to stay in the bedroom in the mornings because I couldn't handle the noise. One of the worst parts was her parents lived on the 2nd floor so they'd come down three times a day have their nose in everything. Couldn't mind their own business for a single day. They slowly started loosing respect for me for not 'laying down the law and yelling at the kids'..as if that was my job.</br>  <br>B-b-but i like asian hobos...<br>God-tier bang. if you've never had your dick chomped down like an egg foo yung for 5 dorra I would highly recommend the experience.</br></br>  <br>lost</br>  <br> No young mother has ever lost a partner. <br>What world do you live in?</br></br>  I would think to myself, 'she's a lot of fun to fuck and hang out with but her kids are always around and that sucks' then it hit me like lightning..I fucking hate kids. Life has been better after I realized and accepted it. I always disliked children, I was just in the closet about it for years. Now that I openly talk about it, people look at me like I'm a monster, but at least I'm not living a lie. <br><br>Had a conversation with a friend of mine a few days ago and he admitted I converted him. He said 'last time we hung out you said kids should be banned from all bars and I didn't agree with you, but the other day I had a incident and now I totally agree with you'</br></br>  <br> tfw love of life is coming back into picture and might want to rekindle things but she has a kid now <br>wat do?</br></br>  <br><br>Maybe. Not sure though.</br></br>  <br><br><br>some dank memes guys good job</br></br></br>  <br><br>How old are you?</br></br>  <br>I did for a little while, it sucks.</br>  <br>move on, she'll use you until you're dry and move on they always do. At least find something that has a lower overhead.</br>  <br>i would rather date the child</br>  <br>nope. any bitch dumb/crazy enough to get knocked up and end up single aint worth any man's time. raising another man's kid is cuckoldry.</br>  <br>are you nuts?</br>  <br>stay the fuck away. delete all contact information. The best way to get her out of your head is to get something new. Learn a few magic tricks online and head out to the bar with a deck of cards and pick up some strange. Leave your ex to the hell she's created. The best revenge is just to do well. Fuck some hot single childless strange and live your life. Don't be that guy that picks up other peoples trash. If you don't listen to this advice and you involve yourself, your going to have a new example of what regret means.</br>  <br>Currently dating a girl, who's son's father died before he was born. drunk driver.</br>  <br>Nope. Her mistake isn't mine.</br>  <br>31 now, was 26 then</br>  <br>why is that?</br>  <br>I'm not dating your mom</br>  <br>Everyone hear that? Get out your pencils and paper, this is called self respect.</br>  <br>especially the ones who live on welfare and still post on facebook about how having the kid was the best thing they ever did</br>  <br><br>Yeah, kinda feel this anyway, keep sort of hoping someone is going to tell me something that magically makes me feel OK about raising some loser's kid but it ain't happening.</br></br>  <br>Fuck no, you'll just get stuck raising some other asshole's brat, and their lives are usually a fucking trainwreck by this point.</br>  <br>he was drunk driving or he was killed by a drunk driver?</br>  <br><br>See I guess your set then.<br><br>When I was 25 I thought the same way but I'm now 31 and have warmed up to the idea of kids.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nope the fuck out, Bitch didn't want you before and went and got a kid with some other cunt which means they're still in the picture somewhat. Nah mang, drop that shit and find someone better</br>  <br> house on fire <br> married parents die while kid stays at grandparents or friends <br><br>I admit, it is not likely, but it can happen.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, tried it twice, it doesn't work<br><br>#1<br> meet girl when out drinking <br> we start dating <br> "I have a kid but my parents look after it" <br> I can believe this, we met in London, she was a work addict, and when we aren't working we are out drinking <br> her kid is 4, she barely sees it <br> it doesn't even call her mum <br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/628137445#p628145403">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And the grandparents and no other family won't take them and they end up in the system?

I’ll have you know he graduated top of my class in the Navy crows, and he has been involved in numerous secret raids on bmws and vws and ge have over 300 confirmed shits. He is trained in gorilla warfare and he's the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to him but just another target. He will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to him over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak he is contacting his secret network of crows across the USA and your car is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your clean car. You’re fucking dead, kid. He can be anywhere, anytime, and he can shit onl you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with his bare anus. Not only is he extensively trained in unarmed combat, but he has access to the entire arsenal of the United States marinee Crowa and will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. He will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it.
