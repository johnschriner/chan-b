Considering most Asian cultures give fuck all about their women, it makes sense that would have been searching for something in her life that made her feel like she had importance and just ran out of options and ended up becoming a feminist. Truly a sad story if I ever heard one.</br>    <br><br>am I doin it rite?</br></br>      <br>http://www.breitbart.com/london/201<wbr>4/12/04/the-sexodus-part-1-the-men-<wbr>giving-up-on-women-and-checking-out<wbr>-of-society/</wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>This is why.</br>  <br/>    <br/>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;628792904 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;628792904 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;628792904 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;628792904 </br></br></br>    <br>I am now a rapist.</br>  Dominant women are hot  <br>agree!! I wish some woman would rape me..I wouldnt complain</br>  <br>Feminism is fine, but it's the 3rd wave that is shit.</br>  <br><br><br>I can generally accept these here. Other than that, this whole, everything is rape shit... fuck that. That's not a woman's desire to be equal, that's these women's desire to be in a position of complete power. Equality is one thing, superiority is another.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, they do have a rape problem.</br>  Feminism is good because it promotes the equality of everyone. Especially for men who are highly disadvantaged in society.  In a sense yes, but this 3rd wave "feminism", which is really not feminism is like shitting into a bucket and serving it up as chili.<br><br>Side note, avoid anyone that mentions that they are a feminist within the first 10mins of meeting that person.</br></br>    <br>In the words of Papa Franku: You must've just ate rotten alphabet soup, cause now you're just SHITTING out words that don't make sense.</br>  <br>Thank you for introducing me to 4th wave feminism, anon. This is a movement I can get behind.... hopefully.</br>    When feminist say "I'm a feminist because I want equal rights for women" I ask them "What rights in the US only apply to men?" And they run away and scream "OPRESSION!"  <br> Why is feminism good /b/? <br><br>It has fully relieved the ugly nature of women.<br><br>We now see a world were women are basically free to do and say as they please without social consequence. This world has led to men being treated like shit both legally and socially. <br><br>Women are whores and leeches. Feminism is just women whoring themselves out to the government to leech on men as a whole.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>To be fair, feminists didn't write rape legislation, so it's not their fault that the legal definition isn't gender neutral. Some even say they're working to make it gender neutral.<br><br>Feminism is still almost 100% evil, though https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=iAR<wbr>HCxAMAO0</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>This is one of the few that makes sense.</br>  <br>So she's admitting that men are generally more intelligent than women?</br>  Only niggers and arabs rape<br>everybody knows that</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=bk5<wbr>xYc09Mos&amp;oref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.you<wbr>tube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dbk5xYc09Mos&amp;<wbr>has_verified=1</wbr></wbr></wbr>  [ ]<br>to those who need it</br>  <br>You magnificent bastard.</br>  <br>As someone who disagrees with women, it has set me on the slippery slope to being a rapist.

It's an industry demand for actresses to show their bodies.

I'm a better cook than most of the women I know. They can GTFO my kitchen.</br>  <br> adoH <br>As in Hitler?<br><br>Sorry, but Nazi germany was a passive matriarchy. First the WW1 killed, maimed and demoralized a lot of men. Therefore they couldn't put up any petit patriarchal resistance against the Supreme Father, bawling from the radio.</br></br></br></br>  On the one hand, I'm for abortion because it involves killing babies. But on the other hand, I'm against it because it gives women a choice. It's a serious moral dilemma.  <br><br><br><br>Thing is that the brown, black and yellow women have never mattered for the feminists and never will. As a matter of fact, some black feminists are calling themselves womanists.<br><br>Therefore I propose that the black womanists and the MRAs should ally against the feminist-conservative axis of emasculation. Fuck! It would be a good thing if the mattress moving and Solanas-schlicking feminists never bred and was supplanted by mulattos.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But but, women already do have equal rights.</br>  Its all about numbers. In Russia you're are men are more likely to be raped by women. Because there are more women then men. Women have needs too, and statistically women in Russia rape men more often  <br>A really good looking man is rarely accused of sexual harassment, because when the man is good looking, the woman doesn't mind. The same behavior from an ugly guy might get the cops involved. It's no different. But if you were going to be raped by a woman, she's likely to be very unattractive to you. You would not appreciate a moment of it.</br>  <br>You can't rape the willing, dumb ass.</br>  <br>I kind of agree with her, wouldn't it be cool to craft your own motorcycle or aircraft AS WELL AS some sick ass weapons? Just saying I'm on her side just this once.</br>  <br>I've never taken that shit seriously. I'm 18 and 5'9" but I've never had a problem with women, I have no idea where this manlet thing comes from, it just sounds like a bunch of either ugly or insecure guys trying to shout out the only thing they have going for them - height.</br>  <br>Who is that guy?</br>  <br>I haven't either, but then I don't take a lot of female stereotypes seriously either. I'm much more likely to go after the girls built like a board than the Kardashians of the world. D's are a turn off.<br><br>Some men do take it seriously, though. Just like some men take bald, hairy, beardless, etc. seriously. Body image issues don't have to be universally agreed upon to fuck up the people that have them.</br></br></br>  <br>He's right. Women are terrible cooks.</br>  <br>I don't understand why feminazi's think being afraid to walk at night is something only women experience.<br>I've avoided walking around at night specifically due to the fact I lived in a rough area. Same goes for many men around the world. Gun &amp; knife crime, drunks looking for trouble, wearing the wrong coloured clothes for fuck sake.<br><br>They try justifying it by saying that the feminism movement will make the world a better place, hurr derr equality!!<br>As if all the arseholes in the world are just going to say "hmm yeah, I think I'm not going to be an arsehole anymore and become a feminist"<br><br>They're all fucking deluded.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I don't understand why feminazi's think being afraid to walk at night is something only women experience. <br>For the umpteenth time: BECAUSE THEY ARE LITTLE ENTITLED PRINCESSES THAT BELIEVES THAT THE WHOLE WORLD CIRCLES AROUND THEM.<br><br> As if all the arseholes in the world are just going to say "hmm yeah, I think I'm not going to be an arsehole anymore and become a feminist" <br>Some of them are.

Unless we're counting Hearthstone in which case it would be Anduin...  <br>Yume nikki<br>Madotsuki</br></br>  i don't think i can do this anymore. I've been plagued with depression for the last 5 days. I can hardly move, hardly think, hardly eat, and my wife says she's had enough of me breaking her heart.<br>I've always had a suspicion that she's cheated on me, but has never admitted to it. <br>In 7 years of our marriage she has put me in 7 situations to where anyone would think she's cheated. She's butt-dialed me while flirting with another man drunk talking about how they are going to fuck when i'm not home. She's come home drunk in the backseat of someone's car claiming that she was trying to be respectful to me, but somehow forgot that she could've called a cab. This guy didn't really feel like talking to me and split as soon as she got out. her pussy was all wet like she had been fucking him. Now I'm going through some crazy paranoia where i think she's cheating on me now even though she isn't drinking anymore. The reason i think of this is because she made me go through a dry spell of a month without sex no matter what i said or did. I was constantly being rejected and everytime i tried to explain to her my pain she would yell at me and call me selfish so i don't open up to her about my feelings anymore. I've tried opening up to her and explaining how I feel rejected while already dealing with abandonment issues from my own parents, but she always yells at me and tells me that i'm selfish or that i'm never satisfied with her and she shows me her rage. <br><br>I don't have a friend in the world to talk to about anything i'm going through and i'm sad and hurt and in pain and instead of trying to help me through it she throws blind rage at me and tells me to leave and never come back. on top of that i think i have male breast cancer but i keep putting it off because I don't want to face that truth during my depression. I am going through all this alone in silence, while culminating suicidal thoughts and she doesn't even care.<br> i want to kill myself but i'm scared. how do i do it? </br></br></br></br></br>  You are punishing the wrong person. If she is that bad, punish her by leaving her. She will have to find a way to make it in the world, and you will be free of an anchor. You will feel better right away.  Fag, rape your wife then killyourself on stream.  Talk to a shrink an reevaluate your life<br>Or<br>Create a split personality start a fight club and then blow up all the major credit card company headquarters with homemade explosive</br></br>  Fuck, m8, why can't you blame her of being selfish?  movie scenes women will never understand.     men: understand that it's a man's duty to see to it that the woman they love receive the best possible outcome from life even if they're not a part of it <br><br> women: OMG HES SO HAWWWTTT xDD </br></br>  <br>and the dying sniper scene at the end</br>  trips decides what I say to my boss when I quit today, will post video.  <br><br>rekt</br></br>  <br>FUCKING WINRAR.
