[ Maryland girls  <br>Severna Park?</br>      Hey, to anyone here who's good at Photoshop. I really like this picture of myself, however I don't like all the junk food rappers in front of me. I feel it gives off the wrong impression, and makes me look day. You guys think you could Photoshop all that out for me? Maybe clean up the pic too? Make it look nicer, ya know?  <br> Ha Daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay</br>  Just getting the hang of photo editing but I think I did okay. Enjoy OP!
