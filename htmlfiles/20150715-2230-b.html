Sativa preferred I dont like sleeping at all, i'd rather stay up and sit on /b/ all night.</br>  <br>I just moved to Vancouver, been price searching various dispensaries trying to get the best deal and best deal I can find is $4 grams. Thing is though, the place that sells the $4 grams is like 25min away. <br><br>As opposed to a place across the road which while convenient, is $8 a gram. <br><br>You bros think it's worth the extra effort to get half the price?</br></br></br></br></br>  What i am smoking right now  King kush dab,pineapple herb and some edibles made with risin butter  Pic was related, then there was sweat, then the hair changed and is weird but totally worth it  <br>$8 a gram is still cheap i live in ontario and its $10 a gram</br>  <br>nice pic</br>  <br>i dont get that sleepy with either</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>2013+2 <br> smoking weed <br><br>Fags.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Where you from?</br>  <br>nice!</br>  <br>Take a dab for me man.

It was the greatest trip of my life.</br>  <br>dude, dabs are the shit. You gotta be careful with them though, cause if you use them too often your tolerance fucking skyrockets.</br>  <br>wow anon, nice.<br>i'd be too ashamed to tatooo any drug related stuff on myself.<br>i'm also ashamed to have a tumblr dedicated to drug use</br></br></br>  <br><br> top tier indica <br> giant needle of pain killers injected into brain <br> dont wanna move <br> or <br> knocked out <br><br>other than that, just body high. raising thoughts and the mild psych feeling isnt as intense</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>thats some og fire there</br>  <br>Thank you, sir. I got this gem for free when the artist saw my pupils. I was three days into a very heavy trip brought on by accidentally dosing with some crystal</br>  El Paso Texas. If someone could be my new acid connect. I'll like love you 5eva  <br><br>ive been smoking for 8 and a half years. if i go a few weeks/months without smoking, the first bowl i finally get to toke... ill have severe anxiety. depending on how much i allow it, it can last for hours, it can last for 10-15 mins. it can last for the next 3-4 bowls. after that, i can smoke for years non-stop and almost never feel anything negative. most people get over the anxiety eventually. some have a little. some have some for personal reasons. a lot of it is psychological, my man. if you have a lot of stress in your life (some you might not even know about), it can control your high<br><br>just keep practicing. marijuana is one of the most enjoyable things in life if you can get a 10/10 high off a bong with some medical grade chronic. it's a mild altering of your consciousness. this is a sign that you should probably never do psychedelics</br></br></br></br>  http://www.youtube.com/user/TheHigh<wbr>RiseCo/videos<br><br>yea or nay?</br></br></wbr>  <br>that actually sounds perfect for me, gonna have to find me some</br>  <br>greentext anon?</br>  One of my best friends told me that smoking would help with my depression. Is that true? Also whats the average amount for an 8th. His dealer sells 8ths for $40 and i want to know whats the amount so I'm not ripped off. Thanks for any help. If i get any at all.  <br>Yea I'm already starting to feel like that,the edibles tho are a another high especially when you already dabbing and smoking</br>  <br>That's a good price if it's some good <br><br>Where I'm from guess might be different from where everybody else from</br></br></br>  <br>Use a vaporizer. It's a different kind of high you get. It's a higher energy, clear minded kind of high. I like it more.</br>  <br> One of my best friends told me that smoking would help with my depression. Is that true? <br><br>if you allow it, learn breathing techniques, practice, and find some dank shit, yes.<br><br> Also whats the average amount for an 8th <br><br>location matters oh so much. in my old town, 60 for an eighth is considered common (even in some other states) but one of the highest prices in the country for it. in oregon, i hear ounces go for less than 250 for top quality stuff. at medical shops, ounces are 300. in legalization states, eighths are super cheap... probably just a little over 20. depends on dealer, how much you buy, etc. 40 is fair if its good quality<br><br>dont forget. you might not feel anything the first 1-3 times you smoke (maybe). especially if you dont teach yourself... to inhale properly</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How would i know he doesnt give me like a dub and a half instead of an 8th? Im in nyc btw.</br>  <br><br>cannacamp.co<br><br>Anybody want to go with me?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Get a scale</br>  <br>I had a tattoo idea of getting all of the molecules tattooed in a sleeve up my arm. The ones i've done are DMT, LSD, Shrooms, and MXE.</br>  <br>Im in nyc. Since i dont know how to roll i bought a flowermater 5.0v. How would i know hes not going to give me like a dub and a half instead of an 8th? Last thing i want to do is spend money and get ripped off</br>  <br>Whats the weight of an 8th? Any good scales to recommend?</br>  <br>Get a scale bro it's worth it <br><br>I'm from Texas and that's a pretty good price if it's some good</br></br></br>  <br>3.5<br><br>You ever smoked before?</br></br></br>  <br>3.5 grams (1/8 oz)<br>here is a conversion table<br>28 grams-1 oz<br>16 oz- 1 pound</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>like others say, consider a scale. but only if you plan on doing this more or even have the chance to weigh it. a good scale is at least 15-20 bucks or more, so its up to you. if your friend is inviting you into the stoner world, theres a good chance you can trust him and let him help you with everything. he probably knows everything. outside of that, most people just eyeball amounts after they get ideas over time of what it looks like but that isn't always reliable either due to density, etc</br></br>  <br>Like a handful of times. 3.5g okay got it thanks for that.</br>  <br>Imma get one from amazon. Fuckin prime day and shit. Thanks.</br>  <br>Thanks! That helps a lot.</br>  <br>Alright thanks. Im gonna get a scale from amazon being that its prime day.

So, weed became legal for everyone on the 1st of this month. Part of the new law is we're able to grow our own in our homes. Black market dealers are trying to get while the getting is good. A lot of weight dealers here are burned out old hippies who grow primo medical shit and supplement their disability checks by selling their excess. Some guy offered me a QP of Blue Dream he said tested out to 28% for $400 on the 4th. I've been hearing similar stories from friends.<br><br>Personally, I'm just waiting for my next paycheck so I can buy an air system and then my grow room is ready to rock.</br></br></br></br></br>  Update:<br>Papa joint gone. Now papa roach.<br>Smoked two peebs, currently smoking these three bowls back to back and posting</br></br>  been high since 4am, doing fuck all but lay on my couch watching banged up abroad. this is what life is for.  <br>Apollo 13 is dank, Always have A11 &amp; A13 crosses going.

Chocolate Thai cross on left.</br>  this bowl smells so good, too bad this is the last of it :(  every joint, bong, vape, everything i've smoked for the last 2.5 fucking years, i've had to smoke in my bathroom. neighbours said they'd call the police if i didn't stop making their house stink like weed. this shit is awful.<br> disappears for 15 mins. gonna miss parties, happenings and sativa claus while gone. nobody knows this hell </br>  <br>I'd rather have some C99</br>  <br><br>its my 2nd favorite of the bunch anon</br></br>  <br>Use active carbon filters and ona odor neutralizer.</br>  i have a bud upstairs which is so ridiculously covered in crystals that it looks yellow. it's only when you break the thing open that you see the green. new strains are the shit.  <br>Cinderella is okay, but I prefer her sisters.</br>  <br>Is it just like making honey oil with isopropol alcohol?</br>  <br><br>Bud is for degenerate losers, might as well huff paint.<br><br>Do a real substance like speed or cow pat.</br></br></br></br>  <br>dude not cool, I just got through terrible jenkem withdrawals</br>  <br>aww who's a precious little petal then. well done sonny. your drugs are better than my drugs. now hurry along, big boys like you have worlds to save.</br>  Smoke time  <br>Might be, I just think that TGA's Subcool is an ass. Won't even bother his gear.</br>  How do you guys get to pick your strains? Is it legal where you are or have you got awesome dealers?<br><br>Here in the UK, you order weed and normally get shit.</br></br>  <br>Agora, you pleb. nobody buys on the streets any more. it's all just shit some chav grew in a cupboard. even amsterdam coffeeshops are shit by comparison, you get like 1000 different strains to choose from, all medgrade.<br>uk too, btw.</br></br>  <br>Biggest seedbanks are based in UK.<br><br>Here's what I take in consideration:<br> who bred it <br> does he offers only regulars <br> has it been tested by legit people <br> what cross is it / flowering time <br> availability <br> is it a new batch of seeds <br> price </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Woops, I misunderstood, thought by strains, you meant seeds, not buds ;^)</br></br>  <br>i just choose strains from recent cannabis cup winners. always awesome. attitude seedbank is where it's at.</br>  <br>Care to clarify dude?</br>  <br>Cannabis cup winners don't mean jack.

It's what was used to create the autoflowering strains, which are weak. Afghan Kush could be decent, but the ruderalis in the mix wouldn't add anything to the high, I don't understand why something like that would've won anything.</br>  <br>bubblegum is a nice, clean high. big bud is alright, mainly chosen for yield.<br><br>the ruderalis genetics simply make it autoflower and grow much smaller, that's all. strength is unaffected.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Are you fucking stupid, that is celery...</br></br>  <br>If it's the original Indiana Bubblegum. The Big Bud is about the worst weed there is, it has the potential to yield decent, but the high is so boring, critical mass is basically big bud 2.0, but even that is kind of dull.</br>  <br> strains from the past <br> crap "seedbank" <br>If want something from a Bubblegum-lineage B.O.G is the guy to get from</br></br></br>  I just moved away from California (for financial reasons).

I'm literally down to this. <br><br>Super Silver Haze</br></br></br>  bongs??  aare we agreed that o.g kush, g13 and mr nice are the most fucking over-rated strains of all time? <br><br>also has anyone grown green crack without the entire fucking street stinking, even with an inline fan and charcoal filter? shit is impossible, i had to abandon a grow simply because of the stink, i could smell it before i even got home</br></br>  <br>what pipes are the best? glass or sherlock ive used a metal one but it was wayyyy to harsh</br>  <br><br>bubblegum is top 10 to 20 for me<br><br><br> wanting to feel good without addiction is for losers <br><br>i hope i wasnt this retarded and misguided when i was an addict</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Anyone have one of these?<br><br>Hakko soldering iron is great to spark bowls with. No butane and burns cooler than a lighter (better flavor, saves weed)</br></br></br></br>  <br> down to this. <br>worst feeling in the world. i panic and buy alcohol if i run out, which makes me crave weed even more. especially the next day when i'm hung over. hate being such a retarded addict, cannot even remember the last time i spent a full day sober. at least a decade ago.</br></br>  <br><br>right? stuff is nuts</br></br>  <br>glass with a removable titanium bowl is best imo. pricey though.</br>  Anyone know where to get hook ups in socal?  <br> OG Kush, Green crack, G13 <br>Hype strains, it's well known, "don't believe the hype"<br><br>And "Mr Nice" is the nickname of a hash smuggler that associated with breeders to found "Mr Nice seeds", they produced some best-sellers strains in the past.<br><br>But it has been more than a decade that they are nowhere near good anymore.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  are there any legal things you guys think you pay too much for, things you want but struggle to get hold of, things you'd like to see for sale? i need money and i'm trying to spot a niche here.<br>how about dabbing kit? hasn't really taken off much yet but presumably it will.<br>how can i make money from you?</br></br>  <br>i know howard marks, dude has a forest in his garden. his strain was so FUCKING BORING though, even though it was grown by a coffeeshop. just don't get where the hype comes from, everyone seemed to love o.g too, i honest to god preferred 90's skunk.</br>  <br><br><br>Holy sHIet. You assholes have made science out of nothing-- as I expect a bunch of college reject potheads to do. FAIL, nerds.</br></br></br>  <br>I can live. I don't respond well to 5+ beers. It encourages me not to drink. I just take some real tiny hits and try to be conservative with my stash. I know I have to meet people but eh what can you do. A few weeks sober is definitely a good thing for me. <br><br>I also have this guy, the Magic Flight Launch Box. I need to get it replaced under warranty though.</br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>Hardly doubt he ever grew anything, he always associated with know breeders, and still does http://cbdcrew.org/about-us/<br><br>Mr Nice is just a "brand", Howard is just a salesperson</br></br></br>  <br>how the hell did you break a MFLB? those things are indestructible. split the copper element or something?</br>  <br>he grew shitty weed in the uk in the 80's but gave up. he lives outside of the uk now and there are vids of him tending to his trees</br>  <br>Anyone in WA?? 6450 to be precise.

Not posting pic because of exif data, and I don't care if anyone believes me.</br>  <br>exif is autostripped from 4chan now. or upload a png which is stripped before it even gets here.</br>  <br>Dude, give me your address and I'll roll them for you. Those are just painful to see.</br>  <br>lmao<br> ?</br></br>  <br>how could something so beautiful be illegal</br>  <br>because it's "incredibly damaging" and "hugely toxic"<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=hzM<wbr>u2lzEdwE</wbr>  [ ]<br> dat dislikes bar </br></br></br>  <br>What part of MO?

How can you believe with 100% certainty that there is no God when there is no proof that he does not exist? That doesn't seem like a very logical, open minded and scientific way to view the world. It seems more like your beliefs are being dictated by your emotions and not on facts (just like religious people).  <br>sleep tight porker</br>  <br>exactly!<br>being sure and being right is not the same.<br><br>Like we are 100% sure our eyes are not real.</br></br></br></br>  <br> But actually I am MORE sure that your god does not exist, than I am sure somewhere in the universe a horse with a unicornhorn exists. <br><br> I am 100% sure god doesn't exist <br>  Because I'm 100% there are no unicorns <br><br>Makes sense.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Island Survival V2<br>7 Decides what he does.</br>  <br>Try to take a coconut</br>  He will fap   <br>Masturbate onto the crab</br>  <br>Roll for that</br>  Pics you are not supposed to share/pics you saved from other anons thread.
