I'll post everything in this folder before switching back to the main one</br>  <br>Nope</br>    <br>Bump</br>      Glad to see I'm not the only one horny for Miku at least        <br>If also love to see this</br>              lurking    <br>Did you want to talk about something in particular, Op? I'll listen if you had something to share.</br>      <br>Nah, nothing particular. Porn or something, I guess. Unless you're uncomfortable talking about fetishes or whatever, then just take your pick of any topic</br>                        Welp, that's everything that was in my feet folder  Back to your regularly scheduled Miku, unless someone wanted the catgirl folder?  <br><br>Hello there, mysterious silent other poster</br></br>                  <br>Ah, alrighty then.<br><br>Thanks for dumping anyway.</br></br></br>      <br>Aww, not up for a random topic? Well. you're welcome anyway</br>      <br>Catgirls are always appreciated op</br>    <br>Cat-eared Miku, on her way</br>        <br>I am not really much of a talker. Prefer to listen.</br>      <br>Well in that case, is there anything you'd want to listen to me talk about?</br>        This thread is hilarious, or rather OP is. Possibly a few others as well.    <br>Sure. How was your day?</br>    <br>It was ok. I did some work, I played some games, I got horny and that's what led me to here. Not a particularly exciting day</br>      <br>What are you working on?</br>      <br>I am glad you're having fun, anon.</br>  <br>Well, I was just helping my dad with some work. He's self-employed and needs a hand every now and than. I don't bother getting a regular part time job during the summer for that reason. The rest of the year, I'm at uni</br>        That's all the cat stuff I have  <br>It's amusing because it shows how stupid your average /b/ poster is. I think the same way of anyone that starts a porn thread on /b/.</br>  Back to the main folder again                  <br>Ah, that's farily close to my situation. I suppose money is not an issue, if you could help him out rather than look for another source of income? And what field is he in?<br><br>Also, what are you studying?</br></br></br>      <br>Stupid how?</br>  <br>He fits carpets<br>I'm studying English Literature</br></br>  <br>He's probably going to point to the various porn boards, not realising that there might be reasons why people would want to post threads here instead</br>  I'm contributing with the only pic I have in my phone<br>sorry if already posted</br>                    <br>He fits carpets? Can you elaborate please because I don't think I've ever encountered that job before...<br><br>And I am so jealous of that. It's always been my fanciful dream to study something related to linguistics rather than engineering. Can you tell me more about your courses?</br></br></br>  This thread's about to hit the image limit.<br>I do have another to maybe fill another thread if people really want more?</br>  <br>I thought he was hinting at something else. Still, I am curious what exactly he wanted to say.</br>  <br>10 IPs <br>Take a guess if people care or not. I'd say no. People fap and then leave. That's what porn threads are.</br></br>    <br>You'd be surprised, anon</br>  Saved the entire thread's pictures. Thanks OP.    I'll end the show  <br>Err, he... fits carpets? You know, he puts floorings down and stuff. I'm not really sure how else to explain it, I've never had anyone tell me they don't know what it is before. I guess it is one of those jobs that you forget exists since you probably don't have carpets changed all that often.<br><br>As for my course, there's the modules you'd expect like the Gothic and Elizabethan poetry and whatever, then there's some more specialised ones every now and then you can take, such as crime fiction in the long 18th century.<br><br>Also, image limit reached</br></br></br></br></br>  lurker here, thanks for the thread guys, off to work now. have a nice evening/day. I'm not a robot but I want to be  <br>I just didn't think this would be common enough of an occurrence to prompt an actual profession.<br><br>What made you pick that major? Do you have aspirations to be a writer yourself?</br></br></br>  OP, is she your waifu or anything? I'm going to be working on AI in a couple years, and I'm curious what you expect from a waifu program. I'm wondering where to start, you know what I mean?  <br>Well, someone's gotta do the job. It's not as straightforward as it sounds.<br><br>And I don't know, I just like talking about books, I guess. There's a separate course entirely for Creative Writing.<br><br><br>Nah, I just like fapping to Miku</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ah, ok. Thanks for the dump though!</br>  <br>No problem, though if you still want input, I guess a waifu AI shouldn't be too easy? You know, kind of ruins the image if they act like a slut</br>  <br>So, favourite author and book by them?</br>  Continuation of a Game of /b/ros<br><br>MUPDATE: Turn 30<br>Open Houses: Martell<br>Open Schisms: Harlaw and Hightower<br><br>Event: Springtime - All rolls receive a +1 T bonus</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>I attack Baelish<br> Lord John Arryn, ruler of the vale <br> Allies: Bolton <br> Permission: <br> NAP: <br> Bonus: The Bloody Gate, Neutrality (0/3) </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Take the remains of my people and fight South, through Lord Baelish lands with his permission to Essos<br> Lord Grendel Stark, the Ruined, the Forsaken, Shield of the Old North, Wolf of Winterfell, Leader of the Remnants of the True North, Commander of Fookin Legend, Old Nan, Hodor, and an asian <br> Allied with Baelish <br> Winter is Coming (0/1) </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>tully attacks vale <br><br> Lord Kalten of House Tully, The Son of the River  <br> Lord of Riverrun  <br> Lord of The Twins  <br> Lord of The Reach <br> Ruler of The Trident  <br> The Conqueror <br> Allies: (Married)House Greyjoy <br> Rains of Castamere +1T  <br> Bonus Married to a King +1T </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Bolton&gt;Stark out from WF and DF<br><br> Roose the Goose is Loose Bolton <br> 20 Good Men <br> Brightroar +1Siege <br> Allies: Arryn <br> NAP: Greyjoy </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>who are you attacking, me or Baelish<br> Lord John Arryn, ruler of the vale <br> Allies: Bolton <br> Permission: <br> NAP: <br> Bonus: The Bloody Gate, Neutrality (0/3) </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Blackfyre &gt; Siege Sunspear, cede to Yronwood<br><br> Lord Racyrryon Blackfyre, Wielder of the Valryian Steel Bastard Sword “Blackfyre”, Commander of the Golden Company, The Last of The Noble Valyrians, The Black Dread, The Impulsive, The Rash, The Crude and The Strong Grey Dragon <br> Alliances: Yronwood <br> Non Aggression Pacts:  <br> Bonus: The Golden Company: +1T, -1S </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you</br>  <br>OOC: Get the fuck out.
