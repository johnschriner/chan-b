Teenagers from mars is my favorite coming-of-age story, not least because it feels kind of raw and messy around the edges, like it was made with ambition and heart rather than calculated expertise.

I haven't kept up with his recent output though. Thoughts?</br></br></br>  <br>shit, I wanted to like this SO HARD. It let me down bad, though. 7/10 for me, tops.</br>  Don't know if you can find it in english  is shade, the changing man god-tier? i'm honestly asking; I've never read it.  This. Always this.  <br><br>I loved it, but I do feel they should have expanded on the bodyguard's backstory (I don't remember his name, "The Human Cementary" guy)<br><br>Did you expect it to be more political or less cliche? Maybe humanize the TV Execs?</br></br></br></br>  great story, and every panel is amazing.    <br>less cliche, for sure. the "punk rock ANARCHY vs Christian Soccer Moms" thing is a great conflict, but it was so primitively put together it felt like a 7th grader wrote it. the core concept is genius, but the execution did not impress me. the spread that got posted included, like, literally all of the characterization of the band members, and it was in the most glaringly tell-don't-show way possible. and the ending? I kept waiting for a subversive reveal, but it just kind of stopped. Uggh. I mean, I like sean murphy (joe the barbarian is cash money), but this book did not scratch the itch I was hoping it would.</br>  And it don't stop  <br>OH FUCK YEAH. this book was tops</br>  <br>I heard about it. It seems pretty interesting.</br>  <br>It's well-done enough to be fiction, but it's non-fiction. Derf Backderf is awesome. Think if the love child of Pekar and Crumb went to high school with J-Dahms.</br>   I cried and cried when I read Star Bullets 2  anybody here read Scud? It was pretty great. the complete edition image put out is worth picking up.  <br><br>You know what I remember the most? <br><br>The little girl in the red dress. (Which, should have been colored a la Schindler's List)<br><br>I had no issues with the ending. My biggest beef was that it didn't have a whole lot to do with Punk music or culture, they should have thrown around some band names and references to history. You could swap Punk for K-pop in this comic too easily and that's not something to be proud of.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i do agree that the punk bits felt painted on rather than as any kind of thematic core. i remember that murphy's clear points about the IRA were somewhat awkwardly shoehorned in, at least they felt that way to me. it seemed like he would have been better off making a different miniseries about irish political struggles.</br>  I feel like /b/ on the whole would enjoy Prison Pit a lot.  <br>it's too abstract for me</br>  <br>Humanimals</br>  <br>Interesting. What are your favorite movies then?</br>  what do anons think of Paul Pope? I'm enjoying Battling Boy.  <br>falling down, collateral, pulp fiction, the raid, fight club, the tim burton sweeny todd, trainspotting...kind of typical nerd stuff.</br>  <br>Love me some Pope. Heavy Liquid, 100%, the One-Trick Rip Off...all fantastic.</br>  <br>I like his art but I was underwhelmed by Battling Boy. Could be cus I went in with high hopes. It was hyped like crazy.<br>I haven't read anything else by Pope.</br></br>  Lately I've been diving into Warren Ellis's Apparat stuff...Doktor Sleepless, Dark Blue, Scars, Strange Kiss/Gravel, the "singles", Bad World...I think it's all great, but I'm like the definition of an Ellis fanboy. Anybody with a more objective perspective have an opinion?  Anything from Junji Ito was well illustrated, but sometimes the stories were lacking<br> manga </br>  <br>give Heavy Liquid a shot. It's what I recommend to people to get them into Pope</br>  <br>I went into Battling Boy with low hopes for the story because that's his traditional weak point, and was pleasantly surprised. It wasn't an amazing story but I liked the set-up and world. The prequel, The Rise of Aurora West was even better.<br><br><br>Loved Doktor Sleepless, devastated to this day that he dropped it after losing his notes in a computer malfunction.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Haven't read much besides  and Maus, what's OP's pic about?</br>  <br>glad someone else sees the genius of Doktor Sleepless...it could have been as good as anything Ellis has ever done if it kept going. I've only read the material in the trade, but I loved it unconditionally.</br>  <br>It's about teenagers in the 70s and this STD that turns them into mutants</br>  <br>Good flicks.<br>Do you know of any comic that plays with the timeline kinda like Pulp Fiction? <br><br>Does the Fight Club comic seem any good??</br></br></br></br>  <br>pretty brilliant graphic novel about an std in the 70s. took 10 years to write, worth it</br>  <br>waiting for the trade, but I love me some Palahniuk and it seems he's made an actual effort to learn how to write comics. plus those david mack covers are like sex on paper. so yeah, seems good to me from what I've seen. <br><br>sin city kinda does the pulp fiction timeline thing if you read all the volumes together</br></br></br>  <br><br>sounds pretty good, I'll have to find it</br></br>  <br>If you have a decent public library, they should have it.</br>  <br>topkek, I moved to this town in 2003 and I have never been to the library</br>  <br>it's free you know</br>  Anyone a Grendel fan? Been reading the omnibi, after having only previous read War Child and Devil by the Deed, so much epic. Matt Wagner is severely underrated. Wish there was a good Sandman Mystery Theatre hardcover.  Anybody here read Wasteland? I just picked up the first trade for 5 euro, but haven't read it yet.  <br>Yeah, but when I moved here as a kid my parents didn't want to drive me across town to go to the library and as a high schooler I had the school's library. I'll probably go check it out Monday</br>  Sandman  Anyone read Maus? I read it a couple years ago and enjoyed it  You guys are nice  I know how super gay this comic is, but I enjoyed it.  <br>who hasn't read maus? It's good in the way Citizen Kane is good--relatively enjoyable on an intellectual level, but mostly significant for advancing the art form so dramatically. I'm not dying to read it all the time, but I respect it greatly for what it is.</br>  Alex Ross is base as fuck.  <br>Forgot pic.</br>    The Photographer is an excellent photo journalism comic. Don't see it brought up much.  <br>I used to think Alex Ross was just okay, then I got the Chip Kidd art book thing about his DC work (Justice), and now i realize he's dope as fuck</br>  <br>Thank god someone mentioned it.</br>  <br>I've been meaning to read it for a long time.</br>    <br> <br>Absolutely God Tier. Charles Burns is vastly underrated and under appreciated.<br><br>Rick Altergott's Doofus is also a God Tier comic.</br></br></br></br>  shaolin cowboy, anybody?  god tier for japan at least<br>inspired a revolutionary piece of animation as well<br><br> inb4 weeb </br></br></br>  <br>I'm sure it's good. The movie was good. Still, it's manga, and I don't swing that way</br>  not god-tier, but what do y'all think about empowered? I think it's pretty fun  <br>hey man, to each their own</br>  Nao of Brown is one of my favorites that I don't think has been said yet.  Highly recommend.  <br>I really like this casualness on /b/</br>  <br>Also Building Stories.</br>  <br>Such a good series!</br>  alright /b/<br>69 decides if i shove one of these zucchini up my ass or make a delicious casserole out of it<br>dubs decides if it's the thick or thin one<br>trips is auto-casserole and i'll mail ya a piece<br>good luck!</br></br></br></br>  <br>bro we have zucchini in hawaii where are you shopping</br>  <br>Rolling</br>  <br>well his jewish mother is going to have a fit when she smells that zucchini</br>  More like this?    <br>Yeah, not feeling like getting banned</br>  <br>this</br>  Holy Christ what did I just watch?
