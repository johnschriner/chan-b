(aka, the Boxxy method.)</br>  <br>a slut to your moms house</br>  <br>Want to marry her. If only god was real.</br>  <br>anne?</br>  <br>MOAR??</br>  What the fuck is wrong with girls online? I'm talking about Tinder, and every other fucking dating app out there.<br><br>You have to follow the most SPECIFIC pattern, and if you FUCK IT UP, in ANY SMALL WAY, you get the fucking cold shoulder.<br><br>I'm so SICK of these fucking apps, which girls use to get kicks out of likes and chat requests - of which there are always MANY, even for fatties. And guys get left in the dust.<br><br>How the FUCK do you have game online? I HATE, fucking HATE the stupid tongue-in-cheek 'pick-up lines' that you have to use in order to get even a small reply from these 'women'. I have hooked up in the past, god knows how i did it, it was pretty random, and always a one nighter - NEVER anything ongoing. And they weren't even the best looking girls too! As soon as you mention ANYTHING about meeting up, they back the fuck out.<br><br>SO OVER THIS. Help me with my profile /b/. I'm not that bad looking, slim, attractive, etc. WTF?<br><br>tl;dr: Girls online are fucktards. Fuck you all. Bunch of fat cunts you all are.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  bumping  <br>Get of the couch and meet girls irl</br>    <br><br>Clubs are fucking stupid. And there's always other guys there a million times better looking and with more game than i'll ever have.<br><br>Hate clubs. Full of douchebags</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>AND you have to spend a billion dollars every week on alcohol and entrance fees and all that shit. Fuck that.</br></br>          <br>if you go out with that attitude you wont score at all. Just be confident and try not to think about 'the hotter guys'. If you want to meet a nice girl just talk to her, and if you make her laugh you're halfway there. Looks don't matter as much as you might think, unless it's a skank, but you don't want that type of girl i suppose</br>    <br>Have you considered the possibility that there is something wrong with you?<br>Why do you demand this attention? What have you done to earn it? Do you have friends?</br></br>  Dude, you're doing it wrong. I can only imagine what "specific patterns" you're using, but I can guarantee they're retarded. Try being yourself and not some weird pattern-based robot.  <br>My dude, all girls care about is attention. Online or IRL. <br><br>They go on apps like that just for thrill or confidence of getting likes or matches or whatever it is, usually they have no intention of meeting up with anybody</br></br></br>  <br><br>Of course i have friends, I'm not an idiot. I'm always myself, saying 'hi how are you tonight' and etc.. Yet they never ever reply.</br></br>      I've made one match out of maybe 300+ girls.Everyone just makes themselves look really shit in their photos.  <br>This. Looks really don't matter. Be confident (if you can't, look at confident people and fake it, treat it a bit like a game). Also: teasing. If you can tease a girl in a friendly way that can make her laugh or makes her punch you in a playful way, you won.</br>  I met my current gf on okcupid. My first message to her, a couple of months ago?<br><br>"Oh my god, it's so hot out today I'm boiling alive in my own sweat like a lobster."<br><br>The name of the game is BE HUMAN.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm always myself. <br>Just because people say this that doesn't mean it's good advice. You might be insufferable, after all.<br>I'd say that before you get all flustered trying to talk to women with the intention of hooking up with them, you improve your conversational skills in general. <br><br>The captcha accompanying this post had spaghetti... Coincidence? I think not, op.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This. Tinder is not very popular in my city but I used it some for a month, got about 50 matches.<br>I hooked up with a girl a few weeks ago and asked to see her Tinder. She spammed 'like' for two minutes and then she had 60 new matches. There's basically no chance of meeting up with someone from Tinder. It's just millions of desperate dudes with shitty openers.</br></br>  <br>It's not just tinder, it is ANY site in general. I guess they get spammed on all these sites too.<br><br><br>My conversational skills are pretty good, I do work in retail and seem to sell shit to people quite easily. Conversing isn't an issue, its about what to talk about first up with a new girl. How do you approach, what do you say? And then what?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Go to college, get a degree, get a well paying job, then come back on Tinder. Girls want someone who has stability in their life, not some jack off on tinder looking for a good time.</br>  <br> Girls want someone who has stability in their life, not some jack off on tinder looking for a good time. <br><br>sure...</br></br></br>  <br>Alright, excercise of the day: Go make an account on a random dating site like OKCupid or something. Then write to all the girls in your area, and I mean ALL the girls. Look at their profile and try to say something different in every message you send. Be yourself, but channel different moods and see what works. Don't take it too seriously or seriously at all. I feel that you are putting way too much thought into it and this is what cramps you up. So this 'excercise' should help you with that.</br>   There's basically no chance of meeting up with someone from Tinder <br><br>XDDDDDDDD</br></br>    Pick best profile picture you have, just photoshop the fuck out of it. <br>  Let em know you're in some kind of university <br>  Create a super random story with some kind of name in it lets take "Mercedis" replace the name with name of tinder match <br>  start talking more random <br>  next day start talking serious <br><br>I had alot of tinder dates &amp; some weird story's its kinda hard to explain but its not that hard</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>maybe your taste in women just sucks</br>  <br><br><br>And what about going from an opening line to asking to meet? None want to meet to fuck, just to meet and have coffee etc. I'm too pragmatic, rather have sex and forget the bs but no, these girls dont want that.</br></br></br>  <br>Not OP, but it's not just him<br>Online dating is retarded and completely shallow and unrealistic<br>Girls get a power kick from turning down a shit ton of guys</br></br></br>  <br>Watch movie = Sex<br><br>Never go for fucking coffe, go to a bar or watch a movie.</br></br></br>  <br>That would be tough to answer for me, as I've never been into one night stands. But generally you have to understand: for a girl to meet you, she has to know you a little. For all they know, you could be some creep or dangerous. Keep it light, be easy-going, just relax. That's all the advice I can give you in regards to that. Oh, and obviously: Have a real exchange with her before you ask to meet up. So don't just ask for a date after the first 5 messages or so.</br>  I have so many matches I usually go back and unmatch some of them who aren't up to par. <br><br>basically - stop being a beta bitch.<br><br>1. use short answers - girls don't want a paragraph of you trying to be witty <br>2. make fun of her in a way that makes her laugh, but still kinda want to hit you <br>3. flattering them = FAIL - attractive chicks match with EVERY guy on tinder telling them they're hot. <br>4. don't message them immediately after matching <br>5. start a conversation by poking fun at something in her bio - most chicks put idiotic stuff down <br>6. when you do strike up a convo, go back and forth a few times and then quit responding - how many guys quit talking to their 'dream tinder girl' after they match them? beta fags spam the shit out of her - you look desperate. <br>7. wait a few days to respond to her message - tell her you don't check this app often because it's stupid <br>8. ask for her number - works majority of the time <br><br><br>basically - when you're first meeting a girl, quit being afraid. say what you want, make fun of her, be yourself. <br><br>when she sees you aren't kissin the ground she walks upon, she will wonder why. <br>but then again. I'm on the better looking end of the male scale.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  There isn't a specific pattern you have to follow, you just have to engage the girl in a way that keeps her interested in you but doesn't make you look desperate. If you do everything right and still get the cold shoulder, don't sweat it, just get back out there. Fisherman with the biggest nets catch the most fish.  <br><br>Girls use these apps to attention whore. Makes them feel like they are attractive. Very few are looking to hook up. Even fewer of those are actually willing to go through with it. Only the absolutely most desperate land whale sluts basically. The ones that are 1 more fat white guy away from going mudshark.</br></br>  I actually agree with OP. Girls are the biggest cunts online and have such a high expectancy out of guys for some fucking reason. The thing I hate the most is them not replying to you. Either you two have a convo and she stops replying, or they just never make contact with you at all. For fucks sake, if you have no intentions of talking to me, nor meeting up with me in person, then fucking swipe left and don't waste my time.  <br>basically this.<br><br>Worked for me.</br></br></br>  <br><br>OK I've heard all that before, and do kind of follow it, however the whole teasing her is kind of hard. Sometimes you can cross over and go too far i guess. It's not really a grey line for me, more like black and white.</br></br>  <br>you must not be as good looking as you think you are. I just say normal shit and it works. Talk about yourself/whatever youre doing and let that intro into hearing about her. then go in for the digits. that simple.</br>  <br>Yeah, I know the feeling. There is only one answer: Practice. Try to read her. The more you do this, the better you will get at it. You will fall on your face a few times, but you will get better at it.</br>  <br> but then again. I'm on the better looking end of the male scale. <br>Lol should have posted this at the beginning and I would have disregarded everything you said<br>People like always say "be an alpha" but don't realize the only reason people like you on these sites is physical attraction, not your retarded formula that every bro thinks he's figured out</br></br></br>  <br><br>He didn't say "go to nightclubs". You only go to clubs for One night stands or to meet hollaback club sluts. <br><br>Make friends, meet people, join a sports or hobby club and meet people the normal way. <br>If you leave your house every day with the mentality just to pick up girls you're gunna fall flat on your face every damn time just like  said. <br><br>Just do normal day-to-day stuff, be friendly, sociable and awesome. Make friends, lots of friends, do stuff and the girls will come to you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>YO OP, as a girl. <br>The only thing i can say: <br>leave it and go outside.</br></br></br>  <br>and this is how you didn't solve the problem!</br>  <br><br><br> Forget Tinder, Go Outside. <br><br>And join what clubs exactly? Sports are mainly guys or girls, never mixed.<br>What other clubs are there to join that are co-ed?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i totally agree OP<br><br>i myself am a good looking, funny guy but FUCK those dating apps<br>srsly<br><br>only skanks, whores, attentionwhores and whatnot there<br><br>no gf material at fucking all belive me</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>sup OP<br><br>Been on 6 tinder dates, fucked 4 of them, still seeing one, blew it with the other because i got wasted on our date and tried to fingerfuck her after we kissed.<br><br>Also fuck girls IRL from time to time but I hate all of the bullshit hoops you have to jump through to get to it. Tinder is the easiest way to go about it.<br><br>Anyway, to spark up a conversation the only way I've had success is to say something that kind of acknowledges how ridiculous it is that you're both on tinder. It makes them drop their guard a little. Most chicks think every guy is just trying to fuck the everloving shit out of them on there (which they and you obviously are) so keeping it light at the start will help them relax. This is just an example but something retarded like "hey would your friends prefer chicken or fish at our wedding" might get a response. As a general rule of thumb, if your friends would call you a faggot for saying it, it will probably work. This has the added bonus of eliminating vegans early.<br><br>Will post more if you're interested.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>not OP but interested</br>  <br>Take dance lessons. You will have to eventually and girls love guys who can do classical dance.</br>  <br><br>hey man, there's a reason why all the 'formulas' are similar in technique. I'm good looking but if I were to spam a girl paragraphs, bow to whatever she says, message her immediately, etc - it fails. <br><br>lots of trial and error man. that's the only way to get better. obviously my system isn't for everyone, I'm just saying after trying countless times - this is what worked best.</br></br></br></br>  <br>  your friends would call you a faggot for saying it, it will probably work. This has the added bonus of eliminating vegans early. <br><br>kekd really hard anon thanks</br></br></br>  <br>If they have something (an interest, a hobby, etc) on their profile, ask about it. People like feeling clever or unique. <br><br>Conversely, I list my own interests on my profile because I know other people will be using the same strategy.<br><br>Another one that tends to work is seeing who is up late and saying "night owl, huh?" Or something or other, which inevitablly leads to exchanging what each person is up to (which means you learn more about the other blah blah blah)<br><br>As for broaching the meet up, just ask if you want to grab coffee/ice cream or something similar. Not a meal --&gt; less investment for both parties. If either of you are uninterested after physically meeting, it is easy to leave. <br><br>Also, make sure you look nice in your pics. Don't pick some shitty picture where your gross room is in the background. Use pictures that show you DOING something to show you have skills or hobbies. Selfies are fine if you are confident of your appearance (but again, no untidy room or shit like that in the background.)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>fuck that man<br><br>my ex used to dance, we were togehter for 2 years and she broke up to be with her dance partner who also was her best guy friend<br><br>so fuck dancing like someone from 1970</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>not here to fix it thats your problem</br>  <br><br>These are the lines i'm talking about, they are ridiculous on the face of them! My problem is actually being creative enough to come up with this shit. Seriously, i sit here looking at a match and try to think of some silly thing to say to them to lighten the mood.</br></br>  Just go out to a club with some friends, not to many in one spot, split up!<br><br>Tell each other to talk to 1 girl minimum<br>Get rejected? fuck it, never see her again anyways.<br><br>Repeat untill succes</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 'hi how are you tonigh <br><br>Seriously? The first message you send to a girl on tinder is that? And you fucking wonder why they don't respond. <br><br>A lot of girls just use tinder and apps like that to flirt for shits and giggles. Guys that open with those lame-but-funny pick up likes get attention because they're dumb and funny. Have you ever considered that you're at least slightly autistic anon?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, she broke up with you because of her dance partner. What does that tell you?</br>  <br>have fun not getting anything out of that girl besides meaningless sex for 2 minutes top</br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>Good looking guys on tinder get all the girls. I've fucked 4 girls on tdr and dated 1. It's just a patience game, mixed with opportunity. I will say I worked hard and put in the hours in night clubs for years. And that is all I can get. Go to they gym, get your own car and place. Get a solid circle of friends. Raise your confidence. Once you have made yourself better, girls will come.<br><br>Tldr: if you can't get girls irl. You won't get them on TDR.</br></br></br>  <br>/b/ro, you only need to think of one. It's not like chicks admit to each other that they're tinderbashing. Just use the same shitty line every time</br>  <br>that dancing is her life? which i already knew<br><br>but besides that, the guy doesnt have her humor, at all. doesnt look good, friends say he looks weird.<br><br>so dont tell me its just the dancing that attracts</br></br></br></br></br>  asking about hobbies or likes gets you some responses, but really if you don't go for the kill (mentioning meeting in real life, talking on the phone for a possible date) you're wasting your time<br><br>you have to know if they are there to have people text them randomly on the app (likes) <br>basically for the attention or actually want to meet someone for a relationship (hookup, which most deny)<br><br>you can't waste time, or linger on small talk (that's what dates are for) you have to flirt, be a bit pushy</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>oh. to continue this <br><br>9. DONT IMMEDIATELY TALK ABOUT FUCKING THEM - the percentage of guys who message girls and immediately turn to sex is astounding. I've seen the tinder's of the chicks I've been out with. <br><br>unless you're famous or she's a super sloot - that fails.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Once you have made yourself better, girls will come. <br>not too true though<br><br>when i met my ex, i didnt have a job, was living at home and doing nothing for a year and we came together.<br>lasted nearly 2.5 years and i got a degree,found a job and then she left when i actually had something</br></br></br></br></br>  Women suck online. Just accept it and move on. They are absolutely horrible at online interactions, it feeds their emotional needs too easily. Don't expect the moon and you won't get so angry when they give you a pebble.<br><br>Go into every match as if it's 1 of a thousand. Say what you gotta say, quickly and shortly. Don't wait for a response, don't ask for more. Just give what you need to and move on. If you are worried about pushing her away then you are too needy for that poontang. You can smell that through every fiber optic cable connecting you two.<br><br>TLDR: Relax, take it slow, don't let the poon get you down. You have a penis and your hand. You have time. No rush.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Wow dude, you seriously have a problem if you are this angry about a social network shit, just like those faggots rioting about facebook, what the fuck? Go out, try to meet girls outside man. Do you think you are going to meet the girl of your dreams on TINDER? Fuck out of here with that shit, sack the fuck up and go out. Don't you think they are in there just to get likes and a couple of dicks on the weekends? <br>You don't have to go to a club, just go out, restaurants, parks, small pubs, stuff like that.<br>Man up kiddo.</br></br></br>  <br>Nope, but it's a big part of her life he has in common with her.<br>My point is: if you are not into sports, try dancing. You learn how to dance, which you will need at the very least later in your life, and it's a good way to meet people, make friends, meet girls. It's a way to get out there if clubs and sports aren't your thing.</br></br>  <br> Don't wait for a response, don't ask for more. Just give what you need to and move on <br>not to get out of topic, but that is probably what im gonna do right now texting my ex.</br></br>  <br>i am into sports, doing martial arts and weight lifting.<br>i cant get something out of dancing anon, for me, it just looks awkward and thats coming from a half cuban, who should have that in his blood</br></br>  <br>2/3 Girlsfriends i met going out.<br><br>2 weeks ago was on a party met some people.<br>last week i was out see girl from party again, decide to just talk to her.<br><br>Make out whole night, talking errday now.<br><br>i'm in fucking love with this one</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Bump  <br><br>Oops. wrong one.<br/></br></br>  Here is how to go from banging NONE of the girls to 90% of them.<br><br> post how much money you make. <br> post a picture of your sweet fucking house. <br> post a picture of your sweet fucking abs. <br> put some shitty punchline joke in your profile. <br><br>If you do not have these things then get them, you're not a fucking snowflake or a commodity. You're a god damn man. You reap only what you sow. <br><br>Cum in a bitches hair and kick her out, get a new one by evening. Hell that's if that one won't accept an obvious lie and apology to come back the next day to get fucked and kicked out.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> in love <br> with a club girl <br>yeah sure m8</br></br></br>  <br>jej</br>  <br><br><br>Right, just what a girl wants, a strange guy who wont leave them alone in a park, being hit on without wanting it.</br></br></br>  <br>Dude</br>  <br>Yeah, I get what you're saying, but it's just so shallow to me. But then again I'm not really an alpha or a beta and probably don't belong on these sites</br>  <br><br>once you get one girl, you have more confidence to get the second girl. <br><br>thus, your roster grows. as it grows, you literally have less time to think about or talk to that one specific girl. so each girl then likes you more because you're not drooling over them. <br><br>the first one is the hardest. but it gets easier from there. build your roster. <br>if girl 1 can't hangout tomorrow you have girl 2, or girl 3.<br><br>ya feel.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>OP<br>,if that is you,<br>i donwloaded lovoo, similar thing to tinder and goddamn<br><br>you do not want to use it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh, somehow what you wrote earlier translated to "I don't like sports" in my head. Well, the main thing is that you get out there somehow. If you are into religion, go to church and community meetings. If you are into certain bands, attend concerts. Look at events taking place in your town like parades, festivals, and go there.</br>  <br>and where is the love?<br><br>cant seem to find that besides stick dick in vagina and be done with it</br></br></br>  its easier to get a girl irl than online, just saying  <br>this is what I do too (27/m)<br><br>you get a good overview of the kind of girls that like you, so I can act in rl accordingly</br></br></br>  <br>been there done that, none of those girls spark my interest.only tat one, my ex, yes im that much of a faggot but i stand for that</br>  <br><br>People are not as special snowflake as they like to believe. Stuff usually works well on alot of people because everyone thinks it's so fucking perfect for them.<br><br>Look at horoscopes. 9 billions humans and somehow like a few hundread million born in the same week will all find the perfect mate, be great in bed and a great listener with creative impulses.<br><br>Be honest bitches, some of you just read that and said but I'm like that....</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Dating apps are NOT FOR MEN.<br><br>You are fooling yourself into thinking that you'll get any long term or meaningful relationship out of dating apps. The ONLY thing they are used for are women with mental issues that need the affirmation that men still want them at any time and at any place. They are not on there to date, or fuck, or do anything. They are there for INSTANT ATTENTION at the touch of their fingertips.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I doubt she has been the last girl in your life. Or I'd I guess. <br><br>Regardless, you need to be comfortable with your life to be confident. Job security and looks give that to most people. <br><br>I'm sure bettering yourself will help you, or at least weed out the people you don't need in your life.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You don't have to be a fucking creep, just say hi as you would do on fucking tinder, what the fuck is the difference? If she says no, she's just swiping left, you just leave you beta fuck.<br>There are no excuses</br></br>  <br>Women never wanted love only protection, now that protection is guaranteed by your tax dollars they're free to explore their slutty desires without risk.</br>  <br>Well, if you feel like that...it's pretty possible that you are still hung up on your ex and in that case, no girl will spark your interest. Get it out of your system. If time works for you, wait it out. If one night stands are an option, do that. She doesn't have to interest you.</br>  <br>until now she has.<br><br>i have both of that anon, when i had only one and no job, we got together.<br><br> or at least weed out the people you don't need in your life. <br>and so many people tell me that its her.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>is that so</br>  <br><br>Can't force yourself to fall in love, it will just happen. One day you will sit up and realize, damn she blows me in the morning, makes me eggs and bacon and then calls me too much to talk about her day, she wants to come over all the time, she wants to buy stuff... fuck I'm in a relationship and she is in love. See, you will get love.</br></br>  <br>spot on anon.<br>youre right im STILL hung up on her, but those girl on tinder and outside always confirm mythoughts.</br></br>   photo with more attractive friend <br> photo at odd angle <br> photo of only her eye <br> photo with hair covering face <br> photo of her pets only <br> app has a "curvy" option in body type <br> early 20s, has a kid <br> feminist <br> nigger &amp;nD wHolE pRofil3 be tYpeD lYkE diS <br> fat <br> fat <br> FUCKING FATTIES EVERYWHERE </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>people suck not the app</br>  <br>yeah well, you just described what i had with my ex-gf.</br>  <br>Sure if you beat her pussy better than anyone else she might get infatuated with you. But as soon as you stop performing, or she believes someone can perform this deed better. *POOF* She no longer loves you.</br>  <br>Truth. TDR is a paradise for ugly women fishing for compliments. <br><br>I do support it though, cause when those ugly girls finally start getting turned down, they realize they are not as attractive as they think. All is in order</br></br></br>  <br>this</br>  <br> <br>This. I'm flirting with a chick I met at work. We'd be fucking right now if she didn't live in another state. She even wants to fuck me and I'm married. (thus no travelling to fuck). She's a 6/10 (I think she's a 7/10, but my friends tell me she's a 6/10).<br> <br>I broke the ice when I started flirting and made her laugh. After that I had to go into alpha mode to seal the deal. But fuck, just make her laugh and don't be a douche, and you're instantly half-way there.</br></br></br></br>  <br>bruh, a few things that this guy is saying will be things that work for him because he's comfortable using them. confidence always shines through.The core philosophy you need to stick to is just not being desperate or appearing uncomfortable.<br><br>When you say "hi how are you tonight?" the immediate conclusion that she draws is that you're boring. Subconsciously you've already expressed too much interest, the conversation is now happening on her terms. Take control of it, direct it wherever you want.<br><br> Ask who her favourite backstreet boy is. Ask her if she believes in dinosaurs. Just stop giving a fuck if she doesn't respond, there are others that will. You just gotta be ok with going for it. Swipe right at everything and run tests on landwhales if you have to. That opening exchange is just trying to get shit kicked off. What happens from there is up to you. You just dripfeed bits of your personality to her mixed in with a bunch of bullshit.<br><br>Chicks will literally laugh at anything if you have the balls to say it</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>then why is that?<br>explain<br><br>why would a girl go from a good looking, funny guy with money to some other guy who is leagues under him</br></br></br></br>  <br>The problem with girls on these apps is that most of them are 5,s and 6s who think they are 9s and 10s. I'll jump through hoops for some grade A cunt but not for a borderline hambeast. <br><br>Also OP, up your game. This isn't "da club", your swag isn't worth shit online.</br></br></br>  <br>that's what I do but I also lose interest after step 8 unless I'm drunk</br>  /b/<br>Why do most of Yanks hate the South of the United States and the Southern people?<br><br>Everytime someone wants to talk about Civil War, confederate flag or something related to the South Yankees start shitposting "Sister fucker, lol" or "Go back to the trailer park inbreed"<br> Literally why? </br></br></br></br>    I don't see what's so hard to understand.<br><br>The confederacy lost 150 years ago, and the retards still waving the flag are dumb, subhuman trash.</br></br>  <br>Trips don't lie</br>  If you look at almost every measurable statistic, most deep Southern states are the reason the US is behind certain countries in those statistics. That combined with backwards thinking promoted due to excessive religion. A lot of the deep South is like the tumor eating away at the rest of the country.  <br>They're jealous of their inferiority to Robert e Lee and his superior military tacticianism. I am 40 miles up on the wrong side of the Mason Dixon line. The south will rise again!</br>  <br>There are positives. Blacks in the rural south don't shoot each other over pety squabbles. They seem happier. They didn't have to deal with fags marrying until Friday, they are lenient on gun laws. What a hell of a place to live.</br>  <br>Every citizen of the USA should hate the enemy state known as the Confederacy of Southern States. We had to go to war with them to keep the country united and together. We succeeded. <br><br>I say we because i genuinely mean you too. You are also part of the UNITED states of america.<br><br>Fucking act like it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice biggotry friend.</br>  for some dumb reason these idiots are proud of a country that lasted 4 years, was a shit-hole, kept slaves its entire existence and was soundly defeated in a bloody war. it shuold really be called southern shame.  <br>because of rednecks, racism, and that goddamn flag. so act like a normal human being if you want us to ever get any respect.<br><br>alabamafag here.</br></br></br>  <br> Literally why? <br>You fucking pleb. Learn to speak English.</br></br>  I was in a plane to South Carolina once.<br>It was full of obese fucks who yelled across the plane about alligator skin and some other shit<br>Not a fun experience</br></br>    <br>#SouthWillRiseAgain</br>  <br>United...lol</br>  <br>So should the native Americans be ashamed that they were massacred in a bloody war because they didn't want to be part of the grand utopia called the USA</br>  If you ask me I think is jealousy <br><br>First of all the South is the center of American history, it is more relevant than the North, when a foreign think in the United States most of time is thinking in Texas or Florida<br><br>We Southerns are the only Americans with a real culture, in fact the Southern Culture is the American culture<br><br>The only culture and pride Northerns have is being cucked by transgenders, niggers and faggots</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This guy gets it</br>  <br>well certainly they should be ashamed that it was so easy, yes.</br>  <br>Trips know the truth.</br>  <br>When I think of the US I think Washington DC, California or Las Vegas, not buttfuck texas or poor ass florida</br>  <br>well you're dumb but at least you're thinking that you're a citizen of the USA. so that's a plus. the south also represents all the bad shit that the rest of the world htinks about us too. that's why when they visit they rarely stray from the NE and NYC in particular or the western coast.</br>  <br>Except for slavery and starting the war which killed more Americans than any other, the South doesn't really have a large part in history. They were mostly just farmers. Big whoop, there were farmers in the North as well as booming industry and constant innovation throughout their history. The financial hub of the modern world. The earliest successful colonies that actually started to seriously populate the region. The headquarters of all the brilliant minds of our founding fathers. I don't see how you could possibly think the South is the center of American history.</br>  <br> tfw the soldiers of germany were fighting the battle of the century with ferocious tenacity and bravery and this ignoramus is demeaning them over a fucking flag </br>  <br>Not for the same reason all you amerifags always visit the Eiffel Tower.</br>  1.You eat too much<br><br>2. You are very religious, according to the latest census, 20 percent of Americans have no religion. But all of these people are almost always from the north. Visiting the south and listening to creationists, people who think that the earth is less than 7000 years old, etc, .... is a very scary experience.</br></br>  <br>Because they are jealous that the south has more, better jobs, better land and cost of living, prices, actual diversity, and most people that move in the U.S. move to places in the south like Atlanta or Dallas. I live in Georgia and tons of carpet baggers here. I am one myself. And a proud southerner too. So get fucked niggers</br>  <br><br>Yeah, no one wants to visit New York or Los Angeles or San Francisco.</br></br>  <br>Beat me to it.<br><br>I'm pretty sure that when foreigners think of places like Texas, it reminds them of why they hate the U.S.</br></br></br>  <br> What is Virginia </br>  <br>Because it's fun and y'all get butthurt so easily.</br>  <br>Yes, united. Do not mistake freedom to disagree with a lack of unity. That very freedom is precisely why this nation remains united despite its diversity.</br>  <br>10/10</br>  They are just mad because the south has the prettiest women!  <br>The confederate flag is the flag of the vanquished</br>  <br> better jobs and cost of living <br>actually when lincoln freed the slaves, the souths economy was utterly obliterated, the effects of which are still seen today. come to chicago and youll see one of the most diverse cities in this country, whereas the south is nig nogs and dirty red necks. basically everything you said is untrue. the south is shit.</br></br>  <br>Yes. Jealousy. That's why the world wide web you use to spew your inane drivel and the computer you're using to do so were invented in the South, right?</br>  The biggest reason is religion Southerners are largely evangelical Christians and that's a special kind of idiocy.<br><br>The second reason would be the boredom. Adults in the South are either low life hicks or frat bros and sorority sisters who are trying to relive stupid shit from college. OH, GAMMA GAMMA GAMMA FOREVER! WAR EAGLE! GO TEAM!</br></br>  <br>BT?</br>    <br>Yea comparing the sweet clean air of Dixie land to fucking Chicago please. leave here walk outside and into traffic.</br>  <br>If you are a total faggot(or a trasgender) you will enjoy that cities</br>  <br>The North has an inferior culture based upon peasants and Jews that hates the Southern culture based upon gentry and nobles.</br>  <br><br>lol your so funny. <br><br>Actually no. South is a pretty shitty place to live. <br><br>Highest rate of divorce, teen pregnancy, unemployment, medicare moochers, AIDS, meth use, childhood poverty, inequality, wage gap, creepy internet search, no minimum wage, bigotry. <br><br>  and sister/goat fuck. <br><br>So thanks but no thanks</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's one of the bars around the campus of Ole Miss</br>  <br>Because they have zero self esteem and have accomplished nothing personally, so they rally around blacks and try to find stupid shit to be outraged about. It makes them feel like they have a purpose.<br><br>After the war, the North let the South keep the Rebel Flag, because healing wounds and reuniting was more important than petty squabbles over a flag.<br><br>These days SJW and blacks are more interested in attention, outrage, division and reopening old wounds.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>AT&amp;T created the majority of the technology the internet is based on.<br>AT&amp;T is a Southern company.<br> moronic yankee detected </br></br></br>  <br>A lot of people want to visit the Bahamas but anyone who's been can tell you its a fucking 3rd world country basically. Point being what people think isn't always true</br>  <br>You don't live in the the south so stfu. There's a place in my town where everyone knows not to go because youll get robbed or shot, only niggers live there.<br><br>I serve the old Germanic gods here, religion is haavily pushed down here but there's plenty of people who don't care what you are.</br></br></br>  <br> literally proves OP's point about pointless, ignorant vitriol <br><br>Stay classy.</br></br></br>  <br>Yea and one of the best medical schools in the world is in Alabama</br>  <br>No minimum wage?<br>Internet search? from /b/. lol<br><br>the rest you pretty much nailed. so kudos.</br></br></br></br>  <br>God dammit heavily* and misplaced comma</br>  <br>I'm aware. Wondering about the girls</br>  <br>Trips only served to prove OP's point. <br><br> kek </br></br></br>  <br>Seems to me California, Maryland, New York, Illinois, Michigan, and Washington DC have many more racial problems than the Southern States do. Despite having fewer niggers. Just suggesting you might need to crawl out of your own shit holes before calling anyone else backwards you fucktwits.</br>  <br>and the north has verison, your point is?</br>  <br>Shit I don't know these whores I just posted the phot because they are fucking bad!</br>  <br>This idiot doesn't know what he's talking about. Ask a back road "hick" anything.</br>  <br>Compared to what? Somalia? You're funny in your earnest attempts at proving your state is not on the same level as some third world shithole.</br>    <br><br>AT&amp;T is a multinational corporation with a complex history and to suggest it is a "southern" company is, well, pretty stupid.</br></br>  <br>Come to North Carolina, bask in your ignorance.</br>  <br>yeah except it is in the case of the south. lived there for five long years. it really is just as bad as people think<br><br>if you live there you just have to accept it from the start so it doesn't seem as bad. but it is.</br></br></br>  <br>I hate the south and most southerners because I grew up there. Most of the yanks who hate might not know what they're talking about but I do. I can't even tell you what a step up in life it was to get the fuck out of that shithole.</br>  <br> Why do most of Yanks hate the South of the United States and the Southern people? <br><br>The American unionists beat them in a war.<br><br>But because America hasnt really won any other wars they keep going back to the confederates and getting their pound of flesh. <br><br>Shortly after the war, they marched a lot of them to their deaths and stuff like that.<br>Now they are banning their flag etc<br><br>Next they will be rounding up southern Americans and putting them in special work camps for their own protection. Like what Hitler did with the Juice.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Here is why.<br><br>People pursue status. They want to feel like they are better than other people and part of a superior group. Whites, like everyone else, are status conscious.<br><br>However, in today's culture, you can't look down on nonwhites because they are seen as too pathetic and oppressed. They don't really have agency. When they commit crimes, for example, it's not their fault, but society's. White liberals are implicitly white supremacists, because they see minorities as little mascots and pets, not as equal people capable of good and evil.<br><br>So you pick on Southern whites. They are white, so they have agency and are seen as "equal" in some ways, but they are retrograde and behind the times, so you can look down on them and not feel guilty.<br><br>Thank about how weird it is that you can openly mock "white trash" for living in trailers and such. You are mocking poor people. And the "progressives" laugh and say this is a good thing to do, presumably because white poor people (unlike black and Hispanic poor people) somehow deserve it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This.<br>Successful, happy people don't obsess about inconsequential things like a flag from a war 150 years ago. They are also usually too busy to go looking for obscure causes to get mad about and waste time protesting over. The only people that do this are losers and special interest shills looking for special privileges, revenge, free shit, whatever....</br></br>  <br>Yea UAB is one of the top medical and research schools in the world, but alright man I am sure you are involved in the medical field and the foriegn affairs of Somalia and other dirt countries.</br>  <br>I have actually spent more of my life in the South than the North. But okay, because I disagree with you I'm a moronic yankee. Got it.<br><br>Anyway, that you think a massive multinational corporation has anything to do with "Southern culture" is laughable. For what it's worth, AT&amp;T's headquarters are in Dallas and I know quite a few Texans that refuse to be labeled the "South." And those are folks that were born and raised Texan, unlike me.</br></br></br>    <br>https://m.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=M155E<wbr>r6PFz0</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>I am from the south and I don't recognize Texas as a southern. Fuck we barely even wanted the Cajuns into the fold.</br>  <br>The butthurt coming off your racist ass is delicious. UAB is a top school only in your dreams.</br>  <br> yankees <br><br>Well it's actually jews, don't know what made you think yankees.</br></br></br>  <br>In general you're right, UAB is pretty average, but their medical program is way up there. I fucking hated Birmingham so it's not a point of pride for me to defend it, I'm just being fair.</br>  <br>Nazism was about superiority over non whites. Confederacy was about states rights. Anyone who says different doesn't know sit about history, especially concerning the native Americans who fought on both sides and got wholly fucked before, during, and after the war by both sides</br>  <br>I am not racist I have a colored TV! Naw man you got me all wrong though I have dated more mixed girls than white ones. Also here is UAB listed at 17 just a few under Harvard so get bent because you are so wrong buddy!<br><br>http://grad-schools.usnews.rankings<wbr>andreviews.com/best-graduate-school<wbr>s/top-medical-schools/primary-care-<wbr>rankings</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Daily reminder no ones born gay, youre a mentally handicapped piece of fucking shit</br>  We look down on the south because:<br><br>  You are overly religious. <br><br>  Can't handle your liquor. <br><br>  Don't keep your Negros in one area in the city where they can do our work for us and kill each other. <br><br>  Have the worst schools in the country and don't better yourselves outside of school. <br><br>  And the absolute biggest reason the entire country is ashamed of the south and would have no problem sending cruise missiles down to bombard you all to pieces is. You are the laziest part of the country! You act like nigs and suck off of the government tit. The only lazier white people in the world are the soccer hooligan sitting at the pub all day Eurofags but at least their laziness tends to come from a little bit more of depression and hopelessness instead of ignorance and laziness.  <br><br>In short white trash is to white people how niggers are to black people.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Roll Tide  <br>Somalia =/= Downtown Birmingham<br>??<br>You're just saying stupid things that don't have any backing whatsoever.</br></br></br>  <br>Yea no Birmingham is a shit hole no doubt but Hoover is really nice now. I am from Homewood originally I live in Destin now though</br>  Confederates were the good guys in the civil war.<br>They will most definitely be the good guys in the next one.<br>The south freed the slaves first and wanted to ship them back to africa, to their home, but the jewnion or the north, wanted to keep them as cheap shit you can push around for your jew agendas, like promote racemixing.<br>Confederates may have lost, but they are the good guys and that cant be taken away from them.<br>If a civil war broke out tomorrow in amerika, i would volunteer to fight for the south, because that civil war would be the most important one in the last 500 years, and would shape the future for another 1000 years.<br>It would be a great honor to be a part of it.</br></br></br></br></br>  Southern master race here.....poor Yankee cucks are just jealous.

I come from a pretty long line of plantation owners.</br>  I'm not a citizen of the glorious US and A but I can understand that a lot of people consider the south less developed (especially socially). This does not apply to all southerners but a lot of them don't question their past. That's the problem. If you don't carefully think about your ancestor's deeds you end up not judging crimes that should be judged. Like I said this doesn't apply to every southerner but their general image all over the world is this (pic related)  <br>small minority? lol tell that to your elected representatives</br>  <br>As a guy living in Alabama, MOST Southerners are the "Hurr tha south 'll raize ageen."<br>You just think it's the other way around because you're like me in that you're not a fuckwit and most people you know aren't fuckwits.<br>However most Southerners in GENERAL are, admittedly, fuckwits.</br></br></br>  <br>Underrated post</br>  <br>yeah genius. that makes sense.</br>  <br>kek, this</br>  <br>i lived down there for 5 years. 5 long fucking years.</br>  <br>shouthernfag here. Actually had this conversation with some of my black friends. Most agreed that the flag 'looked' cool. And frankly didn't give a shit about it's meaning.

I'd rather live in Bruce Jenners mutilated ballsack than that town</br>  <br>oh yes you're right. i think people who live down there don't have any idea how great places can be. they just imagine it's shitty in their head</br>  <br>off by one</br>  <br>Actually The center of American history is on the east coast where the original 13 colonies were settled. Rhode Island has 10 times more history then backwards Texas. Gay merrage and so on is only surprising to "Southern American States" The rest of the world is just like "whatever, what took you soo long?". Southern states have less freedom then fucking Mexico. Now thats sad.</br>  <br>nigger</br>  <br>I'm referring to the original thread regarding AT&amp;T in which I mentioned that it wouldn't be considered a Southern company by most Southerners and Texans</br>  <br> Why do most of Yanks hate the South of the United States and the Southern people? <br> have a history of being backward, racist, homophobic, and having to be dragged kicking and screaming into the future with the rest of us <br> wonder why we hate you <br>We hate you for the same reason we hate screaming children in Walmart. Because we have to be the adult that deals with you.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're not from the south you're from the basement</br>  <br>For the same reason anyone feels the need for "southern pride."</br>  <br>that flag, if that's what you call it ,would make great wallpaper for the inside of your outhouse</br>  <br>Until they start calling for things like tearing down a flag. An action that will do nothing but cause real bad blood and reopen old wounds. I can guarantee most white northerners could give two shits about flying a rebel flag at the SC state house and never bother to think of it. But when you get blacks looking for attention and some revenge on the South, you get northern SJW jumping on the next cause célèbre and shit gets stirred up. The result isn't less racism, but more animosity. Paying attention to these black special interest groups just emboldens them to get outraged about every little thing, and threaten riots if they don't get their way.</br>  <br><br> No matter how much you try to convince yourself it was about slavery you will always still be wrong. It was about state rights, the states rights to keep slavery legal. </br></br>  <br><br>Or any type of pride really.<br><br>Its fine to be proud of yourself as an individual.<br><br>But not because of where you were born or your race or your sexuality.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Norther talking about Niggers <br>You fucking faggots let Obama into the white house</br></br>    <br>This.</br>  <br>Good job generalizing.

Have you ever stopped to realize that most people just do not give a fuck about you? No one is coming for you. LMFAO come out from your bunker.</br>  <br>So, after you've shot at them dammed northerners, do you head back to your double wide and fuck your sister?</br>  <br>This.</br>  <br> No one is coming for you. <br> gibme flag plox <br><br>If you don't give a fuck, why do you keep interfering?</br></br></br></br>  <br> fun <br><br>well, I guess even austistic losers have their ideas of entertainment.</br></br></br>  <br>Go back to the trailer park you inbred sister fucker</br>  <br>I'm not taking your flag. I don't give one single fuck about your flag. I don't fetishize pieces of cloth that artificially demarcate supposed meaningful differences between human beings. It's all rather childish at the end of the day.</br>  <br> b-but muh suthrn pride flag <br>Next time one of you guys bitch about someone flying a Mexican flag I'm going to laugh for days.</br></br>  <br>you're exactly right. and that proves the point about how ignorant the south was and still is</br>  ITT:  <br>Yeah, you sound like you enjoy flying the Mexican flag. So you're traitorous scum just like the Southerners you piss on so much. Fucking loser.</br>  <br>Southern pride pan fried butthurt here.</br>  <br> I don't fetishize pieces of cloth that artificially demarcate supposed meaningful differences between human beings. <br><br><br>Well, apparently blacks and SJW do. I guess it's OK for them to do that, but Southerners can't have any meanings of their own.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes because only the north has the electoral college. Those smart southerners have outsmarted us again.</br>  eurofag here, explain if I'm misunderstanding your shitty 250y/o history<br><br>you seceded from the great britain, then southern states decided to secede from you because fuck you and your taxes, you barely won the war (unions 2m vs confederate 1m and you had quite a lot more casualties, gettysburg being the turning point?) and now they are the retarded ones?<br><br>I heard from a friends its called War of Northern Aggression in the south and that seems more accurate than what you fags call it. <br><br>Its like trying to end a relationship but one forces the another into staying</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> gets ass handed to him online <br> better say butthurt and run away </br></br>  <br>No no, you still don't get it. It's ALL OF YOU that fetishize flags that I think are silly. Yes, I am including you with the blacks and SJWs you hate so much. You're all doing the same stupid thing from two opposing angles.</br>  THE SOUTH WILL RISE A GAIN <br><br>IMA GO GET MAH DIABEETUS MEDICATION<br><br>SISTER PAW IS COMING OVER FOR DINNER WITH UNCLE MOTHER AND IT IS GONNE BE FRIED SQUIRREL WITH CHCKIEN LITS. YUMY</br></br></br></br>  <br>This guy gets it</br>  <br>No, the problem with the Confederate flag is the explicit racism involved in flying it, with all the southerners trying to evade it with "southern pride".<br>Mexicans don't have that connotation with the Mexican flag.</br></br>  <br>I call them 'Flag Fags'</br>  <br>What US government building flies the British flag?</br>  <br>Ass handed to me?

What are you retarded? Can you not follow a simple train of thought? We never spoke about ignorance until you just brought it up. You even proved my damn point in your first reply where you said "it was about states rights" fuck, you must be the dumbest person on b</br>  <br>The only thing the south has over the north is food.</br>  <br> explicit racism involved in flying it <br> don't have that connotation with the Mexican flag <br><br>ffs</br></br></br></br>  <br>All wars are inherently bullshit being as they are based on propaganda. But wars happen, there are victors and losers and people move on.

Yes, that is true.</br></br>  <br>I - as someone with mediocre knowledge of American history, was just trying to look at it objectively, from European standpoint, and I still don't get it how come the North gets all the 'support' while everyone shits on the South.<br><br>Yes I fucking realize thats where rednecks, sister fuckers and trailer park families come from, but seriously, if we are talking history here, I really don't see how North was better than South. <br><br>They were slave owners, treated them fucking well because slaves were expensive (not the general opinion everyone has apparently), had them fighting for the South. <br><br>Northeners, the fuckers who exterminated the Indians, seceded from Britain suddenly call themselves justice dispensers and don't let the South go. <br><br>Not to mention the taxes</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Murika is in full nigger ass kissing mode.  <br><br>Niggers/white trash=culture?<br><br>If so, then you're right anon. The south is full of culture.</br></br></br></br>  ITT:  Having family and friendship ties that span not only this whole continent but also to almost every continent on this planet (no Antarctica buddies yet) every this-country-versus-that-country argument just sounds like petulant childish playground fighting. It is truly a wonder the US has lasted as long as it has given the obvious internal hatreds people express. Nevertheless, maybe that just goes to show how truly enduring some of the better principles the US stands for really are.  <br>Culture clashes are tough. Southern v. Northern, East coast v. West coast... Black v. White.<br><br>It's the choosing on your culture over other human being that ruffles feathers.<br><br>Choosing your "heritage" over the plight of other humans is a pretty shitty thing to do. You define your heritage, not a flag, religious symbol or anything else. Take some responsibility for your actions.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the food in places like NYC and San Francisco are far better than anything you can get in the deep south. <br><br>New orleans really doesn't count as the south. There's some great food there too.</br></br></br>    <br>It was burnt because they burnt it. If the war was fair you would have gotten mowed over. South had 50% of the people 25% of the money and still managed to almost win a war against the most powerful military in the world. No point in talking shit because honestly the south didn't lose shit.<br> kept slaves <br> made the north waste almost every penny </br></br></br>  <br>The Confederate flag has been pretty innocuous for decades. Nobody really cared who flew it or why. Most people had better things to do with their time. Then along come the blacks who needed something to be outraged about this news cycle and suddenly the flag is the worst thing in the world. Blacks are agitating and people are upset because it's just one more thing society has to pander to in order to placate the precious blacks. Until next month when something else sparks their outrage.</br>  <br>lol, now superimpose a map of black populations by percentage.....</br>  <br>How about England's history with Protestantism vs. Catholicism? That's a can of worms, ain't it?<br><br>The North gets shit on plenty as does the South. Usually people are either ignorant or simply taking the piss. Either way, none of it really means anything.</br></br></br>  <br><br>And they cannot be made anywhere else in the same way so we should all go to that magically deep-fried realm called the South.<br><br>I've had barbecue in lots of places, including Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, New York, Missouri, Illinois, California, Puerto Rico, and Wisconsin. <br><br>It's all good, but the best way to know if someone's barbecue will suck is if they brag about it. <br><br>Actually, the ribs in Puerto Rico were really quite good. And I forgot the place in Bath, Maine. Really excellent, although their macaroni and cheese was second rate--but then again, they bragged about it so there's that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this traitor flag started flying again in the 50s while black people wanted to vote in a country they were citizens of. <br><br>it should have been put down then but people are pussies. it;s not to late to correct that oversight and tear down that enemy flag wherever it flies.</br></br></br>  <br><br>What about of "it is in the South" are you having a hard time with? We are talking about the South, and it is full of fat fucks.</br></br>  <br>This. I wonder what would have happened of not for Robert E. Lees failure at Gettysburg</br>  <br>But fighting to further Hitler's aims certainly was worth them dying for, right? Fuck your logic.</br>  <br>oh christ, it's "enemy flag" faggot again<br><br>every fucking thread.....</br></br></br>  <br>Nigger, I lived in the south for 6 years... ignorance aside, you crackers are the only ones still bringing up the civil war. The anti-northerner sentiment was very obvious in "Yankee Go Home" bumperstickers and signs.<br><br>I rarely saw that "southern hospitality" I hear of.<br><br>You inbred cunts lost the war. If it hurts to hear about it, stop bringing it up.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The war for American independence from Britain was fought over taxation without representation, whereas the south succeeded because they didn't want to pay any government any taxes, which as they found as was a terrible idea when the confederacy asked for money to fight their war for succession and the Confederate states laughed and said no. Also the slave issue was a very big component of the war, bigger then the south will let on.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure many food you enjoy originated in the south.</br>  <br>Give me fucking stats. I want to we your proof fuckboy</br>  <br>You're about uncultured as fuck. You literally missed Louisiana. How are you going to say some shit about southern food when you think Missouri and Illinois is the south.</br>  <br>Looks like it's pretty spread out to every place blacks are in high concentration.</br>  <br>Southern revisionism at it's finest.  actually has it right.</br>  <br>See the film:<br>"C.S.A.: The Confederate States of America"<br><br>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0389828<wbr>/</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>prove it faggot</br>  <br>The companies original name was Southern Bell you fucking idiot.</br>  <br>Would have restormed dc and won the war.<br><br>Lol when you talk like you're from Boston nobody is going to like you no matter where you go. It's so cute, it's like you think you fought in the war or something. Again, if it was a fair war the north would have gotten decimated.</br></br></br>  <br>The fact that you know what I'm talking about proves it. Just GTFO retard, before you start spouting about planting the enemy flag in the soil of the USA again...</br>    <br>southern hospitality is just another name for passive aggressive nonsense.</br>  <br>Will take a look, you can also take a look at South Park episode ''Red badge of Gayness''<br><br>Got a friend who majored in ACW here in Croatia, he compares it to our war with Serbians except we won ours and are now a more successful country, not that it still isnt a shit place to live in...</br></br></br>  <br>test</br>  <br>No. There were several regional "baby bells" and southern bell was just one of several.</br>  <br>No, you should go back even further to Bell Telephone Company. Hint: it wasn't founded in the South.<br><br>But go ahead, pick whatever part of history makes sense to you and ignore the rest.</br></br></br>  <br>whoever that guy is, he has a point. thanks for posting anon</br>  <br> ABRAHAM LINCOLN WAS A KNOWN HOMOSEXUAL <br><br>This is all his fault</br></br></br>  <br>congrats you found one example of someone with a similar thought. oh it must be just one guy. you dumb fucker.</br>  <br>black people down there are dumb too. nice of you to point that out.</br>  <br>That's what southerners do. Real history confirms they're little more than third world backwaters.</br>  <br>Lol, a "fair" war.<br><br>Youve said it all there, and your stupidity is confirmed. No need to even speak to you further... enjoy your "culture." Lol</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Yank here. Don't hate the flag. The thing I hate is that you are the fukkkers that brought the niggers here in the first place.

Thanks to the creator of this image for putting them all in one place for to recognize and remove.</br>  <br>Yes, the "fair" thing comes up a lot in the southern education system. Anybody who ever uses the term "fair war" is a bloody moron whose knowledge of history doesn't extend much beyond the fact that the Normandy Beach map on Battlefield was not "fair" for the allies.</br>  <br>yours is.</br>  <br>even if it was all him, he's not lying about one of them being him. right?</br>  Why is it that you cant see the point of an un-biased racially united country that works for the greater good? Not reminiscing in the past and mulling over defeats and hateful prejudices. The country is shifting to a united un-biased mindset. Moving forward with progressive thinking. Yet the south is stuck in decisions on how to continue to make more money from oil, kill inmates, divide races, and blocking the rest of the country off. You are preventing the progressive movement needed to surpass china &amp; japan in technological advancements. Your throwing as many conservative hate minded republicans at the presidential election like numbers matter more than the quality of the persons mindset. You abused your own heritage and pride for the flag and turned it into a symbol of hate and irrational fascist racism. Your no batter than Isis in the sense that you pervert and poison the minds of the youth into your hate mongering Jesus pushing ideals. This country is NOT Christian nor does it belong to your resentment. The south is a tumor and with be politically lanced in due time.  <br>Because, as clearly evidenced by this thread, it's tasty bait.</br>  <br> BF1942 oldfag confirmed. </br>  <br>Maybe if you'd stop fucking your sisters, we wouldn't call you inbreds.<br><br>Seems simple enough to me.</br></br></br>  <br>WoW, even the nignog gals look prettier than the southern lady with the flag</br>  <br>Because they simply refuse to acknowledge that the world around them is changing faster than they can react or cope. Put yourself in their shoes for a moment. It must be fucking terrifying honestly.</br>  <br>this is an example of dumb fat and ugly the southerners are. you using it as a source of pride is telling of your qualities as well.</br>  <br>yeah I know if it was for heritage they would be flying third national flag or bonnie blue for Florida but instead fly the army's battle flag<br>battle flag<br>battle<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ULB<wbr>CuHIpNgU</wbr>  [ ]<br>video to help those understand it a bit more.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty sure nothing is simple enough for you.</br>  <br>it may not be THE confederate flag but it is A confederate flag.

It was just North not wanting to lose the resources - that's fucking it. <br>Then when South still rejected, it suddenly turns into a ''liberty'' war kek</br></br>  <br>Looool ok you aspie faggot.

In my opinion, southerners are mad because "Muh heritage" and anything that sounds like the mildest insult to muh flag or muh civil war sends them into a tard rage.

When it hits you, picture all the tiny fungal spores that are slowly going towards your brain.  Have a comfortable surrounding. Be somewhere you know. After taking them during a cup of orange juice and enjoy  add mdma  <br>do not drink orange juice, it takes the boom out of your trip.<br>Just relax, be somewhere safe, maybe with someone you can trust fully. Do not eat before ingesting the mushrooms.<br>At night the effects are even better</br></br></br>  <br>Orange juice for shrooms? Only drank OJ while on acid for the vit C effects, whats the OJ for with shrooms?</br>  you aren't ready, give ME the shrooms  Can any sporefags identify my two friends here? <br>NorCal/Lake County.</br>  <br>vitamin C can bring you down a tad</br>  break free !  <br><br>Don't waste your trip in your room, try to get outside and enjoy the nature within some familiar surroundings. Have at least one trip sitter that you trust completely. Relaxing music. If you're not too fucked up, play a simple board game... or play an instrument if you're a musician.</br></br>      <br>Seems counter productive.<br><br>Only had shrooms once but didn't have enough to do anything, mostly because we had to split with an extra person. He was a useless waste of space and I should have just had said fuck it and not given him shit.</br></br></br>    Look in the mirror when your at your peak  <br>tried that once, mdma litterally canceled out the effects of the shrooms.</br>  Play with bubbles  first time i tried it really fucked my perception of reality, even when sober. it was like, i could understand why the people acted like they do, the subtilities of langage, social interactions etc... i couldn't see past the absurdity. and i still can't  <br>spongebob and patrick</br>  <br>Just go with it. If you've never done drugs like that then it'll probably be about the most fucked up thing that's ever happened to you. Just let it happen. Don't try and fight it.</br>  <br>Generally anything you percieve as natural is awesome while on shrooms, so take a walk in the woods etc.<br>Doing it in a place you know nobody will be watching or seeing you makes the trip better.<br>Also, don't try to "predict" how the trip will be, just relax and let it come</br></br></br>  <br>Nah dude. Stay in your room and get familiar with the effects and how your body reacts to shrooms. You don't want to have a bad trip in public or in the woods</br>  <br>I've never understood why people say this. What I see when I look in the mirror is some tweaked out motherfucker who doesn't look like they're getting enough oxygen to their facial skin, but I see purple hues on everything normally when tripping.</br>  <br>not in a bad tho. more like a relief,I finally found where my anxieties came from</br>  Know that you control your experience  You can trip major fucking balls off of barely a gram. You cut the shrooms up, put them in a shot of cranberry juice, and quickly take the entire shot. I have read about it on multiple sites.<br>http://www.shroomery.org/forums/sho<wbr>wflat.php/Number/15003143</wbr></br>  <br>I did that but ended up stripping naked looking into the mirror and started stretching. My body has never felt better, it's like it's connecting it's weird crazy to explain.</br>  <br><br>Public? Damn dude, I'd avoid the public at all costs. I really meant more like starting out in your garden or a nearby field, then building up to fairly private and uninhabited places like local forests.</br></br>  <br>Yep. I couldn't help but sit there and laugh at it. It's like I took one more step back than I ever had before and everything just made sense, even if the sense it made was that everything is just silly.</br>  <br> this <br>Watching yourself breathe is like...fuck.<br><br>You feel really powerful.<br>At least I did.</br></br></br></br></br>  for best effect grind them into powder and mix with water, then drink the mixture with your anus.  <br>Watch Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs 2, and drink Dr Pepper with the shrooms to mask that matted dog hair taste</br>  <br>It feels like aliens are making you high.</br>    <br>and light as a feather.<br>I can finally be alone without being worried about finding a partner. I begun to believe that everyone is special in their own way but they cannot see it. Its become conditioned. That's when I think that these people need someone who isn't me, and that's okay. so I leave them alone.</br></br>  <br>It's only aliens if you don't realize that the person tying us all together is the same one that is you.</br>  <br><br>Yeah the last time I tripped was the greatest, had a similar experience to you. On the rare occasion I spoke to my friends and attempted to explain how I was feeling I realised just how much words seemed to fall short of expressing subjective experiences, so after a while I just said nothing because it felt like I was cheapening the experience by trying to rationalise it into sentences.</br></br>  <br>Do this</br>  <br>We're all tied together but the line has been cut</br>  <br><br><br>i guess i was influenced by my existentialist reading (Sartre, Kierkegeerd, Camus etc..) but it felt like, for the first time, everything was clear, true in its pure absurdity</br></br></br>    <br>when you're coming down smoke some weed to bring you back up</br>  How much were you going to take, and what genotype are you working with?  <br>it's more along the lines of trying to give you an extra boost. Or I'm going crazy. Whatevs</br>  <br> this <br>Its straight up a mindfuck but it's glorious.</br></br>  Im going shroom picking friday at a place where i know they grow, can anyone give me tips on identification and possibly growing them myself  <br>This sounds much like my friend who went into psychosis, thinking he could sense everything out of people and get linked mentally somehow etc crazy stuff, shrooms had nothing to do with this tho</br>  I love shrooms. Truly an amazing lifeform. My advice is to respect the fungus and it will respect you.  <br>Paul Stamets has published a lot of handy material. Here's what you do if you're too lazy to read a book: google image search specific species that grow in your area. Learn them top-to-bottom. Learn to take spore-prints and which species don't bruise blue. Also, learn what Galerina Marginata looks like. Cause that shit will kill you. Also, stay radical.</br>  <br>Wear a plumber suit with a red hat that has a M on the front</br>  don't rip your penis off or turn gay. Seriously some guy ripped his penis off on shrooms google it, don't know why I never once thought ever to rip my penis off during 100's of trips. Also don't turn gay many people seem to think because they're gay already and shrooms lifts the veil that shrooms turned them gay don't blame the shrooms cause your a gaylord who enjoys traps. Good luck and godspeed and protect your asshole at all times shroom gnomes will be coming for it  you post your country flag, or if it's posted already, you MUST reply in your own language.<br>lets see how many languages does /b/ speak all over the world</br>  Magyarok?
