How about no</br>  <br><br>Why?</br></br>  <br>That's pretty good, also Prisoners, Nightcrawler, Oldboy, Akira, Se7en, Birdman.</br>  <br>i like some australian movies. romper stomper sure isnt one of them though.</br>  <br>it was a good movie. not as good as the book but.</br>  <br>I don't know, it's a movie that I find somewhat okay, but I think it's not really that good. I can't even explain it, i simply don't like the movie. Maybe because we watched it several years ago in school.</br>  <br><br>Oldboy two thumbs up, watched both of them and it's one of those times where you can say "The original is better" because it clearly was</br></br>  <br>In the other one after that Edward Norton shaves his head and goes full nazi again</br>  <br>Howso?

Very good, even if it doesn't stick with the fact, but with the Robert Graysmith book.</br>  <br><br>This. You people don't understand what underrated means. It doesn't mean "a movie that I like".<br><br>Birdman was up for an academy award.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Depends on how you love them.

Most likely because Christian Bale looks like a retard when he opens his mouth.<br><br>What's wrong with his teeth ?</br></br></br>    <br>Just watch it. A really good movie.</br>    <br>fuck u spastic</br>  <br><br>Just read the book faggot</br></br>  <br><br><br>A guy that knew Dahmer said that film was complete bullshit</br></br></br>  <br>Derf Backderf ?</br>  <br>Ultimate cuck</br>  <br>How many times we'll hear these stupid words?</br>  Ask a closet Cd sissy anything  Hormones?  No. I'm married  <br>Why haven't you caged your clit and flushed the key down the toilet yet?</br>  It is caged most of the time  more photos?  more photos !  <br>I'm married to its hard cding and hiding it</br>    <br><br>Why did you marry stuck up bitches who you can't talk about your sexuality with?</br></br>  Bump  <br>Cause they get defensive cause they think they will lose what they have... I told my wife that I wanted to transition and I've wanted to for years and that she's the first person I told, she started hitting me and said that she'd leave me if I did and since I love her so much I instead tried therapy I pretend that it worked and that in happy but inside I'm dead... I just want to be pretty....</br>  <br>I am like you, not married tho, but still hiding my things to visitors, of course.<br>How do you deal with shaving your body without others (specially your wife) asking about it?</br></br>  <br> inside I'm dead <br>you'd still be dead inside if you transitioned...<br>trust me, /b/ro. trannies are broken human beings. take your antidepressant and plow your wife.</br></br></br>  <br>Wow.<br>Well that's a stuck up bitch if i've ever seen one.<br>Honestly you should leave her. If she can't accept who you are. What do you mean with "they think they will lose what they have"<br>A stable marriage with a normal husband?<br>A status she can show off to be more accepted?<br>Load of bullshit. That's not what a marriage should be about anymore.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hard to plow anything with antidepressants...</br>  <br>So, you tell her your biggest secret, and she hits you and makes threats... And you love her. What the fuck is wrong with you? Except for the low self esteem and feeling like a woman stuck in a mans body??</br>  <br>  trannies are broken human beings <br><br>And how do you know?</br></br></br>  <br>I'd feel to guilty to leave her I don't know why though</br>  <br>The fear of being alone...</br>  <br>Even harder to plow someone with HRT.<br><br>I looked at the rate of suicides post transition.</br></br></br>  <br>face pls embrace it</br>  <br>Because they feel like the opposite gender of their sex... If that isn't "broken", I don't know what is. It's mental disease. Nothing to be ashamed about or good reason to be mean, but transgender/race people are broken.</br>  <br>I know how you feel, not on a marriage scale but I put off breaking up with most recent gf because I knew I'd feel guilty and hurt her, but after I did everyone said I did the right thing for myself</br>  <br>Moar</br>  <br>So, he/she should let fear guide her. Nice... Better to spend the rest of your life with someone that hits you for not lying.</br>  <br>I obviously dont know all the details.<br>But i think it's because you think it'd be selfish on your part to transition and change your lifestyle to a less socially acceptable, "Dragging" your wife into it.<br>In reality, she's the selfish one because she's more obsessed with what others think of her than you. The one she's supposed to love and support. You have absolutely no reason to care about her if she doesn't reciprocate those feelings.<br><br><br> I looked at the rate of suicides post transition. <br>Maybe it's because stupid fucks like you who make life hell for transgender people in our society.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Maybe it's because stupid fucks like you who make life hell for transgender people in our society. <br>Sure, blame me because transitioning is not the cure-all for dysphoria. I'm not trying to disillusion you but you will be disillusioned before the end.</br></br>  <br>Partly, yes. But I find the idea of transgender having a higher suicide rate by default likely. <br><br>It's difficult to describe mental illness in all it's aspects, but that is what transgender people are. Any sort of physical/mental illness IS going to increase the likelihood of ending your own life.. the intolerant people doesn't help though.</br></br></br>  <br>There's no reason to call it a mental disease.<br>By definition of ICD-10, the psychological definition of mental diseases, you can call a mental state a "disease" only when you are severely damaging yourself or damaging others among a few other points.<br>If we'd still go by the definition of everything going against normative lifestyle, every "strange" haircut would be considered a mental disease.<br>Hell, all of /b/ would be clinically mentally sick.</br></br></br></br>  <br> the intolerant people doesn't help though <br>I just want you to remember how I was called intolerant for saying that transitioning might make you miserable. Watch out for these internet fuckers trying to give you psychiatric advice and if you need to go to an actual doctor.</br></br>  <br>Why would you neglect the 40% rate of attempted suicide? Did the big bad culture make you hurt yourself or can you accept it does cause severe damage to yourself and others?</br>  <br>Take it this way lads : IMO trannies,cross dressers are straight people that get off to being humiliated. They live off the reaction they have on other people something like exhibitionists or you know the folk that wank in public. So when that goes and they find some new stimulus all they are left is shame. This is you OP. You're not a woman your just someone who doesn't think he'd be able to be in control of anything ie your marriage. Get more help and replace sucking cock for something that would make you feel more like a man ( carpentry, logging or lifting.. Have a nice life</br>  <br>That's why you actually go to a psychiatrist who evaluates wether or not you actually need transitioning or if the problem is elsewhere.<br>You dont go to "therapy" and just take antidepressants because your wife tells you to and others tell you to be normal or they will leave you.<br>In OP's case it's a problem with her<br>environment and not with her.</br></br></br></br>    ffs  Three cheers to all of us!

Sie rudert und geht selten mal ins Fitnessstudio. Ich gehe schwimmen(nicht oft) und radfahren. <br>Als wir begonnen hatten, fragte sie mich drückst du schon? Ich so ja klar und sie erhöhte den Druck und schon hatte sie meine Hand auf den Tisch gedrückt. Ich war einfach nur total geschockt...Dann wollte sie mit mir Ringen. Ich sagte sofort zu, weil ich wollte sie unbedingt schlagen. Aber schon nach einer Minute hatte sie mich im Schwitzkasten und presste mich zu Boden. Sie drehte mich auf den Rücken nahm meine Handgelenke und drückte sie auf den Boden. Ich versuchte mich zu befreien, aber ich hatte absolut null Chance. Später konnte ich sie auf dem Boden fixieren, doch dann sah man wie ihr bizeps größer wurde und sie mich einfach ohne Probleme hoch hob und zur Seite schmiss. Zum Schluss drückte sie mich gegen die Wand, griff mich unter den Achseln und hob mich hoch. Sie sagte: Komm schon du schwächling, sag dass ich stärker bin als du. Nach einer Minute tat ich dies: Bitte lass mich runter. Du bist stärker als ich. Seitdem erzählt sie es überall herum, was für ein Schwächling ich doch bin. Sie wollte dann meinen Oberarm fühlen und lachte als ich den anspannte und eine kleine Wölbung erschien(die nicht hart ist). Bei ihr dagegen war alles komplett hart und ihr Arm ist doppelt so dick wie meiner. <br>Wie kann ein jüngeres Mädchen, soviel stärker sein als ein 19 jähriger und dazu auch noch gut 12 cm größer???</br></br></br></br>  <br>Wie wärs, ich nenn dich nicht Nazi sondern einfach nur "Engstirnige Zimmerpflanze".<br>Is das Ok oder rollen schon die Tränen?</br></br>  <br>Du hast im Leben noch nie hart körperlich gearbeitet und tust zuwenig für deinen Körper<br>Leb mit den Folgen, du kannst sie doch noch nichma sexuell befridigen wenn sie dich Fitnessmässig so abhängt.

So if you are know any good Metalband from New Zealand, let me know. <br><br>Thank you. :)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>afta skool behind da gym dik</br>  <br>More Goofy<br>The dark ones command it</br></br>  <br>are they all wellington? i have a few hundred oc with names but not from welly.</br>  any dunedin nudes?  <br>Devilskin is a pretty tip fucking top band but I'm not too sure how metal they are. If you'll go for a more rock like band, Black River Drive has two fucking fantastic albums out</br>  <br>You are based god anon. Any more victoria or helena?</br>    <br>Yeah. Post em anyway. I only trade for welly nudes tho. <br>Katie Gradwell</br></br>  <br>andrea</br>  <br>Emma D from dunners</br>  is trolling illegal yet or can we still say mean things to each other?    <br>just post nudes</br>  <br>get home from work. walk in your room and you see these 3<br>what do?</br></br>  <br>Just hearing Little Pills from them. They are quite good, thanks for the tip! <br><br>Black River Drive is a bit too soft for me. :/</br></br></br>  <br>Nice you got any moar?</br>    <br>Just this.</br>  <br>Nah sorry. You?</br>  <br>aha. I was her first kiss.</br>  Anyone in Dunners got photos of Claudia Duff's tits?  <br>Ah fair enough bro. I like them for a bit of chilled out music every once in a while. Vessel is probably my favourite Devilskin song, followed by Start a Revolution, but I think it was Little Pills that made them big (well here at least)</br>  Taurangafag here. Hi.  <br>Thanks anon. Gonna have a good fap tonight</br>  Dunedin reporting late<br><br>snow-walk to the dealer, worth it though</br></br>  <br>West park?</br>  <br>yea man AMA</br>  <br>any 18yo from vic? their first year</br>  <br>Normaly I hear something like Blind Guardian, Silverlight, Heaven Shall Burn an so on. Sometimes even Slayer but I have to be in the mood for that. <br><br>Vessel is really good! Love the Voice from hear. Would like to see&amp;hear them live.</br></br></br>  <br>That ass feels even better than it looks<br>Milo<br><br>I don't go to vic so I don't know.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Newlands. Surprisingly, she was only year 9 when we kissed.</br>  <br>MODS</br>  <br>Why mods? She's legal.</br>  <br>They opened for Slash when he came here last year and apparently they nailed it. They used to do tours around pubs and shit around NZ and I'm still kinda pissed I missed them. <br><br>They're proba the hardest I'll go though. I prefer more rockish rock, like the Foo Fighters, or some Blusey Rock, like the Black Keys or Gem and the Deadheads.</br></br></br>  <br>Name?</br>  <br>lucky bastard. she may be a little crazy but shes hot as hell</br>  <br>she's like 19-20 bro</br>  any Serena Arawa from otago  <br>Well Foo Fighters are pretty good. Even for Rock. :P<br>They are kinda fast, thats what I like about them. But when I ride one my Motocycle, nothing is better then AC/DC. That's really gets my blood boilin. :)<br>I will look out for them. Hope I dont miss them in my year there.</br></br></br>  <br>It says it on the post retard</br>  <br>I saw the Foos earlier this year and they were so bloody good. Probably one of the few 10/10 concerts I've ever been to. Dave Ghrol is just so fucking great haha<br><br>AC/DC is top notch stuff though, gotta hand that to you. Is their new album out yet?</br></br></br>  <br>she'd get it</br>  <br><br>Fuck me, I forgot to say check out a band called Halestorm. They do a few mean song called Freak Like Me, I Get Off, Miss the Misery and What Were You Expecting.</br></br>  <br>pretty sure you'll have this but enjoy</br>  <br>If you mean Rock or Bust, yes. It is out since 2014. :)<br><br>Well my favourite liveperformance was Rammstein in Wuhlheide, Berlin. That was so good. I was in the second line with Flamethrowers over my head. <br><br>Also HSB with their big Wall of Deaths is so enoyable. <br><br>Sorry for my "big and small writing". But in Germany we wirte every fucking Substantive big first. Do you say big or Capital to these Letters? Kinda confused right now.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You thought correctly<br>Frances</br></br>  <br>is that Siobhan from Christchurch?</br>  <br>I know them!!!<br>They rock like hell! But never got a Chance to see them live.</br></br>  <br>pussytoohairy/10</br>  <br>Saw her tits on a mates snap story, there pics of em out?</br>  <br>We say capital for them. And fuck man that sounds wicked! I need to travel to Germany one day. Went when I lived in the Netherlands as a kid but fucking forgot everything about it haha</br>  <br>yad hope so, probably one of the biggest racks in the land</br>  <br>you in north D?</br>  <br>Have some oc for your work. my ex caitlin mckone</br>  <br>I'm hoping against hope for them to play a Kiwi show but the ods ain't great. Although Seether did just come here but I missed them cause of exams</br>  <br>ok i really wannaa see these tits now too</br>  <br>the fuck kind of oc is that? theres a watermark</br>  <br>wot</br>  <br>fail</br>  <br>too right. i still wouldn't though</br>  <br>Yeah, even most of the world hates us, that is mostly the Politic from here. It's fucking terrible. <br>But the people here are nice as fuck if you know them. We need a bit time to open. Thats how we say a "Volkskrankheit" Tribesickness. <br>But the festivals here are some of the best. Like Wacken.</br></br></br>  <br> Oc </br>  <br>Warning you bruv, she aint a looker by any stretch</br>  <br>typical tumblrina</br>  <br>so shes a butterface then?</br>  <br>Name and place?</br>  <br>Is her name frances?</br>  <br>I dont like there new Songs. Finding Beauty in Negative Space is my favourite Album from them.</br>  <br>We've got almost the opposite problem here where just no one knows we exist (apart from rugby where we apparently fuck up every other nation on earth).<br><br>We don't have a huge festival scene here. The only big one is an expensive as fuck New Years thing called Rhythm and Vines, but they're putting a bunch of restrictions on it this year so it probs won't be as good. Only other thing we can really offer is the legendary dunners couch burning parties</br></br></br>  <br>that and landwhale</br>  <br>Probably more on the BBW side</br>  <br>That one was pretty good. Although I do love Words as Weapons and Weak from the new one</br>  <br>proper Oc for you<br>amy young. in her skinnier days</br></br>  <br><br><br>...Scott? jej</br></br></br>  <br>Yes. <br><br>Frances, Wellington</br></br></br>  Thanks Mr. Penis  <br>Thanks Mr. Penis</br>  but but but I am a grill  <br><br>clitoris is the same thing as penis, and clitoris system extends as long as an average penis size. So if you say "thanks Mr.Penis" your clitoris will grow and give you more pleasure than ever</br></br>  <br>then your clitoris will grow 1 inch</br>  <br>you have to post<br>also, tits or gtfo</br></br>  Thanks Mr. Penis  Thanks Mr. Penis  Thanks Mr. Penis  Thanks Mr. Penis  <br>Sleep tight penis</br>  Thanks, Mr. Penis.  <br>Thanks Mr. Penis</br>  Sleep tight penor  <br>Thanks Mr. Penis</br>  <br>Thanks Mr.Penis</br>  Thanks Mr. Penis  Thanks Mr. Penis  <br>i didn't wanna sleep tonight anyway</br>  Thanks Mr. Penis  Thanks Dad  Thanks Mr. Penis  <br>Thanks Mr. Penis</br>  Thanks Mr. Penis  Thank Mr. Penis  Thanks Mr. Penis  Thanks Mr. Penis  Thanks Mr. Penis  Thanks Mr. Penis.
