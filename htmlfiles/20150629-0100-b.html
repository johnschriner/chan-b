Nah, we are going to glorify them, we are going to put them on a throne, so it will breed even more madness, in the end, nobody will be left to know what logic and common sense are, and this will mark the end of humanity, all because we do not want to oppress mantally deranged people.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The thing is that people nowadays have replaced reason with emotion.

Fused ankle with a ~8 inch long and ~3 inch wide skin graft on top of my foot and ankle  <br>why don't you tell us about your emergency room + dildo incident?</br>  Worst I've got as far as I know is crooked kneecaps. Can't walk or stand in place for very long before they start hurting like a motherfucker, and I can pop them both consistently on cue. Bone cysts in both my knees too, which don't do anything to affect me regularly, and are fortunately both benign. They do hollow out a part of my kneecap from what I understand though.  Why do you let the x rays bro?.it gives you cancer. Actually they can use other techniques for that...  <br> ~8 inch long and ~3 inch wide skin graft on top of my foot and ankle <br>I want to see this</br></br>  I'm highly intelligent.  right now i have acid reflux.<br><br>i've been getting drunk on schnaps all week with no trouble at all, but last night i went out for beers with a bro and woke up with upset stomach.</br></br>  Got this.  <br><br>Thought you would want to keep that secret</br></br>  <br>Don't you fucking know what you are?</br>  <br><br>I had osteochondritis when I was in the navy. actually went to the hospital because i thought i was having a heart attack. my chest/rib cage area was just so fucking inflamed.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Man, you've got some flabby tits in that xray!<br><br>But really, I've just got clinical depression and general anxiety.

I also have a massive addiction to cock.  <br>Try Mckenzie exercises, unspesific lumbar pain is very common.</br>  <br>From my thigh<br><br><br><br>Yeah</br></br></br></br></br>  Alcoholism and heroin habit  Sleep deprivation, drug addiction, HPV, and 7 stab wounds on my back from when some fucker stole my car.<br>But that's nothing wrong.</br>  <br>im going to physio and that helps a bit, but he has no clue except that its definitely the muscles or skin</br>  my body is ded because of basketball<br><br> my feet are full of calluses and look kinda fucked up <br> my fingers are fucked up because of constantly jamming them <br> all of my joints hurt all the time for no reason <br> my patellar tendons are ded <br> my achilles are close to being ded <br> my meniscus and other shit in my knees hurt <br> i BTFOd my lower back missing a dunk 2 days ago, felt like my spine was gonna break and now im laying in bed and it hurts like shit <br><br>something like that<br>i dont think i was born with any weird shit tho except for that pigeon chest thing and heart problems running in the family</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Lots of xrays can increase your odds of getting cancer some small percent. CT scans on the other hand should definitely be avoided unless absolutely needed.</br>  <br>Try melatonin.</br>   allergies <br> lose hearing in left ear 1 month ago <br> losing hearing in right ear now <br><br>just going through tests right now, pretty scared.</br></br></br></br>  <br>thats because 4chan</br>  scoliosis from sharing a womb with twin, has scoliosis too<br>wolff-parkinson-white syndrome, tons of heart problems<br>narcolepsy<br>cant do anything about any of em except pay out the ass to get my back cracked every other day</br></br></br>  <br>I got chronic sacroiliitis in both my joints, I'm on pain and anxiety meds 24/7. Only 26 y old, so my life is fucked forever. Can't even carry shopping bags mora than a few hundred meters.</br>  <br><br>This happened to me.<br><br>After a time, it was discovered to be Ankylosing Spondylitis and Rheumatoid Arthritis combined. Hurt like hell for years before it ever showed up on a MRI.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Possibly psychosomatic. A lot of chronic non objective pain, particularly back pain can be unexpressed emotion and stress. Sounds hippy dippy but there seems to be some anecdotal truth to it. For example I get issues where I feel like I have to piss all the time and it hurts to pee when I'm really stressed out and under slept. There's nothing that show up on any tests. It's just stress. Stress causes lots of health problems. Get into meditation, regular exercise, and talk therapy. It might help.</br>  <br>  <br>I agree with that assessment, though be it quite unspesific. Myfacial release and Mckenzie would probably sort you out. 85% of lumbarpain cases are "unspesific". Do yoga, take a walk every day, preferably in rural areas and hope to fuck your physio is competent. (tip, if he does the same damn thing every time you visit, over a long period, he may not give enough of a fuck to try an solve your isse.)</br></br>  a bit of a scoliosis.<br>always coughing and slime in the lungs.<br>sleep deprivation.</br></br>  Depression.<br>Enough to rob me of any motivation outside baseline survival, not enough to qualify for aid.<br> "Not a danger to self or others". <br><br>Hayfever.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This is also a diferential diagnosis i can get behind, but not without having examined you personaly and peformed an anamnesis.</br>   I think so  SLI<br>Bad knees, always locking up.<br><br>Fucking hurts, man.</br></br></br>  <br>got checked for both of them, and its none<br><br>id prefer to be diagnosed with something bad than not know whats wrong with me</br></br></br>  I get kidney stones sometimes.

What kind of drugs?  Munchausen syndrome w/doge  <br>ching ching chong kling klang</br>   poor fellow  <br>Same, but I got sacroiliitis, so I can't move without pain meds at all, so I'm stuck with waking up in my own sweat from the withdrawals starting every morning.<br><br>Also have panic disorder, depression and chronic insomnia.

Shit blows man.</br>  <br>If it hurts when palpated then it sounds structural. A lot of back pain is enigmatic and hard to diagnose. I'm not sure about this one. I would agree that if it's painful to the touch it is likely not psychosomatic. But usually in those cases MDs can figure it out.</br>  <br>what you pretend your dog is sick? Thats munchausen syndrome by proxy</br>  <br>Meniscus is the knee. When it's torn it usually makes a clicking sound and is very painful to flex.</br>    <br>almost unbearably painful when palpated.<br>damn physiotherapist spent 15 mins rubbing that area to "loosen it up"</br></br>  Epilepsy. The one thing that stops me from being independant.  <br>Except from the lower back thing (obviously) I have the EXACT SAME shit going on, including the stuff outside the greentext and I didn't get it from basketball, but from handball.</br>  <br>so what do you eat?</br>  Had 3 herniated discs in lumbar region  <br>Tissue stresses over time will become hypersensetive ( nociceptors/pain receptors react faster, and other pain receptors with a very low actuation theshold will be awakend), you have to return the tissue to a normal state. Manual therapy and movement, lots of it. I still maintain meckenzie exercises (likely extension) Google "meckenzie derengament threatment) and start moving, even if painfull, move "normaly".</br>  bump  any more doctors?  is thred ded????  <br>Just wondering, does people with epilepsy never live alone for safety measures?<br>Also, are you allowed to drive etc?
