[ Baww thread<br>Guys my girlfriend of 2 years has just told me she doesn't think we're going to work out and it'll probably be over in a week. I'm still madly in love with her and she says she still cares for me deeply. I was willing to move countries with her. How do I deal with this pain, I don't even know what to do</br>  <br> my girlfriend of 2 years has just told me she doesn't think we're going to work out and it'll probably be over in a week. <br>She's been fucking other men behind your back from the very beginning.</br></br>  <br>The thing is she's got anxiety issues and has no friends, never goes out, sits at home playing vidya, she's perfect to me its killing me</br>  Grow a pair, all of you.  <br>She slept with her gamer friends, spilling love juices all over your bed.</br>  Have breakup sex and see if it mindfucks her back into relationship status.  <br>get some meth, helped me with my last breakup</br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br>Find something to distract yourself. Buy a new game, find a side slut, go on a small adventure, anything. Give her space to think whatever she's thinking. The best thing you can do is not stress over it and respect giving her space, she will notice and appreciate that. If it doesnt work out, there are plenty of fish in the sea, and only a manchild is too immature to still be friends with an ex, just go with the flow, bro, hope this helps</br>  <br>I was considering getting back into weed, which I stopped because I didn't need it to be happy since I had her. But now I think I need it. I wish I could fake anhero just to see her cry for once</br>  "girlfriend of 2 years"<br>she's too old for you anyway</br>  <br>I really appreciate it anon</br>  <br>no need, if you can get your shit together it will make her weep at night, can tell from experience<br>it will be hard as hell the first weeks, but if you focus on doing something with your life as another anon said, it will feel better</br></br>  <br>how come it is immature to be friends with an ex?</br>  <br>Dump her before she dumps you.</br>  <br>Why</br>  <br>such bait</br>  <br>Because there is a very big difference between an adult relationship and a teenage relationship. Leaving out obvious circumstances where one of you wrongs the other via cheating or something similar, there is no reason to not stay friends with someone you've shared so much life experience with. They can still be your best friend. And if you play your cards right they can be your fuck buddy.</br>  I'm scared to go for a drive because I'm so void right now that I would pussy out and turn the wheel  <br>there is nothing to do. Hard times are coming for you /b/ro, I feel you.<br><br>In some time you'll think that you learned a lesson of Life, so you will be able to move on again. That's all.<br><br>Meanwhile, there's alcohol and one night stands.</br></br></br></br></br>  Lets have an God-tier albums thread.

He can't have lucked for 2 years. It's more likely that he got soft about his ex wanting to save the last of their memories together, so he put the pics in photobucket for her and got real unlucky.</br>  <br> vodka is illegal in australia <br><br>srsly?<br><br>why</br></br></br></br></br>  has anyone reuploaded Panther Talk 2015?
