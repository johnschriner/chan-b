I had no idea why</br>  <br>How much should I tip ?</br>  <br>I guess if you can grow it, good and if you can't, sucks for you. I don't grow a good beard myself so I keep it short.</br>  <br>Whatever you feel you want to. I guess base it off how satisfied you are with the results. Tipping isn't an obligation obviously but it is appreciated. Barbers aren't like servers, we don't live off of tips and there is only a tiny microscopic bit of butthurt when I don't get tipped but I get paid well anyways.</br>  Some great Pomade, low-medium shone and great hold.    <br>It's Ricky from TPB.</br>  What's your favorite haircut OP?

Real men cut their own hair  <br>On myself, I get a medium bald fade combover and I love shear work as well as fades and blending work. I'd say pompadours and burst tapers are my favorite to cut</br>  <br>Pretty sure real men go to their barber.<br><br>Just how old are you anyways? <br><br>This new generation is fucking retarded.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Op loves periphery. He is one of my favorite musicians.</br>  <br>I cut my own hair. But yes I make $1200-$1500 a week.</br>  <br> poor communication the cause for him being shitty as his job. <br> confirmed nigger. </br></br>    <br>ITT: children who don't understand how many problems miscommunication can create in pretty much every aspect of life.</br>  <br>together with the facial pubes?</br>  <br>Obviously your hair is suited to your head. Some cuts don't look good on certain people but I wouldn't blame it on face shapes. More on head shaped.</br>  <br>Why do you start this thread everyday? You must have a lot of work</br>  <br>I took yesterday and today off just for a break to hang out with my wife and kids<br><br> inb4 get off 4chan </br></br></br>  <br>Gutted</br>  what kind of music do you like? which band is your favorite?  <br> implying I've got a job where I need to be told how to button my pants. <br><br>I'm sorry you're an idiot, Anon.</br></br></br>  <br>If you're a massive stinking faggit that wants to look like a generic faggit</br>  How do you get hair to look less poofy and have more weight? I have jew hair that's puffy as hell.  <br>This is how I know you are a shit new school barber. Suavecito &amp;any other water soluble, are a gel. Pomade doesnt wash out in one shower</br>  <br>I love metal. Between The Buried And Me has to be my all time favorite. My friends put me on to Kendrick Lamar and J Cole those guys are pretty good</br>  <br>And thats the worst part about this generation.. They don't even admit when they're wrong, and they hate listening to advice from their superiors..<br><br>I'm so fucking worried about the future of this planet...</br></br></br>  I'm always really talkative to a barber when they're cutting my hair, but I know some people can be awkward as fuck and just sit there being all silent<br><br>how awkward is that for you?</br></br>  please kill yourself OP  <br>JETPACKS WAS YES<br>NOLLY WAS NO</br></br>  <br>YUP. You're a shitty new school barber that gives kids "comb overs" when it's really called a side part. A comb over is when you're bald &amp; comb over the side hair to cover the baldness. Faggot</br>  <br>Then you sir, are a faggot of gargantuan proportion</br>  <br>I guess if you want curly hair try a curl activator creme, I don't know of any brands but I've used it ages ago and I got good results</br>  <br><br>I can't wait for this "giant poof with shaved sides" haircut trend to finally die.</br></br>  <br>I'm balding pl0x halp nao!</br>  <br>I was given a can from my brother and it works well and my clients like it</br>  <br/>  <br>Do you like any good metal? Have you heard a Sabbath album all the way through?</br>  OP i've got long hair<br>i look fucking 15 without it i kid you not<br>are there any nonfaggot interesting haircuts that are not the retarded combover shaved sides cancer?<br><br>BTBAM is fucking stellar i bet you jerk your microscopic cock over Manowar</br></br></br></br>  <br> Sabbath <br>Go home grandpa</br></br>  <br>I don't mind. If they are quiet then I just ask them what type of music they like and put on Pandora. It makes it less awkward but I love conversation too. Being a good people person is important in this line of work, it not just about the haircut, but the whole customer service experience.</br>  <br> grandpa <br> for liking sabbath <br>wat</br></br></br>    <br>A comb over is where you comb you hair to whatever side. Side part is the same thing too. You're arguing the same point. <br>I do all types of haircuts so I don't know what you mean by new school barber</br></br>  <br>Any way I could get to grow a beard faster?<br>I'm twenty-fucking-two and only get a shitty soul patch. And that's if I don't shave for weeks on end.<br>Even chems are fine, I'll take whatever.</br></br></br>  Barber? Hahahaha who the fuck sees a barber. You can take you $10 haircut and shove it up your ass, butcher.<br><br>I cough up the money to see a professional hair stylists. Y'know, someone who actually knows what he or she is doing, unlike your stupid barber ass.</br></br>  <br>I like old school metal too like Iron Maiden, Scrorpions, Metallica never been a huge Sabbath fan though</br>  <br> sabbath <br> good metal <br> mfw </br></br></br>  <br>If you don't like fades I recommend trying short sides (not skin) with a light taper in the back and a little off the top so you can have a bunch of styling options<br><br>BTBAM is the shit, I downloadable. New album and it's 10/10 hands down. Definitely buying a hard copy when it drops</br></br></br>  <br>Manowar suck</br>  I have always had a receding hairline. It's barely noticable when i grow slightly longer hair which fall into my forehead. Will i forever be stuck with that kind of haircut? What haircut do you recommend?  <br> only old metal is good metal <br>being this much of a faggot</br></br>  <br>I'd try Rogaine. The store version supposedly works just as well</br>  <br> who the fuck sees a barber. <br>People who aren't pussy metrosexual faggots</br></br>  <br>can you post a picture of what you mean ? <br>i kinda like my hair, it's cool, but i'm looking for alternatives in case i change my mind someday</br></br>  <br><br><br>gtfo summerfags</br></br></br>  <br><br>Wait four more years and enjoy rolling in college pussy because you can still pass for a sophmore.</br></br>  <br>What haircut should I get? Usually I get a blowout 7 up top 6 on the sides and just brush it down like any other latino. What do i do about this kinky shit?</br>  <br>It's not a trend you faggot.<br><br>It's been a thing for a long, long time and one of the few options men have with their hair.</br></br></br>  New Tribal Wars 2 Thread!<br><br>- Make an account in Tribal Wars 2 website<br>- Make sure it's the English Version<br>- Join World 12 (Leeds Castle)<br>- Start in South East<br>- Join 4chan tribe.
