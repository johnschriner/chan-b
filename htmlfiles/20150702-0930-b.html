The cancer is contained within the testicle and has not spread to nearby lymph nodes or other organs. Stage 1S means that there are raised markers after surgery. <br><br>Stage 2 – the cancer cells have spread into nearby lymph nodes in your abdomen or pelvis. Your marker level may be normal (S0) or slightly raised (S1). This is split into 2A, 2B and 2C.<br><br>Stage 2A means the lymph nodes are all smaller than 2cm<br>Stage 2B means the nodes are between 2cm and 5cm<br>Stage 2C means at least one lymph node is bigger than 5cm <br>Stage 3 – this is split into 3A, 3B and 3C<br><br>Stage 3A means the cancer has spread to distant lymph nodes (for example near the collarbone) or your lungs. Your marker level may be normal (S0) or slightly raised (S1)<br>Stage 3B means the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes and you have a moderately high marker level (S2), OR your cancer has spread to your lungs or distant lymph nodes and you have a moderately high marker level<br>Stage 3C can be the same as stage 3B but you have a very high marker level (S3), OR your cancer has spread to another body organ, such as the liver or brain – this used to be called stage 4 testicular cancer</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Looks like a really nutty zit.</br>  <br>looks like you are going to be a mother soon.<br>they will hatch</br></br>  warts stupid  <br><br>agree, post more pics OP</br></br>    OP is a faggot<br>This was posted yesterday.</br>  It hurts if I pull on it.  wash your nuts better, fagget    op did you bust a nut  <br>Oh nasty man.

Espacially when you put sanitizer in the wounds. I off cutting myself for a while but this feeling of so many wounds, filled with sanitizer must be really intense. Where do i get these worms?</br>  Sebaceous cysts.

They appeared when I was around 14, never been to a doctor or told my parents. At first there was one, then more appeared and the older ones got worse.<br><br>After 7 years the original is still there, big and fat but not near as gross as yours. I have only a few others, for a couple years it was bad. Most are small now and I can pop them. A few have gotten really big and I still managed to pop them, and a weird bag thing came out.<br><br>I looked it up, they're cysts. Just like normal ones but on your balls. Some are like zits, some need to be cut out. One day I will pop the big one, and it will feel great.<br><br>i also read somewhere that it's supposed to be filled with access semen, idk how true that is cause i have jerked off a lot over the years</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Its cancer, you will die...</br>  <br>Spider Eggs. First time in your life that your dick is fucked.</br>  Those are skin tags. They are simply lumps of fat that gather where skin folds occur. You can go to a dermatologist and pay a fortune if you want to get them burnt off with liquid nitrogen. I have had a few though and all I do is wrap them in thread to cut off the blood supply to them, then hold an ice block on them for a while to numb them. Then I get a pair of nail clippers and I just pop them off. I'm a bit of a tough cunt though, so I can fully understand if you want to wuss out and get someone else to do it.  you need to pop that like a man with balls.  Herpes maybe? Probably Cancer.  <br>lol</br>  Ice had surgery to remove one before. The are called sebaceous cysts. Harmless just annoying. Wash better and don't shave your balls. Mine came from shaving my balls. Hot wash cloth 2x a day will cause it to dissolve back into your body. Takes a while though.  <br>Ingrown hairs on the scrotum easily become cysts</br>  <br>Not a skin tag. Sebaceous cyst.</br>  <br>Absolutely correct</br>  <br><br>This picture is beautiful. It makes me want to shrink down so I can burrow into it and strike white oil.<br><br>Also this: http://www.embarrassingproblems.com<wbr>/problem/lumps-genitals-men</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>i dont know whether im sad or glad theres someone else thats on here as much as i am</br></br>  How do we stop ISIS?  <br>If the WORLD wants to stop ISIS, we need to beat the shit out of USA. They always are looking for new wars, helping these terrorists. This world would be better without USA.</br>  link to vid?  <br>we look at American Ninja, the 80s movie with Michael Dudikoff and compare training sequences and realize that ISIS does not exist beyond a cartoon of FXX and a really hot chick that inherited the powers of the Egyptian Pantheon according to DC comics</br>  https://www.jaishalislam.com/video/<wbr>show/8/28/<br><br>That's ISIS being executed btw.</br></br></wbr>  You can't  <br>Why stop ISIS? They're clearing out all the other filthy sandniggers.</br>  <br>You can't,the only possibility to survive to ISIS is to convert to islam,the religion of peace.Inshallah soon,the coward infidels of the Westeros will fall and the holy army of Khal Al Baghdadi will winrar.Allah Uh Akbar my friends</br>   rape   Isis is actually already under western and israeli control. even if that wasn't true everything they're doing is serving the interests of our leadership.  <br>Westeros<br>Top kek</br></br>  <br>this<br>So much this<br>Isis is a mossad unit<br>Funded by usa</br></br></br></br>  <br>sure m9</br>  <br>even if they are not then they are accidentally only attacking mutual enemies of the Israelis.

Lots of em.  <br>ISIS isn't a rebel group against americans. Theyre hardcore Muslims who kill other Islamic people for not following their (ISIS's) radical beliefs. They are like the WBC of sand niggers.</br>  <br><br>They'll kill anyone who does'nt follow their beleifs. After all, thats what it says to do in the Quran.</br></br>  <br>We don't want to stop them, you do realise they are mostly killing other muslims right?

This Islamic bullshit is what happens when you take a fictional book to seriously and shun actual knowledge.  <br>Indeed</br>  do we kek the hell out of then? so they hit each other until there are none alive    accidental radiation of the middle east  Find out who's funding the cunts and kill em, simples.  <br> implying it has anything to do with religeon and not just powerhungry sacks of shit <br>toppest kek.</br></br>  <br> implying they are not muslim sacks of shit killing in the name of islam <br><br>lel</br></br></br>  <br> I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. <br>Allah is the new Odin</br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=-sU<wbr>WaxAllOo</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=wI3<wbr>XYnc1YVQ</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>TAQIYYA !!!!<br><br>You're that mudslime faggot who ''does nothing wrong'' and yet inside your heart you cheer for isis, but wont say it out loud. untill its the right time.</br></br></br>  <br>I thought the same thing. Seems a little more tame than the shit ISIS does to its prisoners. I don't really like the idea of any sort of mass execution though, I don't see how killing radicalized farmboys from bumfuck Syria or Iraq does anything to solve the real issue.</br>  Actually the solution is quite simple to fix ISIS and terror bobming: whoever is fighting them or has to pick the shit spattered pieces of them take them to the proper burial place, bury the remains with a nice slab of bacon or other pork. This wil prevent them from getting into heaven. Televise every single burial along with their name, pictures and birth dates.<br><br>Real Muslims will stop. Only the shit stains will continue, and you can save the bacon.</br></br>  80 shall rise and fight a vital battle in dabiq , war death famine &amp; pestilence will arrive as foretold in the prophecys , he shall conquer and stand in the ashes as angels halt the iron gates  I read somewhere that the only real way to fight ISIS is to cultivate understanding and logic in our own communities and hope it has an infectious effect on the world. Maybe we can all fight ISIS in our own way without picking up an assault rifle.....  <br>The problem with isis is that it's based on an idea. you can't destroy an idea. Let's say that th US kills every last isis member. As bad as they are, they have family and friends who love them, some of whom would seek revenge.<br>on top of that there will always be religious wackos who want everyone who doesn't think or believe THE. EXACT. WAY. they do, dead.<br>tldr; if we stop isis, something else will replace it.<br><br>Or we could bomb the fuck out of israel, stop giving israel money, and stop arming israel. that way they wont be able to arm and fund isis.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  Implying it has nothing to do with a religion that they base their entire lives around which explicitly tells them to kill unbeleivers and whose primary goal is an Islamic State based entirely upon Islam. </br>  <br>stop sending you troops to fight for them.</br>  <br><br>Thats just trying to explain one verse and even then not very well. The amount of hoops that they have to go through to obfuscate what it clearly says.<br><br>And you could argue that the ISIS interpretation is the true interpretation of the Quran, they sure do, and many others besides.<br><br>This 'moderate' interpretation is just one of many interpretations and is actually not that popular in the wider muslim world. You could do the same with any ideology, good or bad.<br><br>Islam is a bad ideology because it clearly states quite awful things, like cutting off limbs for stealing, stoning adulterers, and even killing unbeleivers. Taking any of this seriously, which is what you are commanded to do under Islam, is dangerous and not in the public good, especially in a western society.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Tell America to stop funding isis  <br>You see that faggot who keep posting that girls crying? Everytime he post it everyone get mad, if we ignore him he will stop shitposting, its the same with ISIS</br>  <br> cultivate understanding and logic <br><br>Nebulous 'feel-good' statements which don't actually mean a lot.<br><br>We've been trying to 'cultivate understanding' between western society and Islam for decades and it simply doesn't work. <br><br>We don't have to spend so much time 'cultivating', 'connecting with' and 'engaging' other communities. The jewish, hindu, buddhist and other communities all get along petty well with western society. <br><br>Islam and Muslim communities are the only ones that seem to need this constant 'engagement', fostering of good relations' and 'culturing of understaning'. <br><br>Maybe its about time we admitted that if we need to spend so much time convincing western Muslims (let alone other muslism) not to kill people, join terror groups and plot terror acts, then there's something fundamentally wrong with Islam itself.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>fuckin rekt m8</br>  <br>when you guys destroy US please spare me I am an innocent bystander oh and my family.</br>  Nananananananananananananananananan<wbr>anan batman</wbr>  <br>... forgot to add CIA</br>  <br>interesting theory</br>  <br>Islam and Muslim communities haven't been receiving constant "engagement" "fostering of good relations" or any of that crap. How is stealing another country's oik "fostering good relations"? You fucking sheep need to open your eyes. ISIS was creates by the USA to create more unrest in the Middle East, which equals at some point the US has to intervene which equals more oil for blood-thirsty 'Murrica. Fucking Americans digust me. Ignorant pieces of shit.</br>  <br><br>Yeah but even 'moderate muslims' will kick up such a fucking shitstorm at that because 'muh Islam'.</br></br>  <br>this</br>  <br>cuz letting child molestors get away with 11 months of jail time is a good ideology.</br>  <br>it's not based on an idea. It has a leadership structure. Destroy the leadership structure with overwhelming force. Use internet datamining to determine the new up-and-comers. Use overwhelming policing tactics on the new up-and-comers and make all of their communications public. Open public discourse.<br><br>Police the remaining "lone wolf/insurgencies"<br><br>It's just hard to do this world wide, especially in non-industrialized regions.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I honestly meant that in a general sense. Perhaps beleiveing in the "contagious effect" is a bit "feel-good" and unrealistic. If you look back through history and see how the western world has waged war in the middle east, both militarily and politically you can see how there is so much mistrust, hopelessness, and violence there. <br><br>I also think that writing off a whole group of people is simply ridiculous, do you think people in the middle east want war and poverty any more than anyone in the western world does?<br><br>They are all just trying to live their lives just as us, they unfortunately have a minority of mislead violent jihadists roving around burning, beheading, and doing other terrible shit. Probably due in a large part to the influences from the western world. ISIS wouldn't have such a hold on the area if we (meaning really anyone) had stepped in and stopped it before it had grown infectious. <br><br>I would say that westerns culture of apathy is as if not more dangerous that their culture of violence.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Regular Muslims shouldn't care. If they don't follow ISIS then they would see it as a justifiable punishment for using their religion for evil reasons. At least that's how I would see it if I was a Muslim</br>  <br><br> Islam and Muslim communities haven't been receiving constant "engagement" "fostering of good relations" or any of that crap. <br>Muslim communities in the west have.<br><br> How is stealing another country's oik "fostering good relations"? <br>That's the fucking jews, and even then, its one tiny country. Muslims have been invading countless african countries and slaughtering innocent civilians for hundereds of years.<br><br>  ISIS was creates by the USA <br>I'll give you partial credit, ISIS was unintentionally created by the USA wen they bum rushed the middle east for no real reason other than 'muh oil $$$' and left a power vacuum that was easy for Islamists like ISIS to fill.<br><br>I'm not disputing that the US government is a warmongering corporatocracy, but that doesn't make Islam or it's adherents any better either.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>What on earth are you even arguing?</br></br>  <br>hm</br>  <br>gonna step here and say that militant pursuit against militant islam will work as long as there is also militant acceptance of moderate/tolerant islamic beliefs.<br><br>I think that the Coexist-style Muslims generally understand that a heavy hand is necessary to deal with the Jihad-style Muslims.</br></br></br>    Anyone hear about those Bullshit attacks planned for July 4th? <br><br>Niggers really believe ISIS exists. <br><br> mfw nobody remembers the "freedom fighters" from the 80s <br> mfw nobody knows US funded the "freedom fighters" when they rioted in the middle east  <br> mfw we were in direct contact with their leader, a mr. Bin Laden <br> Mfw "freedom fighter" changed to "terrorist" after Gulf War  <br><br>Nope. Not falling for it again.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  There is no need to stop isis. Isis Will stop by itself, because there is no political vision.
