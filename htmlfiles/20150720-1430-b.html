[ Medfag, ask me anything. <br><br>Been a doctor in the ER for 10 and and phych for 6 before that, still do psych on the side.</br></br>  where did u find this jpg?  <br>Google.</br>  <br>ok, now please just standby as this thread gets pruned like every other unworthy thread.</br>  <br>Standing by.</br>  Is your job fun?  <br>I love my job. Psych was draining but rewarding; the ER is my favorite though. <br><br>I enjoy the people I work with and its just always interesting.</br></br></br>  how often have you done ECT?  <br>Have you heard of Depersonalisation Disorder?</br>  <br>So you did two residencies?</br>  How do you masturbate.  I have what I could only describe as physical hallucinations when I get too high on anything. I'll feel like my back is vibrating, like my throat is literally on fire or like I'm scratching my face through a plastic bag. Am I a schizo? Or is it the drugs?  Canada or us?  Do you know anything pertaining to the 68W: Combat Medic job for the Army?  <br>I only performed it personally a few times in my residency. Its a really useful tool for patients that are very chronicly psychotic. performing it I would say was the least enjoyable thing. The results can be amazing, but its just sad to actually do it.</br>  how likely is it that someone taking a PDE inhibitor will get priapism?  why would someone experience occasional moments of inexplicable rage? Is this a hormonal thing or some kind of psychological trauma?  <br>What are my chances of getting dry socket? Got my wisdom teeth removed 5 days ago been taking my meds and wash my mouth with antiseptic after every time I smoke weed. Also I started smoking yesterday since I didn't have any swelling or pain at all.</br>  what's the strangest foreign body you've removed and from where?  <br>You're just gay.</br>  if a patient claims that he is Jesus, God, etc., how do you decide whether or not he is delusional or telling the truth?  <br>Yes, I had seen it a lot fairly recently with the surge of bathsalts/k2/those other synthetic drugs. <br><br><br>Yes, I realized that psych was not something I wanted to do forever; emergency medicine was always my second choice. After a few years in psych, I decided to go for it. <br><br><br>US.<br><br><br>i do not.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How much do you get paid</br>  How does one go removing a Sebaceous cyst?  if a patient tells you that one of his medication is "peanut butter balls" what medication is that?  <br>You missed one op.</br>  <br>Doctor, plis diagnose.</br>  <br>Was are treatment options you've seen be successful in treating the symptoms of Depersonalisation? Are there common underlining causes if it becomes chronic?</br>  <br>How much letrozole should I take per day to clear up my gyno? I have the liquid version. 2.5m/1ml</br>  have you ever delivered a breach baby? twins? anencephalic baby?  <br>It of course depends on the DPEI, but with more potent ones, there is strong possibility, usually more minor cases of priapism occur that correct itself in a short time. <br><br><br>Smoking can aggravate it, but if you keep hydrated and keep rinsing, you shouldn't have any issues. <br><br><br>I ask them to preform a miracle. <br><br><br>It depends on a lot of factors. I''d need more info on the occurrences.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  How the fuck do I get rid of exzema?  <br>you medfags, and fire fighters, should be paid more. you save lives. pigs take lives, cut pig pay give more to madfags and firefags. yes.</br>  do you test for BV or do you go by smell?  <br>This. I bet they "just fell on it ".<br>Knew a paramedic once that had a call from a guy that "just rolled over in bed" and lost his wife's vibrator up his ass. Everyone talking really loud in the ambulance while trying not to laugh at the humiliated dude lying there buzzing all the way to the hospital.</br></br>  <br><br>The symbol you have posted in the pic, the commonly used medical symbol. I bet you do not know what it is.<br><br>It's called caduceus. It dates back ancient mystery religions in Egypt.</br></br></br></br>  <br>what u think of obamacare?</br>  browser fucked up on me. gotta back track, give me some time.  how many of your colleagues have committed suicide? gotten divorced? went bankrupt?  how old are you?  <br> I ask them to preform a miracle. <br>Kek. Good answer.<br>What's the worst mistake you've made?</br></br></br>  Aspiring medifag here.<br><br>1. How hard is the actual MCAT?<br><br>2. I started psychology, switched to premed when I realized that the dif between psychiatrist and psychologist is about 100k per year. Now considering hospitalist work as my mother (another medifag) gets insane offers from hospitals across the country. What is a psychiatric rotation like vs admitting physician work?</br></br></br></br>  can you still diagram the Krebs cycle?  <br> get rid of exzema <br>Outgrow it, faggot. Proud 20-year-old survivor (or just move somewhere more sunny, the UV burns away the irritated skin)</br></br>  OP- <br><br>Is Lyme as big of a deal as people make it sound? Are people making up half the symptoms?<br><br>And, do you think weed is actually useful as a medicine for anyhting?</br></br></br></br>  How long for fatty liver to progress to scarring? Have been drinking pretty much daily for going on 7 years. Usually 6-12 beers a day. How screwed am i?  <br>Am 30 btw</br>  <br>Not OP, but have you tried porrige oats? Cut the foot off a stocking , fill it with oats and run the hot waster through them for a bath. Also, you can make a poultice with oats and a little hot water.<br>A friend even cured her dog's eczema with porrige baths.</br></br>  <br>The only really memorable one that doesn't involve insects is a dolls head in a middle age mans anus. he was pretty honest about it, didn't seem too embarrassed, pretty sure it wasn't his first rodeo. He almost needed surgery though, he got it pretty far up. <br><br><br>Have to test for it. its usually obvious though due to the smell, but occasionally, smell is not as obvious.<br><br> <br>Go to a doctor and show him your eczema and he should give you a prescription for a decent topical steroid if its bad enough. Otherwise just use OTC corticosteroid cream. <br><br><br>A few, nothing too weird. our pregnancies usually skip right to L&amp;D if they can at all make it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>*hot water</br>  <br><br>More likely you'll get kidney stones or gout</br></br>  <br>30 yr old but "been in ER 10 yr and psych 6 yrs before that"? do the math...</br>  rank by believability:<br><br>1. Sanjay Gupta<br>2. dr Oz<br>3. dr phil<br>4. dr drew<br>5. dr Andrew Weil</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks...I may try it...</br>  How much do you make a year? and what college did you go to?  <br><br>I used to use E45, which you dilute in bathwater and soak in to reduce irritation.</br></br>  <br>can you ever get rid of hpv completely? asking for ummm a... errrr... friend.</br>  I have to inject myself victoza (liraglutide), 1.2 mg everyday.<br><br>If say, I wanted to kill myself, how much more should I have to inject?<br>Would it be painful?</br></br></br>  <br>claims to be med fag doesn't even use medical symbol</br>  how many times have you been sued? win? lose? settle?  What state do you practice in    how many Joules do you start with on an 11yo of average weight in cardiac arrest?  is psych just a scam?<br><br>I don't believe im sick or have any psych disorder<br><br>ive been prescribed a ton of different medication for depression/anxiety/schizoid/psychos<wbr>is over 9 years. im 23.<br><br>I really believe its just a scheme</br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>it's actually not bait Caduceus doesn't actually represent medicine, Americans are just retarded and get it confused</br>  <br> 629099976 <br>why is an MD/psych on /b/<br>how big a liar are you?<br><br>find just one drug you has a ZERO chance of premature aging via vasoconstriction/hair loss/skin wrinkling, ZERO chance of post selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor sexual dysfunction ZERO chance of causing any OTHER psych "illnesses" etc.<br><br>*sigh* I really hate psychiatry.<br>And I really wonder what a hedonic orgasm is like. I've never had one in my life :( uppers, uppers galore, and ritalin growing up.<br><br>BLECH.<br><br>I hate them.<br><br>how was it rewarding for the ones suffering with fake smiles on their faces?<br><br>and how the fuck do i get a shrink that just won't fuck with my brain at all/won't fuck me up MORE or will at least actually respect me as roughly intellectually equal rather than being a complete snob?<br><br>How do I restore my brain's dopamine function without resorting to three other fucking pills at minimum FOR LIFE? :( I mean seriously... ugh.<br><br>and why the hell am I the only person I know of on earth who can take 30+ MG of fucking YOHIMBINE and barely have a pulse increase, still be sleepy without having a pot of coffee or three in me, and actually end up with shrinkage rather than erection :(<br><br><br>I think medfags need more school seats tbh<br><br>I wish I were capable of medfaggotry. But I can't get teh HIGH grades. can I pass ? Sure. I'd end up with straight Bs in life sciences<br><br>but since med schools only take top performers....<br><br>even though, ironically somewhat, i'd wanna do neuropsych research.<br><br>do you know any research mds in that field btw that would converse with me?<br><br><br>The MCATs got worse. Enjoy and good luck. it's an over 9 hour test now.<br><br><br>FUCK YOU IM NOT EVEN THE MEDFAG AND I HATE YOU FOR THIS <br><br>Actual serious medfag question: How do I get rid of bad orthostatic intolerance (I haven't been able to stand for long periods of time since I was 10-11 and it got worse) without any kind of pill that would worsen my sexual function? or age me, etc?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I like to think so, but I'm bias. <br><br><br>Its bullshit. We needa help the poor, yes, but there are better ways to do it. <br><br><br>Not had any that I personally know kill themselves, quite a few divorces though. <br><br><br>I was working in the ER at this point and I had a depressed patient kill herself after I let her leave. I felt like she would be able to make it a few days to her appt with her normal psych doc and she had a good support system. She killed herself in her bathroom a few hours later by hanging, came back DOA. <br><br><br>Chronic lyme is usually total bullshit. It can trigger an autoimmune response in some people, but its usually able to be corrected. <br><br><br>Progression could be months to years. If you're still drinking, it might be under a year. Liver failure is not pleasant, if you stop now, you might have a chance, I hope you take it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The patient is 30.</br>  Ok I'm 22 years old but my left knee and right shoulder joint hurt like fucking hell maybe 1-2 times a week especially if it's cold???  <br>Arthritis.</br>  if you were to see an elderly psych patient with chronically blue skin what would be the most likely medication to have caused it?  <br>Must admit, I also thought it was bait, but having checked you're right. OPs pic is a Caduceus, but the symbol of medicine is the Rod of Asclepius.<br>Fuck. I just learned something on /b/. Thanks anon.</br></br>  <br>It won't be pleasant. Why do you want to kill yourself?<br><br><br>Psych is not a scam, its just not easy. Brain chemistry is a finicky bitch, trying to correct it is hard, especially with comorbid issues.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Really being this young <br>Any suggestions on who to see gp specialist ect</br></br>  the most likely disease you'd contract from eating raw oysters?  when's the last time you used a tonometer?  what's the first calculation to do if someone has isolated hyponatremia?  what's the ER treatment of oculogyric crisis?  doc, can you check these doubles?  <br>Thanks for skipping me doc</br>  got HPV from a whore and removed the warts via laser. Am i still contagious without any visible warts?  I tried to donate blood but they rejected me due to use of Propecia. why?  <br>I use it occasionally, but problems related to ocular pressure in emergency medicine tends to be obvious. <br><br><br>That wasn't OP; it could be poor diet, it could be arthritis. i'd go talk with your doc, he'll run some tests to rule things out and find the cause.</br></br></br></br>  when my gf licks my sack I get blood in my semen. is that dangerous?
