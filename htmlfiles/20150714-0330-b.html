[ Teacher thread? Teacher thread    <br>Well, thats a flat ass if I ever saw one.<br><br>You could play pool on that thing.</br></br></br>    <br>post better ones then</br>  those shoes do not fit the clothing at all  <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=6M4<wbr>_Ommfvv0</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  is that mechanics? or material resistance?<br><br>not sure how it's named in english...</br></br>  <br>worst shoes ever<br><br>would not bang /10</br></br></br>  Almost got close to fucking one of my teachers.. chubby redhead who was absolutely beautiful. Usually chubby girls are butter faces, but she was so fucking pretty, used to jerk off to her constantly. Kept flirting with her in class, staring at her tits, making sure she knew I was 'mirin. One day she was leaning over the desk to help me with my school work, and I was blatantly staring at her tits, she did a little shimmy move and pulled her shirt down a little further to expose more and then just smiled for a second and went back to talking(I sat in the back corner of the class, close to her desk so i could hopefully see and upskirt one day, never did ;(.. ). needless to say I was rock hard and stared her up and down as she walked away, couldnt look her in the eyes without getting a rager  keep going  I`m fucking a teacher right now. Not my teacher though, I`ve graduated already. Still hot.  <br>pics fgt</br>  more!!!  <br>dont have anymore...<br>others should post their collection</br></br>  <br>Nothing /b/ would admire, shes probably a 5-6/10, OP's teacher is much hotter. But she is short and tiny and that's what I like, and she also enjoys being spanked and submissive, so everything is perfect.</br>  nice ass and figure ... would like to see her naked  <br><br>I really wish I took creep shots of my gender studies professor, she had a 10/10 ass</br></br>  Freshman year English. Just found out she got pregnant and tried to add her on fb. But it was a no go.  <br>dont matter. post it</br>  <br>mickey on tee</br>  <br>You tried to add her.... after you heard about she got pregnant? Oh shit nigger youre doing it backwards</br>  <br>Same anon here.. just remembered a time where one of my teachers (a different one from the previous story) Once sat down on a high chair and wasn't wearing panties, practically showed her pussy to the entire class while crossing her legs. she was a newer teacher, and was probably like 22 or 23. Had a nice rack, would see her nips poking through sometimes during the winter, long curly brown hair, but her as and legs were pretty much perfect.. her pussy was a little hairy, but it looked so fucking tight, needless to say it was one of the best days of my life.</br>  <br> tell us more... <br>any photos of this lady?</br></br>  <br>Is she an engineer?</br>  <br>Well really it was just the news that reminded me she still existed. She was the accidentally flirty type. So goddamn cute up there</br>  <br>Yeah but... AFTER she got pregnant. What, you wanted to be her baby daddy?</br>  I'm a teacher as chance would have it. Ask me anything.  <br>tits or gtfo</br>  <br>How many lads have you fucked?</br>  <br>Yeah, sure.</br>    <br>Statics?</br>  I actually was getting super close to a young teacher assistant in my school. She had a shape like Kim Kardashian kind of but was white and I am guessing jewish. I would flirt with her in class and she would obviously be flirting back (like if I was just sitting there and not doing work, she would bend over to see if she can help but basically suffocate my shoulder with her huge tits and then when she would be done, she would turn around with her butt literally touching the edge of my desk and not move for 5-8 minutes) She had a really nice fat ass. Seriously, a big round Sophie Dee booty (perfect example). But before we could get closer she got transferred. I wasnt there on her last day so I texted my friend to tell her "I will miss her and her big beautiful butt" and he said she told me to add her on facebook. Never got around to it though. I'm probably going to be called a fag for this story but you would understand if you were there.  <br><br>I'm a straight male. I can show you my flat dude tits if you really want though...<br><br>And I haven't fucked any lads.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Horseradish face</br>  <br>Unfortunately no photos. I've looked her up countless times on many forms of social media, can't even find any profiles. <br><br>The only other story I have of her is when I got lunch detention for yelling at someone or some stupid shit and sat in her classroom while she reviewed papers and homework and shit. We talked about stupid shit for awhile, until we got into the topic of my at the time current GF, and she began asking rather odd questions like "Where was your first date?" "What'd you do after the date?" "Ohh, so no reward for your efforts? I'm surprised" and got really flirty with me. Saying things like "Your hair looks really good long, you should keep it that way" "Like the top I have on? I think it shows too much, what do you think?" etc.. really upset at my then beta self for not ramming her on her desk</br></br></br>  <br><br>Dat panty line.</br></br>    <br>how do you never get round to adding her on fb? Do it now you autistic bellpiece</br>  Well, it was years ago and I never actually built up the courage to do it. I am beta fag.  bump  Is it possible to open up a broken 1TB HDD and insert the disk platters into a 250GB HDD and turn it into a working 1TB HDD? If possible, can someone provide me basic directions on how to?  no.  <br>No its not possible. Read it up how they produce non SSD HDD's. You'll need a fucking laboratory for it mate...</br>  <br>ALT-F4 brings up the disk properties menu. Make sure "allow platter expansion" is checked.</br>  kek, are you for real  Fag  You're gunna need to cover it in rice to get the water content out. Rice is a natural dehumidifier.  cancer  <br> fish_and_hook.jpg </br>  <br> non SSD HDD's <br> non solid-state disk hard drive disk's <br><br>what the fuck is that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>put it in microwave for like 5 minutes</br>  <br>Right?</br>  <br><br>OP, it is possible. I work for both microsoft and twitch tech support teams so I know what I'm doing.<br><br>Before you open it up, you need to make sure it's sufficiently discharged. Obviously computer compenents have a lot of electricity going through them all the time, even when they're unplugged so you need to make sure you won't injure yourself, or worse, the hardware.<br><br>The simplest way to do this is to find a non-conductive liquid, such as red wine or vinegar, then submerge the drive in it for about 30 seconds. Dry it off afterwards with a flannel.<br><br>Secondly, you then need to get the disks out. Modern HDDs only have three parts: the housing, the disk and the reading arm. Simply unscrew the top silver part off of the housing, and you should be able to lift the disk right off. Use your fingertips to get rid of any dust. Then, take your second drive and open it up, remove that disk, then replace it with the one you just took out of the 1TB drive.<br><br>Now it's almost ready to run. Since it has been discharged and exposed to air, it needs to be re-energized before it will work. The simplest way of doing this is to place the drive into a microwave and run it on full for around 15 seconds. The radiation in the microwave's energy is on a different frequency to any currents that would damage your disk, meaning your crucial components will be fine. The energons and electrons in the waves will charge and jump start the Xeon particles built into the hard drive's firmware, bringing it back into action. This can also be used to repair corrupted files.<br><br>All that is left to do it put itt back in your PC, plug in your sata and power cables and away you go.<br><br>hope this helps</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kek</br>  <br>Going through all this effort for very weak bait.</br>  <br><br>Everyone but stupid autists knew what he meant.</br></br>  <br>OP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>PLEASE DON'T LISTEN TO THIS ASSHOLE. HE'S TRYING TO GET YOU TO BREAK YOUR DRIVE. YOU NEED TO RECHARGE IT FOR AT LEAST 20 MINUTES OR IT WILL FRY YOUR MOTHERBOARD!<br><br>Sorry for the caps but you need to know. I once blew my whole system up after I changed platters because it didn't charge long enough</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>20 minutes is only for SSDs, he has a normal HHD<br><br>you're right but not in this case</br></br></br></br>  <br>Delete System 32</br>  <br>  The energons and electrons in the waves <br>  Xeon particles <br><br>would destroy my HDD / 10</br></br></br></br>  HDDs get sent to clean rooms to be opened. Even a tiny amount of dust or static electricity in the air can ruin the data stored on the platters. If you open the drive, not only will you end the warranty, you'll just have useless parts. <br><br>And no, picking up some dirty socks and spraying some Febreeze won't make your room clean enough.</br></br>  <br>what if you do it under the shower?</br>  <br>Sorry...

As times go on, and time changes things, people get scared of the new things, and are reminded of how much better it was before the change. <br><br>So don't worry. In 20 years or so, people will be like, AHHH remember back in the early 2000's? Shit was so much simpler back then, thems were the good ol days.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>9/11 ruined everything..</br>  <br>see<br><br><br>It's not about hurr next generation sucks, there literally is zero differentiation from 200x to 20xx.

When shit starts changing, you'll notice all the things you don't have anymore and how much better it was when they were there.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> What the fuck do dipshits born post 2000 have? <br><br>Every device has a built-in camera, no matter what. That's been nice lately.</br></br></br>  <br> No noticeable differences in culture. <br><br>how old are you?</br></br></br>  <br> What the fuck do dipshits born post 2000 have? <br><br>They don't have to buy a new PC every 2 years, since the needs of the software have slowed their increase. Now you can play newly-released games on a 5, 6, 8 year old machine.

As a result, they're childishly enthusiastic about their hobbies (which they've only barely scratched the surface of), find random humor completely hilarious, but also have the prudish, politically-correct mentality that goes with the delusion that they can be normal members of society and accepted by potentially anyone.

That's just sad.</br></br></br></br></br>  look up the story in google, theres loads of stuff about it.    <br>My girlfriend works in Garbage Disposal. true she is not lifting the bins and all that she simply drives the truck. but still shes driving a Garbage truck</br>  <br>Really hope that show is not scripted.</br>    <br>This is so fucking perfect. 10/10 anon</br>    <br><br>the poster makes a good point, don't put yourself in a position as a male to be charged with rape under insane circumstances.<br><br> Oh course it's not rape when two drunk people who are equally drunk both decide to have bad drunk sex. <br><br>but that won't stop a judge from putting you in prison and make you an unemployable sex offender for the rest of your life, so you know, don't have sex with drunk women, and you probably shouldn't have sex with a woman you don't know well enough to reasonably assume she isn't bad-shit crazy. Honestly it's not that hard, I've been very drunk around very drunk women and never had sex with any of them.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Look it up <br> On 4chan <br><br>M8, with this philosophy /pol should have 0 thread since 2005.</br></br></br></br>  <br>While really dumb the message should be taken seriously as this COULD happen even if it's wrong.</br>  <br><br>TITS or GTFO</br></br>  <br><br> poster makes a good point  <br><br>No it doesn't. Women are as much to blame for men for drunken sex. Fucking jew.</br></br></br></br>    Every time someone see a feminist  <br>Was that meant to be "women are as much to blame AS men for drunken sex," or "women are as much to blame for men AS drunken sex."<br><br>Because, honestly, I can see it being true both ways.</br></br></br>    <br>Nice.</br>        <br> someone actually took the time to type that out <br> no one is ever going to read such small font <br>Holy shit MRA's are pathetic. Is there a single person ITT that isnt a fat pathetic neckbeard?</br></br></br>  <br>Go back to reddit, you fucking fruit.</br>        <br><br>you didn't even read the post your criticizing did you?</br></br>  <br><br> this mad  <br><br>Kek, no I'm no MRA. I just love seeing you femnazi's when you're steaming mad :)</br></br></br></br>        <br> implying driving a truck is bad </br>  <br>1. im not mad<br>2. im not female<br>3. im not a feminist<br>4. you are beyond desperate and pathetic</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> both get drunk  <br> both have sex  <br><br> male gets arrested because rape  <br> but nether can consent because both are drunk, but still, rape because its the males fault  <br><br>Looks like you didn't read it either. :) Stay mad</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's like you're not even trying anymore, fruitcake :p</br></br>  <br><br>Why does the article make such a big deal about her being a 'self proclaimed' feminist?<br><br>All feminists are self proclaimed.<br><br>There isnt a test or qualification you need to achieve to become one.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> herlax <br> heedrill <br> sheekachu <br> sheodude </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>incase you never took biology, the male inserts the penis into the vagina, not the other way around. So unless the woman stuck something up the mans butt it cant ever be her fault.</br>  <br>That probably has something to do with your personality...<br><br> You're missing out on good sex. Drunk chicks are wild. </br></br></br>  <br>I actually read that whole thing. worth it</br>  <br>Feminism doesn't destroy capitalism, it actually encourages it. After WWII people discovered that having more women in the workforce was economically sound.<br><br>That's the one reason feminism exists, because the Jewish media wants to push it's agenda and get more money from doubling the size of the Americam workforce.<br><br><br>It doesn't need to be true, because I believe it like a story that's been around for years. The truth behind the human aspect is spot on, and this WILL happen, regardless of your opinion on the subject.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh those kooky teenagers and their colloquialisms.<br> Greentexts after "speaking" <br> Doesnt give a fuck about texas (or america in general) <br> Literally yelling "Hey come check out this stupid faggot on the internet" <br> Friends laughing at you for being such a stuck up fagbait. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> comfortable blue collar jobs </br>  <br>you have got to be kidding me. how much of a fegot can you be?</br>    <br> :p <br>if you dont want people to know how much of a newfag you are i would suggest not using emoticons on 4chan. That has been a faux pas for about 10 years now.</br></br>  <br>rape is defined as penetrative sex m8, look it up.</br>  <br> being this stupid. </br>    <br><br>Oooooohhh</br></br>  <br>r/srs<br><br>Have you guys ever been there? Those people are legitimately delusional.</br></br></br>  <br>Do you jerk off by fucking your hand or by forcibly moving your hand around your penis?</br>      <br> penetrative sex <br>So, all sex is rape according to your definition.</br></br>    <br>I usually massage the base of my penis slowly until im about to cum, but im a trap so i dont exactly fap like normal dudes do. Beating it super fast just doesnt do anything for me</br>  <br>for some strange reason, its called "Assault by insertion" and the rates are just as high as rape, funnily enough, rape by proxy numbers for women are WAAAAY higher than men</br>  <br>I read it, and it's a pretty good list if you ask me. Do you care to elaborate on why you think it's bad, or just act like a salty feminist with sand in their vagina? No? Then shut the fuck up.</br>    <br><br>Oh course it's not rape when two drunk people who are equally drunk both decide to have bad drunk sex<br><br> No it doesn't. Women are as much to blame for men for drunken sex. Fucking jew. <br><br>you didn't even read the post your criticizing did you?<br><br> both get drunk  <br> both have sex  <br><br> male gets arrested because rape  <br> but nether can consent because both are drunk, but still, rape because its the males fault <br><br><br>you can't be this bad a reading comprehension</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Hey, you know what would be really good? <br>If you faggaloons would contribute actual feminazi posts and hate images, instead of arguing among yourselves whos hates them more and who doesnt mad and whos a newfag. Nigga nobody cares.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Seriously what the fuck is with all the sjws here  <br>You're a moron.<br><br><br>You're also a moron. Have you ever met a fucking girl? They're ambivalent and stupid cunts. They can't even be held responsible for the words they say, because it's nothing but hot air. There's no meaning behind a woman's actions.</br></br></br></br>    <br>nope, you should learn to read<br> Rape is a type of sexual assault usually involving sexual intercourse or other forms of sexual penetration perpetrated against a person without that person's consent <br> without consent <br> penetration <br> without consent <br> women are penetrated by the penis not the other way around <br><br>Im not saying i agree with it, im just stating facts. You neckbeards REALLY get triggered easily.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>See:<br><br><br><br>Dumbass.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>*slow clap*</br>    <br>+1</br>  <br>summer</br>  <br>So how did she get pregnant in the first place?</br>  <br> getting triggerd this easily. </br>    <br>The fuck are you even talking about? The poster implies fault with the male even though both individuals intoxicated themselves. That's biased as hell.</br>  Who gives a shit, honestly?<br><br>People were up in arms about that abortion thing a while ago, but honestly - how does it effect any of you?<br><br>If anything you should be glad she didn't allow her genes to pass on.</br></br></br></br>  drawthread  <br>no, go away</br>   tfw waking up for your new job makes you miss Mr. Smiles   <br>SUCK MY DICK NIGGA</br>  I'VE GOT THE JOY, JOY, JOY IN MY HEART  <br>No thanks<br><br><br>no, go away<br><br><br>Jobs are jobs.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I wonder how many request fags here have commissioned drawfags, and learned their real names?<br><br>I've done so with a few.</br></br>  <br>sure are an optimistic cunt</br>  <br>At least a lick...<br>My penis weeps cum tears</br></br>  <br>down in my heart</br>  Taking requests  <br>Suck my balls</br>  <br>Slowpoke grill hulking out plz -.-</br>  <br>can you draw mr skeltal?</br>  <br>Down in my heart.</br>  <br>Have some lesbian time with Alice maybe? might give her piercing and play with her nipples or reverse roles http://havenolimits.deviantart.com/<wbr>gallery/?offset=96</wbr></br>  can you please draw goku shaking hands with pikachu  <br>this dude doing lewd stuff?</br>  <br>why would you want to know someone's real name?<br><br><br>  </br></br></br></br>  <br> asking again in the next thread <br>Why haven't you killed yourself yet, you sad sack of shit?</br></br>  <br> why would you want to know someone's real name? <br>Why not?</br></br>  <br>Oh God I can't stop cumming and farting</br>  Hi Guys~!
