They resuscitated the monkey after the scene was filmed. It lived a long and healthy life afterwards. :)</br>    <br>Totally right ¡¡</br>  <br>Already saved , fuck you<br>kek</br></br>  ISIS says they want to destroy the fucking Sphinx and the Pyramids of Giza - what do you guys think about it, what are the chances of that really to happen ?? and if that happenned would you care? <br><br>what does /b think</br></br>    The aliens wouldn't let them  stop believing jewish propaganda, things are not being destroyed, just sold on the black market, the rest is cast copies and video effects  <br>They're pretty much in downtown Cairo, there's a KFC a few hundred yards from them. If they do, props to them, but unless they get a foothold in Egypt it's not gonna happen, you can't really just suicide bomb the pyramids, it'd be a whole project to dismantle them.</br>  <br>Eagerly waiting them to do that.<br>They'll get ass fucked by the egyptian army.<br>Egypt depends too much on tourism to let that shit happen.</br></br></br>  <br>I am okey with that <br>really i dont care<br>i am egyptian btw</br></br></br>  <br>this</br>  <br>Why are these niggers allowed to chimp out again?<br>I mean, it's just a bunch of wild sandniggers, surely any decent actual army would be able to wipe them off the planet?</br></br>  <br>bro, EXACTLY<br>thats the same question i keep asking myself when i see such info coming up!!!</br></br>  <br>even american army can't wipe out the few caveman in afganistan,isis soldiers are experienced in iraq,afghanistan checenya etc.</br>  <br>They gotta need some big bombs to do that.<br>Things are massive.<br>Also Egypt wouldn't let them.<br><br>Though, how would they react if we started erasing their history?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>As soon as any country's tourist attractions get attacked, they step up their game.<br>Egyptian muslims wouldn't put up with it, ISIS can't change shit there.</br></br>  <br>what is the leading religon in Egypt? isny it Islam actually?</br>  <br>Because:<br>A: Saudi Arabia likes them, also oil<br>B: Muslims in the west might see it as a 'war on islam', and liberals are dead afraid to emotionally hurt muslims.<br>C: The west cannot be bothered by a few muslims running amok. We've seen it already, same old boring story.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>All this is a scam. They are bullshitting us. There's no way this shit can happen. Those fuckers make videos of themselves next to large roads, they have big bases under the open sky, anything like this could be spotted by aircraft or satellite with no effort at all. <br>I'm not sure what all this is about. Call me crazy, but this destruction of ancient artifacts doesn't seem merely circumstancial to me. They're doing this for a reason, and this reason is something different than "'muh Allah".</br></br></br>  <br>Egypt would lose what essentially defines them.<br>Say egypt and everyone thinks of camels and pyramids.<br><br>Egypt is the heritage of a once great empire.<br>They aren't gonna give tht nostalgia out of hand that easily.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah? but islam is a not a terror religion</br>  <br>exactly</br>  <br>Keep telling yourself<br>fat piece of shit<br>your days are numbered</br></br></br>  <br>if they ever make it to egypt and damn have you seen them pyramids? gonna need like hundreds of suicide bombers to blow that shit up!</br>  <br>these guys are more organized, an organized army is more easy to destroy.</br>  <br>OK I haven't really given a shit about isis or them executing a bunch of rando's but if they fuck up the pyramids and/or sphinx, then I will be pissed.</br>  <br> They're doing this for a reason <br>To erase any trace of cultures that isn't theirs.<br><br>What they essentially want to do is a damnatio memoriae.<br>If they succeed, all that will be remembered in the future is Islam.<br>The entire known history of humanity will be 100% islam.<br>Basically the alpha and omega of humanity will be islam.<br>That's the goal of their ruinations.<br><br>Their true goal of everything is to cause the end of the world, and to start the day of judgement.<br>Basically having allah smite all unbelievers and prophecies happening etc.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Keep telling myself...exactly what?<br>Get out of the basement, kid.<br>...and yes, I'm well aware of my days being numbered, not on ISIL's account, though.</br></br></br>  <br>If they do they are gay.</br>  Who care about a few old stones?  <br>yup</br>  <br> cultural heritage <br> few old stones <br><br>Please don't start talking about borders too.</br></br></br></br>  post some isis material  <br> destroy the pyramids  <br><br>LOL yeah, good luck with that one, Muhammad.</br></br></br>  They'd have to get past Indiana Hawass first<br><br>tl;dr They don't stand a fucking chance doing anything in Egypt</br></br>  <br>I actually would care a great deal. Those are things I want to see with my own eyes. It's arthecechual greatness. If they fuck it up I will be seriously pissed off.</br>  The US will let those towel-headed turd burgulars fuck up the Spinxter &amp; Pyramid of Ginzo &amp; all that other archeological Middle east shit so we won't feel too bad when we carpet nuke the whole muzzie magilla  the key retaliation would be to destroy mecca.    Jet fuel can't melt stone blocks  <br>exactly man</br>  Maybe they'll all get cursed by the pharao once they open or damage a pyramid too much.  Mohammed has mummy issues  <br> If they fuck it up I will be seriously pissed off. <br><br>Well guys it looks like now we have a legitimate reason to try and stop Isis. <br><br>We must stop them or else anon will get "seriously pissed off"</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>underrated</br>  <br>Because Israel has our government in its pocket and Syria is more of a threat to Israel than ISIS. The US is allowing ISIS to destabilize Syria, so we can rush in and save it with democracy by exterminating ISIS.</br>  <br><br>What he said. Except the arthecechual part.</br></br>  funny how they tiptoed around Israel without touching it<br><br><br>==FUCKING JEW PROPAGANDA==</br></br></br>  They're not gonna be able t destroy the fucking pyramids egyptian military will fucking GO all on them  <br>The almighty egyptian military that was fucked in the ass by one of the smallest countries in the world in the six day war? OK :^)</br>  <br>But why aren't the sandnigger states doing anything?<br>They have strong militaries.</br></br>  <br>i know its hard to see the world of your fence of prejudice but they probably wont see for much after being bust to pieces by sledge hammers <br>http://www.cnn.com/videos/world/201<wbr>5/02/26/id-wedeman-mosul-isis-destr<wbr>oys-artifacts.cnn</wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>what sandnigger states, the rulers are all in the corporate pockets</br>  <br>that was a show, the statues were brown outside and white in the inside, open your eyes americunt.</br>  Next thing will be <br><br> ISIS vows to destroy Mt.Everast <br>or<br> ISIS declares the Mars rovers haram and plans their destruction <br><br>They're pretty tough killing handfuls of people who don't really want to fight in the first place, but they ain't going up against anyone about their shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They are. Syria is a sandnigger state who's military is fighting ISIS. They're having difficulty because terrorist organizations aren't conventional enemies. <br>It's like playing whack-a-mole where every time you hit one two more pop up.</br></br>  <br>The pyramids are now more tourist bait than anything else.<br>It's funny because ISIS is an Egyptian god name. Those whole group has been pushed and funded by the CIA.<br>If they do destroy something, this might finally push the us military to "act". <br>Meaning more funding for defense, more new terrorist laws, more freedoms taken away.<br>It's all a fucking joke. It's all a lie.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> But why aren't the sandnigger states doing anything? <br>They are either arming up their forces because they're not the same type of muslim as ISIS,<br>or they silently agree and support them behind everyone's back.<br>Rest assured, mst of the sandnigger nations agree with ISIS, so it's not that hard to steamroll them.</br></br></br></br>  <br> kikes that are the best armed, best trained modern western style military in the region/a nuclear power <br> the same as sandniggers with no armored power, no air power, no military training, and small arms <br><br>egypt will out aloha snackbar ISL any day of the week. you're saying a chihuahua can btfo a pitbull because a bigger pitbull won a dog fight versus that pitbull.</br></br></br></br>  <br>your not very smart are you, there are plenty examples anon just open your eyes</br>  <br>  implying borders aren't retarded imaginary boundaries <br>  implying countless civilizations and artifacts haven't been lost to time <br>I'm surprised no one tried to destroy them sooner honestly</br></br></br>  <br>i´thought both of them were allready destroyed so idc</br>  <br>Fuck off sandnigger before I gouge your eyebaals out and fuck your empty eye sockets</br>  <br> implying borders aren't retarded imaginary boundaries <br>They aren't.<br> implying countless civilizations and artifacts haven't been lost to time <br>Because we couldn't get our grubby nostalgic hands on them<br> I'm surprised no one tried to destroy them sooner honestly <br>They have. They failed.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>because it's hard to sell a war of extermination to a bunch of swj fags, even if it's what is 100% necessary to take care of the cancer that is islam</br>  <br> mudslime detected <br>Stop fucking your neighbor's goat you fucking terrorist. You're late for your suicide bombing</br></br>  <br>You sure care a lot about outdated things that have absolutely no relevance to your life. <br>And no, boundaries are retarded, solely exist for positions of power</br></br>  I want it to happen. These guys take action. They will discover the secret chambers and stuff. Our western society was always about "oh no. We musnt touch them. No more searching allowed" and all that boring CUCK SHIT.<br><br>These guys do stuff and don't deny it would be super awesome to watch a pyramid or sphinx explode.<br>Something's happening!!!!!!</br></br></br>  let me make a couple of things clear:<br><br>1. Islam IS the religion of peace (out of billions of followers, a tiny tiny minority commit violent acts).<br><br>2. it is highly possible for isis to destroy Egyptian artifacts (Egypt has done nothing to fight isis - and doesn't have the backing of its Islamic masses TO fight isis). In short, Egypt is TERRIFIED of isis and isis' inherent implications in regards to Egypt's muslim masses.<br><br>3. who CARES about artifacts in the middle east? as far as i'm concerned, the west should stop interfering, and let those arab/kurd/Persian etc. animals destroy each other. the middle east is a cesspool. fuck their culture, their artifacts, fuck everything about the middle east.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think you need to read up on the differences between the IDF and ISIS - even in a conventional war, the israelis dominated egypt. How hard do you think it would be if you were allowed to kill civilians indiscriminately and suicide bomb and attack with chemical weapons too?</br>  <br> implying he would fuck a sandnigger <br><br>Get out sandnigger lover.</br></br></br>  <br> And no, boundaries are retarded, solely exist for positions of power <br> Literally define the sovereignty of a nation. <br> Literally define a country's juridical monopoly. <br> useless <br>Shove that cosmopolitan bullshit deep up your rear, next to your head</br></br></br></br></br>  no one will care until they destroy the freedom tower or another big "awesome" american skyscraper  <br>islam is the religion of war, slimes all follow the same book</br>  <br>It's still too violent for the civilized West.<br>Islam needs a reformation or there will be more crusades by the nations of the cross, and I don't think Islam will survive that.</br></br>  <br> Implying a one world order wouldn't be better than any other form of governing </br>  <br>bump they got nice editing</br>  <br>I wouldn't care in the slightest, it's just another muslim country. also the unrest would kill the tourism industry much like tunisia which is a good thing. we shouldn't be giving money to muslim countries, let the violent animals starve</br>  <br> Islam IS the religion of peace (out of billions of followers, a tiny tiny minority commit violent acts). <br>A tiny minority supported by a disturbingly large percentage of muslims.<br> it is highly possible for isis to destroy Egyptian artifacts <br>False. Egypt will call for help if it must.<br> Egypt has done nothing to fight isis <br>ISIS isn't anywhere near Egypt to be a danger.<br> who CARES about artifacts in the middle east? <br>Those who admire the beauty of these things.<br>Those who like to discover the past, to study how older civilisations lived, and to draw lessons from that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>lol a 3rd crusade. by the "peace-loving Christians" no less. good heavens.<br><br>Christianity is too violent for the west. So is Judaism. Buddhism (look up Buddhism's track record on genocide). And Islam.<br><br>Religion is for idiots. Maybe we need a crusade against religion? Purge the religious masses. Also purge agnostic and atheist extremists, their preaching is annoying.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> comparing israel, the modern first world western military to a bunch of religious extremists that are kinda sort of good at killing the wrong type of muslim... except for the kurds <br><br>isis's capability =/= 1/100th of israel's ability to wage war. <br><br> hurr but isis doesn't follow rules muh gorilla war  <br>and egypt has enough military might to kill them when they crop up, execute the wrong type of muslim who is in isis, etc. You're talking about a regional power that has only been able to take over destabilized regions but keeps getting btfo by iran, syria, the kurds, etc. in major engagements. <br><br>and since Obama has asked for war powers to go back to iraq, ISL is about to get some hot haram freedom poured down their throats</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, an nations are bullshit. Why do you think continents were made? Because the small petty states aren't fully representative. why did the United states succeed? Why did China succeed? Why did Russia succeed? Because it made the boundaries larger. Keep making them larger, you realize that the boundaries only hold us back.<br><br>Cry me a river faggot, the only problems that have ever existed were because individual states argued like children over imaginary boundaries</br></br></br>  <br>reddit.com pls</br>  <br> Implying everyone would gladly agree with that and happily go along with it <br> Implying a global democracy will last longer than a week <br> Implying a global tyranny would last longer than a month. <br>It is bureaucratically impossible to rule the entire world with an iron fist, which is required if you want people to actually follow your orders.</br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw they go under the Sphinx's paw and get eradicated by supernatural forces.  <br> mfw aliens &gt; ISIS <br> ayy lmao </br></br></br>  <br> B: Muslims in the west might see it as a 'war on islam', and liberals are dead afraid to emotionally hurt muslims. <br><br>Because that completely stopped the west from obliterating Iraq a few times and Afghanistan, not to mention Palestine, Libya etc.<br>Do you actually believe the pile of shit that comes out of your own mouth?</br></br></br></br>  It is the religious duty of the civilized world to kill every single ISIS puke (and their sympathizers). We should come up with a catchy name for the crusade to obliterate them. How about, "The Holy Crusade"?  <br>The 'P' in 'Islam' stands for 'Peace'.</br>  <br> Why do you think continents were made? <br>Because we discovered tectonic plates<br> why did the United states succeed? <br>They did not suffer direct damage from 2 devastating world wars.<br> Why did China succeed? <br>It managed to radically change its economy, averting total collapse.<br> Why did Russia succeed? <br>See china.<br><br> Because it made the boundaries larger. <br>Eh no. City states are more efficient, because it's a homogenous area where all interests are in line, so there's less squabble over what to do.<br> Keep making them larger, you realize that the boundaries only hold us back. <br>China has been a total disaster for many centuries thanks to its sheer size.<br>Large countries are a hell to rule, tend to become largely self sustaining, which in return slowly kills all need to improve.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Jihadi pls go</br>  <br>They seem to spend a lot of time attending to their superstitions, and trying to force people to conform to their Bronze Age reality. It's not even remotely possible that these morons will attain even a tiny fraction of their goals. Meanwhile, the fuckers are playing it safe by conquering a godforsaken desert that's not worth defending in the first place, and calling that a victory. They're utterly childish in their world view. Also - Islam is the worst of the Abrahamic religions, which are all shit, total shit. Muhammed was a pedophile.</br>  <br>How's your second year of college treating you, kid? Looking forward to finally being able to drink legally?</br>  <br>implying that im a fag lol</br>  <br>this</br>  <br>Does most of your clothing have either a pot leaf, some reference to Rastafarians/Bob Marley, or Che Guevara on it?</br>  <br>Cities are the bottom of the barrel. We had city states exist for centuries and all it created was bickering. The next evolution for humanity is the removal of all boundaries, just like the Internet and the global trade has done.<br><br>When I say boundaries are imaginary, I mean literally. They change all the time, nations rise and fall, and humanity changes with it. If all the boundaries dropped tomorrow, there would be a lot less bickering and a more united world</br></br></br>  <br> we need to exterminate subspecies of homo sapiens sapiens who are subhuman barbarians and resettle their land with colonists  <br>ftfy</br></br>  <br> just like the Internet and the global trade has done. <br> Because these aren;t bound by any laws at all <br><br> When I say boundaries are imaginary, I mean literally. They change all the time, nations rise and fall, and humanity changes with it. <br>It's not about their position, it's what they mean.<br><br> If all the boundaries dropped tomorrow, there would be a lot less bickering and a more united world <br> Because all laws in the world are exactly the same, because the entire juridical system is the same across the world <br> retards actually believe a world without borders will work <br>Either all hell breaks loose, or everyone will quickly revert to borders.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Hop! <br> kek </br></br>  <br>Implying nothing. You keep saying all kinds of teenage bullshit.</br>  Okay destroying the Sphinx I can see but how does a relatively small faction go about destroying a pyramid made of solid stone?  <br><br>They might be able to fuck up the sphinx but seriously what are they going to do to a pyramid?</br></br>  My prediction is that all this ISIS/ISIL bullshit is just a little show to upset people and make them want to fight, then shift the focus to something that will make the western countries more powerful. Basically the US is saying sorry you guys deal with that shit unless you want to give some shit up.  <br>C4, lots and lots of C4</br>  Allah is great<br>Allah is big<br>Allah has a fucking huge dick</br></br>  <br>jet fuel</br>  <br>jet fuel can't melt sphinx beams</br>  <br>slap a C4 to every single brick and allahu snackbar</br>  <br>Came at me bro<br> i am waiting come on gouge my eyeballs fucking american bitch</br></br>  <br>New world order is already in the works and has been planned for a long time. One world government is not far fetched. Acts like the TPP will remove power from governments and place them in corporations. As governments lose their power, the world will become under a world regime dictated by commodity and trade</br>  <br>Hail hydra...?</br>  My gf's Egyptian family was there a month ago and i was hoping this would happen while they were there. They all came home alive unfortunately  <br> ISIS says they want to destroy the fucking Sphinx and the Pyramids of Giza - what do you guys think about it, <br>pretty cool<br> write history wihtout your slave goverment <br><br>go figure your (childhood) gang could do this</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If it happens, our world shows HOW DISABLED THIS FUCKING WORLD IS, ISIS is a real threat like nazi germany once was, we need to invade Syria to destroy every piece of ISIS, this is why i went to the military, soon we will invade Syria.</br>  <br>I think this anon watches way to much history channel.</br>  <br>someone drone this sandnigger</br>  <br> soon we will invade Syria. <br>soon your head will be their BBQ</br></br>  <br>Lol this nigger</br>    <br>My drones will be faster than their knifes.</br>  As an Atheist and Junior Schoolar I support the idea of destruction.  <br>It would matter immensely to me. Those buildings are an important part of history.</br>  <br>Daaaaang-k memes</br>  <br>ISIS have gone, too far now</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure you don't know what that word means are you 12</br>  <br> My drones <br> My <br>this isn't "call of duty"</br></br></br>  <br>The amount of c4 needed would be almost unfatohomable. You could do some damage, sure. But to bring it down, or 'erase it from history' couldn't be done.</br>    <br>Good riddance....they are just symbols of slavery just like the Confederate flag.</br>    i think isis is just retarded and you either should kill them all right now or accept them being retards in the future too  <br>Alloha snack bar?</br>  <br><br>ISIS arnt doing a gorrila war though, they have a capital, oil fields, supply lines, bases, etc-things you can actually attack</br></br>  <br><br>I hope they do it.<br><br><br>First of all your an idiot if your a western tourist visiting any muslim country now.<br><br>Secondly, with those pyramids, if you look in any other direction you just see a slum. Its not enjoyable. People only visit there to say they have been there.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pls go tumblr</br>    <br>The trade off is isil are killing off swathes of other muslims, everybody in the west is laffing their bollocks off over it but if we take them out to save some egyptian relics we've stopped kebab removal by proxy. Rock and a hard place.</br>  <br>Actually it's still not fully known how either were created, and it might not have been slaves</br>  JEWS-PAGANS ARE PLAYING CHRISTIANS AGAINST MUSLIMS. NOTHING TO SEE HERE  <br>We don't know how the confederate flag was created??? Simple. Some rednecks sewed their knickers together</br>  Starting to think they're the terrorist equivalent of Donald Trump, or North Korea.<br><br>They'll do anything to get people to think they matter.</br></br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br><br>Some of these people have been fighting and living in warzone since they were old enough to shoot a gun<br><br>Hard to imagine in your little suburban world I'm sure</br></br></br></br>  <br> First of all your an idiot if your a western tourist visiting any muslim country now. <br><br>This, westerners should boycott all muslim holiday destinations. It's not worth the risk and it bolsters other countries tourist revenues at muslim expense. Spend money in countries that wont murder us on the beach.</br></br></br>  <br>I meant the pyramids :^)</br>  <br>The biggest part you're forgetting is that 95% of the people in egypt are already islamic, and many of them have no choice but to welcome ISIS on religious beliefs. Not to say egypt isn't doing exactly what you said they'd do. There are reports of large groups of egyptian students being pulled out of class and discovered dead many miles away on the side of the road. The military executes them discreetly as it's convinced that many are ISIS agents, but all it does by doing that is sow terror among its own people.</br>  So the essential problem in fighting ISIS is that they hide among civilians and don't engage in open warfare, right?<br><br>Why don't they just evacuate regions with civilians in them?</br></br>  <br>I was thinking more like drilling into the pyramids and inserting C4 into key structural points, not just setting it on the outside. (idk where that'd be though, I'm no architect). Although I think dynamite would be a more feasible alternative to C4 if we're being realistic.</br>  <br>Because then you displace the civilians and piss absolutely everyone off. The Russians did the same thing in Chechnya and opened up a really big can of worms.</br>  fuck the pyramids they are a monument of slavery  <br>this is bullshit as you have to read the other sura too. And the first thing as example you see in 8:12 that this happens in a dream and is said as in the bible those who dont believe will be punished. <br><br>And as many people say that christians are peacefully look what happens as Mose returns with the ten commandments. He nearly kills off half of his tribe because they worship a golden cow. <br><br>So compare those books, read them fully and UNDERSTAND them as they are.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>sjw</br>  <br>We had that problem with other terrorist groups in the past, but ISIS is almost like a small country, taking over swathes of territory, taxing its citizens, imposing laws... etc. They have a structured military, with uniforms and armored vehicles, they don't really hide among civilians, at least not nearly as much as other groups.</br>  <br> They're doing this for a reason, and this reason is something different than "'muh Allah". <br>This anon <br><br>is absolutely correct, in so far as their mindset goes. Muslims destroying cultural artifacts and historical sites isn't a new thing or fad. They've been doing that shit for decades. <br><br>Islam is the worst.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's the same sort of editing mythbusters has, I swear.</br>  "they all follow the same book" ... not in the same way. the terrorists are more like cult members than moslems  <br> lol a 3rd crusade <br><br> he doesn't know history </br></br></br>  <br>8/10, kek'd</br>  <br> pic <br>I'd love it if Ra came down to Earth with his pyramid ship and wasted the whole ISIS controlled area with a good old mineral powered atomic bomb.</br></br>  <br> bullshit this is totally call of duty</br>  I don't give a fuck so long as it happens somewhere far away from me.  Nope, I wholeheartedly support ISIS. Christianity had their chance, the world is going to shit. Might as well let the goddamn MudSlimes go at it for a bit, who knows, maybe their mentality will survive most of the human race. <br><br>Fuck America.</br></br>  <br>If I recall the pyramids once shown as light as snow and were very smooth. Then the limestone got pried off them, cuz fuck it that shit is expensive and that was the pre-industrial version of stripping copper out of the walls,</br>  <br>Nailed it.</br>  <br>john sakars pls go</br>  <br>Remember when they said they would conquer europe? Has that happened yet?</br>  <br>this picture really made me sad</br>  <br> They've been doing that shit for decades <br><br>HAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHA oh wow anon hold on let me catch my breath....<br><br>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA<br><br>They have been doing this for THOUSANDS of years</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, isis are muslims, all muslims follow the same book.</br>  <br> :^) <br><br>Go back to 9gag you giant ass wrangler</br></br></br>  <br> goat fucker detected </br>  <br>Key structural points.... It's a giant pile of stone<br><br>And plus you don't think the Egyptians or someone else is gonna step in when they see a bunch of people scale the thing and start drilling into it. The scale of the pyramid means that would be logistically impossible</br></br></br>  <br><br>It's a pyramid, there aren't really any. It's already a pile of stones, there's nothing to knock over, nothing to knock down. There isn't even anything inside, it's over 99% pure stone</br></br>  LIGHT THAT SHIT UP MOTHERFUCKERS!!  <br>Why is it their religious duty?<br>Isn't anything religious related to the pyramids already dead?<br>They don't pose a threat to ISIS' beliefs, unlike Christians (and many Muslims).<br><br>Doesn't make sense to me.<br>If they wanted (and they do want, I think) to blow up the Vatican, that makes sense.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Islam IS the religion of peace <br><br>No taqiyya here, no sir</br></br></br>  Make him a meme in the name of 626666666  <br>if 626666666 haru is the cutest meme</br>  Kill yourselves.  <br>No?</br>  ITT: We describe our sex lives with Spongebob quotes<br><br>"It's big and valuable!"</br></br>   big meaty claws   Alone.<br>Alone, alone...
