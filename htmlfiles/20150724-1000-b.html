If you don't like how they draw, ignore them. If you like how they draw, you can ask them to draw more things you like.<br><br>That's literally the purpose of posting an avatar. I don't get why people get this buttblasted over the fact that almost all artists post an example of their work before people can know what to expect of them.<br><br>Hating avatars is retarded, hating shitty people on the other hand is more than justified. The reason why shitty people come back is because they feed off negative attention, so just ignore them.<br><br>Don't be a buttblasted shitposter, hating drawings in a thread for drawings.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Instead of tubavore how about tuba porn? Two tubas getting it on.</br>  <br>oh look it's Ud, Durd and Durrdy<br>the hit television cartoon show where 3 boys suffering from down's syndrome venture out into the world in search for jerr brerrkers ( also known as potatoes )</br></br>  <br>Thirded. Need some more tubavore variety.</br>  <br>run it by me again: how are any of these things the issue</br>  <br>That works too.</br>  <br>there it is, triggered</br>  <br>It's a wasted effort, anon. They just like to complain and argue and it's probably two anons max.</br>  <br>These comics are still relevant after all this time, and they still pretend to not know why anon doesn't accept this shit with open arms.</br>  <br>I know, that's why I'm giving each one of my two cents. It's not skin off my back typing a comment on 4chan.</br>  <br>Two of these guys blowing each other's mouthpieces.</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>I like how they're drawn like Ren and Stimpy</br>  <br>Seconded.<br>Also checked</br></br>  <br> 5 5s <br>In before shit storm.</br></br>  <br>combine the two ideas. have two of them pin the dinosaur down, one makes him blow the tuba while the other one starts feeding him into his bell, swallowing him</br>  <br>Anons get angry because they don't get their way.<br> Skype has not been a topic/important for months <br> Avatarfagging and "circlejerking" does not a damn thing wrong, it's always been like that.  <br>People are free to draw and request what they want here, but anons get salted and spam and act like shit. Other board drawthreads are requests, /b/ is a free for all and people abuse it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>im not triggered, im just curious as to why people think these things are the issue.</br>  <br>A check of a check my good friend.</br>  <br> this is even more "relevant" </br>  <br>HOLY SHIT</br>  <br>Something like pic related</br>  <br>Sadly no one would draw that.</br>    <br>Oh man tubavore fans win again. 5 5's.

Drawthread : no drawing edition  <br>They did when avatarfags showed up.</br>  <br>Look ma I'm taking bait!</br>  <br>only by that get ;-)</br>  <br><br>drawfags are the ones posting avatars. they're not allowed to post avatars anymore so they're stuck with lurking and text posting.</br></br>  <br>Most are biding their time, they go dormant like herpes. <br><br>Even last night there were 3-4 that came in and still thought it a good idea to trade skype addresses and talk about their "main group".</br></br></br>  <br>Anons are just having piss tantrums, come back later tonight anon, just don't respond to the bait.</br>  <br><br>someone had an interesting idea last thread of him getting stuck in the strings of a cello like a spiderweb as a tuba came to swallow him up which was a neat idea</br></br>  <br>So what are you? a toady faggot or an avatar spammer?</br>  <br><br> Not allowed <br><br>the spammer got banned, fuck them.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You got more cats?</br>  <br> drawfags are the one posting avatars <br>ahahaha nope, i am sorry you feel stockholm syndrome with these faggots</br></br>   Creator of Tubavore comic pissed at spammers <br> Tells them to stop <br> Spammers are autistic as fuck <br> Continues <br>How did I know this'll happen?<br><br><br> Not allowed to post Avatars <br> Some, but not all, artists draw their avatar for requests <br> Pin and EHG are the worst offenders <br>kek</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah I do why?</br>  <br>every drawfag who has posted in more than one thread ever on 4chan has had an avatar of some kind for almost a decade. your argument is retarded.</br>  whats an avatarfag, post ref  <br>Real cute, I like it.</br>  <br>QUINTS OF 5'S<br><br>QUINTS OF 5'S<br><br>DING DING DING<br><br>GIVE THIS MAN HIS TUBAS</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ahahaha nigger that was me last night trying to make it seem calm<br><br>the creator stopped using tumblr long ago and nobody knows him nor do the people requesting tubavore know each other<br><br>that said, draw some tubavore</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Here's the bigger picture</br>  <br><br><br/></br></br>  <br><br>Daily reminder that until these comics are no longer contextually accurate representations of draw threads you will have massive blow back.<br><br><br>You know what you need to do to change this place for the better. So do it and you shall enter into a new golden age of draw threads. <br><br>These corrective actions were long overdue and are the simple result of the problems you welcome in with this skype and avatar circlejerkery. <br><br>Stop it, or we stop you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  You guys know if you let the mods know about the tuba spam guy, he'll get ban for rule 10, right?

Flood spamming will get you nowhere. Neither does bumping. (in which I'm actually trying to keep my mouth shut about my PPG request)</br>  <br>it's not bending shit, he's been here every day filling the thread to max wit images of is tuba shit, if that's not spam i don't know what is.</br>  <br>A request is a request.
