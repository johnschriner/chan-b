I'm not going to post the same link to satisfy your retardation. Also, I don't think you're someone else. You're being a retard that's championing a woman for no apparent reason. I get the impression you were confused by the word "keep". It means "continue". You know, like doing something consistently after you've started doing it. You started championing, I told you to continue. Clear enough?</br>  <br><br>I bet she could handle some of the feather/bantamweights, but mousasi fought at 185 and 205, saying she could beat legit guys doesnt mean she has to beat someone like Cain Velasquez or Jon Jones to not be shit.</br></br>  <br>And I still say she couldn't. They may weigh the same, sure, but the muscle composition is different. She can fight someone the exact same height and weight as her, but if they're male, they will almost undoubtedly win. A 130lb chimp would fucking annihilate a 200lb man for the same reason.</br>  <br> one video <br> sparring <br> implying your original response wasn't directed at someone else <br>you can tell by the tone of your post anon.<br><br> There's a video in this very thread of her being manhandled with ease while everyone joke and laughs in the background at her. One video is more than zero videos. But yes, keep championing her, I'm sure she'll let you suck the cum from her vagina if you whiteknight her enough on a Tibetan carpentry symposium. <br> implying you didn't believe i was someone else <br> implying i'm whiteknighting <br> implying i'm doing more than just calling you out <br>still waiting on "videos"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, that is doing pretty well, considering gegard is a top 5 MIDDLEWIGHT MALE she did very well, you probably would understand since you dont know mma or jiujitsu, but for someone with that size and strength discrepency she is doing very well</br>  <br> Still arguing semantics <br> Thinks that it being 'sparring' means she isn't trying <br>Watch the video. She's going for it. He isn't. He wins with ease.<br><br><br>See: </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She definitley would lose in a fight against the vast majority of the mens BW divison, sure. But how does that make her not good? the male body has such a massive mechanical advantage over the female one, she would probably get knocked out.<br><br>But if she managed to get a guy whose ground game wasnt great down she could most likely tap him.<br><br>I've rolled with brown belt woman and she was seriously good and im 6'2" 88kgs, she taps some of the smaller blue belt guys on the regular and she is smaller than rousey.<br><br>I'm starting to realise you just know nothing and this is a pointless exchange</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I never said she wasn't good. I said she couldn't beat "top level guys", that's all.</br>  <br><br>Not impressed by the Judo credentials. I used to work with (no kidding) a female Judo competitor that had been to all the world competitions, etc. She had repeatedly stated that the Judo competition community was very small and everyone knew and had fought everyone else many times. Being the top fighter in an art that has a few dozen top practitioners in a world of almost 7 billion isn't that impressive. Now, show me where she is a greco-roman or boxing champion and I might be impressed because the field of competition is pretty huge.</br></br>   people who think she could beat up any non-professional-fighting male     <br><br>Not the guy you were arguing with, but got to put in my 2 cents.<br><br>You are indeed a fucking idiot. You obviously lack basic reading comprehension and you argue like an American liberal, you lose a point in a spectacular fashion, so you try to move the argument around to make you look like a winner. <br><br>I can tell you're a martial artist because you refuse to be pinned down to the stance you took earlier, ha!<br><br>She can, quite literally be, the top female fighter of any kind in the world. Put her in a ring or on the street with a pound for pound same weight male of even half the skill level and she will lose at least half of the time. Against a male of equal size and skill, she will lose 95%.<br><br>If you can't acknowledge that as fact, you're a delusional moron.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That was my only post in this thread you fuckwit</br>   all of this fucking buttmad retardation <br> no nudes </br>  <br>stole the words right out of my hands</br>  <br>I just want to see her nudes man. Fuck this</br>  All of you SJWs need to go back to tumblr. RR might be able to beat a man at doing laundry or baking cookies, but that's about it.  <br>Dat ass is clearly JRE approved</br>  <br>She had almost no money till after she was champ. You are talking out of your prolapsed nigger loving ass you fucking retarded faggot nigger cum gobbling mongoloid</br>  <br>That is proof that she is amazing. That is a top level MENS MIDDLEWEIGHT YOU FUCKING RETARD<br> Meisha masterace </br></br>  <br>this. except your right everyone else is garbage but its not as much to do with money as it is that she's been doing it her entire life and its only just gotten crazy popular in the last decade. so no other girls have been training for much longer than that. probably by the time anyones caught up to her she'll be retired though I think. I doubt anyones gonna get to her level anytime soon.</br>  <br>Again, not arguing she isn't good. Simply arguing she isn't as good as top level men, which was claimed in this thread. Try to keep up.</br>  <br> which was claimed in this thread <br>ERROR CITATION NEEDED: PLEASE AN HERO IMMEDIETLY</br></br>  Rate me /b/  Dubs decide <br>gogogog</br>  op is a faggot  Tits or GTFO  Not this shit again    "hey, I just want to say this: I am a complete and utter shitposting faggot."  <br>reroll</br>  I'm a degenerate cock bag sharing this conversation with a bunch of plebs while we all decide whether to troll you or get some nudes of your smelly shit cunt  <br>Hey</br>  wow, you seem like such a bitch. gtfo  hey  <br>Roll</br>  Rekt thread  i'll start    anybody ?  <br> Nigger slapping a perfectly normal white male <br> slapped nigger in the face <br> female <br> needs to learn it's place <br> deserved it </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She slapped a black guy you god damned autist</br>    <br>Hes white</br>    <br>She let the kid get hit<br><br>kek</br></br></br>  posting 1/10  <br>Extreme planking.</br>  2/10  <br><br>WTF?

The overall cost is 12 billion dollars.</br>  No. Even putting aside the fiction of cloning a dinosaur in the first place...even if you had one it wouldn't be able to survive.<br><br>The atmosphere contained 30% more oxygen back then than it does today (around 30% vs. 21% today). All of the plants and animals they lived off have died out. They have no immunity to contemporary illnesses. <br><br>They tried cloning a Mammoth from comparably decent quality tissue. They failed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>but if we could recreate dinosaurs wouldn't we also be able to genetically modify them to be able to survive in the new atmosphere?</br>  <br>i'm sure if we can clone dinosaurs, we can genetically alter them to live in our atmosphere.<br><br>Have you seen any of the movies?</br></br></br>  <br>You mean an actuall dinosaur park? Sure, anything is possible with genetics.<br><br>A dinosaur breakout like that, probably not.</br></br></br>  <br><br>The reason they became so big was because of the oxygen saturation. To survive they would have to be smaller.</br></br>  <br>well if a hurricane knocks out the electricity, and some fat asshole locks everyone out from turning anything back on then a break out could possibly happen.</br>  <br>then make them smaller. or make it to where they'll be fine without all that extra oxygen. It's Genetics.</br>  <br> anon visits park <br> "oh it won't be like the movies, there won't be a breakout" <br> 30 mins later, see pic </br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=FBl<wbr>S2Kvxtoc</wbr>  [ ]  <br>6:40<br>ylyl</br></br>  <br>No. Simply because DNA doesn't survive for that long. Mammoths or Sabretooth tigers, sure, we can have those one day if we want. But dinosaurs just have been gone for to long.</br>  <br> hasn't seen the movies <br><br>They filled in the gaps you fuckin mong, go rewatch the first movie</br></br></br>  <br>duh mosquitos<br><br>lrn2science</br></br></br>   tr0ll/10<br>the oldest readable dna we have found is 400 some thousand years old. they weren't aware of this when they made the movie. 65 million year old dna just doesn't exist. plus the mosquito they used in the movie doesn't suck blood. they really made a lot of technical errors. some due to being dumb, and others due to post movie discovery.</br>  <br> scrutinising a summer blockbuster for fake science <br><br>kek<br><br>i just wanna watch dinosaurs eat each other and maybe some mexicans</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>not true. you have to spare no expense.</br>  <br>this be true<br><br>why we priorities cancer research and space travel when we could have dinosaurs is why we suck as a species</br></br></br>  <br>i didn't say it was a bad movie. but it's fantasy, not science fiction.</br>  <br> lrn2science <br>kek, even then it won't survive for 65 million yrs. oldest DNA is what  said. Theoretically, in ideal conditions, DNA could survive for about a million yrs max.</br></br>  <br>What about some sort of dome with alleviated oxygen levels?</br>  No. The half life of DNA is 521 years  <br> fantasy, not science fiction. <br><br>science fiction isn't fantasy?</br></br></br>  <br>They discovered a t rex in Montana that still has soft tissue...</br>  <br>Shouldn't matter. If a portion is intact, you could be able to make usable dna using statistical methods. You'd need a metric shit ton of dna though. But they managed to recreate mammoth dna through a similar method.</br>  <br>That was what we thought</br>  <br> some freaky scientists allready made chickens grow the tail of a velociraptor. <br><br>why not ?</br></br></br>  <br>science fiction is traditionally built upon principles of science fact and the fiction is derived from not yet discovered science. <br><br>example:<br>star trek is science fiction<br>star wars is fantasy... in space.</br></br></br></br></br>  Assuming the technology has been developed, yes and no. Most dinosaurs of comparable size and weight to modern animals may be able to survive, but the larger ones will have serious problems. Principally, there is evidence that gravity was weaker on the prehistoric Earth for reasons not understood. Also the atmosphere was much thicker and had a different composition. The continents were also joined to form one or two supercontinents, allowing the large herbivores to migrate. The orientation of the continents also kept the climate more stable and tropical. So if we could overcome many of these obstacles as well, maybe we could clone some dinos to fuck our shit up  <br>"soft tissue" doesn't mean shit, it's still fossilised dead cells.<br><br>There is no portion of dead DNA, it's not a 'fill in the gaps' type deal, that shit is dead, 100%</br></br></br>  <br>Mammoths where still around after the pyramids were built, dinosaurs are millions of years old; there is no comparison</br>  <br><br>No. DNA breaks down after a certain amount of time, just like a radioactive half life. Unfortunately, all of its bonds are broken down after a million or so years. It'd be like trying to rebuild a car out of atoms of the various materials.</br></br>  All this talk about bringing dinos back but..<br>If we follow the same methods why can't we prevent recent extinct animals from staying extinct</br>  <br>Underrated post</br>  <br>What if one of the thousands of mosquitoes that have bitten you landed on a tree and got covered in tree sap. It becomes undisturbed and fossilizes. 65 million years later a another setient species emerges (or comes here) and recovers your DNA from that fossil inside of the mosquitoes and recreates you in the future 65 million years from now. <br><br>You then populate the earth with yourself as your DNA changed gender and you end up killing everything for sport to find out who you are.</br></br></br>    <br>We can but the question is if we should. For instance we now have enough DNA that we could theoretically de-extinct the mammoth. But the mammoth has been gone for a long time. What effect would it's reintroduction have on the current eco system?</br>  <br>Wel would be able to have a rack of mammoth ribs like Fred Flintstone</br>  <br> best answer <br>using new DNA and trying to go back is another method, but equally impossible</br></br>  what would be the easiest animal to bring back, the Dodo bird?  <br>exactly.<br><br><br>Impact? It's a fucking wooly mammoth.... what impact could it possibly have? Wander around siberia till it dies? Again? Eat some shrubs and if worse comes to worse we wipe them out again.<br><br><br>Now the sabretooth tiger in the wild mating with lions/tigers making some hybrid shit yea.... that's a problem. Wooly Mammoth? Now Alaska can have a circus.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kekd</br>  All these tryhards thinking they understand about genetics and biology. <br><br>No, we cant have dinosaurs<br>No, we cant make dinosaurs smaller<br>No, we cant release mammoths into the wild<br>Yes, it would impact the ecosystem <br><br>Jesus<br>Have you seen what happens when we try to clone a sheep?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Jesus <br>Have you seen what happens when we try to clone a sheep?<br><br>It works successfully and we have our first growable scottish fuck toys?</br></br></br></br>  /b/?  <br> Whats with all the drunks? <br> /b </br></br>  <br>What the fuck is this meant to mean and why do you keep saying it???????</br>  <br>Fuck sake you've already made a thread about this.
