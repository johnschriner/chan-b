I want to do it, but I also want to move away from the "5 kids government check" that all my sisters (except my twin sister) are living. I want to actually do something with my life, but I don't want to waste it...</br></br></br></br>  <br>games designer here, hi<br>its worth it if you have the dedication</br></br>  <br>okay, its official. <br>I hate you. <br>You have an irish accent and in love &gt;&lt; haha</br></br></br>  <br>hahah, how old are you /b/ro?</br>  <br>Feels? I need to feel.<br> 24, single, living alone. <br> Not too close to parents. <br> Parents are still proud of me even though I've accomplished nothing in life. <br> Mom calls me every Saturday. <br> Sometimes I miss the call or just don't answer. <br> Regardless, she always calls. <br> mid August get a call from dad. <br> Mom is in hospital for emergency surgery. <br> Found something bad in her chest. <br> Go to hospital after she gets out. <br> She has a gaping hole in her chest and a vacuum sucking shit out of it. <br> She's in the hospital for more than a month. <br> There was some sort of infection in the bones and muscle in her chest. <br> They removed her sternum and lots of infected tissue. <br> Pulled muscle from shoulders and stomach and stapled. <br> Mom goes home, has lots of rehab to go through. <br> I often think of visiting, but in the end always think "She has dad and the kids...she's fine." <br> Get a card in the mail on my birthday. Pic related. <br> She still calls every Saturday. <br> I try to answer more often. <br> Try to see how she's doing. <br> Decide to go over for New Years. <br> We combine my birthday, Christmas and New Years into one evening. <br> It's alright, kinda awkward but alright. <br> Mom calls for three more Saturdays. <br> Miss/ignore them all. Too busy, don't want to talk, etc... <br> Next Saturday, no call. <br> Think nothing of it at first. <br> Then she calls. <br> Answer. <br> It's not my mom, it's my Aunt. <br> Anon...you need to come over to your dads house... Right now. It's very important. <br> What happened? <br> Mom died. <br> Went back to work and just collapsed. <br> Her aortic valve was infected. <br> It ruptured. <br> She bled out in minutes. <br> Paramedics were way too late to do anything. <br> Can't cry for some reason. <br> Go home, get in bed. <br> Put on Pandora. <br> This starts playing...on a rock station. <br>I've never cried so hard in my life.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=XsT<wbr>jI75uEUQ</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>18, just old enough to be on this site</br>  <br><br>How would I get into it early? Compared to others, I'm pretty much towards the end of my high school education. I have no idea how to start gaining experience, any recommendations? I've done research on the work conditions and such already, and there's a school nearby (that I've had the pleasure to attend a cyber tech week for) that offers a degree.</br></br>  <br>that's not too old. there's still time. a lot of it</br>  <br>What you wanting to be? <br>3d artist?<br>concept artist?<br>coder?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I quit my job 2 months ago and backpacked solo around France for a month, didn't know anyone there but after it I felt pretty good. More confident in myself and "refreshed".</br></br>  <br>Yeah man<br>these thread have made me motivated and ready for life, i was depressed as fuck, but im happy for now!</br></br>  <br><br>I mostly want to get into being a 3d artist, but on the side I want to have a bit of experience with all of them (Want to be able to freelance a wee bit if necessary. I also would love to create my own little pixel game...a labor of love I guess)</br></br>  <br>damn, at the end when i played the song.</br>  <br><br>Beautiful song...</br></br>  <br>I'm happy for you anon, live life man, do it for your /b/ros.</br>  <br>I'm a 3D artist, student, heres my portfolio: coranjonwright () wix () com/homepage<br>You can find my email on there if you wanna talk about a project.</br></br>  <br>yeah! thanks bro</br>  <br><br>...the problem is, I have little experience...I've tried google and such, but there's little results as to get easy beginner practice.<br><br>All I have to go on is experimenting with Blender (Which got on steam recently, thanks Valve!)</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's what I did early last year for 2 months in SEA. Afterwards is when I got this whole shitfeel. A lot of people I met said being able to teach abroad or find work abroad was the best thing to ever happen to them, but idk. Seems so risky.</br>  <br>good luck in life! I'm gonna miss you when this 404's</br>  <br>hey dude, I wanted to tell you about an opportunity that came out and grabbed me at 19, I got pretty lucky.<br><br> I came out of high school with a 1.8 GPA <br> seriously who the fuck even graduates with that shit? <br> thought to myself there's no fucking way any college would take me if I had a major <br> and they wouldn't unless that shit was community college, which wasn't happening <br> so I went out for a year and worked the jobs man <br> Stock boy, bus boy, general store after-hours cleaner (fuck you if you call it a Janitor) <br> if it was a job, I tried it <br> to no avail, I still found myself without meaning or purpose in life <br> I felt empty, and time only felt like it was slowing down <br> felt like I was a ghost walking amongst the living, no one noticed me <br> so I branched out, asked people what do <br> someone says military <br> spend the next four years of my life learning discipline, trades, meeting new people, going new places <br> was like the first breath of air after being underwater <br><br>I'm not trying to sap you into signing your life away, that shit takes time to think about and believe me, I hung on it for months. But it changed me into a person that wish he could've been there for me when I needed help. Hopefully this at least gets you moving in a better direction looking for answers to the questions you need answered.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'll be honest with you instead of giving you a bullshit motivational speech.<br>Lots of games are being released each day, there's a teenie weenie chance that yours will get noticed, if you intend to join a games developer (EA/Ubisoft/Etc) then you probably won't be developing the Latest games unless you believe you have some serious skill, they would most likely make you an assistant and you would have to keep working to get one shot to get your dream job making games.</br></br>  <br>Fuck. Hit my like a train. <br>RIP</br></br>  <br><br>I know that. I don't care if it gets noticed, I just want to put it out there. Success doesn't matter, I just want to do something.<br><br>I understand the competitive nature, but thats why I want to get started now.</br></br></br></br>   be alone for two years smoking weed everyday and playing vidya with friends who live far away <br> know they are not truly friends <br> disappear from most friends who do talk to me all the time <br> so lonely <br> finally find group of friends I really like <br> they are like a family with eachother I want to be like that <br> but I'm an outsider even though they've made me their friend <br> feel like I'm not even there sometimes when I'm with them <br> don't know how to break barrier stopping me from joining them properly <br> finally found decent friends but I'm still so lonely <br> what do? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck blender. <br>Get Maya. <br>Trust me, its worth it.<br>or get it from the docks of pirates</br></br></br></br>  One could say that this is a place for autistic retards, but, you guys i feel like you are the closest thing a brother, am really feeling tonight anons but gtg, have a goodnight  <br>Same bro, this has been a great adventure!<br>hope you two fall deeper in love and grow old together! <br><br>remember: in relationships, it always goes up. And theress never a limit on that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't misunderstand me here, I think you should go for it, take every fucking chance you get, just warning you about the bad sides of it.</br>  <br>many parents wish they never die before their children, but by god I wish to never feel the pain of having them leave me. It's the random thoughts that kill me in the night or whenever they happen, tears and anguish. I'm so sorry anon.</br>  Played immor tall to Mad Word<br> tfw they made it </br>  <br><br>Whats so bad about blender, just out of curiousity.<br><br>I'd rather not pirate things...really guilty conscious.</br></br></br></br>    <br>I'm going to interject here and say, its not a chance of being noticed, its the skills you have.<br><br>you need skills to make a beautiful game and get it out there into social media<br>you learn this!</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I have thought about it. I don't think I have what it takes to do it, and honestly, I don't feel like I would enjoy dedicating my life to something I don't necessarily believe in... (Nothing bad to the armed forces, it's more along the lines of being pretty pacifist, and generally a humanitarian)</br></br>  Why do we do this to ourselves /b/?<br>Why do we seek out sadness?</br>  <br>Press on friend, never give up. Every time shit happens it's harder and harder but never give up. <br>Even with a past in which the dark outnumbers the bright, the day will pass and something new will come tomorrow...<br>Look towards tomorrow.</br></br></br>  <br>seriously dude, you deserve to find someone amazing. its been so good meeting you. I had no idea there were such great people on 4chan. you've made a new friend today anon. <br>&amp;thanks a lot man. we've already talked about getting married&amp;what our kids are going to be called. lel. hope you the best bro.</br></br>  <br>Maya is industry standard.<br>you can animate - code - hell you can make a fucking game in maya. Its worth getting a trail atleast!</br></br>  <br><br>Exactly why I want to start now.<br><br>You need skills, and I want to get as experienced as I can before it's too late. I just don't know where to start.</br></br></br></br>  <br>its a good feeling when you help people and its a good high when you get shit off your chest. <br>whats not to like?</br></br>  <br><br>...looked up the price, holy crap 135$ a month? A bit terrifying. guess I see why it's standard.</br></br>  <br>the games scene wil never fade, just advance. <br>go google "indie game:the movie" and watch that, then go make the next league of legends or some shit. Also email me when you get there and remember me ;)</br></br>   be 22 <br> meet 18 year old girl trough gaming <br> she's perfect, hit it off instantly <br> weeks go by, we play everyday <br> tells me she wants to meet me <br> i buy plane ticket for her to come see me, because she still lived with her parents <br> we have the most amazing week together, playing, smoking, having sex <br> she tells me she didn't know what she was looking for until she found me <br> months go by, relationship working fine , not minding the distance because i have enough money for her to come visit me <br> 6 weeks go by since a visit, she calls me <br> telling me she's been feeling really sick and has been throwing up alot <br> instant panic <br> she books appointment with doctor <br> calls me after, she's pregnant <br>cont?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Jesus christ, is it even normal for dad's to do this?</br>  <br>honestly, yar har ahoy matey!</br>  <br>It's been a nightmare. Let me tell you, ALWAYS answer the calls. Always. Even if you're busy. Even if you just don't want to talk. Do it. Talk. Say "I love you". I'd give up every moment I have ahead of myself for one opportunity to say that.</br>  <br><br>I've actually seen it on Netflix already. Edmund McMillen is a pretty cool guy, big fan of a lot of his games (Isaac was mental...but in a very alluring way....he made a lot of things just to be a dick though. Cursed Skull/Eye.).</br></br>  <br>congratulations man!</br>  <br>I don't even know how often that happens, but that just made me sad</br>  <br>if you join a major development team, remember you got recruited in my thread. okay Thx</br>  <br>MODS</br>  <br>every game has a deeper story, i aim for this im my games, to let out anger or depression, to make the player feel like i do for a while. Its a good feeling knowing you can control people for a few seconds</br>  <br><br>Yessir/Yesmaam *salute*</br></br>  <br>Thanks I do try and I've been doing better recently but I don't know I feel like everything I do is getting me judged by them even if it's not and it just gets me down knowing I'm just "the new guy"</br>  <br>wow you're late to the party aren't you</br>  <br>FUCK</br>  <br><br>And remember me too (The portfolio guy)</br></br>    <br>I miss you already bro.</br>  <br><br>Exactly, whats the point of doing it if you don't practically squeeze your very soul into it.<br><br>Some of the best games ever are because of this. Warcraft was a bunch of nerds going full nerd. League of Legends and Dota were people who had an idea and began, yet again, nerd.<br><br>And then there's the games that tell such a beautiful story you have to just sit for a few minutes (or hours/days).</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Awh man, if you wanna, although replies arent guaranteed you can find my portfolio on this thread and email is on there ^^ just tell me your the LDR guy!</br>  <br>Nigger, to bothered to answer a phone of a probably dying parent, pathetic</br>  <br>with that in mind, go look into stanley parable and tell me what the fuck that guy was on.<br>then tell me so i can have 50 of them</br></br>  <br>wait where is it? can't find it man</br>  <br>In time you'll drop the FNG tag, and they'll know you for who you are. Open up, if they don't like what's inside then they're not really made for you. Never change who you are for other people, and always be on watch for people who want to change you, because they're not the people you're looking for. I'll search until the end of my life for people who will accept me for who I am and enjoy my company because I know I'm worth it. Do you know that you're worth it too?</br>  <br><br><br>New anon chiming in, but the games that make you feel genuinely sad by the credit roll are usually the gems. Strive to create games that leave the player in awe with a bittersweet feeling.<br><br>I'm a huge RPG fan so after finishing a game I invested weeks to months creates this bond I feel depressed breaking by finishing the game.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>coranjonwright () wix () com/homepage</br></br>  <br>will screenshot that for the morning</br>  <br>I'll note that down, i want to make a game about depression and then cut it off feeling like theres more.</br>  <br>I dont follow? <br>why we screenshotting?</br></br>  <br>Easy to make judgment with no background.<br><br>My mom was a drunk throughout most of my teenage years. My dad had anger problems. I took care of myself since I was 14. I grew distant from them and only started trying to get close again in my 20's. It's hard though. When someone betrays you it's hard to let them in. Not only that, I struggle with depression and anxiety. I know I made a mistake by not getting closer to her in the end, believe me.</br></br></br>  <br><br>That group of guys were probably wanting to do something fun and surreal, poking fun at the oddities of the gaming industry, especially the AAA developers.</br></br>  <br>make the depression secretive, like hide it under a more positive scenario and slowly get more twisted as the story goes on. guaranteed mind fuck and tear jerker. (I'm not the other dude. I'm just joining in)</br>  <br>Do you have an idea how'd you like to manifest that? Papa and Yo was a brilliant game that was able manifest domestic abuse into the game with the monster and the final level. It's good to take a indirect approach at heavy topics such as abuse or depression. Do you have an brainstorms or notes you're juggling with?</br>  <br>so I can remember it. bc no doubt I'll forget it hahah</br>  <br>I just hope I can stay around for long enough for that to happen.

Fellow Terrans, I come to you in the wake of recent events to issue a call to reason. Let no human deny the perils of our time. While we battle one another, divided by the petty strife of our common history, the tide of a greater conflict is turning against us, threatening to destroy all that we have accomplished.<br><br>It is time for us as nations, and as individuals to set aside our longstanding feuds and unite. The tides of an unwinnable war are upon us, and we must seek refuge upon higher ground, lest we be swept away by the flood.<br><br>The Confederacy is no more. Whatever semblance of unity and protection it once provided is a phantom… a memory. With our enemies left unchecked, who will you turn to for protection? The devastation wrought by the alien invaders is self-evident.<br><br>We have seen our homes and communities destroyed by the calculated blows of the Protoss. We have seen firsthand our friends and loved ones consumed by the nightmarish Zerg. Uprecedented, and unimaginable though they may be, these are the signs of our times.<br><br>The time has come my fellow Terrans, to rally to a new banner. In unity lies strength. Already many of the dissident factions have joined us. Out of the many we shall forge an indivisible whole, capitulating ONLY to a single throne. And from that throne…<br><br>I… Shall watch over you. From this day forward, let no human make war upon any other human. Let no Terran agency conspire against this new beginning. And let no man consort with alien powers. And to all the enemies of humanity, seek not to bar our way. For we shall win through… No matter the cost.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>hurr durr daymm jeena muh walfare check</br>  <br>Hello. I am from the South. This is a symbol of our heritage. You are attempting to degrade it.</br>  <br>It's been degraded already.</br>  <br> your heritage is losing the war </br>  Georgiafag here, I was never never into the country image, but it's exploded in the last few weeks.<br><br>Due to the recent controversy, I actually see the flag 10 times more often. People that weren't flying it before are doing so now more than ever. There's even a billboard over a tire lube shop saying "keep 'em flyin" and the local produce stand is selling flags in concrete buckets for the back of your truck.<br><br>So good job media, it was slowly fading on it's own but now its in full swing again.</br></br></br></br>  <br> muh hurritage  <br>Yeah, you guys didn't start waving the flag again until about the time the Civil Rights Act was enacted. <br><br>Shut the fuck up and go fuck your sister.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah it's the media's fault, not the inbred hicks flying that flag everywhere.</br>  <br><br> mad leftists <br>You guys have some sort of superiority complex.</br></br></br>  I've got a plan.<br>We round up every single nigger in the South, and we ship 'em all to Boston, Massachusetts. <br>Then you yankee fucks can live with them if you love them so fucking much.</br></br>  <br> spoken like a true jew </br>  <br> not the inbred hicks flying that flag everywhere <br>There was always that small group that did so everyday, but now people that consider themselves even slightly "country" are displaying it like a new trend.<br><br>It will hopefully blow over, there isn't really any heritage attached to the confederate battle flag other than a failure of a nation that tried to sustain itself on dated beliefs.<br><br>At least they aren't flying the Gadsden flag, the one that might have actually meant something.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I think we should let the niggers and hillbillies fight it out and whoever wins can't be bitched at again.  <br> said the kike to the fuhrer </br>  <br>/thread<br>You deal with the shit. I don't understand why you fucking yankees all of the sudden are getting offended by this more than niggers are. There are niggers waving said confederate flag around too so it's obviously not a big deal to them. So shut the fuck up and enjoy your shitty women, your overcrowded cities, and your shitty ass coke.</br></br>  <br> shitty ass coke <br>ma nigguh</br></br>    <br>holy shit, it's like looking into a mirror.<br> who is this faggot? <br><br>inb4google</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You didnt know? heres a webm with sound for ya, that i cant upload here http://89.248.168.196/media/videos/<wbr>57092987.webm</wbr></br></br>  <br>Capn fuckin spaulding</br>  <br>This.
