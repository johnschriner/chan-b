[ Guys, I'm heading to an inpatient mental health facility.<br><br>Fortunately it's a small 20 bed facility, but I'm still nervous as shit. I just feel like everyone is gonna vibe me out or something.<br><br>Anyone have any experiences?</br></br></br></br>  Coffee gays?  I want a lover I don't have to love    Ditto.<br><br>And it's not really as cold as that. He can be sometimes almost tolerable.</br></br>  <br>He's coming over on sunday and we're gonna play games and do the naughty.</br>    that still sounds pretty bad<br><br><br>So what do you want me to solve then</br></br></br>      <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;627256452 <br>We'd probably do bad things to ourselves or other without drugs. Or maybe just be assholes.</br>  <br>I'm super nervous</br>  Of course, I'm mostly exaggerating what antipathy I have toward him. He's actually pretty ok, he's just sometimes insufferably boring.  still sounds real bad to me bruh<br><br><br>meditate<br><br><br>yall gotta learn to get clean</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>It sounds like a pretty chill time, just try to enjoy the company.<br><br>Nah fuck that.</br></br></br>  It's not an ideal friendship, I got to know him in my previous school, he was actually somewhat fun back then, but now he just spends all his time home and listens to the same old music, watches the same old videos and drinks by himself over and over again. It's a friendship mixed with pity.    <br>I'd rather NOT think about it.<br><br><br>I shall. I'm trying to not get my expectations up too high.</br></br></br></br>                man finland is a depressing country<br><br><br>winter's gonna end<br>I'm gonna clean these veins again<br><br><br>that's exactly right<br>meditate, clear your mind of everything</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>          <br>Coffee AND gay?<br><br>Best.

The Americans among us might remember the Coke "classic' debacle quiet some time ago, when the recipe was changed, to high fructose corn syrup. <br>This and Americans in my experience, don't walk anywhere. While it is normal for people elsewhere, to Simple "go for a walk" for particular purpose or goal in mind, but rather something they just 'do'. Americans will always drive everywhere, even if the destination is in view distance.<br>Tldr Amerifats have become accustomed, and addicted, to the sickly sweet taste of High Fructose Corn Syrup</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ignore the bottom 14% of our populace they go under any African country of your choice.
