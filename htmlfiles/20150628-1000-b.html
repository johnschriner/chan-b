I think I would react the same. The life fuck you up, so you go crazy and kill some fuckers for any reason that sound more or less good. <br>Like that tiny left of emotion take a fucking huge proportion because fuck everything.</br></br></br>  <br>it is to me. i know im a bit down to earth, sorry for that</br>  <br>A THOUSAND TIMES THIS<br><br> inb4 "NOT POST-APO" faggots </br></br></br>  <br>Hard to find? Watched it few weeks ago. <br>Like google search torrent thunder dome.</br></br>  <br>I haven't tried very hard but it's not at my finger tips like I would expect it to be.</br>  <br>Why that? <br>I didn't see the time passe when in the movie theater.</br></br>  <br>good shout</br>  <br>To lazy for torrents tho</br>  <br>Just torrent it dude, hell torrent all the Mad Max films but as this guy said<br><br>Not Fury Road</br></br></br>  world war z<br>ayyyyy lmao</br>    <br>Audiobook was tight</br>  <br>They should have kept Mel Gibson for sure.</br>  <br> wants to watch movie <br> cant be bothered to spend about 30 seconds finding a torrent <br><br>how do you survive?</br></br></br></br>  <br> audiobook </br>  the road  <br>Can't disagree. Would have been nice, but Tom Hardy did a great job anyway.</br>  <br>Yall nigs retarded.<br>Where I am Legend at</br></br>  <br><br>Interceptor situation in the film would be like taking back to the futures delorean and giving them a shit teir car then introducing the delorean later only to kill it off within 20 seconds.<br><br>Over the top and felt unnecessary, the previous ones were low budget giving them a more authentic feel.<br><br>Max lack of dialog, under 15 which is normal for a film like this but it felt played upon in this<br><br>That fucking guitarist, fucking seriously.<br><br>The ending is too neat and tidy and yet the story aspect felt sparse at best. Perhaps none of these issues would have been quite as apparent if Fury Road weren’t so similar to Road Warrior to begin with. But Fury Road is, essentially, one long chase scene centered around a heavily armored tanker truck.<br>Road Warrior’s second act is one long chase scene centered around a not-so-heavily armored tanker.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  28 days and 28 weeks later  <br>literally shit movie<br><br>no wonder nobody mentioned it in over 100 posts</br></br></br>  <br>I used to waist my time downloading shit divx files and viruses from limewire. Now it's easier just to stream it for money if I have to.</br>  this  <br><br>Hate to be that guy but the novels ending was better. Look it up, the original ending which was filmed and everything is so much better and maybe for those who don't like it film redeeming.</br></br>  <br>It's not here for a reason faggot.</br>  <br>That book was written for audiobook format.<br>Someone should torrent it</br></br>  <br>Shitty movies. Bad acting.</br>  <br>Fuck yes.</br>  <br>Yeah buddy</br>  <br><br><br><br>Some titties in the first one aswell</br></br></br></br>  <br>The raid sucks. Highly overrated. And the sequel is even worse.</br>  <br>Honestly my only disappointment with that movie is there was no sequel to finish the movie... was very upset at the ending because of that.</br>  DOOMSDAY!!!!  <br>Does this count?</br>  <br/>  You can find Mad Max and Mad Max 2 on Popcorn Time.  <br>thanks anon I'll check it out.</br>  <br>This</br>  <br>Hey does popcorn time not work on chromecast now or what?</br>  <br>no</br>  <br>But not beyond thunderdome</br>  <br><br>The Road</br></br>  <br>WITNESS ME!!!</br>  <br>This to every extent. I loved the book, so the movie was really a spit in my face.</br>  <br>But sting tho</br>  <br>Thunderdome isn't that good, though. It's got the feel of a children's fantasy movie.</br>  if they do the film trilogy like they're planning (heard it might be in 4 parts, wtf) this is gonna be fucking incredible  <br>Yeah, Thunderdome is after they got successful and when wallets enlarge so do egos.</br>  <br>I was a kid when I saw it.
