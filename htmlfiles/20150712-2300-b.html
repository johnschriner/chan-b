Turn back.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Suoh, if you want to sue Adachi for all of his money for attempt to murder, I can manage it.<br>I'll take 40% of the winnings.</br></br>  <br>Request denied!<br><br>What can you give me that wouldn't be disgusting or disappointing?</br></br></br>  Peaceful days are over-- <br>ARENA EVENT!</br>  <br>I really wish you wouldn't. It's not becoming of a student of Hope's Peak Academy, but I bet you won't fucking listen anyway, so what's the point?<br><br>I'm not desperate. I actually GET the things I want~</br></br></br>  <br>You just love to kick me while I'm down, Don't you?</br>  <br>It was just a question anon, u don't need to get platinum mad cause ur not getting attention</br>  <br> what game universe are we talking about here, because 99.9% of warlocks have stupid range compared to any blood mages <br> same shit for spellset </br></br>  <br>We're betting to the extreme, right? I will never be lewd in any way towards you again. Sound good?</br>  <br>A doormat certainly has it's uses!</br>  *sigh*<br>I suppose Miss Enoshima does not wish to realize how pathetic she is.<br>You have me, Mom.<br>I'll even put on the wig, if it makes you feel better.</br></br></br>  Well, this is depressing.<br> F </br>  <br>Heh, Yeah probably! Kinda like how you tell me not to do my hair like this but I still do to annoy you~</br>  <br><br>monkeys !</br></br>  <br>Implying this is about attention. That's the thing about you circlejerkfags you're so starved for attention you make it thr center of all your arguements.</br>  <br>Thats why I'm here!</br>  <br> Sneaks up and hugs from behind <br>Junko-Sama!</br></br>  <br>What the hell...?</br>  <br>Trappy says she doesn't care about Ta yet continues to lurk on her problems. Obsessed much meng?</br>  In the news today...oh, wait, there is none.<br><br><br>Hello frog.</br></br></br>  <br>Do what you said about the book</br>  <br>T-the.. wig?<br>Oh Jordan, you always know how to cheer me up!</br></br>  <br>What a coincidence, so do I! For instance, I get to go with Koneko to the prom! I also have a fridge full of Dr.Pepper, but how I got that was unethical.</br>  <br>That sounds very good...you are not that dumb after all. You can put "without permission" there.<br><br>I am sorry. It just feels too good.</br></br></br>  <br>U mad bro?</br>  <br>((I've been at Perkins for the past four hours, doing research. My table is a mess, and it's starting to rain outside. I should probably go. Later, all!<br><br>And thanks for hosting!))</br></br></br>  <br>Dang it charlie, you had that one! I'm gonna have to call in big brother, won't I.</br>  <br>You got nothing to say bro?</br>  <br>That was a joke. Not even I am that evil...</br>  <br>On Ta, yes. She's a fucking bitch.<br>I don't have a grudge against Estellise though, I'm just dissappointed in who she really is.<br><br><br>I don't "lurk on her problems". I even have her filtered so I don't have to read her shit posts. However, this comment was posted by an anon and it got my interested now.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A-Are you turning into Junko or something?</br>  <br>I was just assuming D&amp;D. Can't think of any other type of game format where both warlocks and Blood Mages are involved and both are balanced.<br><br>Of course, one class rules over the other where one of them have OP spells/range, but in a balanced setting, Blood Mages shit all over Warlocks 9 out of 10 times.</br></br></br>  <br>You're the best, Angel-chan...<br><br><br>Huh? You enjoy it sometimes...? Well in any case, you've got a deal!</br></br></br></br>  AND THEN, THE FEAST!...<br>Nui doesn't seem too happy about the last event</br>  <br> sigh <br>Hello, Eruka-chan...<br><br>Sorry, I'm kinda tired... but thanks...<br><br>I don't care...</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Have I told you that I love you?</br>  <br>Thats no fun...</br>  <br>Hello visor mutt.</br>  <br> I'm just dissappointed in who she really is. <br>I feel like I've missed a lot.</br></br>  <br>Who are you anyways?</br>  <br>Tired eh? Would you like a froggy teddy bear to snuggle with?</br>  <br>that is overly adorable...<br>why do i have a bad feeling horrific shit happens to her at some point doesnt it<br><br>come now, were all magic users! none of us r those bloody technomancers<br><br><br>theres more to magic then just d&amp;d and often or not blood mages are very powerful, but only when theres blood.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't ever wanna see a planet masturbate again!<br>Eugh!</br></br>  <br>If you say so bro. Ur too emotionally involved. U and Ta. U will probably add ur two cents in that thread as well cause ur obsessed</br>  <br> tfw Junko doesn't care about your achievements <br><br>I'll just go back to being invisible until that feeling stops hurting...</br></br></br>  <br>I'll miss you, Dr Pepper.</br>  <br> ta-class </br>  <br>No, but things can get boring around here so I have to find new ways of amusement.<br><br>So the bet is set. Whoever surives longer the next round will win the bet. It is that simple.<br>This time try to survive first day...</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is there... something wrong?</br>  <br><br>what...?</br></br>  <br>I know that feeling, good sir...</br>  <br>(Don't start i haven't slept and not in the mood for this shit</br>  <br>Even if that statement doesn't make sense, yes...<br><br>C'mere...<br><br>It's going to hurt worse when I forbid her from going to the prom with you... If that wasn't another lie...</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I miss nobody here and I never will.</br>  <br>Ha. If you win again, I guess that you REALLY are the 'Ultimate Gambler'. Alright, good luck.</br>  <br>Doormat and retired knight have some bad blood</br>  <br>I've got a pretty good way of amusement...If you wanna try it that is?</br>  <br>Alright then.<br>Take yourself to prom.</br></br>  <br>All yours!</br>  <br> balanced setting <br>So like you said, if a blood mage gets ambushed? A good think warlocks ten to be quite intelligent.</br></br>  <br>Jus sayin dude</br>   3 cannon shots <br> Popura <br> Nui  <br> Tamaki Suoh <br><br>In other news, things get slightly awkward.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You're forgetting someone...</br></br>  <br>no, why?<br><br><br>Don't worry, I didn't tell anyone either.<br>Just know that I have friendzoned her, and after that I found out some stuff, so then I didn't even want to be her friend anymore. <br><br><br>Yes, I will gladly rub it in Ta's face.<br>Yesterday she said that she enjoys watching people break up and wants to enjoy the show. Isn't it funny how just a few hours later she's the one breaking up and raging?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Being hounded constantly by idiots isn't a lot of fun...<br><br>But I'm okay. I'm just tired more than I should be and I don't know why...</br></br></br>  <br>It's the only feeling that Dr.Pepper can't make better...<br><br>Ohh, you'd actually forbid her from going with me? You sure do hate Toujou-san, don't you?</br></br></br>  <br>Good luck to you also. You will need it.<br><br>You really want Junko to castrate you or something?</br></br></br>  <br>Ugh, dont even speak of technomancers, filthy heretic scum that they are.</br>  <br>Do you need a coffee or something?</br>  <br><br>Ahahah, I see my jokes still haven't improved at all since I've been on last! Y-you do know that was a joke, right?</br></br>  <br>Who am I? I'm peacock! Ain't that obvious?</br>  <br>Damn, that's like getting to know someone twice and not telling them you're the same person.</br>  <br>N-No I-I don't. I-I like my bits as they are thank you...</br>  <br>I'll... leave you alone...</br>  <br>Oh yea Adachi did say that he loved you in a gay way a while back.</br>  Sena gets some sweet, sweet revenge and Josuke gets one of my silly events.  <br>I see.. What kind of rules and conditions should we learn of? Do they depend on each individual ritual, or on all rituals in general?..</br>  Bad Uranus! Baaad..  <br> a good thing they are quite intelligent <br> fucks up tend </br></br>  <br>W-wait... You're taking her to prom?</br>  Well met, mortal beings.  <br> in a gay way <br>pls no</br></br>  <br>You won't miss me because I'm right here! Right, right!?</br>  <br>uranus deserves that</br>  <br>nah, worse and different.</br>    <br>Well it doesn't really matter if Ta was the one doing the breaking up. It's what she wanted so I don't get where ur upper hand is besides starting shit.</br>  <br>I see it a little different, after all you just can't stop this weed dealing thing...</br>   RIP Uranus   <br>Hello, Uranus. A present from your neighbor, Neptune!</br>  <br>individually<br><br><br> actually implying im mortal <br>theres only one person i know who will ever defeat me, and ive got a long while before then...</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, I'm just going to snuggle this frog<br> for a bit... but thanks.<br><br>You're one of the few I do want around me, come here...<br><br>Just shut up already.<br><br>You really want to go with him...?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Please yes.</br>  <br>Taking you to prom? Yeah, that was the deal.<br><br>Who're you again?</br></br></br>  <br>I can use a can. Share some with me, I enjoy commoner's food and beverage.</br>  <br> Southern War Princess </br>  <br>...Yeah.</br>  <br> finn </br>  <br>Correct. Blood Mages are more practical and does a lot of improv-spells on the spot, while Warlocks are more planning and deceitful from a RP stand-point.<br><br>Of course, this all boils down to how strong the two parties are, who's hunting who, and how prepared the two individuals are.<br><br>Though more often than not, Blood mages tend to win, but that's not to say Warlocks can also win with precise planning and if they really catch the Blood mage off-guard. Then they're no match for a Warlock. <br> Neat discussion btw. Thanks. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  And then we're down to two! WHO SHALL WIN!?  <br> RIP Uranus </br>  <br>I'll gladly start shit with her.</br>  <br>Everyone..nay, everything can be defeated, everything can perish and then they too will face the scales for their final judgment.

Also edgy</br></br>        <br>What a edge/cringe</br>  <br>edgy mcedgylord</br>    Ok guys, i wanna discuss with you of the excessive use of term edgy. Why do you call edgy people who find killers cool? Cuz we all agree that these two in OP's pic are little faggots, but there are pretty cool killers out there, cold, silent, you know, KILLERS. Why is it edgy to find killers cool? Especially when most our media is about killing and murder. So try and stop being normies, and call everybody edgy just because they are less narrow minded than you.<br> pic related it's a cool killer </br>    <br>3edgy564me</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>LE EDGY MEME, never gets old</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I see.

Why would you find a media character like dexter or hannibal cool, and find edgy people who praise actual people who actually did things instead of being invented?</br>  <br>Heil Putin</br>    <br>I'll bite<br> implying that i like dexter or hannibal </br></br>    <br> QQ overuse of edgy <br> posts something edgy <br><br>fucking newfags</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well. It's your call then, some people like baseball and others like tennis, but who cares.<br>My problem is these people that find media killers badass, and they think it is edgy to like real killers, where's the logic in that? Can't they handle real life?</br></br>  <br> has no argument <br><br>idiot</br></br></br>    hey guys  he is my hero as he stands against the rising threat of islam, multiculturalism and globalisation<br><br>he is proud of who he is and where he comes from as we all should be and we defend it despite being labelled a criminal</br></br>  You erection you lose  <br>ayyyy lmao</br>  <br>Also this.</br>  <br>And we all know that Kat has a penis.</br>  Do you honestly believe in the "Big Bang"?
