LOL there are no nukes with a blast radius that large.  All three on africa. Too many monkeys already  <br>We can dream</br>  <br> should have drown <br>Learn English, you're worse than a nigger.</br></br>  <br>Water levels would actually go down if you melted icebergs etc, the way to do it would be melting ice on land, which would then flow into the ocean eventually.</br>    <br>Is this nigga serious?</br>  why do people want to bomb africa, I know it's full of nigger, but it's just poor nigger that don't do shit, I prefer bombing the imperialist countrys, and those who interfer with the economics and politics of others  <br>Ice is less dense than water, do you even science?</br>  <br>Ha! Mah nigga</br>  <br>HAHAHAa<br>God you're retarded<br> What are elevations </br></br></br>  <br>Wow, you such with Paint. <br><br>Anyways I assume you dropped the nukes there to prevent hurting people, yeah?</br></br></br>  <br>Is this nigga serious??</br>  <br>Stop saying mah nigga</br>  <br>Middle East.<br>Mexico<br>Columbia</br></br></br>  <br>Get a glass of water, put some ice cubes in it and let it melt and you'll see the water level decrease.</br>  <br>America didn't save anyone in Europe, the Soviet Union did the heavy lifting in Europe. Learn 2 history nig</br>  <br>You could get more people if you adjust the one over Africa to the east a little</br>  <br> confirmed troll  <br>never mind friend, keep up the good work.</br></br>  <br>this</br>  <br><br>finally someone has the right idea</br></br>      <br> water expands when it freezes so when the ice melts the volume in the cup is smaller</br>  <br>You entirely missed China, TAIWAN #1!!!!!!</br>  <br>I've been wondering what the degree of SJWness of Europe is. Do you have some sources to point me towards on this matter?<br><br><br>I'm not sure which Americans you're referring to but I'm sure we people who say this are taking about very different demographics</br></br></br></br>  <br>Please say this is bait, if it isn't i dispair</br>    <br>Everyone knows that retard. <br>but ELEVATION hmmmmmmm</br></br>  kind of cheated, but I really needed a few more  <br>he's right though</br>  <br>Why would you nuke Mongolia and the irrelevant part of Russia?</br>  <br>The USSR saved Europe from the Nazis, the USA saved Europe from the USSR</br>  <br>I'm not entirely sure about this, but as Antarctica sits upon a lot of rock and doesn't float (therefore not displacing water in the first place), wouldn't the water levels increase anyway if we nuked it?</br>  all three in Africa      doing it right this time  <br>yep, this isn't that hard</br>  <br>Fuck u musk</br>  <br>I said that earlier, only ice in the water will cause water levels to decrease, ice caps melting will cause an increase.</br>  <br>If only this logic were valid. And if it is, it would be applied to Europeans decending from Africans and then humans would realize they should care about all other humans (and stop stepping all over others) and we'd love in a much better world.</br>  Do you people seriously think Indians are better than niggers? I'd much rather nuke India and Pakistan than Africa  <br>The asses you betrayed.</br>  <br>Israel? Fuck off kike</br>  <br>maybe a fourth nuke for the philippenes would be nice to get rid of some millions more muslims but i think those 3 i placed are already ok</br>  <br>Most coherent post 2015 award</br>  <br>No Korea best Korea</br>  <br>This. Is built Europe, America and China</br>    If you have ice in your drink and it melts, does the glass overflow?  <br>No you wouldn't. When an ice cube is floating in water, the total mass of the ice cube is equal to the total mass that the water would have if it were occupying the space taken up by the submerged portion of the ice cube - this is needed in order for the buoyancy force on the ice cube to equal its weight. The ice is of lower density, yes, so this is why an ice cube floats, with some portion above the water.<br><br>If the ice cube melts, then, the resulting water will take up the same volume as the portion of the ice cube that was underwater before it melts. Hence, the water level will not rise or fall - it will stay the same.</br></br></br>  <br>dont mind me, just saving your sanity....</br>      <br>No, it doesn't, but your moms vagina does.</br>  As an Aussie, I feel proud that no one wants to wipe us off the map. I mean, why would they?  "i would just boof all three into my infinitely vast rectum"<br>- OP</br>  <br>Threaten some nations for money or some shit</br>    <br>Roaches are immune to radiation</br>  <br><br><br>This can all be solved by recalling that ice is expanded water. If you have a certain mass amount of water and it freezes and expands you have the same amount of mass taking up more space, that by definition is less dense because its the same mass taking up more volume</br></br></br>  <br>underrated post</br>  <br>our hero</br>  <br>myth<br><br>if it has cells it will be affected</br></br></br>  <br> same amount of mass taking up more space <br>Not if we are referring to sea level anon</br></br>  <br>we'll just chuck some stingrays your way</br>  <br>except that the ice if *floating* in the water. As ice, it will take up more volume total, but this doesn't necessarily affect the *water level* - the height of the water. The volume of a floating ice cube submerged in water is equal to the volume occupied by the ice cube if it melts. Therefore, when the ice melts, you'll lose the bit of ice hovering above the water, but the water level will not change.</br>  <br>No. Just because the Russians lost so many men means nothing, it just means they use their overwheling numbers because they are "disposable". <br><br>Also second, third and fourth front. Go read a History book.</br></br></br>  <br>cockroach cells are immune because it has armor</br>  <br>this</br>  <br>That's what's up.

Except that was done by American air power you nutless monkey. Go eat some cheese and surrender to Islam frenchie</br>  <br><br>this</br></br>  <br>Who said anything about numbers champ<br>Russia did way more work than any other country in Europe. That's just how it happened.</br></br>  <br><br>This is fascinating. Look at all the virtually uninhabited parts of the world.</br></br>  <br>It was really all saudi arabia. get your heads out of your propaganda.</br>  <br>Taiwan seems less shitty than China though, it'd be a shame to waste a whole nuke to hit Taiwan and miss Europe or America. I would take the china nuke and eliminate as many Chinese as possible.<br><br>I'm an Amerifag btw</br></br></br>  <br><br>Europig. Kill yourself.

Of course the image actually means the red circle is the size of the explosion, not the size of the bomb. The text is still wrong however.</br>  <br>yea, and we saved the USSR. They would have starved to death without us.</br>  <br>although this isn't true bc America did a lot on the western front so Russia didn't have to spread to thin, America was also busy fighting the japs who never would have surrendered if not for our bomb.<br><br>Also<br><br>Mfw Europe would all be Russia if not for America keeping them at bay during the cold war<br><br>You think Russia would have stopped at Germany lol?<br><br>Faggot</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yep that's mine</br>    <br>rip polynesia</br>  <br>the beehive and the retard kid with the stick</br>  <br> muh bomb <br>except japan was already going to offer surrender before the bomb, which was done largely as a "proof of concept"</br></br>  <br>.... so?</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Autism europigs detected.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tf brah?

Let's go then!<br><br>Start with unpacking your post</br></br></br>  <br>lol can't argue that but Russia would still be a brutal Communist regime most likely.</br>  Save 'em for a comet that's on a collision course with earth.  <br>so where can i join isis ?</br>  <br><br>Stop saying Stop saying mah nigga</br></br>  <br>The only interpretation that makes sense is that the explosion is that size. Assuming the other way males for all sorts of nonsense and non conversation. So might as well skip any interpretation that's not exploshun size.<br><br>I agree though, the OP is poorly worded.</br></br></br>  <br>the whole "they were going to fight to the death" meme is not true though. Some leaders wanted to fight, which caused conflict over attempts at surrender, true, but by and large Japan was not going to continue the war for very long.</br>  One in the South Pole, one in the north, and one around the equator.<br><br>Then kick back and let the resulting clouds of dust and radiation slowly kill every nation on earth while I fill up my buried school bus with beautiful women to breed with and cans of beans n shit to eat.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>none of you got that</br></br></br></br>  <br>Im trying hard to miss Russia</br>  <br>Well explain it then</br>  <br>I was tempted to put them all on one site<br> the only way to be sure </br></br>  <br><br>autism, no. die.</br></br>  <br>Europig, no. die.</br>  <br>There would def be a large faction of the military who would. Eventually yeah the majority would give in but not until an invasion. The point is the USA was fighting on two difficult fronts and completely discounting their efforts in Europe is wrong. Russia would have struggled to take Germany on alone over such a vast area. And Russia would have continued if they did, and took over what they could.<br><br>I live in the USA and I'm not a hardcore patriot or anything, I think this nation used to be great and now is fucked with alot of fucking idiots walking around, but the American military might can't be denied. Mostly due to the fact we spend 600 billion on it</br></br></br>  nuke the whales  <br>are from Japan ?</br>  <br>Finally someone w some fucking sense</br>  <br>i love you anon</br>  <br><br>you're thinking Indonesia with the largest muslim population on the planet. You get a participation ribbon though! Good Job!!</br></br>  <br>Lesser of two evils.</br>  <br>Explain it to me. <br><br>If your talking about my post being contentless, its content waswnt to hurt the feelings of the niggs who posted that crap. I suspect I know exactly the type who posted the "coherent post" so, watch out fsggot I know exactly how to rip your dick out your ass</br></br></br>  Massive ice melting, everybody dies  <br>Peace in the world :O</br>  <br>What the fuck are you on about kek</br>  India, center África and Brasil.    North korea <br>West US<br>Middle East</br></br>  <br>Fishing with dad</br>  <br>If you want to join isis you do t need their permission. Just look at their agenda and start doing what they would do if they were in your position. Imagine being able to have an isis member take over your mind and they'd be you. They could instantly infiltrate hour country that way. What would tehy do? Cause maximum damage I'm sure.</br>  <br>kek</br>  <br>I would also connect the north korea nuke with a bit of china</br>  <br>America is a fucking joke. Grow a brain fucktard and Kill yourself. Your country has the stupidest people on earth. Hope 9/11 happens again</br>    <br>Wait, shit, you know hes right.</br>  <br> No muslims <br> No more niggers <br> No USA stealing oil <br><br><br>World peace reached. 10/10</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>American faggot. Grow a brain</br>  <br>winrar</br>  <br>The asses without which your country wouldn't exist :^)</br>  <br> nuking something that is essentially one giant nuclear explosion <br><br>nigga what?</br></br></br>  Everyone who's nuking the icecaps needs to remember something...<br><br>You aren't going to turn Ice into Water... you're going to turn Ice into Water-Vapor.<br><br>You're not going to raise the sea level, you're going to make the Ozone a little more Oxygen, Hydrogen and Radiation rich than it was befre.</br></br></br></br>  <br> grow a brain <br>That uh, that's not possible</br></br>  <br>I agree with you</br>  <br>When you grow up and read a little history from the Russian side you'll understand why their Communist empire was terrible for the citizenry, But dont worry about it for now, I don't except a 14 year old to get it</br>  <br> be a parent-type figure <br> give birth to a child-type thing <br> proceed to die some time after <br> child-type thing ceases to exist <br><br>Anon's logic.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> Be a lazy slob <br> War happens <br> Another dude beats up the enemy, and leaves <br> Kick the enemy in the side while he's already done and claim you did it all <br>American logic</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>not how nukes work. Nukes are design to explode outwards, by detonation before impact. It would leave an ash ridden ground underneath but would actually form any kind of significant crater.</br>  There's another right answer?  <br>Lol, didn't think of this but I am surprised it took this long. (Kek, long)<br><br><br>I highly doubt the vaporized ice wouldn't saturate the atmosphere and not come down. But then again, when a meteor got the earth it didn't fully make sense but debris stayed in the atmosphere as long as it did to kew aw da dinosos eeder</br></br></br></br>    <br>I call it "The Wall"</br>    <br>Allies that helped the allies win ww2 less than America<br>- none</br></br>  <br>A man after my own heart.</br>  <br> East coast of America <br> Not west  <br>Liberal detected</br></br></br>  <br>"america keeping them at bay"<br><br>you say it as if America was doing it for Europe's best interests.<br><br>you think America would have stopped germany?<br>The UK and Russia took the hardest hits from germany and were still fighting, admittedly they were on the brink of loss, however they fought the war. America just cleaned up the scraps and claimed the glory.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>second this based faggot,</br>  <br>Pretty accurate except for the last part.<br><br>Russia only got to kick the enemy in the side when the rest of the allies decided to slow-roll the eastern front and give it to them.</br></br></br>  <br>the one where you lift the one on the left a bit more.</br>    Hey /b/, I want your advice<br> Matched a girl on Tinder, 20yo. <br> She looks just fine, coming tomorrow to my town with her parents. Want to spend the day with someone. <br> Talked for a while, crossed pictures, everything seems ok. <br> Told her I'm home alone tomorrow and we can have some nice time before meeting. She agrees and says Im really cute. <br> Then she calls me, and she has this strange voice like little girl -boy pretending to be a girl- <br> I ask her wtf is that and she says she is in a wheelchair and thats her real voice. <br> I ash her for a timestamp with my name and yes, she seems to be real but its so fucked up. <br><br>What would you do? She looks just fine, but would you dare to fuck a girl like this? Especially with her parents around in town?<br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/654419168#p654419168">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pussy<br><br>http://www.streetsie.com/dating-par<wbr>aplegic-girls/<br><br>Life ain't gonna hand you a perfect fucking angel every time, people are flawed, love that shit<br><br>Reminds me of a story of a kid with the same thing Steven Hawking has, and he ended up getting a maid and moving away from home and getting a girlfriend.
