This feels really nice, your touch is so delicate and soft * he moans when you play with his balls twitching as you pump him Faster* if you don't mind me saying nurse your breasts are really nice looking, especially with them pushed together like that.</br></br>  I'm still here!  <br><br>Any writefags around?</br></br>  <br>Sona stopped posting so there's not that much people now</br>  <br>I write, sort of.</br>  Staying alive  F  <br>Paying respects</br>  Don't let it die  <br>"Oh John, you really think so?" she takes her hand off your balls and props her arm up underneath her small offering squeezing them upwards, they were a B at best. <br><br>"I bet your girlfriend has much bigger though. Y-you do have a girlfriend right John? This cock would be a waste otherwise." She stops pumping your thick cock, instead taking the plam of her hand and placing it flat on the tip of your head before closing her hands around just the tip of your cock, teasing it relentlessly.</br></br></br>  <br>It's dead Jim.</br>  I think what you meant to say Index. I understand, you're confused, lonely. Don't understand life or the reason for your existence. Trust me though. It's not all that great, unless you want it to be.<br><br>Now if you was any type of thread maker like me, you'd know that in fact Ant-Man was pitched by Stan Lee in the late 80s. For me there is only one 80s.<br><br>Due to you still learning though. I'll forgive it.<br>Bitches best recognize though. I'm Index.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>N-no I'm not with anyone right now, but that's not important. *he glances at your breasts his jaw dropped both the view and the feeling of her palm on his member are overwhelming* your really stunning emily, there's no way that your single is there</br>  <br>Fuck. That you meant to say it!!!!!!!!!!! I guess this time shit is fucking with me. Kind of tired still. BUT need to press on!!!!! Who else will do this?? Aquman? Please. He's as useless as Antman.</br>  <br>Shit! nothing but mistakes.<br>I made him a steak.<br>It was damn juicy and overflowing with things.</br></br></br>  <br>Good to see you Index.</br>  <br><br><br>Maybe tomorrow, it's late.</br></br></br>  <br>It doesn't say "ERP", so it can't just be found with ctrl-f.<br>It's seriously annoying when people do this, and I end up making an ERP thread because I assume there isn't one...</br></br>  <br>Noticing your expression as you're staring at her breasts, she unbttons her top fully before discarding it to the floor. Her nipples were at full attention, poking into her black bra as if they were going to pierce through it in a moment's notice. "Now John, unfortunately its hospital policy that I stay clothed during the procedure...but this still counts right?" She gives you a coy smile and a wink. "Feel free to touch"<br><br>(my captchas are being severely autistic and dancing all over the screen what is happening.)</br></br></br>  <br>Shut up baby I know it!!! Bitches keep making threads about me and naming them wrong. When will they learn?</br>  <br>*he grins at the thought and leans forward to grow at her breasts, feeling her hard nipples through her bra* you seem to be enjoying this just as much as I am emily, why are you so aroused just from touching me with your hands?</br>  Alright.<br><br><br> video game <br> action hero said it <br> female <br><br>"I'm sorry. I forgot to mention one of the reasons I hunt your kind. You're much too ugly not to be taken out of your misery."<br><br>"Yours is a face only a mother could love, and one that I could never forget."</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Grope *</br>  <br>Catalog&gt;ERP<br><br>Wooooow.</br></br></br>  Big meaty cocks  Patrick Seitz had the longest wait of any Straw Hat voice actors: between voicing Franky on Unlimited Adventure and Franky’s debut on the actual episodes was a span of nearly 5 years<br><br>Compared to Brina Palencia waiting between Toonami Skypiea episodes to Drum Island, or Stephanie Young between that same arc to Whiskey Peak.</br></br>  Where did everyone who was in desperate need of a dicking go?  <br>Got any shark facts?</br>  "If there's anything I hate in this world, it's cockroaches and crying babies! ... Though, I suppose a crying baby cockroach would be TRULY terrible."<br><br> video game </br></br>  <br>She lets out a soft moan as she fondle her tits. "Ooohh~ John! I told you I normally have to do this for a bunch of geezers. It's rare to have a stud like you come in here, especially one so...endowed."<br><br>She gazes down at your massive cock lustfully, a slight bit of drool forming at the corner of her lips as she begins to salivate at the thought of tasting your engorged member. Her gloved palm slick with pre, she stops playing with your cock for a moment to take a lick of the salty juices, before wrapping her hand around your dick once again and pumping with a renewed vigor.</br></br></br>  <br>Of course I fucking do nig duck who's addicted to cock!!!!!!! SHARK WEEK IS OVER BITCH!!!!!!!!<br><br>Did you know? The average shark has 40-45 fucking teeth!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and can have up to seven rows of replacement teeth. Because sharks lose a lot of teeth and grow them back quickly, they often go through more than 30,000 teeth in a lifetime.</br></br></br>  <br>Well I'm glad your enjoying your self miss* he is cut off by sudden waves of pleasure*<br>O-oh that feels really good * shivers of pleasure jolt through his body, he can feel a load building up in his balls* if you want to get a bit more of a taste I would allow it, it doesn't say you can't in hospital guide lines does it?</br></br>  Shark mothers go back home to the place where they were born and give birth to their young. <br><br>At least they fucking think that!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THEY GO WHERE THE FUCK THEY LIKE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</br></br>  Sharks are attracted to sharp color contrast. Don't wear fucking jewelry you cock sucking cunt.  <br>She's continuously smacking her lips together, savoring the taste of your delicious pre as you ask he if she'd like more of a taste. She frowns in disappointment, giving you sad puppy eyes. "Unfortunately it's against regulations. why, if the hospital found out I could be fired."<br><br>She takes her free hand and grips it around your cock along with her other. Even with both hands she barely managed to cover 3/4's of your huge prick, and she begins to jerk you very slowly, emphasizing how large your cock is since each full stroke takes moments to complete.</br></br></br>  The name rhinoceros means ‘nose horn’ and is often shortened to rhino.<br>All rhinoceros can grow to weigh over 2200 pounds!!!!!!! Bitch face!!!!!!!!!!!!</br>  <br>F-fuck, emily that feels really nice. What if you closed the curtain around us, even for like 5 minutes? When will you get another chance like this? *his member pulsing with every stroke, torrents of pleasure overwhelm him as he breathes deeply bracing at the bed for grip. * <br><br>I'm sure if you were to taste I wouldn't last very long</br></br></br>  A group of goddamn rhinoceros is called a crash.  <br>That's amazing</br>  <br>Shut baby I know it!!!!!!<br>Rhinoceros horns are made from a protein called keratin, the same substance that hair is made of.<br>But everyone knows that shit.</br></br></br>  You're eyes lie to all of you. They're are no Centaurs in London!!!!!!!!!!!<br>And also no fucking White Rhinoceros!!!!!!!!!!! They are grey/gray</br>  <br>"My, not only are hung like a horse, but you got brains too hun Why didn't I think of that? Be right back sweety~"<br><br>She lets go of your cock for a moment, leaveing it pulsing and twitching unattended as she goes to draw the curtains. She comes back and squats at the side of the bed, her thighs pushing back her skirt enough for you to see that she was positively drenched. "Think you could sit up for me darling?"</br></br></br>  The largest rhino species is the white rhino.<br><br>Now, what have you learned?</br></br>  <br>Not who you're RPing with, but damn your posts are hot</br>  Rhinos spend their days and nights grazing and only sleep during the hottest parts of the day. During the rare times when they aren't eating, they can be found enjoying a cooling mud soak. These soaks also help to protect the animals from bugs, and the mud is a natural sunblock.  <br>Of course nurse, whatever needs to be done for proper treatment* he grips at his own member due to his restlessness, glancing at her breasts more and more. He sits up a she requested admiring her body and appreciating her rather shapely rump* so what now emily</br>  Every two and a half to five years, a female rhino will reproduce. Female rhinos carry their young for a gestation period of 15 to 16 months. <br><br> welcome home my friend! <br> yeah we're gonna have good time! <br> come into this world of mine! </br></br></br></br>  When rhinos are happy, they make a loud "mmwonk" sound with their mouths.<br><br> Don’t wake me <br> Don’t let it off the leash <br> There’s a monster livin’ under this hide </br></br></br></br>  <br>"I'm going to have my taste of course." Without warning, she lunges at your cock and easily takes 7 inches in an instance, before hitting her limit. She begins making choking noises as she tries to take more or meaty rod, but to no avail. She tears up a little, causing her mascara to run down her cheeks. She finally backs of of your dick with a loud plopping noise, gasping for breath, a thick strand of saliva lingers between your cock and her lips.<br><br>"J-john, you'll have to help me take the rest.." she whimpers as she goes back in for round two.</br></br></br>  The woolly rhino died out about 10,000 years ago.  Rhinos were first here around 50 million years ago,  <br>How big is a rhino's dick?</br>  <br>*he let's out a loud moan as she takes most of his member, twitching deep in her throat and precum gushing from his cock. * oh fuck emily, that's really good~ * he puts his hands on the back of her head and starts to push downward, beging her her to take every last inch* shit is really tight in there emily. *her thrusts upward with pleasure on occasion shoving himself deeper</br>  <br>Bigger than yours.<br>Bitch.<br>about 5 to 6 feet long<br>Now go jerk off to the thought of you gobbling it up like the slut you are.</br></br></br></br>  Did you know a duck penis is insane? Because duck's vagina's are also insane. They are all twisted and fucked up, so are a male's duck penis. The male duck has to have a more twisty fucked up penis than the females twisted and fucked up vag.<br><br>Because ducks love to rape.</br></br>  Blue eyed master race. Show em and rate em.<br><br>Green eyes and hazel welcome too.

First, a few facts about me:<br>I'm a proud bisexual! This is the only area of my life where I really feel like a part of my identity is erased by the media and general society.<br>I have struggled with some pretty bad depression and anxiety over the past couple years, but of course, you can still talk to me any time you like about anything.<br>I am white. I don't deny the privilege I have as a white girl and a large part of my need to create this subreddit has to do with white feminism and how damaging it can be to women of color.<br>I am not perfect. I'm 15 years old and can be very misled sometimes. I have mistakenly done some very bad things in the past that I certainly don't want to repeat. I want to make this a safe space for everyone but I am privileged in many areas of life so if I say or do something that seems out of line, please tell me.<br>I've been a self-proclaimed feminist ever since I first heard the word, but there was always something that bugged me when I studied the movement online; Every mainstream feminist website had a painful lack of diversity. Almost every woman I saw was white, heterosexual, able-bodied, neurotypical, rich, thin, you name it. In all other areas besides gender these women were very privileged and that just didn't sit right with me.<br>Women who are like that are very scarce compared to the entire population of women around the globe, and what's the point of feminism if we're only empowering the top 1% of women?<br>Whether this subreddit gains 10 or 10,000 subscribers, I hope we can all learn to accept one another and build a path towards a brighter future. (How cheesy was that?!)

You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.</br>  Oh man, some of these had me howling.  <br>What the fuck happened there?</br>  <br>wow, 10/10</br>  <br>goddamn lost hahhahah</br>  <br>But I'm only 19</br>  Dumping my private collection  <br>what a nice visible pussy</br>  C moon      <br/>  Lurking  and other view  <br/>  Perfect ...  <br>what are you thinking about this ass in yoga pants?</br>    ops      <br>lurkers?</br>  <br>one</br>  <br>Yes.

Generell ist die Benotung an unseren Gymnasien ein Witz. Ich bin jetzt 28 und kann sagen wenn ich zurückblicke. Die Mädchenbevorzugung war in allen Fächern so widerlich offensichtlich,d ass man dagegen eigentlich was tun müsste.<br><br>Jungs werden weiter für Kleinigkeiten als ADHS krank oder zumindest wibbelig verschrien und man hört sogar dauerns "Frauen sind schlauer als Männer". Bei uns ist die Emanzipation schon längst da und Männer müssen bald anfangen sich nicht diskriminiert zu fühlen. Dazu kommt das Frauen dadurch immer eingebidleter und schlimm zu ertragen werden. Wenn man Ihnen dann kontra gibt schlüpfen sie direkt in die Opferrolle und tun so als wäre alles total patriarchisch und man muss sie ja gut behandeln weil Sie Ladys sind.<br><br>Wünscht sich noch einer gute alte Zeiten zurückj, ind enen einer Frau mit angebrachtem Respekt entgegen gebracht wurde, dieser aber auch gewürdigt wurde und wenn sie mehrfach über die Stränge geschlagen hat, man auch mal mit der Faust auf den Tisch (oder in ihr Gesicht) hauen wollte und gut war. Mein Opa hat das so gehandhabt und die waren verheiratet bis zum Tod wo beide circa 95 waren. Good old times.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dumm gelaufen würde ich da mal sagen.
