There are nice feet and there are disgusting feet. Just because a girl happens to have feet, doesn't automatically mean they are nice. This means large, flat, bony, wrinkly, dirty, discolored, misshapen, or otherwise unfeminine feet are not welcome so please don't post them in these threads. Post small, petite, curvy, soft-looking, feminine feet in natural, graceful poses. I'll point some out so you dumbfucks can see.            <br><br>this man</br></br>          <br>Well, not exactly.

I try to think about it but can't think of anyone.  I can't really think of a her. To my great disappointment there's a him. I can't really pin point my feelings towards him and I don't know why I feel this way. fml.  <br>/:</br>  Natalia Poklonskaya  <br><br>Are you sexually attracted to men or just emotionally?</br></br>    summer  Sara...  <br>Because you are a faggot maybe?</br>  i met annabel who seemed to be going through some shit. we randomly met through photography. she had depression and ear problems. i asked if i could take portraits of her and she agreed. so the first time we hooked up it was all fun and i took photos of her with my leica that i saved up for two years to get. it all went really good/ agreed to meet up again. second time we met it ended up feeling like a date. her quirky sense of humour and overall strange look on life was so attractive. took more portraits of her. <br>third time we met was the heartbreaker. we went for burritos then i took her to the top of a high rise car park to enjoy the view of the city. we took loads of photos and she told me about her ex. i told her about how everything will be fine and that one day i'll take her away from it all. she asked for my shoulder and i said she can use my whole body. so i sat down and she just laid back into me on the concrete floor. <br>she told me she had to go back to her home country and i was so fucking sad about that. she's gone back to china now. i've been in some complicated breakups and i'm not the crying type but holy shit my heart exploded and i had to hold back tears for like three weeks. i still get choked up still thinking about her.</br></br>  <br>Well shit man...</br>  <br>I..don't really know for sure. We kinda messed around a little, but never had sex. Though being with him I felt, I don't really know how to describe it but really good. Like my body was aching for more of him. I am sounding like a real faggot right now, I'll stop.</br>  Daniela  EVERYONE HERE JUST BLAZED SEVERAL MILLION BRAIN CELLS WITH MORE REGRET. THE PAI DOESN"T DIE IF YOU KEEP REMINDING YOURSELF&gt; MOVE THE FUCK ON.<br><br>cause i'm bangin her now. In the mouth.</br></br>  <br>Ana</br>  I met this girl who seemed really cool and we were texting, getting into each others and started dating a little. Then her ex started to bug her and she wasn't sure about it anymore, so we stopped talking. Two weeks later she starts talking to me again. She wants to try it but she can't let go of her previous relationship or something.  <br>Nah, you dont sound like a faggot. Just let it out.</br>  <br>Wait a second...where do you go to school?</br>  <br>Don't do it.

I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it.

We have an obesity rate to rival Amerifat and our binge drinking culture is disgusting. Our government is pathetic and elitist and our lovely NHS which we're so proud of is falling apart from the inside.<br><br>But hey, at least no one gets shot whilst at church over here.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>rekt</br>  <br>nope. you are the timid mice. <br><br>i am the decendant of brave folk who risked everything for a better life and freedom from tyranny.</br></br></br>  <br>u fokin wot m8</br>  <br>and we hate you :3</br>  <br>ah yes, because we had the gall to ask for taxes to fund all the soldiers we posted on the colonies, the sheer cheek</br>  <br>a block is a section of houses or properties surrounded by streets, so if you live on gobstopper crescent and sithendenshire street, and those streets intersect with cuckoldechester avenue and privet drive, respectively, then that surrounded area is your block.<br><br>Get it, dumb fuck?</br></br></br>  Ah the insecurities of the Yanks.

Thats fucking scary  <br><br>Untrue bait is weak, like OP.</br></br>  <br>I can confirm that in the last year, I have had at least two foreign dentists and a sandnigger optician. There was also a Polish girl working at a pharmacy. The NHS loves immigrants more than OP loves dick. They have no fucking idea what they're doing and I can barely understand them. While there are a lot of ugly fucks in in Britain, there's also quite a lot of attractive people, especially the younger ones. We also have an obesity problem, as most people become land whales by the time they're 25.</br>  <br>lots.</br>    I love how everyone can have a sense of community with other parts of the world using 4chan  <br>more like alien</br>  <br>If you need to exercise beyond normal everyday life, then you are fucking weird.
