So I was in London visiting friends i met at Oktoberfest, they ordered pizza and were so fucking excited because we were all pretty hungry. So the Pizza comes,<br>"oi m8 this is the best pizza you will ever taste i swear on me mum"<br>they were fucking devouring it like it was some god food<br>this is the pizza they ordered<br>Why are brits so fucking disgusting</br></br></br></br>  <br>is that banana?</br>  that looks rancid  <br>fucking kek</br>  <br>Peanuts, Banana, and Chicken? What fucking monstrosity is this</br>  That pizza looks like someone puked on it. Fucking horrible. Would not eat.  did you have any?  <br>Fuck no, it was one of two. Other was semi-normal (pineapple and sausage) which I pretty much ate by myself</br>  <br>that sounds EVEN FUCKING WORSE</br>  When I was in Japan, I was gonna order pizza because I didn't want to leave my hotel room, but the ad on the desk was Dominos Pizza with corn on it, and I decided to not bother  britain has pretty terrible food all around, would not recommend visiting  <br>They are gross and have no taste at all, fucking argue with this britfags</br>  L O N D O N<br>O<br>N<br>D<br>O<br>N</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>if i was high/drunk i would eat a pizza with those ingredients (chicken, peanuts, pineapple) i ate worse shit impressing some hippie stoner chick from college (fermented lentil and tofu soup). presentation makes it look like a dirty paki made it with his curry crusted cock</br>  <br>Also, that pile of shit they call an English breakfast. Who the fuck wakes up and want to eat beans or a whole tomato?</br>      <br>ppl are fucking gross</br>  Their bad teeth make them incapable of chewing, and they can't chew what's inside, so they can't taste the inside of their food.    <br>We ate beans for breakfast, lunch and dinner, but not always. Chorizo with eggs,side of beans, Stalk or two of romaine lettuce with tomato is a good one</br>  anyone got the green text with the ramen surprise?  <br>cold bb-q beans?</br>  old stale pasta<br><br>sage</br></br>   be going to get together with my sister <br> we park a way down the street because it's in a relatively big city <br> we walk and I play my guitar while we walk <br> we eventually get to the housing area <br> we eventually get to the building <br> we start walking up the stairs <br> my mortal enemy approaches <br> he's with his cousin <br> they're behind us <br> I say "I'd fight both of you." <br> get into my fighting stance <br> fighting stance is like pic related <br> south paw, Karate influence, but right arm is up like a boxing guard, but my left arm is lower more closely resembling a karate stance <br> cousin says some cocky bullshit <br> throw a chain punch of 5 punches an inch away from my enemy's face <br> throw a side kick, making him back off <br> my sister is holding my from behind from my arms <br> break her hold, and throw a twin flying front kick at my enemy down the stairs, which makes him back off even more and more quickly <br> my sister grabs hold of me again <br> I slowly walk down, dragging my sister with me <br> I eventually get kind of loose <br> I lazy/speed vault down the left rail with my left arm because of muh Parkour skills <br> land and Parkour roll <br> enemy is already on ground level <br> take up orthodox boxing fighting stance with my altered boxing-karate hybrid arms <br> throw right leg inside crescent kick to outside crescent kick with left leg <br> jump and do two upwards flying roundhouse kicks (two successive kicks) <br> throw a spinning heel kick with my left leg <br> throw a side kick with my right leg <br> 180 to jump turn to inside crescent kick with right leg <br> front kick with left leg <br> front kick with right leg <br> take up my south paw hybrid boxing-karate stance <br> we don't end up fighting and I eventually leave <br>I hate that fucker.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>to add some flavour to regular bacon eggs and toast while still being pretty easy to cook</br>  <br>was that the thread on /ck/ where the guy made a relatively high quality meal, then later revealed what was in the bowl was top ramen?</br>  <br><br>What do you americunts actually think this is good?????

How does that make you feel?</br>  TeeNage mutant ninja turtles  <br>Hello britfag</br>      covering all bases  <br>You like sticking up for toast sandwiches and the fog breathers?</br>  <br>Copypasta has succeeded in luring the newfags. Good on you.</br>  scrambled egg on a tortilla with sriracha  <br>I've been here since 2006 and I've never seen that pasta</br>  <br> scrambled egg on a tortilla with sriracha <br>but thats fucking popcorn and ketchup</br></br>  <br>Kek you're right</br>  <br>No it's not, it's a scramwrap.</br>  <br>I love scrambled eggs on tortillas with sriracha</br>  <br>nigga thats popcorn</br>  <br>Our food is famously atrocious. Any Brit who tries to disagree with you is delusional and can be immediately disregarded. We have a food called faggots; they're just random off-cuts and offal. Black pudding is basically the same. Spotted Dick is another classic. I like it, but objectively it is the blandest desert ever conceived. A simple explanation is that for some reason, most people have been brought up on Wartime diets passed down from parents and grandparents. So our food is limited to what was available then and has hardly changed. As such, when cultures with good food (i.e India, China, Italy) began to immigrate en mass to Britain they realised that they could enter the food market, providing a needed dose of variety into the British diet, but at the same time only using cheap ingredients and putting in like 10% of the effort over here as would be required in their respective native lands, because our standards are, and have always been, so poor. Any good meal you have in Britain has absolutely no British origin at all. But I still fucking love it because I have been conditioned to be a tasteless twat in all things culinary.</br>  <br>head to /ck/ you newfag</br>  <br><br>I did try this once out of curiosity...<br><br>The lesson: don't put American sliced cheese on a pizza, it doesn't melt right.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>got em</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>thats popcorn dipshit</br></br></br>  <br>You probably used the oil based cheese instead of dairy. That shit is like low grade plastic.</br>    <br>it doesn't melt at all its like a steel bea or something.</br>  Peanut Butter with Mayonnaise yum        <br>NO NO NO NO NO<br><br>NO<br><br>NNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<br><br>all i am seeing right now is that disgusting nigga with the holes in him with the maggots<br><br>im gettin the 12 gauge fuck this</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>the fuck is this?</br>            <br>pasta or not... is... is that fucking turmeric sprinkled on that motherfucker?????</br>      <br>shit sammich?</br>     ghetto hibachi   <br><br>Ancient pasta.</br></br>    <br>British food</br>  <br> You probably used the oil based cheese instead of dairy. That shit is like low grade plastic. <br><br>And that is exactly how it was! It more 'burned' instead of melting and was exactly like burning plastic onto a pizza. It was fucking nasty. I can't believe I ate this shit as a kid. Try to cook it and you realize, "this shit aint right". You realize how processed it is.</br></br></br>  <br>what is this</br>    <br>wow old pasta is old<br>i saw this thread my first time here a couple years ago</br></br>  <br>I love /b/ are those bon bons?</br>          Why the fuck are there PEANUTS!?
