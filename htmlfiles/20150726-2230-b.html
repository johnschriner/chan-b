I know you're trying to help but this is not a simple bacterial or viral infection. Even severe tonsilitis does not show the signs of tissue damage that OP is experiencing.<br><br>This is a devastating infection, please seek help OP</br></br></br>  Doctor here... What you should do is amputate from the neck.  <br>Please note the redness in the soft palate, which is not even part of the tonsils. This is a spreading infection and the proximity to the brain makes this a very serious situation.<br><br>I'm a 2nd year dental student, I'm by no means an expert but I have seen thoisands of images of oral infections. This looks severe.<br><br>Anon'a tonsillectomy shows healing tissue and scar tissue with minimal signs of infection.

Lumps and bumps can occur very commonly. If you are young then it is not cancerous.<br><br>Get a doctor or dentist visit if it persists longer than ~2 weeks</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>That looks like cancer. I'm 100% serious.</br>  Well /b/ros like I said I am a 2nd year dental student, I've covered a lot of education and the main thing I lack is clinical experience.<br><br>Ask me anything related to this type of stuff and I'd be glad to give my best answer but I'm passing out in 10 minutes.</br></br>  <br>My cat had really bad cancer before it died. This is what it looked like. Op, that looks pretty advanced and could easily spread elsewhere.</br>  <br><br><br><br>I can't get enough of everyone's responses lol. This is what your throat looks like after a tonsillectomy, the black bits are from the cauterization. <br><br>Even though its a common procedure it is actually surprisingly traumatic and one of the more painful procedures to recover from. <br><br>http://i2.wp.com/tonsillectomyrecov<wbr>ery.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/<wbr>Day4.jpg<br><br>https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipe<wbr>dia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Tonsillectom<wbr>y_day_7.jpg/1280px-Tonsillectomy_da<wbr>y_7.jpg</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>get out of here summerfag</br>  <br>sucked too much dick</br>  <br><br>2nd year dental student...

Chuunibyou is the FUCKING best  Seirei no Moribito.<br><br>Enjoy.</br></br>  <br>Good battles, shittiest story</br>  <br>Liked the anime, was disappointed at the ending though.</br>  <br>To be fair, it was pretty damn entertaining.</br>  Tie between this, Jojo's (although I like parts 4-8 more than what has been animated), and Durarara!!  mfw no on says Kill la Kill  evangelion is my overall favorite, but toradora still makes me cry when i watch the ending episodes drunk on christmas<br><br>i dont watch a lot of anime really</br></br>  <br>Is it worth picking Toradora back up after I dropped it after like 8 episodes? Does it get better?</br>  Soul Eater<br><br>I don't know why, I've seen more than one anime, I don't find any of them sexually attractive, I hated the ending, and the music was average, but I still enjoy this anime as my favorite.</br></br>  <br>Eden of the East</br>  <br>mah nigga</br>  <br>much, much better. the first half is pretty boring, but the rest of it is a feels trip rollercoaster<br><br>i still watch it every year around christmas time, it's beautiful and never gets old for me<br><br><br>i would say very much worth picking back up</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>JoJo's maken no sense to me. Maybe it does but it's just so unreal, it feels like a James Bond movie. Everything keeps going horribly wrong and Dio will kill everyone but for some reason JoJo can do the craziest things to stop him.. Every single time.</br>  <br>I liked it</br>  <br>Death Note<br>All of season 1<br>season 2 sucked asshole and had a loophole in the ending.....meaning Light actually won</br></br></br>  <br>go for it man, totally worth it</br>  <br>It's very hit or miss but the first 3 parts aren't very good compared to the rest of the nonanimated parts. Part 2 is still a good part though.<br><br>Alright I'll give it another chance once I get through my backlog</br></br></br>  Sakurasou no pet na kanojo<br><br>I'm not quite sure why though</br></br>  <br>Trinity Blood? maybe...</br>  we got a guy laid  <br><br>you niggers are why i don't go to /a/<br>elitist neckbeards who like to shit on good animes because they think they're better than everyone else because they've watched the most obscure shit on the fucking planet</br></br></br>  <br> SAO is my second favorite <br><br>15 year old detected.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck man, I may get shit for this but it's gotta be Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.</br>  TENGEN TOPPA GURREN LAGANN  Death note<br>Fullmetal alchemist<br><br> also a basic bitch </br></br></br>  <br>I don't care what people watch, that's their own business and tastes. But you kinda gotta admit, SAO was bad</br>  <br>if you have any heart left at all, you won't regret it. i would recommend watching each episode on the corresponding day of december, leading to the final episode on christmas. it fits in almost uncanny and /a/ does a livestream of each episode on the day. it's gr8</br>  <br> mushishi <br><br>My nigger.</br></br></br>  <br>I didn't think it was bad<br>I thought the second half sucked nuts, but that's a different story<br>I mean, sure, it was stupid teenager bullshit, but at the very least it wasn't bad at what it wanted to do and it stuck with that.</br></br></br>  <br>You read the manga yet mate? Because I recommend you do if you haven't yet<br><br>I might wait to see it on the livestream days maybe, what episode should I watch to in preperation?</br></br></br>  <br>I would if I had time. I think I'm up to page 15 or so. So far I'm hoping part 4 is animated and subbed because I loved parts 1-3</br>  Death Note is still the best anime of all time<br><br>I know it's cool to hate it because it is well known and old and all but nothing quite beats it <br><br>Just stop watching after ep 26</br></br></br></br>  Hunter x Hunter  Katanagatari I guess.<br>Emonzaemon did nothing wrong</br>  Golden time<br>Watched it after a bad breakup, it hit me like a truck and had me crying like Hell.</br>  <br>I really didn't like the characters, they all felt too one dimensional to me, but I'm a very character centric guy so it may not have bothered anyone as much as it did me. But I hate how the MMO aspect was terribly represented. He wears low level armor throughout his whole playthrough and he soloed a goddamn raidboss. But that's just me being nitpicking. The animation and soundtrack were amazing though, I have to admit</br>  <br>well of course i would recommend just starting from 1 and on, if that's what you mean. there's a lot of subtle stuff in the first couple episodes that's brought back in a really good way later on. episode 1 starts on december 1st, and so on and so forth. sometimes i'm busy during the stream though so i always have a backup 1080p copy of each episode in my HDD</br>  hellsing is my favourite but i admit it's not for everyone.  not in any order <br> inferno cop <br> afro samurai  <br> samurai seven  <br> gurren lagann <br>ill give a list i don't care</br></br></br></br></br>  only godtier in this thread  higurashi no naku koro ni, faggots  The suite life of cory in the house.  Best anime  Madoka  <br>MAH NIGGA</br>  jesus fucking christ, the amount of 15 year olds here is appalling. mind you, i like anime, but there are a few things that the moment characters in anime do, i stop watching. those are: <br>1) unnecessary nudity/fan-service that isn't a part of the plot.<br>2) Japanese people not making sense (grammatical sense... Japanese anime seems to just let sentences trail off, without finishing their thought) <br>3) annoyingly over-the-top/loud character. im not 5, i dont need loud yells and bright colors to keep my attention. <br>with that said...<br>Psycho-pass is brilliant, especially if you happen to like philosophy.<br>Ghost in the shell (SAC/arise and 1st movie)<br>those are about the only ones that are "god-tier". there are some more good ones. but they are rare.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> approved </br>  /b/, what anime should I watch?<br><br>I'm not a noob, I've seen the obvious Fullmetal Alchemist, Death Note, Cowboy Bebop, etc.<br><br> inb4 boku no pico </br></br></br></br>  <br>Evangelion?</br>  <br><br>I heard Netflix is a pretty good source of dubbed anime.</br></br>  <br>That's actually the one classic I haven't seen.<br><br>I've thought about watching it, but I've never been that into mecha anime.</br></br></br>  <br>You can find pretty much anything that isn't younger than a year online for free anyway.</br>  Durarara  <br>seen it</br>  The Big O - Battle in Robots with religious undertones<br>Tokyo Ghoul - guy turns into a half vampire/human hybrid and needs to learn to live with his new hunger<br>Attack on Titan - the walking dead with giants<br>Akira - guy hits a 90 y/o kid and becomes superman<br>Beserk - story about a guy who fights a lot with a big sword<br>Little Witch Academia - Harry potter in like 26 mintues</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Higurashi, When they Cry.
