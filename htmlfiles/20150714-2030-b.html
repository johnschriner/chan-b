The jc2 map was bigger, but most of it is just trees n shit with a few run down good for nothing villages</br>  <br> oh hey let's make 4 fucking biomes and even more sub diversity regions ranging from desert to permafrost on this piece of land smaller than the countryside of Wales. Also, lets put a fucking atol in the middle because why the fuck not! </br>  Cringe thread?<br>Cringe thread.</br>  <br>That doctor deserves a reward.</br>  <br>/thread</br>    Rate ?

Like it would be so fucking easy.  <br>There is a concept called "invisible money". It's making $ from all the little things you don't notice. Somewhere some guy got rich making the plastic fork you got at the cafeteria at school, or who made the cover to the wall socket your computer is plugged into right now. People get stuck thinking that to get rich you have to create the next Google or invent cold fusion or some shit. You don't. You just look for the demand.</br>  <br>If you ignore a lot of other things, it's true.<br>People band together, that's always been the case, even in barter systems. It's not unique to the rich.<br><br>In Australia, there's a trucking mogul, Lindsay Fox. He started his career as a truck driver, then bought his first truck with a loan. Then bought a second and hired another driver and on and on. He's one of (if not the) richest man in Australia now, worth quite a few billion.<br><br>Before you keep going, look up little things like 'rags to riches' stories.<br>You don't 'need' education to get rich, just to be smart enough to do something or provide people with what they're willing to pay for. It doesn't matter if it's a new toy or a rap song, it happens all the time.<br>Or you could keep believing your own bias and blaming the rich for all your problems. In which case, stay poor. It's not your fault after all.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>my god im not even gonna try anymore</br>  How is everyone doing tonight?<br><br>Feeling shitty?
