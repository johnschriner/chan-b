Pissing in an ocean of piss. <br>I remember cp threads being the norm, not the rare exception.<br>I remember when we raided a cutting site... "cutting buddies" and we raided it so hard we crashed their server and they literally never came back. We kicked someone off the internet. They deserved it, and it was glorious.<br>I remember raiding "family friendly" sites with gore and scat and CP and Delicious Ron.<br><br>I remember when /b/ was the font from which all memes spread across the internet.<br><br>I remember the board literally moving so fast that a thread would be born and die in less than an hour, and the only way you knew it was there was the OC that you had experienced with your fellow Magnificent Bastards.<br><br>Now instead of raids we get bananas. <br>Now instead of CP we get "claim you're celebrity waifu"<br>Now instead of disgusting, offensive raw unfiltered shit we get "dubs thread post your dubs"<br>Now instead of original content flowing from /b/ and spreading across the internet, we get reposts from 9gag and tumblr.<br><br>There's no dark beauty, no malignant humor, just a bunch of underage useless faggots spamming bananas, "YLYL" and fucking triforces.<br><br>/b/ is disney.<br><br>/b/ only flows in the direction of the majority, so this is obviously what you wanted. You voted for this. you decided this.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>roughly 5 years, around the time taxmaster was wiped off the face of /b/</br>  48 years.<br>Pic related, my favourite meme.</br>  4 years, facebook frog  trap thread? need some pics for my collection  <br>the fuck is this</br>  <br>OC<br><br>Why did you have to be 5 off...<br><br>Well thank you &lt;3 Yeah and sorry, not really ready yet.

Can't deliver even as simple thing as this.  OP you're scum  Hitler  <br>Win 7 is still the shit bruh</br>  I'm looking for like minded people to discuss how we will get ride of any form of government by peaceful or violent means I don't care which all I know is that I'm sick of all the talk and not seeing any actions. Any thoughts?  <br>It is impossible to do under peaceful means.</br>  Fuck greedy fossil fuel companys, burn them all  <br>i agree I am thinking the first blow should be to the federal reserve</br>  <br>i agree here too</br>  There's no such thing as a nonviolent revolution.<br>-Malcolm X</br>  I feel there are basic guidelines humans should follow. But unfortunately, peoples are still pretty primitive and still need a government to tell them what to do.  well any ideas of what we can do to actually strike and cause some change  <br>plenty of ideas. but I would prefer not to share them on an open forum.</br>  <br>well can you direct me to a place that i can get involved for change or to someone who isnt a pussy and wants to get the ball rolling</br>  <br>theanarchistlibrary org has a lot of resources. There are a lot of communities that you can become involved in, but you should find them yourself and be well read before you just jump into something you may not be prepared for, or have second thoughts about your ideologies. Be sure it is what you believe before you dive in head first young one.</br>  Anarchism is the state of war against all against all. I have no respect for those who don't see that.  Make sure your pack leader shows you gun safety at your next cub scout meeting fag  <br>That is a common misconception my fellow /b/tard. Read more.</br>  <br>I have no respect for people that dont have a basic understanding of political systems. faggot</br>  Anarchy can't work in anyway in a human civilization and it will NEVER happen.<br><br>Stop being edgy children and go get a job.</br></br>  <br>The issue is anarchists see utopia of sorts, when I on the other hand see utopia as an impossibility.</br>  <br> Tfw its worked before <br> tfw its working now in certain places <br><br>Try harder</br></br></br></br>  <br>You should educate yourself a bit more before spouting off about things you don't understand. Cheers bub! @<br><br><br>I have a job. Again, please educate yourself before making assumptions.</br></br></br></br>  Anarcho-Communist/Social Libertarian here.  <br>It isn't about a utopia. It is about people self governing without the state. Communities not reliant on government.</br>  YOUR ALL FUCKING IDIOTS!<br>Without government what is keeping all of us from being slaves to those companies you hate so much.<br><br>I don't think all of us and our future kids want to be in a constant state of war.</br></br></br>  <br> tfw you are a gullible retard <br>as said before, get a job and drop your autism</br></br>  <br>This so much this <br> but what can we do to get there</br></br>  <br>"Anarcho-Socialist" here as well my friend :)</br>  <br>It only "works" because there still exists an overarching government. Shit I can't remember the name of the town, but it exists in Nevada I think on an old marine base. Well if total anarchy would exist, there would be nothing protecting that peaceful little hamlet from looking like Mogadishu.</br>  <br>Agree. Utopia will probably never exist. But that isnt what it is about.</br>  <br>Implying there would be a free market. Back to studying faggot.</br>  <br>nope. its marxist communists who see the utopia. its free-market capitalists who see the utopia. and, well, i guess some anarcho-primitivist anti-civ types see a utopia, if humanity makes it through the dystopia of the present, that is</br>  <br>Seriously? Dude, you need to pull your head out of the clouds...without government we would all be slaves? Tell me, what would you consider yourself? A free man? lol</br>  <br>govt provides the military and police to keep those companies going. without the state there could be no concentration of wealth.</br>  <br>Made no arguement refuting my own. <br><br>I have a job. A decent one in fact. Anarchy is not about being lazy. Go read.</br></br></br>  <br>Are you talking about Slab city? Because the community works but it is a poor example.</br>  Read hobbes's leviathan. The state of nature is a shitty end of the stick. At least a small government is required, sacrificing one small bit of our infinite liberty in a state of nature, so that our verbal contracts with one another have some teeth. Humans in a state of nature are shitty things. I wouldn't expect any of you to understand.  <br>I believe the city you are talking about might be in the Mojave in California. I cant recall the name either. But Chiapas might be a better example.</br>  <br>read it, its shit. go read landauer, kropotkin, emma goldman, and colin ward.</br>  <br>Don't vote. Don't follow their laws if they conflict with your desire (including all those who want to rape and kill and touch the children)<br><br>no wait. vote for the best possible representative, because your choice matters.<br>and be happy we have a democratic government that enforces laws that protect non bad people from bad people</br></br></br></br>  <br>Add Bakunin, Bookchin.</br>  <br>'state of nature' is an intellectual abstraction. everything is in a state of nature. society and govt occur naturally. community without government occurs naturally as well. cartesian dualism is a mental illusion, my friend. and people have been self-organizing without a ruling class for a very, very long time.</br>  <br>Free market means ever company for them self. One company can corner the whole market and leave us all begin to suck their dicks to get some food to feed our family. <br><br>FREE MARKET<br><br>DO I HAVE TO MENTION THE GREAT DEPRESSION!<br><br>ya your right you do need to go back to school.<br><br>Source: i have a degree in economics</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>why?</br>  I'll never be persuaded away from the belief that the most effective way to govern a people is with a Republic and realpolitik.  <br>Im not op but i am the one you replied too. If you think in an anarchist society there would be a free market you are highly mistaken. You may have misunderstood me. Either that or youre autistic.</br>  <br>you cant have concentrations of private property without armed fools protecting said property. that is basically having a govt. free market = liberal-state + capitalist economy. no state, no capitalist economy. the two grew up together, and we would be fooling ourselves if we did not think of them as one integrated system, both depending upon the other to function.</br>  <br>is OP fbi?</br>  <br>why get rid of government? if the people want a good government we can vote one in.<br>an anarchic system assumes good morals cannot be corrupted by power. and that is ridiculous.<br>democracy assumes the people have good morals, and while that is ridiculous, it lets the people decide what is good.<br>anarchy leaves little room for democratic change</br></br></br></br>  <br>There's probably a lot of ways. One would be to create alternative economies to capitalism within the system, slowly outgrowing it and rendering the state useless, or by seizing control of the cities and factories by force, destroying the police force while directly eliminating the state's power</br>  <br>I think it is called Slab City, and yes it is a poor example.<br><br>Kropotkin, Landauer, Goldman FTW<br><br>There is morality in anarchism believe it or not. And no, your vote does not matter anymore...<br><br>If you have a degree in economics then you should realize the state of disarray most countries are in. You should also realize that a free market gives people the right to chose a company. If you know anything about economics and private companies then you would know that the majority of companies that you think are in competition with one another are a lot of times actually owned by the same parent company...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We are all being watched already lol. I post worse things on social media with no anonymity. Im not worried.</br>  <br>This...</br>  <br><br>OP, and everyone else who considers themselves serious, should start off by reading the unabomber manifesto, then jacques ellul, the technological society.</br></br>  its all about that resistant culture  <br>Reactionary ecology is a one way ticket to sucktown</br>  <br>Where is it working? The only place I know that has no centralized government Is somalia, yeah, somalia truly is a paradise. ..<br><br>Humans will always group together in a governing structure, without a government gangs or tribes form with a ruling structure.<br><br>You Litteraly can't have a late human population without a government because a governing system will form no matter what.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rojava is probably the most relevant example. http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/5996<wbr>184<br> Somalia is not organized through anarchism, but by warlords.</br></wbr></br>  <br>You literally can't spell, therefore all of your attempts trying to sound smart are invalid.</br>  <br>nope<br><br><br>chiapas and many other indigenous territories, many small communities and networks in the global north, workers occupied factories in argentina, squat houses in spain, neighborhood assemblies in venezuela, argentina, brazil, kobane and other kurdish communities in turkey/syria/iraq, its everywhere. just gotta look for it.</br></br></br></br>  Most of my books are in storage atm. Heres a random stack I have with me.  <br>Humans will always form governments or leadership groups, get rid of the government a gangs will form with ruling structures and in the end you will have groups controlled by governments but in worse situations.<br><br>Hope you don't like clean water, food, electricity, Internet, security, medical care, emergency care or any modern convince.<br><br>Get rid of the government and infastructure collapses, you can't expect 7 billion people to all think the way you do and keep working and maintaining infastructure and not forming gangs and militas.<br><br>It's human nature to form governing systems, you can't change that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Remember, remember the 5th of November,<br>The gunpowder treason and plot.<br>I know of no reason the gunpowder treason<br>Should ever be forgot.<br><br> Blow up important monuments <br> Mutiny <br> Come out on top during the chaos </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  My wifes tits  nice tits  <br>thanks</br>  more  <br>prob seen this one already</br>  Does she have a tummy ache?  pussy pics  Nice op.
