And it most likely only got known to the world because they where so proud that they started telling people about how they had sex with their teacher.<br><br>Now 22 years is insane. in Scandinavia 15 is the age which you can start to have sex, and to punish her with 22 years for this is over the top. I mean in Denmark 21 years is that longest sentence you can get and that's for very severe murder.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>She is a rapist and should get killed for her crimes.</br></br>  <br>wat?<br>you mean she got 22 years of lesbian prison after giving 3, 17 olds the night of their life?</br></br>  <br>indeed, the only thing i see as really wrong here. Is she got pregnant, and i think aborted without one of the boys knowing, I don't know the law on that area well, but i think that's illegal as both parties need to agree to such thing.</br>  <br>1st. that sounds like a hentai<br>2nd. Id tap her, hard<br>3rd. &gt;illegal as both parties need to agree <br>wtf is this shit?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> the thing is it is not murder, forced or any such thing, everyone of those depressed ass kids got a dream forfilled. And it most likely only got known to the world because they where so proud that they started telling people about how they joint this really cool sect  <br><br>I like how people conveniently ignore that she was their teacher.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I like how people conveniently ignore that she was their teacher. <br><br>why does this matter?</br></br></br>  <br>  ignore that she was their teacher. <br>yeah man, considering thats the actual hot part!</br></br>  <br>that bithc should get honors and not jailtime...<br><br>no seriously, you muricans and your "HURR DURR UNDERAGE" bullshit is just way too retarded...<br>okay, i get that she's a teacher, good. then don't ever let her work in a job related to teens again. problem solved...</br></br></br></br>  <br>In United States of Prudistan, sex is evil.<br> TheyÂ´re more worried with the children seeing sex in the internet than... anything, really.<br> This woman was probably condemned by a Jury of old ladies and a woman judge, no man would put her in jail (no REAL MAN, that is).</br></br></br>  <br>position of authority you moron.</br>  <br>Woulda got longer if the genders were reversed.</br>  <br> a woman getting a taste of what life is like for men <br><br>Cool. Not that she won't be released early since she's a woman.</br></br></br>  <br>Some jail related anon should give us her address in prison so we can write to her.<br>The teen anons can sent pics of their dicks as well.</br></br>  <br>Why is it rape when a male teacher gives horny ass girls what they dream about, but not when a female teacher does it with boys, exactly?</br>  <br> everyone of those horny ass kids got a dream forfilled <br><br>This is okay to say if you also agree the same thing about girls.<br><br>Stories about female teachers having sex with say 14 year old boys is "a dream come true" for them but when the story is changed to a thirty six year man having sex with a 14 year old girl suddenly it's not cool.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The design of courtroom is based on a Protestant church. <br><br>She's been sentenced 22 years to save her poor misguided soul...</br></br></br>  <br>As you know, girls and women hate sex. Silly anon.</br>    <br> 22 FUCKING YEARS <br><br>the age of consent is 16 in Florida<br><br>how is this possible<br><br>has she literally been sentenced</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I bet them having sex had absolutely no effect on their teacher student relationship...</br>  <br>maybe so, but these were 17 year old boys, not 14.<br><br>Take note that in a few months they'd be drunk off their arses fucking girl's they've only know for a few hours. And that would be considered normal and healthy for boys that age.<br>So fucking one woman who they've known for years and learnt to trust, shouldn't exactly be considered corrupting their minds.</br></br></br></br>  Is 22 years excessive? Sure. But it at least raises a point of contention. When you violate the confidence of the parents whose children's wellbeing was entrusted to you, by, well, violating them, it's a pretty dark thing indeed.<br><br>22 years is however, more than a little bonkers for 17 year olds.</br></br>  It's not because of age she got sentenced it's because of she abused her power as a teacher and authority figure in the eyes of the courts.  <br>I used 14 as an example because I know that 17 is a perfectly healthy age, I was merely saying that you have to be okay with girls wanting the same thing and it being okay.</br>  <br>I know of 17 year old girls having huge crushes on their teachers, i bet if said teachers wanted to they could have bedded those girls with no problem.</br>  <br><br>that's retarded. rape doesn't carry the same sentence as murder because then the perpetrator has no reason to let the person live.</br></br>  <br> the age of consent is 16 in Florida <br>Florida degenerates. It should be 21 and you know that.</br></br>  This is what you get when you ask for equality. I agree that it's a ridiculously long sentence, but if it was a guy fucking three 17 year old girls, few people would care. Is it ridiculous? Yes. Anytime you have a system of justice you have a system of injustice. She'll end up doing 7-10 years of that sentence, possibly even less.  <br> abused her power as a teacher and authority figure in the eyes of the courts. <br><br>you could be a high school teacher and beat a student in the middle of class till the kid had to be hospitalized with broken bones and not get 22 years</br></br></br>  <br>which frankly stupid. I married my boss who I met as my boss. She shouldn't and doesn't go to jail just because she's the authority figure who "abused her power" by asking me out.<br><br>I get there's a slight difference with teachers and doctors and stuff. But it should just be lose their job at that school/hospital or whatever. Going to jail for interacting like normal people in a way no one would even consider bad outside of that job is silly.</br></br></br>  <br>That's disgusting. She should be given the death penalty.</br>  <br>TAKE THAT, OBSCENE WOMAN.<br>You should have fapped to internet porn and stayed virgin for the rest of your life like all of us, but NOOO... YOU HAD TO FUCK HOT STUDENTS, DID YOU?!?!<br> Hope you enjoy your prison :)</br></br></br>  <br>Age of consent is 16 years in most states, some of the kids mist have claimed rape for either money or parents cracked down and forced them to say it</br>  <br><br>I googled it and it says she got probation, no jail time.</br></br>  <br>There are people who do less time for murder.</br>  <br>While i do not agree with the length of the sentence given to her, i got to say i'm surprised and somewhat happy that the case is being taken seriously in this situation because men are constantly being sentenced harshly for the same thing, this is equality</br>  Didn't she have sex like 30 times with them? I mean any normal person should've stopped after she got pregnant..  <br> I googled it and it says she got probation, no jail time. <br><br>figures<br><br>god damn it OP</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>^this</br>  <br>KeK<br>Teachers no longer have any authority</br></br>  <br>They're retarded what's new ?<br><br>Land of the fat, home of the tard</br></br></br>  <br> I married my boss who I met as my boss <br>You were his hot 17 yo young underage secretary?<br>Did he tapped your ass in office?<br>You could have sent him to jail and made a fortune, you know that?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Wait, maybe not. the google gave me the wrong name, which is weird.

This is equal justice, even though yes she is hot.</br>  shes not even that attractive i hope some big black bitch makes her a slave and smothers her nightly with her large black tits  <br>seeing as SHE (as noted in post) was hot as hell and fun to be around. while not 17, was 19 and she 24 back then.<br><br>and only in her office. you can close the binds and that there. my office was shared with about 8 other people, who are the kind of lookers that you want joining in, so not there.</br></br></br>    <br>I was that kid who got beaten by his teachers in middle school, about 13 years ago. GREENTEXT? OR should I STF U</br>  Fucking dum Americunts lol.  anyone in this thread crying about her sentence is a bleeding heart tumbler faggot. men get this sentence all the time so props to the judge for being fair based on previous cases  <br>this. you are one smart guy</br>  <br>Only if you meant beaten off.</br>  <br>OWNED<br><br>UNDERAGE SEXING IS ILLEGAL<br><br>B A S E D<br>A<br>S<br>E<br>D</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>if it was a man who fucked a 17 year old girl this thread wouldnt be up and everyone would be fine with the sentence.</br>  <br>yup this.</br>  <br>does illegal=bad?<br>Any rational person can understand that a 17 year old is hardly any different to an 18 year old. Not only that the legal age in Australia is 16 for example.<br>Your argument is moot</br></br></br>  <br><br>Let me guess you're American who thinks his child is a special snowflake and totally fucked up raising them. So now you blame the school for not teaching the children what you should teach them and when they try you go ahead and complain that they're not teaching them what you want them to be taught. <br>No wonder teachers are so powerless in your country.</br></br></br>   We are not releasing the guys name because he may be a victim <br><br>kek and these cunts are supposed to be the worlds leading nation?</br></br>  <br>:( no just actually beaten, 5 different teachers all at the same time. I was knocked unconscious woke up in nurse office. Said I fell down stairs....</br>  <br>It's not rape in either of those circumstances. The worst that should happen is the teacher gets fired, or forced to resign. Again this fucking country likes to jail people for having human nature. <br><br>It's so ass backwards that we rather see people fight and kill each other than make love. This country is full of fucking morons.</br></br></br>  <br>a pedo is a pedo.</br>  <br><br>she was 24 and he was 17 <br><br>what was she charged with, that is literally not statutory rape in FL</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think its illegal because it was a student/teacher relationship</br>  I don't agree with 22 years, unless we're missing something and she really did force those kids to fuck her.<br><br>She coulda just waited until they were 18 and fucked their brains out.</br></br>  <br>we need to riot!!<br>we all need to go to florida and start a giant riot, then the government with their tolerant ways will retract their sentencing to her, <br>like they fucking did with the confederate flag and other politically correct bullshit.</br></br></br>  <br><br>let's say the students were 18<br><br>how is fucking a legal age student worth half a life in prison</br></br></br></br>  I've only seen a couple of the vids and shit, but I'm confused about what age she was when the actual sex happened.<br><br>It seems she's like 30 now, but this was over 6 years ago, right? So I'm seeing that a woman who was 24 had sex with a few 17 year olds and got sentenced for 22 years in prison for it?<br><br>When the legal age in many states is 16... a 24 year old can get 22 years for having sex with 17 year olds because... wrong state?<br><br>Is that actually what happened.<br><br>Further, some quotes from the judge really fucking set me off. He was talking about "faith" and shit. This is the root of this fucking nonsense, this puritanical religious authoritarian shit. Fuck, I hate religion.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> She coulda just waited until they were 18 and fucked their brains out. <br><br>a 24 year old having sex with a 17 year old is legal in florida</br></br></br>  <br>Murica the land of the free...</br>  <br><br>Its because she was a teacher.<br><br>This country is ruled by sanctimonious women who infantilize everyone to the extent that 17 year old men have to be protected from consensual sex with 8 out of 10s because their "Think of the Children" mentality envisions a slippery slope where their 8 year old will get banged by the gym teacher if they don't lynch this chick.<br><br>Don't think it isn't happening to you too Europe. You may be less uptight about sex; but you have to provide ID to buy a butter knife.<br><br>Women love the nanny state. We never should have let them vote.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I've only seen a couple of the vids and shit, but I'm confused about what age she was when the actual sex happened. <br><br>she was 23 or 24<br><br>http://www.ageofconsent.com/florida<wbr>.htm</wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  Right-wing Christian fundamentalist abore anything sexual. They believe sex is the devils work.  <br> You may be less uptight about sex; but you have to provide ID to buy a butter knife. <br><br>Cannot confirm<br>Sauce: me</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well then waited till they graduated. <br><br>The problem is that she's a teacher and they were her students. I absolutely agree that you can't do that with your students (as hot as it is).<br><br>That being said, damn, I wish I had a teacher like that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br> provide ID to buy a butter knife. <br><br>Its already happened to the Brits.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> does illegal=bad? <br>Illegal = you do it and you get in trouble<br><br> Any rational person can understand [insert my favourite argument here] <br>lol<br>  that a 17 year old is hardly any different to an 18 year old. <br>Well, to start with, a 17 year old is not a 18 year old.<br><br> Not only that the legal age in Australia is 16 for example. <br>Thanks for the info.<br><br> Your argument is moot <br>Very well memed</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>OH MY GOD<br>ENGLAND, WHY?<br><br>Canadafag here. Are you guys serious? What the fuck?<br><br>Is it because you have no guns that you must resort to using kitchenware as a weapon?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>haha no it won't happen here. We're not as retarded as you are in regard to sex. <br>we may be more retarded in other things, but we don't have that puritan shit here</br></br>  <br>what a monster, scarring those poor boys, i bet they will need therapy <br>im glad she gets what she deserves<br>sex with a minor is no joke</br></br></br>  For those who are blaming religion, you ever think that maybe the big deal is that someone in a position of authority abused their authority and that maybe it's less about religion than it is punishing a predator who can't control themselves? In the immortal words of Jimmy "Dy-no-mite!" Walker, "Don't do the crime if you can't do the time." She's a predator who couldn't wait for those kids to turn 18. She wasn't that much older, but her relationship with those students deprived them of the opportunity to form meaningful relationships with girls closer to their own age.  <br> The problem is that she's a teacher and they were her students. <br>that still doesn't warrant a 22 years sentence.</br></br>  <br>I did it all for the nookie call.</br>  <br> U.S what is wrong with you???? <br>Pretty much everything.</br></br>  <br> 22 FUCKING YEARS FOR SEXING 17 YEAR OLD MEN. <br> Jesus U.S what is wrong with you???? <br><br>Is gender equality finally coming to the states?</br></br></br></br>  <br>The thing is, if those boys had any shred of decency they'd appeal it the second they turn eighteen. <br><br>In fact they wouldnt have to be decent- because they'd probably get more fuk out of it.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>It already is happening friend.<br><br>Your sanctimonious women are more preoccupied with multiculturalism at the moment; but its only a matter of time before they start telling you how evil your cock is.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=F67<wbr>JhKT5bxU</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because of the US is mostly run by religious retards is that are all like "Du words of GOD in the bibles are muh laws". And then go to church every Sunday to apologize for being human.</br>  <br> this </br>  <br>Normal human behavior punished by a putting someone into a box for 22 years. Fuck this gay earth.</br>  <br>Not true. In Texas "if I remember" a male teacher was let go free, after a judge determined the female student was "asking for it" SJW groups flipped out, and tried to have the judge removed.<br>Please know what you're talking about, instead of shitting your opinion as "fact".</br></br>  <br>We're a bunch of fail fags without out enough common since to tell the stupid fags to STFU.</br>  <br>You're exactly right that one time was indicativ of every single other instance of that particular crime. Go kill yourself dumbass.</br>  <br> someone in a position of authority abused their authority <br><br>did she? did she use her position as teacher to force him to do something he didn't want? Would her punishment be the same had he been a few months older and past the age of consent?she could have abused her authority all the same</br></br></br>  <br>Exactly. I said that earlier. <br><br>She shouldn't teach again, because she broke the rules. <br><br>Now, we don't know the full story. She could very well have raped those kids. Or she could have fulfilled one of my biggest fantasies. <br><br>I agree that 22 years is way too much. They just destroyed her entire life because she fucked some of her students. She should lose her job, but not 22 years.<br><br>I hope that it was consensual, and if it was, that she gets out early.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There was another one near me, hot blonde teacher, who got 30 years for the same thing: Let three of her students run a train on her.<br><br>Bitch was married too. Imagine how mad THAT guy was when he found out he got cucked by a bunch of kids.<br><br>Frankly, I think this shit is hilarious. Women have been screaming about equality for fucking decades. Well, they got it. Welcome to a man's world, bitches.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Okay guys, wtf ? we're not on tumblr, you're not fighting against feminists, we all fucking know there cant be any equality between men and women and that'll always be like this, it doesn't make the 22 years too severe.<br>I mean, she should just get fired from her job and probably stopped from teaching again, and that's it.</br></br></br>  <br>haha feminisim win</br>  <br>It might have affected the way she was grading. In the United States we Americans take education very seriously to preserve the intellectual vigor which has led us to being the lone world superpower.</br>  <br>go back to /pol/ you retard.<br>the main problem is american common law system based on precendent and technicality. <br><br>in europe you can make a law and then the judge will evaluate each situation on a case by base basis. <br>in the usa you can't do that. <br><br>so in most of europe it would be<br> 16 is legal, thus it's accepted that a 17 person can consent to sex <br> next let's check if she abused her position of authority and eventually give the punishment for that kind of abuse <br><br>in the usa its<br> age of consent is 16 <br> but in the case of a position of authority it's 18 <br> thus it's rape <br> let's make an example out of her </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Jesus U.S what is wrong with you???? <br>Sexual repression and taboos from bygone eras channeled through a poor law system</br></br>  <br>Lol, it is 16 in a lot of country, except yours, so no Florida evolves. It should be 16, not less and not more.</br>  <br>Its not age.. Most states have a consent age of 16. But student/teaacher makes it worse, for some reason.</br>  <br> YFW Hong Kong has more personal freedom per person than the U.S. has </br>  <br> Ephebophilia <br><br>Read and learn please</br></br></br>  <br>of course 22 years. see, she wouldn't actually learn her lesson if we only jailed her for 21 years. and firing her from her job? that's not good enough...we need to take a fifth of her life away from her control so she knows what's good for her. and what do you care anyway? you're going to go to sleep tonight all nice and cozy in your bed tonight because we pulled another evil predator who probably worships satan off the street...for the children.</br>  <br>It's called an abuse of power leading to sexual acts with someone who is legally a child. Regardless of actual age the bitch knew the law and this sort of thing sets the precedent of women not getting away with this bullshit anymore. Also, why do you automatically assume the students were bragging and not at least a little bit traumatised by it? Men are humans too, fem scum.</br>  <br>That is just ridiculous.<br>Did they ask the boys their opinion?<br>I'd give my left nut to bust my other nut in that.<br>I think it's every teenagers fantasy to fuck their hot teacher.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Appeal what? The state prosecuted her, not them. They can't appeal shit, and quite frankly their opinion means nothing. She was prosecuted for the position she held combined with sex with a minor.</br>  <br><br>You don't watch the news do you?<br><br>I guess you must have missed all those protests over the fact that they can't elect anyone who hasn't been dictated by the communist party.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Would you react the same way if the sexes were reversed?</br>  <br>Continue...</br>  <br>Other anon doesn't understand that exceptions don't disprove a rule</br>  <br><br><br>this is how those in power keep you down. <br><br><br>instead of being happy that the same retarded and brutish rule is being applied to others you should try to make that rule not be applied at all.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Punishment would have been less because it's no longer sex with a minor, but she still would have been punished for abusing her power to potentially blackmail a student into sex. The actual situation pretty much doesn't matter, it's what she did and what she could have potentially done that is being punished and discouraged.</br>  <br>bwaahahhahahahahaha teachers having authority.</br>  <br>still doesn't change the the irony that the uk has more freedoms than the usa and the shared ones for longer to.</br>  <br>16 depends on the state, in most with that age limit you have to be within 2-3 years of that age yourself for it to apply. National age is 18.</br>  <br>She did abuse her authority. She used a place where she was supposed to be teaching these young people as her personal dating pool. She's a predator. If she wasn't a predator she would have sought companionship with people her own age. If she had sex with them when they were 18, she wouldn't be getting jail time but she wouldn't be teaching anymore either. Also, she was accused of fucking an eight grader (that's about 12-13 years old) the same year that she definitely fucked the 17 year old dudes. She wasn't charged with the first incident, but she was accused of it. Also, she has other charges pending. She's a fucking predator. Now, all that being said, I would have fucked her when I was that age and been happy about it.</br>  <br>Because it makes it more sexy</br>  <br> Mainland China =/= Hong Kong <br>Go back to geography class, anon.</br></br>  <br>i will kill her with my loaded weapon <br>in other words my cock <br><br>she is hot</br></br></br></br>  <br>of course you fuck nut, 17 year old girls are completely capable of making their own fucking decisions, just like 17 year old boys. sexist cunt</br>  <br>Under 18 makes you a minor, legally speaking a child. Therefore under the law she is a paedophile.<br><br>Read and learn please</br></br></br>  lol when will Ameritards realise they have a lot less 'freedom' than most Europeans?  <br>welcome to america, where homosexuals can mary and you get over 20 years in jail for having heterosex.</br>  <br>It still really bothers me that one of his teeth is directly in the middle of his face.</br>  <br>a child in some aspects, not in others. Their considered as children so they can't get sentenced as harshly when they commit a crime, but they are in no way children when it comes to sex.</br>  fuckthisgayearth.jpg<br><br>She is so cute too. 22 days is enough =/.</br></br>  <br>In some states, even if the victim is 18 or even 19, if the perpetrator is a teacher or someone in that sort of position they can still be charged as a sex offender. I read about it happening to a teacher for a 18 y.o. student who wasn't even in her class but just went to the same school she taught at.</br>  <br>In reality they aren't, at least some aren't, but that is completely unrelated to legal definitions. They're legally children in regards to sex which is why the age of consent is 18 in general. U.S. legal system =/= Logical</br>  <br>Yeah, position of authority is a big deal in the U.S.</br>  <br>omg I never noticed that...can't unsee...</br>  <br>she's fucking hot</br>   USA <br> freedom <br><br>pick one</br></br></br>  <br><br>So you really don't watch the news.<br><br>Or are you just one of those idiots who replies to pictures without reading the statement next to them and you somehow assumed that I thought my picture of the Tienanmen Square protests from 1989 (look at the filename fucktard) was taken in 2014 in Honk Kong?<br><br>Just stop posting dude.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>That's the problem, law is meant to work for us, not us for the law</br>  <br>Pedophilia is sexual attraction to prepubescent kids you retard</br>  <br><br>I wish I had a teacher like that.</br></br>  <br> tortilla </br>  <br>Then the law should probably be destroyed and started again from scratch. Fun fact, the U.S. has the most complex legal system in history, also the highest rate of citizen incarceration in history. Good times.</br>  She should burn in hell.  <br><br> still doesn't change the the irony that the uk has more freedoms than the usa  <br><br>Look dude you need to pull your head out of your ass if you want to keep your freedoms.<br><br>I'm American and I'm deeply disturbed with the way my freedoms have been eroded since September 11th.<br><br>If you're English you really aren't in a position to be feeling good about the state of individual freedom. Your government is spying on you just as mine is and your rights to free expression have been eroded in the name of tolerance.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>jesus, ill let her rape me.</br>  <br>At least the UK government doesn't hide that fact, the cameras are pretty fucking obvious and very useful in catching criminals. Individual freedom isn't stellar here, but it's better than the U.S. and people here actually stand up to the government and change unethical laws. When was the last time the U.S. population in general made any decision that made logical sense?</br>  <br>How is it that this teacher gets 22 years and this chick in the hat was pretty much a camwhore star while still in high school and not one word gets said about it?<br><br>NOT ONE WORD.</br></br></br>  <br>Jesus fucking Christ, what happened to WT Snacks?</br>  <br>Truth. UK &amp; US are both becoming totalitarian shitholes. Trolling aside, this is pretty fucking dangerous and I don't think it'll become better any time soon. We must unite and fight the good fight. UK is worst, but US is a close second</br>  <br>spot on</br>  <br>this guy gets it</br>  <br><br> people here actually stand up to the government and change unethical laws. <br><br>You're talking about the country where the city council and the police let Pakis fuck every preteen girl in town for a decade because they didn't want to be accused of being racist?</br></br></br></br>  wish my teacher had done the same back in the years.  Use some common sense for christ sakes.<br><br>She knew the country she lived in, the laws, the culture and the justice system and the sentences meted out for this kind of crime.<br><br>This is not some care in the community level retard we are talking about but an intelligent woman in a position of responsibility.<br><br>You could argue all day about how fair it is and how different it is in other countries but none of it matters,<br><br>Don't do the crime if you can't do the time.<br><br>faggots.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shut the fuck up. If it were a guy he'd probably get 10 years more.</br>  <br>yes but we can't be racist, can we now<br><br>even if they are kiddy fiddlers</br></br></br>  <br>This kind of retards still think they need weapons to fight an oppressive government</br>  <br>checked^<br><br>this is true, but those kids will never get to eat asshole ever again thanks to those fucking judges and mothers. nobody wins here.</br></br></br>  it's called equality  <br> she was aware that she lived in a fucked up backwards ass nation with draconian puritanical morality laws <br> therefore there is nothing wrong with the laws and everything that happens to her is fair! <br>little shits like you are just pathetic</br></br></br>  <br>spot on</br>  <br>hey man she hot as fuck. What the fuck is the reasoning behind this, that she will somehow damage their psyche?<br>I don't know who the fuck would say no to that. Maybe 16th century puritans. Shit.</br></br>  <br>Did I say there weren't cowards in the government? No, I said the public stand up to bullshit, which they did once that became public.</br>  <br><br> still think they need weapons to fight an oppressive government <br><br>Remember how we defeated the Third Reich with the power of friendship?</br></br></br></br>    <br>I'd do anything to eat a 24 yr old muff at 17.</br>  <br>You're the pathetic one, anon. The morality or justification of those laws doesn't mean dick, they're still laws regardless of what you think of them. Welcome to the adult world, you still have to follow rules you don't like.</br>  <br>I'd totally pail her bail and run off with her to mexico. Shit.</br>  <br>THIS</br>  <br> 22 FUCKING YEARS FOR SEXING 17 YEAR <br><br>She should have known the age of consent laws for her country.<br><br>Im just glad they didnt reduce her sentence just because shes a le womyn.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Justice. All a male has to do is accidentally touch a girl and they get life in prison. Girls were getting away with this but it seems like they aren't anymore. Like the teacher who was drugging teens and getting them drunk. All she got was a slap on the wrist and had to apologize.</br>    <br><br>I wrote that and if you can't see the truth of it then you are the pathetic little shit.</br></br>  <br><br> No, I said the public stand up to bullshit, which they did once that became public. <br><br>Really?<br><br>So you threw the town council in prison along with all the police who sat back and let it happen?<br><br>No, you didn't did you? <br><br>You got real angry about it for a few weeks and your politicians made promises that it would never happen again and then you forgot about it and nothing happened.<br><br>The English people are even more sheep like than the Americans are at this point.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>precisely</br>  <br>Yeah, I remember how the soviets defeated the 3rd Reich<br><br>BTW, this faggot still doesn't get he's supporting a fascist government with bars and stars.</br></br></br>  <br>spot on</br>  <br><br>If you dont agree with the laws campaign to change them.<br>Dont just pretend they dont exist and then act surprised when you get arrested.<br>People managed that with weed in some states.<br><br>If most of the people in your country agree with the law and you dont, its foolish to just pretend the laws dont exist. <br><br>You need to accept that you live in a democracy and either move on or move country.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Caused by feminism,<br>welcome to fucking equality bitches,<br>kiss your rights goodbye</br></br>  <br>My god she is stunning. 16 is age of consent where i am. Situation is completely rediculous. American really need to catch up with the rest of he world</br>  <br>Ahh.<br>This is justice<br>Men always get arrested for this<br>Finally a girl gets arrested</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Thanks Stalin <br><br>Wow, you're so obsessed with pissing off the Americans that you'll take a shit on British soldiers right along with them.<br><br>Fuck you mate.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What do you recommend for fighting an oppressive government? Some sterns words a peaceful protest? 'Cuz we all know how well that works. Most change comes about because of violence. Terrorism has historically worked, riots have brought about change some times, and when the founding fathers of the US were fed up with England's bullshit, they gained their independence by inciting a war and winning that shit. You're the kind of retard that bitches about corporations being at the root of all the world's problems and claim you want world peace, but all you do is smoke pot and smell bad.</br>  <br>precisely</br>  <br>to be fair, we honestly were basically "operation distract the nazi's a bit while the russians clean house."</br>  <br><br>I think the point hes making is that they were afraid of being called racists.<br><br>The parents of the victims would complain to the police about their preteen kids staying overnight with 30 year old muslim men.<br><br>Muslim Councillors, community leaders and activists portrayed it as a problem of the parents not wanting their children to be around muslims. <br>Rather than not wanting their preteens to stay overnight with 30 year old men.<br><br>But since it all came to light things have got a bit more rational.<br><br>Certain Taxi firms in Rotherham allow you to ask for a non muslim white driver. If you dont feel like your daughter is safe with a muslim.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The Russians did most of the work, deal with it.</br>  <br>she will probably get raped and used by seneters and gards and the prison warden untill she loses her looks then she will get pardended</br>  You're all the assholes that complained that a female teacher wouldn't get a harsh punishment like a male teacher would for fucking his underage students.  <br>22 years for making those brats the luckiest motherfuckers in their whole state. its sad</br>  <br>You believe the U.S. won independence itself? Oh anon, go back to history class. France and Spain own the U.S. its independence, and mostly just France. The UK was at war on 3 fronts at the same time, the U.S. wasn't seen as an important front.</br>  <br>So you recognize that terrorists are just modern rebels, don't you? They call themselves rebelds or fighters for justice and the governments call them terrorists.<br><br>Just to make it clear, because I suspect nobody is getting the point.<br><br><br>This guy is defending oppression, but he could be the same guy who thinks guns will protect him from an oppressive government.<br><br>Are we clear?<br><br>Now, about the third reich. Soviets put a lot more effort in steamrolling the third reich than any other faction. Plus Hitler was a lot more scared of Stalin than any other enemy.<br><br>The only thing american propaganda is right was that Stalin was a tyrant and a betrayer of the socialist principles.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>spot on</br>  <br>I never said they didn't get help, but the point was that war (i.e. violence with weapons) was what got them their independence. There were British troops in the colonies and if there hadn't been violent conflict, nothing would have changed and the US would still be a part of the British Empire.</br>  <br><br>So what are you suggesting? <br><br>A two tiered law system where men face much harsher laws than women?</br></br></br></br>  <br>why would an underage need to buy kitchen knives anyway?</br>  <br>War which was...only viable because of the French. Even if there had been violent conflict, if the UK hadn't been at war with Spain and France at the same time the U.S. would have been a colony until around the same time the UK was forced to give Africa and India their independence.</br>  <br>pedo fear has gone too far. there is nothing wrong with 22y having sex with 17y. if they both wanted it....<br>even it was teacher. maybe getting fired from job is ok but no jail time</br></br>  Long time no see /b/<br>Here is the underside of my tits.</br>  now put a timestamp on your ass and a sharpie in the pooper    <br>wait for your tits getting saggy. you'll never see your tat again.</br>  <br>Implying I live that long.</br>  what the actual fuck is this? like fucking stop, drama queens.
