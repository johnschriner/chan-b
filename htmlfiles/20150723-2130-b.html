Any ideas what to boost Emperor of Essos with?</br>  <br>imho just reduce the Free Cities' required number to 3. It will be a great boost.</br>  <br>Yeah. I did that to make the 4 requirement for Independent Kingdoms to make more sense. But I suppose a new kingdom needs more to legitimize it.</br>  <br>That's a decent thought. Makes it a bit easier to get, but so would it for competing empires.<br> That could lead to potentially three separate "Empires" going to war, which would be epic. <br> (OP) Lady Commander Jaeyme Snow </br></br></br>  <br>I agree with you. New kingdoms needs more power to "fix" themselves.<br><br><br>Yeah, I can imagine a Tyrosh Empire vs. a Bravos Empire, both claiming the famous throne. Would be cool.</br></br></br></br>  Eh....debating if we should start with just three. <br> (OP) Lady Commander Jaeyme Snow </br>  <br>Rolling for Dragons? <br><br> Shae the Funny Whore <br> Pentos </br></br></br></br>  <br>Let's wait, or maybe later we can find more players.

Anything else, other than minor Kings for houses who have such canon thrones, or objectives that directly oppose those Three Thrones, just make the games both longer and more complex, especially as the average Go/b/ player is now more inclined to simply avoid conflict, attack neutral houses, and hugbox the few endgame players that aren't trying to diplomatically arrange an endmup with little to no war.<br><br> Seaborne </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hail the king in the north, Stark.

We are fucked</br></br></br></br></br>    The Fermi paradox is the paradox that if there are so many stars in our milky way galaxy alone, with many planets orbiting those, why is there no evidence for life outside our planet?  <br><br><br>im not writing this shit out, but basically this<br><br>http://imgur.com/gallery/Wtog9 <br><br>  the great filter will destroy us </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  bump  aliens cannot ignore our girth forever    <br>Its an interesting theory.<br><br>But, if aliens are so advanced, they could find ways to shield all outside contact to an entire solar system+ for any civilization that isn't advanced enough.<br><br>There would probably be some way to hide their progress from us that we can't even comprehend the scope of.</br></br></br></br></br>  I honestly feel like we are the first. Have you seen how fast our technology and minds have expanded in the past couple of years?!<br><br>We are already planning (albeit rudimentary) colonization of Mars. We haven't heard shit anywhere else. We are getting close to becoming a Type I civilization.<br><br>And our brains are continually evolving.</br></br></br></br>  Timing could be big reason why too.<br><br>Think about how long civilization has existed, how long we've had high technology, space flight etc.<br><br>Relative to most time scales, it's no time at all. Assuming the universe is essentially uniform throughout, that doesn't guarantee that civilizations or evolution take place simultaneously on different worlds.<br><br>A civilization that's 7000 years old destroys itself right as the first humans are creating cities, then we destroy ourselves right as another civilization is coming to life elsewhere.

Perhaps no technologically advanced aliens have ever made it to our neck of the woods. Better not to have them show up as they will likely arrive as conquerors if they do show up.</br>    <br>Not true, we have a theoretical model that would make ft. travel possible, plus we've had some relatively new breakthroughs that bring us closer to FTL travel.</br>  <br>FTL is only based on the laws of physics that we currently know.

This is the question people fail to ask when they speculate that life exists on suitable planets. The chance that a lifeform comes into being through chance, being capable of reproducing, gathering energy, excreting waste, so unlikely (x0.00001 for it to surviveand actually reproduce) the only reason life doesn't seem rare to us is because we are life, and wherever it may arise that is where it finds itself. The dream is for us to not be alone but that's all it is. Don't let your faggy desires bias your thoughts.</br>  <br> except that it's true </br>  <br>Another is that species whether intelligent or not which are confined to one planet are common to see for a more advanced species with interstellar capability and so not so interesting. And also that being in contact with them past their stone ages would be interrupting their natural growth.<br><br>Fermi paradox asks "why haven't there been evidence of them anywhere yet?" but if you look at old earth ruins there are definitely some evidence of advanced building techniques the ancient world wouldn't have had on their own.

They probably wouldn't know about each other either. <br>And that's just our local galaxy. <br>It is totally pointless to speculate.<br>We'll never know. And if our descendents ever do find out, our ramblings will look worse than the monsters drawn on medieval maps.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Life? Given the right conditions is probably not all that unlikely. Now, that's not complex life or intelligent life. Just life. Complex life is a lot harder and intelligent life might be astoundingly rare. We just don't know yet.<br><br>We are not alone. We just might not have any neighbors smarter than a door knob.</br></br></br>  <br> Stones precision cut seemingly with lasers and such. <br>Some people use primitive precision techniques even today.<br>For a fine, smooth, even surface, some people like to use manual labor, and a more primitive tool, sandpaper.</br></br></br>  The real problem is actually building materials. How far do you think we'd have gotten without iron as a building material? Do you know how rare iron is geologically elsewhere? How much of a crapshoot our iron was? I'll break it down the best i can<br> can't entirely remember how long ago exactly <br> the earth is a molten hunk of rock floating in space <br> iron is so heavy it sinks in this watery rock right to the core <br> its so heavy we don't actually have any iron left up top on the surface <br> earth cools and we have so little iron its not even funny <br> along comes this new type of life called cyanobacteria <br> green bastards start photosynthesis <br> all this new oxygen lets the iron oxide and attach to air moleculars letting it disseminate into the water <br> so much iron is released using this that for a few million years our blue oceans turn a sickly green <br> the atmosphere becomes super saturated with oxygen and the bacteria die off from lack of CO2 comparable to when they evolved for <br> the iron now starts to settle as free oxygen seeps out of water into atmosphere <br> iron makes a nice layer at the bottom of these oceans and seas <br>That iron made all those years ago before shit even had eyes is the very iron we mine and the ONLY accessible iron we have. We wouldn't be anywhere near our technological level without iron and the little iron we do have is only there after a very specific set of events that not only gave this planet water and oxygen the things we NEED to live but it took all that time to accumulate resources AND the time for that exact strain of bacteria to have that exact set of respiration and then have the genes and capabilities of spreading as far as it did. How many planets out there have the correct amount of water, light, heat, solid land, time, materials, and location then how many of them had bacteria that exhales oxygen in a water based enviroment and managed to survive long enough and be wide spread enough for what iron could be stripped from that planet?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tl;Dr you have no idea how much of a fluke our civilization is don't hold out for it having happened elsewhere.</br>  <br>10x10^-100 x 0.00001 x 10x10^("SPACE'S VASTNESS") still pretty fucking unlikely smart boy</br>  <br>There could be an abundance of a different type of metal on a different planet, one that doesn't even exist on our periodic table.</br>  <br>No it isn't. Learn probability and don't assume the universe is infinite. Time is infinite</br>  <br>nope, I believe in aliens. I don't believe in religious art as proof of aliens, especially when they have been debunked already<br>nice try, Freeman, you idiot.</br></br>  <br>Not really man, any more elements past what we know to exist would be incredibly unstable.</br>  <br>  *at this moment in time <br>faggot</br></br>  <br>What</br>  <br>Physically impossible. We have the periodic table mapped out. We could create heavier elements artificially but they're inherently unstable and would be many many times heavier and sink faster and deeper in crust formation and they would be shit building materials. Theres a reason we use iron for building pretty much everything.</br>  Lurking.  Distance. The laws of physics are immutable.  consider all of our long range observations; they're all looking at different snap shots in the universes' past and despite all the time we've traveled looking at polaroid shots of the universes history, nothing to point to intelligent life.<br><br>personally I just think other "intelligent" life would be so alien and bizarre to us, that we would never notice it unless it came up to us and slapped in the face</br></br>  This takes a round-a-bout swing at it, Funny as well as poignant.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=HPl<wbr>10L40pBM</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>A planet of sea monsters and dinosaurs. No asteroid to end their reign.</br>  <br><br>Fair enough.<br><br>What are your thoughts on aliens then? I just want to hear everyones opinions on all of this.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not true. We've already proven the speed of light is variable and controllable to a degree in laboratory tests. That photons can be split into 2+ copies using only one to start with I.e. Infinite energy if done in sufficient quantities, making new quarks that can't exist by smashing particles, etc. either we know so little about physics is laughable and comparable to not knowing anything or the universe is playing by a different set of rules entirely and what we think we know is just the first steps to a bigger game.</br>  Never realized so many imgurians used 4chan.  <br><br>Pretty fucking obvious.<br><br>People report them regularly. They've been here since they kickstarted the Cambrian Explosion and hung around to see what happened. They're over 10 billion years old and so advanced they've evolved way, way past our biological ceiling of comprehension. Faced with something so perplexing stiff-as-a-board minds retreat into the comfort of bias.<br><br>Google "Clyde Tombaugh UFO" and then think about how flawed Fermi's logic was.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>if you have a colony ship capable of sustaining infinite generations, then it wouldn't really matter if you can go at the speed of light or not. then there are still plenty of theories on traveling vast distances without needing to go fast, such as bending space</br>  <br>P.s. Forgot to mention that photon one would not only be infinite energy but also CREATING energy which is also supposed to be impossible.</br>  <br> they will likely arrive as conquerors if they do show up. <br>Nah. What would they want here? Resources? Other planets without hostile creatures have them in abundance. Slaves? If there were ever a species bred for war in this universe, it's us. We'd sooner destroy all existence on the planet before allowing a complete hostile takeover.<br><br>They'd waste so many resources and so much time traveling here all for nothing. No advanced species is that stupid.</br></br></br></br>  <br>people report what they want to see. probably why we still get Elvis sightings. its just inconclusive hearsay</br>  <br>4. We are the last.</br>  <br>Um, no. The elements don't work like that.</br>  <br>Variable as in you can slow in down through different mediums, not as in you can speed it up.<br><br>Even if you could achieve FTL, which is more or less impossible without "negative mass" and "exotic matter", no meaningful communication could happen between your vessel and Earth, so you end up with nothing but islands of isolated communities around different stars. Not some grand, unified, human empire.</br></br></br>  <br>Like alien ideas? What the could possibly be physically?</br>  I think people fail to realize what infinity means. it kind of must exist. millions of civilizations could have risen and fallen before us there could just be nothing around us right now. I would imagine life would make some self replicating satellites but even then what are the odds we would even encounter them or any evidence at all.  <br> grand, unified, human empire. <br>you're the only one talking about that, buddy.</br></br>  <br><br>"Colony ship?"<br><br>Time dilates. Once a Bussard ramjet got to relativistic speeds the crew could cover the entire Milky Way in a single lifespan. Might be a long time on Earth, but not on the ship.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The universe is ~14 billions years old.<br>The milky way is 100 000 light years across.<br>This means that if a species left their home planet 200 000 years before we developed the technology to do the same, assuming that they could only travel at half the speed of light, it would take them 0.0002 billion years (200 000 years) to travel the full length of the milky way galaxy and reach Earth.<br>Similarly, the nearest galaxy to us is 179000 light years away (small magellanic cloud). This would take ~ twice as long to reach us 0.0004 billion years (400 000 years, not accounting for red shift. It may be impossible to travel between galaxies because of how fast we are expanding away from them)<br><br>OK. So, let's just assume for the sake of it that the conspiracy theory is correct and aliens have been visiting us, monitoring and abducting certain people.<br><br>From what I have heard discussed through watching documentaries on the subject, I have put together a list of traits which seem to describe the alien agenda. I will relay them as facts out of convenience. To be taken with a pinch of salt:<br><br>ALIEN AGENDA<br><br>1) they haven't killed us (pilots and astronauts have come into contact and nearly all recorded cases humans have not been harmed, but some pilots reported having problems with electronics if they had been ordered to shoot down the UFO)<br>2) they are interested in preventing nuclear war (they have deactivated nuclear bases and performed other activity around nuclear silos)<br>3) they have been present within our solar system for a very long time (it is very unlikely that they would have arrived in entirety at the turn of the century when we were capable of detecting them)<br>4) they are bound by equal physical laws that we are (they are not demons, spiritual or extra dimensional beings. Sorry, that is preposterous)<br>5) they have technology that appears magical to us (caught on radar traveling speeds exceeding 30000mph, performing right angle maneuvers that would</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>what about...<br> - we are not important enough to be acknowledged</br></br>  <br>snap a human into pieces)<br>6) there are many different species (supposedly)<br>7) people are abducted and in most cases, returned unharmed with efforts taken to prevent memory of abduction (lots of cases of this. Lacking evidence.)<br>8) they do not make themselves known to the public in present age, although it is unknown if they ever did to our predecessors<br>9) there appears to be a growing public consciousness towards acceptance of an alien presence in popular media i.e movies, internet, news<br>10) we have seen their motherships orbiting Saturn, collecting energy from the sun, lunar bases on the backside of the moon 'Tower of Babel', now recent unidentified white spots on Ceres (no, I don't believe Ceres' spots are anything to do with aliens, but, hey, it's topical as of making this post. Images and videos can be faked or misinterpreted.)<br><br>All of this would point to one answer: They are here to create hybrid races using life on earth as an incubation chamber for beneficial genetic mutations. Physical beauty, structural strength, cellular adaptations, immunities to viruses, organ efficiency, stuff like lactose tolerance which developed in humans some 8000 years ago in Turkey when we domesticated cattle. The applications are vast. It's even possible that because of relativity, time passes much quicker here on Earth than it does in their spaceship/ location elsewhere in the universe. That is, if one were abducted and taken on board their spaceship, you may only feel like 2 hours have passed but when you are returned to Earth 5 days have passed. This would make it more 'profitable' for them to let life evolve beneficial mutations and simply take the most compatible, or best, results. This is just wild speculation, of course.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And all they've managed to figure out is that 10% of humans don't mind a bit of anal probing.</br>  <br>Life exists to spread out and evolve. Humanity and descendants of humanity won't be perfect, but they will be good enough to survive. I think that everything I have said here is a fair indication of how humanity would act if it were in the position of observing an alien planet but did not see any benefit to interacting with them on a social level. We would be interested in their survival advantages and trying to utilize those developments to our advantage. It would be a relationship of mutual benefit- we would adapt to new environments and they would evolve, albeit against their will.</br>  <br>not talking about going light speed though. that was the entire point</br>  <br>Wtf does this generation have to worry about, we're all gonna die in that time span</br>  <br><br>You didn't google Tombaugh, did you? People fail to weigh evidence appropriately far more often.</br></br>  <br>The NWO is inevitable, and for the betterment of mankind.</br>  <br>You didn't google Elvis sightings did you?</br>  <br>we might see evidence that supports the theory's in a century or so. seeing actual FL will take longer</br>  <br>No. You don't understand how this shit works. Infinity exists yes but the MATERIAL UNIVERSE created at the big bang is FINITE and is spreading into infinity.</br>  <br><br>You forget time dilation, and you also stupidly assume that our technology is the universe's pinnacle. If anybody ever finds and learns to deflect a graviton time travel in either direction will be a snap.</br></br>  <br>He's talking about how the sum of any infinite series is 1, not about the size or shape of the universe.</br>  <br>Are you aware of how bullshit big the universe is?</br>  <br><br>Cute. Google Tombaugh.</br></br>  <br><br>Lol. I'm a fortean. I know people who have collected them for decades. They're informative, even if they don't provide any evidence of the Risen King.</br></br>  <br><br>I think u made a huge jump to your conclusion there, boss; more likely they're just tagging and tracking the way we do with wildlife- explains why they don't "make themselves known" to us...they're trying to disturb the natural habitat as little as possible.</br></br>  <br>Fermi paradox isn't a paradox.<br><br>It's just a matter of the teeny, tiny, minuscule reach of any signal revealing earth lifes's existence out into the universe, and the unliklihood that another intelligent being would happen to be interested in our little mossy rock eons before anything interesting on it was happening in order to notice once it did...<br><br>it's a matter of proportion.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>But you're using weak sarcasm to dodge uncomfortable evidence.</br></br>  <br><br>That's just speculation. It could happen (although very unlikely) so arent you curious about how others perceive the situation?</br></br>  <br>You fail or ignore the fact we already exist, Or do we, This question is kinda moot tbh simulation theory makes more sense.</br>  If you're going to enslave humanity with a NWO, why do it now instead of back when we were just a series of small, isolated communities?  <br>you're not providing any. all you're doing is telling people to google something.</br>  <br>Well the apparent probability of life arising on a habitable planet is 100% based on our observable evidence, so it's not unreasonable to deduce that life (not necessarily intelligent) is extremely common in the universe.</br>  <br>Batshit crazy people gotta have something to sell their shity youtube channels on eh.</br>  <br>those are some pretty hefty claims anon<br>and a pretty flimsy story backing them up</br></br>  <br><br>Well who cares about the name. What are your thoughts? <br><br>Do you think aliens exist? If not, why? If they do, why haven't we heard from them?<br><br>If it's a matter of proportion, do you believe in aliens but think they are too far away?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  An alien civilization with the capability to travel across the universe would also be advanced enough that they would be able to learn anything g they wanted about us without actually I treating with use or even coming here, and why would they want to. We think they would want to travel and conquer, because we're approaching from the mindset of a bunch of barely sentient semi apes and conquering and exploring is what we would do. Aliens that have been able to have the level of cohesion and enlighten I their society to achieve that capacity probably wouldn't give much of a fuck about using it.  Idk man...idk<br><br><br>but much like Michiu said in the interview the pic is based off of...if we ever encounter them....chance are it won't be in peace....and we'll have our asses handed to us...because chances are they will think differently ten anything else on earth, fight differently, be higher in tech then we are<br><br>but even then if they did think like us....what does humanity do when we tend to find new civilizations...we conquer them and/or nearly eradicate them.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Even more likely they're billions of years old and responsible for lots of phenomena we don't understand. Might be all those UFOs people see, along with religious miracles, bigfoot sightings, and so forth are all part of a control system leading us to a goal millions of years beyond out ability to understand.<br><br>But you smarties have it all figured out from the comfort of your bedrooms. Congrats.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>And you're too lazy to do even that much.</br></br>  <br>Fermi didn't realize that we have at least 4 celestial bodies right in our own little solar system that may very well have life living on them. Europa, Ganymede, Callisto, and Titan.<br><br>...shit could get real weird, the day we send our probes down through that ice.</br></br></br>  <br>No, I actually mentioned time dilation. I also suggest that UFO technology is far in advance to our own. Can you even read? Jesus Christ.</br>  <br>Very few in this thread claiming to have all the answers but you seem to assume people are even ringing their hands of the debate at all when no one is, did you read the thread at all.</br>  <br>No. Aliens are not greenpeace. I seriously feel like I am talking to retards here.</br>  <br><br>Those numbers dont make sense; earth was only around for a billion years before life began. Basically, as soon as it finished cooling and liquid water formed there was life. It seems more likely that wherever the conditions are correct for carbon based lifeforms to exist, they will exist and life is far more common in the universe than we know.</br></br>  <br>Underrated post</br>  It seems like when people think of aliens they think that they are extremely advanced.<br><br>We have done space flight and have sent probes into space (granted not very far).<br><br>Perhaps there is a civilization, similar to ours, that have just figured out interstellar flight but haven't mastered it. <br><br>Perhaps in the short future this civilization will find us and try to teach us. Maybe they already came to Earth but we were too primitive at the time...<br><br>Am i the only on who thinks that?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How do you know<br>Maybe meeting new alien spaces is commonplace and not getting into contact is prime directive</br></br>  <br>Oh, they've pretty much debunked most of this.<br>there's plenty of evidence that the ancients knew how to soften stone. so when placed under weight, would form shape together and create the illusion that it were cut to fit so nicely.<br>The tech was kind of a shamen-esque pracice, not for everyone. so centuries later of many of these civs dying out, only a few master craftsmen knew the secret, then a king of some old country made it so that only the king and offspring of the craftsmen knew the secret and they we're all murdered in an uprising and the last knowledge of the trade died.<br>tho yes, lifting some of those stones stil remains a mystery.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's because I get so fucking sick of all of you asshats thinking so fucking small. Chances of anything getting here that's even close to our level of understanding is just about nil. If they're here - and they are - they've got to be one HELL of a lot more advanced than we are. So advanced they represent an entirely order of being. Something...godlike.</br></br>  <br>I've already said my thoughts.<br>Whatever alien life there may be, hasn't had a chance to know we're even here yet, because our outbound signal hasn't reached anywhere yet.<br><br>Any alien coincidentally listening in for a signal coming from earths direction, wouldn't be seeing us yet.<br><br>Even if they had supernatural technology that could travel faster than light and tear huge holes all over space-time, first they'd have to know we're worth visiting, and nigga, we haven't been broadcasting long enough to alert anyone to diddly.<br><br>Best chance we have for discovering extra terrestrial life is in our own solar system on the jovian moons, purely because it's right next door.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Then how come we aren't already conquered? Why would they bother to mask their presence if they're obviously far more technologically advanced than we are? Have you met them? Have you asked if they're Greenpeace?<br><br>You're the retard.<br>You are.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>True, but how many times has humanity said "Fuck it" to this rule.<br><br>Whose to say that alien races dont do the same?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it looks like a flying tank</br>  <br>no you fucking faggot. Star Trek is a human interpretation of space exploration, with human ideologies. HUMAN. As in NOT ALIEN. Not to mention, its target audience is casual entertainment for average person with 9-5 office jobs.<br><br>Put simply, an ancient space-soap on TV is in indicative of how an intelligence species bent on survival would behave in space.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Or you could rub two sides of the stone together, wearing both sides down until you couldn't slide a thread between them.<br><br>Which is how they did it, by the way.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe they're not as retarded as humans<br>Maybe violating the non-contact directive is under thread of homeplanet Exterminatus</br></br>  <br>topkek</br>  <br>Bear in mind you,me and anyone else in this thread are but a small number of people who have asked ourselves or others questions like this, There are far more intelligent people alive right now who are asking these same questions, There have been far more intelligent people before we came into this world who as well asked these questions and got fucking nowhere. We are a very limited species as far as universal understanding goes, Calm your tits,Close your eyes and listen to something peaceful.</br>  <br>You're describing bacteria. They run life on earth. &amp; we're discovering more and more each year, they run our bodies &amp; minds.<br><br>Some ancient fuckin genetics in that shit too. Been around forever. And the shit survives space and entry through the atmosphere. However, genetics reveals the bacterium we've found and tested to be quite terrestrial in origin.<br><br>...that said, you can scoop up a handful of dirt in your back yard, and find 40 new bacteria never before documented. That's how much there still is to know about the #1 most influential life form on the planet yet.</br></br></br></br></br>  /  <br><br>Damn son, good answer.</br></br>  <br><br>Yet again you didn't read my post.<br><br>Well done, moron.

If you'd rather call God an "Alien Superintelligence" I wouldn't argue with you.<br><br>What I'm trying to say is that people who have asked these questions hard enough, and desperately enough, claim to have pierced the veil.

Do you think there is a better answer?</br></br></br></br>  <br>To call anything alien on this planet is fucking asinine in the extreme, It's the same as idiots calling anything observed on our planet "Unnatural" If it exists here, Is observable then it is not alien to our planet or unnatural for it to happen, Maybe rare but neither alien or unnatural.<br><br>Unless it,Them,They,Something comes from outside of what we know or understand it isn't alien at all and certainly not unnatural, Fucking hate that word, Yes I am mad, Fuck you fagget.</br></br></br>  <br>the sun will explode, we are never safe until unlock the secrets of interstellar travel and space habitation in general.

We ignored them for Economics. Besides don't get why people always assume there has to be more advanced civilizations out there.

I assume there is intelligent life elsewhere in the universe. Maybe they have started exploring the universe, but it's pretty unlikely that they'll find us, as even our radio signals have only reached about less than 100 light years. When they do discover them, if they do that is, it'll still take them a long ass time to get to earth.  <br>i keked</br>  <br><br> the lack of evidence is evidence  <br><br>You're not smarter than anyone, boss</br></br></br></br>  <br>No thanks, I don't want to go to jail for molesting a 12 year old</br>   right now there's about two hundred extraterrestrial /b/s where dumbfucks call each other retarded for believing or not believing in aliens and we'll never know   <br>Wow ur so fucking stupid lmao<br>The literature of which u speak has been passed from generations to generations, edited and revised, etc. There would've been more shit in the bible and other literature revealing aliens if the Vatican and other knights templar/illuminati type niggers didn't revise it<br>Tldr; Jesus Moses Mohammad Buddha = all alien life forms that existed on earth.

Sorry about that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Get back to youtube conspiracy videos fagget.</br>  <br>most of those radio signals up until about the 1950s were so low powered they were lost in static within a light year.<br><br>Only with the advent of TV broadcasts did we broadcast with enough power to even make it out of our solar system, and then only TV for quite a while.<br><br>The detectable bubble of human influence we live in in the universe only has about a 70 light year radius, tops. It's nothing.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>One of the very few decent youtube channels worth bothering with.</br>  <br>Buddha isn't. Person you fucking retard. It's a title.<br><br>Also, rebirth in Buddhism isn't something that happens after death unless you deal with Tibetan Buddhism in which case you're dealing with other religions mixed in with Buddhism.

Why should there be? We've been able to detect signals for about 150 years at best. We've been able to detect remote signals for about 70. Do you understand how large and old the universe is? Calculate 70 into 13 billion - it's not even the blink of an eye on universal time scales, add distance onto that and you might as well say "well I should win the lottery if I look in this bin and find the winning lottery ticket." It's nonsense.<br><br>It would be very very surprising if we had received evidence of life elsewhere within 70 years of looking into a 13 billion year old ~infinite universe that we can't even see the extent of.</br></br></br></br></br>  didnt any of you see the strange creature in the closeup of pluto?

Sorry.</br>  <br>so is winning the lottery, yet it happens all the time. if the chance is &gt;0, it will happen.</br>  The Fermi Paradox is a bad joke.<br><br>The "Where is everybody?" question was posed a few decades after the invention of the fucking radio. Once we thought of the statistical likelihood that we weren't the only life in the universe, we started shitting our pants about why we haven't made contact yet. <br><br>3 problems that disprove the fermi paradox. Speed of radio signal transmission. Signal loss and degradation, and the timeframe in which we've been waiting for a reply.<br><br>The inverse square law basically states that the further a signal travels, the wider it will spread, and the weaker it will become. Over the course of a few lightyears, the signal may become so weak it's indistinguishable from background radiation. This may be remedied by having prior knowledge of the location of an alien species and sending a focused beam of information.<br><br>Assuming that, the rate at which those signals travel is vastly too slow to have any meaningful contact. Let's just say, there's a planet we want to send a signal to that's 100 ly away.<br><br>We send a signal and it will take 100 fucking years before they receive it. Then they decode, put together a reply and transmit back. Another 100 years. So if you sent a message. Your great-great-great grandchildren will receive a reply. Not a viable form of communication.<br><br>Also, even if we have neighbors that are half that distance at 50 ly. We still have only had any meaningful radio power for the past 70 year. And have only really started listening to the cosmos for the past 40.<br><br>Radio signals are a bullshit way to talk in space. We haven't found any better ways yet. Any advanced space fairing civilization will have.<br><br>The Fermi paradox is the result of impatient small human minds trying to deal with the vastness of the cosmos.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You're both stupid, just admit it.</br></br>  <br>Roughly every 7 years you're a completely new you.</br>  <br><br> Your IQ clearly very low <br><br>Grammar, genius</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>pretty much this, no way an intergalactic space traveling race would not want to fuck us, no matter how primitive we seem to them. <br><br>At best, we'd all be sex slaves right now.</br></br></br></br>  <br> More developed <br>Kek</br></br>  we were planted by humanoids on planets they deem habitable, we wont observe contact until we reach a certain milestone, they probably have countless earth like civilizations active on the basis to see variance in societal growth  <br>Maybe English isn't his mother language, Small minded idiots, Did you forget you're on the internet champ?</br>  I'm just going to leave this here<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=I-r<wbr>c6S1JHdw</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Grammar?

Do you think we will ever run into them?</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, I just omit words sometimes when I don't care who I am speaking to.

Extinction events that almost left our predecessors extinct themselves.

Then mention my material and claim it as your own, all the while forgetting about me as 'that guy who couldn't spell'. Gee, what a complete retard he was, wasn't he!<br><br>I hope you realize that your response is a defense mechanism to shield your ego. <br><br>And for the record, the only reason somebody picked me up on omitting a word is because they couldn't compete with me on an intellectual level the subject being discussed.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That would be cool As fuck to see one in a telescope munching on mars</br>  <br><br>So you think nature formed us and we are the only ones in the galaxy then?<br><br>Honestly, just curious.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's pretty unlikely. I'm not the guy you're replying to, but yeah.</br>  <br>never know. they could find us accidentally.</br>  <br> There would've been more shit in the bible and other literature revealing aliens if the Vatican and other knights templar/illuminati type niggers didn't revise it <br><br>Shit you are stupid son. Probably think that makes you some sort of critical mind if you doubt the scientific consensus on all costs and parrot evey ridiculous conspiracy theory.<br><br><br>To the fermi paradox, it has some really weak arguments. First of all how do we know there is more than one civilization in our milky way, maybe intelligent life is much more unlikely than what we want to believe, second WHY on earth should a civilization consistently try to colonize whole milky ways over millions of years. It costs a shit ton of ressources and there'S not so much personal gain for individuals already living (presumeably) pretty well off in advanced societies, furthermore it implies that a civ would not change is not subject to political and cultural change and just carries on with the same programme for millions of years.<br>In short this so called paradox is built on a hella unstable ground and claims that are unproven at best.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>in a way, yes<br>Adapting to the level of the average response I was receiving. It's nice to analyze my complex behaviour sometimes.

The next big extinction will happen, and it's anyone's guess if humans are able to survive it.</br></br></br>  <br>lol, that's cute. It's just an innocent bit of drama to get you all riled up. It's super effective.</br>  <br>Shit, this is getting more ridiculous by the minute<br>Just look at these fucking posts<br>It's like I stumbled upon forum posts of 15 year old me</br></br></br>  <br><br>I think there's a slim chance we could.

So much weird shit, but a few years went by and my time on the internet desensitized me, so I came back to /b/, had some high-quality laughs and watched OP do some really dumb shit just because some guy got dubs. <br>Then /b/ got gradually shittier.<br>I still come here and soft through the shit to find an occasional good laugh.<br>It's mostly shitposting bananas, b8 threads, and OP not delivering these days though.</br></br></br>  Because some times I can't help not procrastinating  <br>There was MLP when you were first shown 4chan? fuck ive been here too long</br>  <br>because i love wasting time</br>  bewbies  No one will probably make another one.<br>Jellyfish appreciation thread.</br>  boykiss  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;629856115 <br>Not sure a bad thing, just gotta remember to not smother and let him have time without you around.<br><br>Time for rows 3x12 to defeat.</br></br></br>  <br>They can deage themselves.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;629856545 <br>Don't waste your time.<br><br><br>It's not something I want to talk about.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ahh OK then. So some self reflection I'm sure you can figure it out. What happy thing did you do today?</br>  <br>Like i said, if i could forgo relationships for more money i would.<br><br><br> tfw it took my 20 minutes to realize the thing on the camera wasnt a ghost, its a fucking spider crawling on the camera. <br>God im stupid.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>aces is gay</br>    <br>I'm not the one who needs self reflection.<br><br>Uh... Nothing of note.<br><br><br>Were you scared</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I hate you, boxer-eating slackjawed scuming Carrion.</br>  <br>Why would I eat underwear?</br>    <br>Nope, just annoyed.<br>Id have to work at a haunted post.<br><br><br>And who are you tiger man?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well guess there is nothing you can do but get over whatever it is that's got you in this mood.</br>  <br>Go play in traffic.</br>  <br>Just a muscle tiger in training at the gym.<br>Who are you annon?</br></br>  <br>That's an interesting reaction to the supernatural.<br><br><br>It's not that easy.</br></br></br></br>    My god you people are so shit  <br>Aces. Lord of unfinished ideas and half-clev<br><br><br>Im not a very interesting person</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah I know the feeling. It's like you've done everything right or so you think, and you just don't understand why it went the way it did. Maybe it wasn't your fault and they just couldn't accept that they are the ones that fucked up and placed the blame on you as their coping mechanism.</br>      <br>It's a huge mix of bullshit but it's me that causes everything. It's why I'd rather not talk about it.<br><br><br>Are we the same person</br></br></br></br>      <br>Welcome to the self help thread, what's your issue?<br><br>Aces?? So you like the red baron? Flying high and defending your country from invasion?<br><br>In time you'll heal.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, because i am Aces. I'm just unfathomably boring.</br>    <br>It's complicated and stupid.<br><br><br>Are you Aces though. Or am I Aces.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Pfft. No such thing, surely you did something interesting today/tonight?</br>    <br>we are all. that's why we're here.</br>  <br>Hmm, Well i do always fly high and i consider myself a patriot above all else, even when my country is wrong and foolish.<br>Perhaps i am.</br></br>  <br>If it's stupid then why has it got you so twisted??</br>    <br>What strains you smoke/vape then? I prefer skunk number 1.</br>    <br>Because I get overly emotional about stupid things.</br>  <br>Aces reaches far beyond a person, Aces is a state of being. Accept your nature.<br><br><br>I woke up.<br>Honestly the only thing i find fascinating about my life is the dreams i have.<br><br><br>Eh, misery loves Aces. And company i guess.<br>As long as they dont track mud on my carpet.<br>Its from istanbul.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>        <br>Use logic then, it'll never fail you.<br><br>So you lucid dream?</br></br></br>  <br>I actually dont smoke. Not that i hate it or anything, i just dont.</br>  You are so shit aces  <br>Ohh i dont have this one thanks!!<br><br>So you vape its OK to admit that ;-)</br></br></br>  <br>It's complicated. I just can't explain more.<br><br><br>Deep</br></br></br></br>    <br>coolbeans</br>  <br>It can never be so complicated that you can't explain it. It might just be embarrassing to you be inconsequential to everyone else.</br>  <br>Nope, i let my subconscious mind weave its own narrative.<br>One day i dreamed of a museum in the year 2435 on a distant planet. The trees were silver and their leaves were blood red and dangled down like streamers.</br></br>    <br>Yes i am.<br><br><br>But those aare mouth fedoras!<br><br>I dont vape either.<br><br><br>Life is nothing if one does not attempt to think deep. At least every so often.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not embarrassing. Thinking about makes me upset and I just don't like explaining it.<br><br><br>Wax on wax off</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kill yourself</br>  <br>Its 7pm, no one drives past my house<br><br>also ur fat</br></br></br>    <br>Cool.

The entire solar region (group of planets) had a heavy mix of almost Asianic-Pacific island culture influences in its designs and architecture. I had a very nice apartment there.<br>I'm always chill.<br>Today is thankfully my day off, go home and sleep it away.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh.<br><br><br>Why can't I be a fur person</br></br></br></br>  <br>What did you expect?? Intellectual conversations??</br>  <br>Because you have been posting Some plastic girl toy thing.<br><br>Time for face pulls 5x18</br></br></br>  <br>Yep. And im almost always too boring or too offputting to people, so i have trouble making small talk, then people think im weird when i bring this up.</br>  <br><br>well post till they give up faggot.<br><br> Jellyfish reproduce both sexually and asexually. </br></br></br></br>    <br>Then dont, kunt.</br>  <br>Funny that they have no brain and still survive to this day</br>     Plastic girl toy thing <br><br><br>Small talk is impossible.</br></br></br>  <br>I'll let you suck my dick.</br>    hey /b/, just letting you know I can kill you.

Masturbation will calm you down, make sure you eat your ejaculate.</br>     Upon reaching adult size, jellyfish spawn daily given enough food. <br><br>perfection</br></br>    I want to start watching Naruto.<br>Should I start with Shippuden ?</br>  To be honest, no. You should watch from original on just to know what the fuck it going on storywise.  <br>you should start by killing yourself</br>  <br>It's not too late OP. You don't have to evolve to this higher level of faggotry</br>  Naruto is a shit showfor young kids or autists with shit taste.  No, watch first part first  <br>STart with classic naruto. I know it is very bad but otherwise you won't understand shit watching the shippuden.</br>  <br>Shippuden won't make a lick of sense if you haven't seen the original 3 thousand episodes</br>  <br>The start and end of original naruto is good. But the fucking filler between episdoe 120-190 is awful hard to watch.</br>  Start with episode 1, google a filler guide.<br><br>There's only 150ish episodes of the original series, a lot of which you can skip through since 3-5 minutes they recap, 2 minutes for the intro, 2 for the ending and preview next episode so really in the end you're only watching about 15 minutes of content per episode. You should be able to get through them really fast if you remember how the previous episode ends and skip ahead to the place where they start again. <br><br>Shippuden has even more filler and it's a slower pace, but in the end the strategy still works.</br></br></br></br>  Watch the first naruto. It basically explains how naruto sakura and sasuke met  <br>Need background and moar on this picture ffs</br>  To be honest, I started watching Naruto and I fucking hate it. I want to feel bad for Naruto because everybody is a prick to him, but then he acts like an annoying cunt so I hate him.  <br>Watch till chuunin exams. Stop watching<br><br>No but really if you want this story read the manga the anime is terrible</br></br></br>  <br> 150ish episodes of the original series <br>Are you fucking stupid? There are at least 300+ episodes that aren't filler.<br><br> since 3-5 minutes they recap <br> 2 minutes for the intro <br> you're only watching about 15 minutes of content per episode <br>You are clearly stupid. Episodes are roughly 22-24 minutes long. At maximum 4 of those minutes are intro's, recaps and endings all in one. There's a good 20 minutes to watch.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  The voice acting for the English Naruto drive me up the fuckin wall so I settled with reading if that helps.  <br> original series <br>hes wrong, but so are you.</br></br>  New spiderman thread<br><br><br>Old thread</br></br></br>       making spiderman thread <br><br>newfag, you are the cancer killing this board</br></br>    <br>/b/ has been dead a while now nigger</br>        <br>dude its fucking genus. how the fuck are you supposed to derail a mother fucking spider man thread? we're all fucked.</br>            <br>Deadpool.

The whole world hates niggers because they are stupid, smelly and basically worthless.<br><br>Now, before you make yourself look like even more of a bafoon go do some research.
