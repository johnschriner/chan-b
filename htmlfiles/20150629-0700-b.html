Tell me about the different dimensions.  Time is the fourth dimension  <br>well each dimensions is said to be a right angle to the origional. such as you cant have the first dimension which is a flat line, without the zeroth dimension which is a point. because in order to have a line you must have to points intersecting.</br>  ill post another image  this image is more of a visual depiction of the idea i just explained  One dimension is a straight line with no thickness.<br><br>Two dimensions is a plane - a flat sheet with no depth. It has height and width, but no depth.<br><br>Three dimensions is the everyday world - height, width, and depth all exist.<br><br>Nominally a 4th dimension would be at right angles to height, width, and depth, but off into a direction that we can't perceive, in the same way that something limited to the plane of 2 dimensions can't perceive the 3rd dimension.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the fourth dimension is time you moron.</br>  The 4th dimension would be something out of the realm of what we can comprehend. For example 2d objects dont see things in the 2 dimension they see them in the 1st same is said for us we dont perceive things in the 3rd dimension we actually see thingx in the 2nd dimension. so basically youd be seeing through fucking walls  The fourth dimensions is time<br><br>There are no dimensions beyond that, or at least not within this universe.</br></br>  <br>Also let me say that i am open to any new ideas and information about perceived consciousness and well most anything that will enlighten me</br>  wrong fourth dimension not time  <br>like a contractor looking at blueprints?</br>  @624551890<br>says u buddy</br>  <br>Don't much about that but The Fifth Dimension is arguably The Byrds' best album.</br>  <br> The fourth dimensions is time <br><br>For some mathematical calculations, it CAN be considered another dimension. That has nothing to do with this discussion.<br><br> There are no dimensions beyond that, or at least not within this universe. <br><br>Wrong. The folk at CERN have pretty much established that there are higher dimensions, but at such a nano-scale, they really cannot effect our 3 dimensions.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>which would lead to the question of why not this universe right? is it simply because it cannot? or because we can not perceive it that way.</br>  <br>like, kek, man</br>  <br>are there not a believed 11 dimensions?</br>  <br>I think 13 is the number</br>  <br>Why would it stop at 11 dimensions? Wouldn't it be an infinite amount of dimensions? Why is 11 such a special number?</br>  <br>This guy must be Jon Snow</br>  Is spin a dimension?<br>Multiple same-spin objects can't exist at the same point in spacetime, but they can if they have (sufficiently) different spin.</br>  <br> we live in the matrix <br>prove me wrong<br> protip: you cant </br></br></br>  <br>Because 11 allows the majority of the math to work for String Theorists<br><br>Some of their math requires 40 dimensions.</br></br></br>  <br>Why is the ration between diameter and circumference of a circle 3.14159265358979373.... and not something else?<br><br>Some things just are.</br></br></br>  <br>It's very possibly true if our descendants reached technological singularity and began making simulations.</br>  OP HERE; lets switch this to another topic. what are your thoughts on the possibility of our consciousness and or the idea of free will.  <br> The folk at CERN have pretty much established that there are higher dimensions, but at such a nano-scale, they really cannot effect our 3 dimensions <br>It isn't proven though. That's just the leading hypothesis to explain the behavior of subatomic particles traveling at super high speeds.</br></br>  <br>Ok, it makes more sense. And 11 is a prime number.<br><br><br>But still we could be wrong about everything.</br></br></br></br>  <br>yes we could.</br>  <br>Dimensions. Bot alternate realities.

Time is motion. You can have time in 1d, 2d, 3d, 4d etc.</br>  <br>Granted. But, higher dimensions can be inferred from things like quantum experiments such as the double slot experiment.

On a sheet of paper you need two little (non-zero, non-colinear) arrows to make a coordinate system. In 3d you need 3 (non-zero, non-colinear, non-coplanar) arrows to make a coordinate system. In 4d....<br><br>One interesting thing to consider is something like a function f(x) (ie f(x)=x^2). This actually forms an infinite dimensional vector space. This shit is the bread and butter of Quantum Mechanics.<br><br>Our universe appears to be a 4d space-time, and the vector formalism extends to 4D euclidean space easily, but we live in a curved space, so straight up geometric vectors from high school don't work. You have to introduce a way to measure things (a metric) that treats space and time on different footings, although you need all 4 numbers to describe shit.

Any more or less and this universe would not have been able to form.</br>  <br>agreed.see this post<br><br/></br></br>  <br>But quantum mechanics is dependant upon observations. Our actions and inaction directly influence quantum states.</br>  <br>die</br>  A 3 dimensional object casts a 2D shadow<br>A 4D object would have a 3 dimensional shadow.</br>  <br>Scientists tested atoms a bit like the electrons in the double-slit experiment and found that they also respond to a probability wave even though they have mass and interact with all the known forces. Their path collapses either to a particle-like OR a wave-like behavior ONLY AT THE MOMENT of observation, affecting their current state, but also their state somewhat back in time when they were travelling.</br>  <br>If the 4D object is optically clear, will it still project a 3D shadow?</br>  <br>I fucking know right this is huge</br>  <br>Well that depends on if light still reacts in the same way we know and see with 3 and 2D objects with what we call 4D objects. It would be interesting if someone could actually experiment with it.</br>  <br>...or a 2D, or a 1D.<br><br>Think for a second. If you could project a 4D shape to 3D, then you have a 'shadow' of a 4D shape in 3D. But wait, there's more! Now you have a 3D object. Why not project that down to 2D? Induction shows you can project down as many dimensions as you want.<br><br>And you know what else? Lines (1D) can exists in 2D and 3D. You can guess that you can upproject lower dimensional geometry to higher dimensions just fine too.<br><br>I N D U C T I O N</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How to experiment with a 4D object, a 12 page illustrated book by Anon</br>  Since we're constantly in motion through the universe, do you think that's a requirement for time to pass? Like each step we move is also the next step in time, and if we weren't moving time wouldn't happen?  <br>It is. No motion causes "no time to pass", just as experiencing no time implies a perception of no motion (like a photon). Space-time is real.</br>  <br>No. Quite the opposite. The faster you go, the slower time passes for you</br>  <br>if you weren't moving in time, none of your atoms would be moving or interacting with anything, you'd be dead and probably wouldn't even exist.<br><br>But, nothing we know is able to stop moving i.e. nothing goes to 0 kelvin temperature (as far as I know)</br></br></br>  <br>oh yeah thats right, oops</br>  <br>omfg we really are in the matrix... we are so fucked</br>  <br>There's no such thing as shadows. There's light, which operates in 3d space, and a 3d object can block that light, but it blocks it from a portion of 3d space. Only one side of whatever 3d object the light is blocked from will be dark, unless it's angled differently, but 3d objects don't cast 2d shadows.</br>  <br><br>And also, for something to fully stop it would need to have 0 uncertainty into it's velocity/momentum, which leads to an infinity uncertainty at position, leading to something that's located everywhere at the same time.<br>All according to Heisenberg.</br></br></br>  <br>glad someone read this, I brain farted a couple of time while writing it haha. its still accurate tho</br>  <br>Nope. You experience time passing normally for yourself. It's everything else that appears to be running slower.<br><br>Think of muon decays. They decay in a short amount of time. Cosmic rays make muons in the upper atmosphere going close to c. From our point of view the muons should decay by the time they hit the ground, however they don't because in their reference frame not enough time has passed.<br><br>I guess what I'm trying to get at is you always view time as going normally for yourself. It's other's clocks that are doing weird shit.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br> leading to something that's located everywhere at the same time. <br> inb4 some faggot says it's god </br></br>  <br>Yeah, if you are a photon, your clock is still and your start/arrival time is the same, but we humans have to wait for them to travel and we can calculate their speed. Photons are never aware of moving through space.</br>  <br>The faster you move through space, the faster you move through time. A stopwatch won't act any different, but it will move through time faster, recording time slower than it's actually passing. So it will say less time has passed, making it look like time passed more slowly, but it actually moved through time faster. Time doesn't actually "pass" we just move through it.</br>  <br>My brain is full of fuck right now</br>  <br> Time doesn't actually "pass" we just move through it. <br>Fuck, thats true! Great distinction anon</br></br>    <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_pri<wbr>ori_and_a_posteriori#Immanuel_Kant<br>'Contrary to contemporary usages of the term, Kant thinks that a priori knowledge is not entirely independent of the content of experience. And unlike the rationalists, Kant thinks that a priori cognition, in its pure form, that is without the admixture of any empirical content, is limited to the deduction of the conditions of possible experience. These a priori, or transcendental conditions, are seated in one's cognitive faculties, and are not provided by experience in general or any experience in particular, though "a priori" intuitions can be triggered by experience. Kant nominated and explored the possibility of a transcendental logic with which to consider the deduction of the a priori in its pure form. Space, time and causality are considered pure a priori intuitions. Kant reasoned that the pure a priori intutions are established via his transcendental aesthetic and transcendental logic. He claimed that the human subject would not have the kind of experience that it has were these a priori forms not in some way constitutive of him as a human subject. For instance, a person would not experience the world as an orderly, rule-governed place unless time, space and causality were functions of their perception. The claim is more formally known as Kant's transcendental deduction and it is the central argument of his major work, the Critique of Pure Reason. The transcendental deduction argues that time, space and causality are ideal, and, in its consideration of a possible logic of the a priori, attempts to make the case for the fact of subjectivity, what constitutes subjectivity and what relation it holds with objectivity and the empirical.'<br><br>Right?</br></br></br></wbr></br>  <br>As far as I remember, time is the 7th dimension according to one theory, and its not a spacial dimension at all so you're wrong one way or the other</br>  <br>Yess I was looking for this story. Thank you.</br>  <br>I fucking hate this particle-wave duality shit people get hung up on.<br><br>When you take a measurement (an eigenvalue of an operator), a quantum system collapses down to the corresponding eigenfunction. Otherwise the wave equation is just evolving in time and doin' it's thing.<br><br>This particle shit? Well that's just an eigenfunction of the position operator, ie a dirac delta, ie a spike, ie a 'particle'.<br><br>It's not like things decide to be waves one second or particles the next. Instead of wave-particle duality, we should just call whatever quantum shit is wavecles or paves, unifying the fact that neither word is sufficient, and we have something new altogether. Leads to less confusion.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Negative. If time is a whole new dimension, any movement in the 3rd dimension would result as a 0 value movement in higher dimension. So it literally has no impact.</br>  <br>http://www.anu.edu.au/news/all-news<wbr>/experiment-confirms-quantum-theory<wbr>-weirdness<br>Time is something completely different. Read this</br></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>HOW WE GET OUT OF TIHS SHIT</br>  <br>You're confusing the speed of light with time.<br>If you move at the speed of light, anything else moving at the speed of light would still look as if it was moving at the speed of light relative to you. Time is something different</br></br>  <br>The fourth dimension I only used for calculations don't really transform a geometry into 4d it is useful for calculation of transformations you only use the w axis as 1 you never use a different number for the w axis, you just use the w axis to be able to make several transformations to the geometry so you have a 4x4 transformation matrix to use in you shaders, you never use that fourth dimension for the render. But in a way yeah the geometry used in graphics is indeed in a fourth dimension.</br>  <br>http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/sto<wbr>ry/2015/06/injectable-electronics-p<wbr>romise-sharper-view-of-brain/<br>Soon anon.<br>Soon.</br></br></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>everything on your screen is two-dimensional just like drawings on a piece of paper. it doesn't have actual depth even if it looks like i does. are you 12?</br>  <br>But nothing is ever standing still because we're careening though space.</br>  <br>The true reality could be more horrifying than we think if we are really in a simulation.

I'm saying that an observer on the ground in reference frame S says it takes one second for a muon generated in the upper atmosphere traveling at 0.99c to hit the ground. By all accounts no muons should hit the ground.<br><br>However, relativity speaking, to the muon in reference frame S' the trip only takes 0.01 s, so virtually no muons have decayed. This discrepancies in times is attributed to relativistic effects.

This is a dark memory but a few months back I had just gotten done with a fit of laughter caused by one of these hilarious threads. Suddenly my mom walks in and she's crying. I attempted to suppress the growing urge to laugh but it was getting more difficult. Face red, tears running down her aging face, mom grabs my shoulders and says "Your father's dead."<br><br>It was at that moment that I couldn't hold back anymore. I burst into a banana-induced fit of laughter, but the horrible news drew tears to my eyes. I laughed while I cried, tears streaming down my wide open grin, memories of daddy resurfacing and being melded and combined with the naked banana.<br><br>I lost two things that night.</br></br></br></br></br>      <br>hello, friend from the summer</br>  <br>what was he meant to be doing?</br>  <br>check his freedums</br>  <br>he didn't realize the sliding door was closed and shot through the glass<br><br>smarten up</br></br></br>  <br><br> haven't laughed on 4chan since summer began <br> now, tears. </br></br></br>  <br><br>looks like he was checkin himself out in the mirror and accidently fired.</br></br>  <br>smarten up</br>  <br>fucking hell Ken, you had one job</br>  <br>tbh that chimp is way cuter than the white baby</br>  <br>lololol that is legendary</br>  <br>how does that guy do it? hang out with his buddy's who have smoking hots broads, and he has to look at that fat pig the whole time.</br>    <br>She probably started out hot but then they got married.</br>  <br>ahahaha this is the funniest shit ever, all new to me</br>      <br> Knowing your limits </br>  <br>fucking kek.<br><br>$1 for a BJ<br>$5 for sex<br>$10 for anal<br><br>if she plays her cards right she'll get something nice for xmas</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>god this pic makes me sad. this is my whole life.</br>  <br>I lost for real.</br>              <br> Such accuracy  <br>Dam son, go watch rsd for awhile; get yo shit str8.</br></br>  <br>kek</br>    <br>kek fukn dolphins</br>  <br>im not sure which one is more autistic, you or him</br>  <br>Cant believe O lose on this one...

Oh my God.<br><br>I can almost see your pathetic overweight frame glowing in the dark, lit by your computer screen which is the only source of light in your room, giggling like a like girl as you once again type your little Banana thread up and fill in the captcha. Or maybe you don’t even fill in the captcha. Maybe you’re such a disgusting NEET that you actually paid for a 4chan pass, so you just choose the picture. Oh, and we all know the picture. The “epic” Banana guy, isn’t it? I imagine you little shit laughing so hard as you click it that you drop your Doritos on the floor, but it’s ok, your mother will clean it up in the morning. Oh, that’s right. Did I fail to mention? You live with your mother. You are a fat fucking fuckup, she’s probably so sick of you already. So sick of having to do everything for you all goddamn day, every day, for a grown man who spends all his time on 4chan posting about a fucking banana. Just imagine this. She had you, and then she thought you were gonna be a scientist or an astronaut or something grand, and then you became a NEET. A pathetic Bananafag NEET. She probably cries herself to sleep everyday thinking about how bad it is and how she wishes she could just disappear. She can’t even try to talk with you because all you say is “I REALLY REALLY LIKE THIS PICTURE.” You’ve become a parody of your own self. And that’s all you are. A sad little man laughing in the dark by himself as he prepares to indulge in the same old dance that he’s done a million times now. And that’s all you’ll ever be.</br></br></br>        <br>This is something my middle aged aunt would post on Facebook with a completely stupid quote about coffee or some shit like that.</br>    <br>Not why, but how!?</br>    <br>So much autism</br>  <br>Sooo... where is this?</br>  <br>Lost</br>  <br>this made me feel naughty :)))</br>  <br>risk averted this is why I only need my waifu</br>  <br> losing on the first goddamn post <br><br>holy shit<br>took me a second to get it</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Are there fags out there in that bad of relationships where the men have to beg for sex?

I understand it's not really a black thing to do but what about gooks?  I am super interested in trying LSD, but unfortunately I have no one to trip with. Everything I read says to not try it alone. Always have a friend in case of a bad trip and such. But I have no friends who would take it with me. What can I do? Is it actually totally ok for me to take it alone? Or what can I do? <br><br>Also general stoner thread</br></br>  Only tripped twice but much preferred being alone. My friends seemed pretty pissed off about sitting me. Just find somewhere to chill and watch clouds, what could go wrong?  <br>The first time I tripped on LSD, I went with a friend who also tripped. He would not have been very helpful in the event that I had accidentally overdosed (bad trip). I have since accompanied other people on their first trips and, even though tripping myself, I could have helped them in similar straits.<br><br>Overdosing was more common in the 1960s than it is now.

I'm considering buying a USA one for 4th of July.  <br><br>Confederate one?</br></br>  You know, I'm actually happy for homosexuals can get married. I really am. Ive met gays that are better people than I'll ever be.<br><br>But tell me this, why is it socially acceptable to be gay but I still can't marry my seven girlfriends or my fucking goat? Why is it that if someone has pedophilic tendencies they're shunned? <br><br>It's kinda hypocritical the more you think about it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You can marry your horse, but not a goat.</br>  <br>The legal philosophy behind pedos and goat is that neither can legally consent to intercourse or marriage, which is just a legal contract. <br><br>Poly though, that argument is 100% on point.</br></br></br>  <br>you're a goatphobic cis nigger.<br><br>be more open minded pls</br></br></br>  <br>top kek</br>  <br>Its interesting the idea of animal consent. <br><br>It's true that most animals are very promiscuous, but do they have the mental capacity to understand permission? If so, is it right to bed animals because they don't know nor care?</br></br></br>  <br>difference between homosexuality and bestiality is consent.<br><br>Is that so hard to get?<br><br>-_-</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Animals understand permission in their own way with each other. But there's really no way for them to communicate such consent to a person, in a way that would be irrefutable. <br><br>For kids, there is a legal presumption that minors don't have the full mental capacity to understand things like the consequences of their actions. That's why pedo crimes are strict liability, the pedo's intent does not matter, as long as he committed the act he's guilty. But also the child's intent doesn't matter, because they don't know any better. So in strict liability crimes the intent element usually required for most crimes is presumed to be fulfilled. <br><br>Also checked.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Goat can't consent so...<br><br>As for polygamy I have no idea, same for your sister or your mom/mum . Seems okay in my books.</br></br>  <br>good point, I think because animals cannot consent and doesn't care nor will be emotionally scorn..fucking animals should be allowed because regardless of laws they can kill you if they want</br>  <br>Because gay's getting married doesn't hurt anyone. Fucking an animal can hurt the animal because they weren't made to take human genitalia. And fucking children, well, I shouldn't have to explain why that's wrong. Polygamy on the other hand, while I think it's kinda weird, I don't see why it shouldn't be allowed.</br>  <br>Why can't I marry my sister? that scare tactic of retarded kids is a lie because non-relatives have retarded kids or passed on bad genes</br>  <br>Good point on the bestiality thing.<br><br>It's funny because all lot cases on pedophilia would be solved if we simply lowered our age of consent. Most countries have it around 13-15 but here in the states its 18, which is ludicrous because sexual urges start way before 18.</br></br></br>  &gt;<br><br>The thing about incest is that it makes your possible children much more susceptible to deformity and such. It's not that it definitely will make them deformed, but the likelihood is exponentially higher than two non related people. As far as I know that's the only reason it's illegal.</br></br>  <br> Because gay's getting married doesn't hurt anyone <br><br>Most conservatives would argue that homosexuality sullies the sanctity of marriage. I'm kinda on that point.</br></br></br>  <br>But that doesn't HURT anyone. It goes against people's beliefs, but it won't fuck someone up permanently like pedophilia can.</br>  <br>Yeah, it's a shitty unfair standard really, because everyone is different there's no hard line where all of a sudden children become adults. It's really just an arbitrary number based on averages.</br>  <br>Well, what if i'm a conservative parent and I dont want to expose my child to homosexuals because it would ruin his morality?</br>  <br>your kid is gonna be a total faggot lol</br>  <br>it's a scare tactic like masturbation make you blind saying</br>  Let's start a punchable faces thread  this fucker      <br><br>smug motherfucker</br></br>        <br>I think pretty much everything is white American</br>  Backpfeifengesicht - a face in need of a fist<br><br>Ah the Germans, thank you.</br></br>        https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Kof<wbr>I6ocTLE8</wbr>  [ ]    <br>Yes</br>  <br>he hasn't a chin, op.</br>  <br>i would strangle him</br>  <br>God..</br>    <br>Why would you post pictures of your friend on 4chan</br>  <br><br> Friend <br><br>This dude is literally the biggest wanker you can think of</br></br></br></br>  <br>looks like a decent fellow</br>  He had a punchable face but his head got crushed by a Semi :(      <br><br> 00:32 sea pick-cals <br> 4:40 on - THOSE BURGER SKILLS <br> 6:30 &amp; 8:30 - WHAT DID YOU DO!?!?!!!! </br></br></br></br>  <br>i know this guy, he's a dick <br>his called Isac Bjerring</br></br>    <br>Dat depth perception doe</br>    Rounds are slow, /b/.<br><br>Ask a Medfag from the third world anything.

It doesn't hurt to touch or to flex, and walking is fine too, but riding a bike or going up stairs kills. What do you think this could be? 18 year old male.  what was the most fucked up thing you saw?  <br>why haven't you set up your own internet pharmacy and made bank off americans while providing the useful hardy narcotics we need</br>  <br><br>why are you in the third world<br><br><br>why not come to glorious america?</br></br></br></br></br>  What is your job?  <br>He already lives in the third world. Why move laterally?</br>    <br>No, never. But I´ve seen it a couple times on ER evaluation, not by medics.<br><br><br>Ever check down that before? How is the pain? How much can you extend it before it begins to hurt?<br><br><br>A malogrus (Malogro), a type of unstoppable spontaneous abortion that happens on the last 20 weeks of gestation.

Like flexing it, but straightening my leg instead of closing it, is what hurts, if that makes sense?</br></br>  <br>Nice trips, yeah, sounds like a tron from the inside tendons of your knee and/or a congestion of the liquid inside your articulation and the membrane that produces it. Anyhow, put some cold on the area and check your local doc.<br><br><br>How is the pain? At what times it presents? Do you feel it grow with a change on the position?</br></br></br></br>  <br>it starts in the evening, it's similar to a muscle cramp, just tense and painful. position doesn't matter much</br>  <br>I have this weird small meaty growth under two of my nails (hands). It looks as if whatever's under the nails has thickened but otherwise it looks like normal skin, tissue and the nail itself looks fine. <br>It's not really a nuisance, just wondering what it could be.</br></br>  <br>It sounds like a compresion of the nerve that runs through your leg. I seriously reccomend you to see your local MD, I´ve seen cases that started like that and get complicated rather rapidly.<br><br><br>Pic related please.</br></br></br></br>  nig  <br>Alright thanks a bunch man will do</br>  <br>Fag.</br>  <br>pic</br>  <br>Oh. You seem legit. When I run/get my heart rate up I get intense neck pain and migraine like symptoms. I have tried chiropractic work.

Very progressive. Will fix everything. Superb job.</br></br></br>  <br>Rapists are perverted, they have a mental illness. They need treatment and support, not stigma and jail sentences. We're allowed to call alcoholism a disease but being a rapist makes you a criminal? How hypocritical. <br><br>Blaming rapists for committing rape is victim blaming, it's the same as blaming people with OCD for their compulsions. <br><br>I thought we were supposed to be more progressive than this, you people make me sick. <br><br>Prove that rapists don't have a mental illness.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  1  webm thread time,<br><br>give me your best /b/</br></br>    <br>Is that really a question?</br>  <br>Wtf?</br></blockquote>]
