I love this faggot so much that I really don't give a shit.<br>He's my buddy now.</br></br></br></br></br>        Way to go anon! That's a one beautiful son of a bitch  <br>Thinking of it as 100 dollars a month on dog food makes it feel bad.<br><br>Think of it as small investments towards the future of that little motherfucker chewing off the balls of any piece of garbage trying to break into your house.</br></br></br>  Find a way to make a little extra cash on the side, <br>that dog looks worth it, he's fucking beautiful<br><br>Know the breed?

It only ever feels bad when he's not around. Seeing this fucker playing around makes you forget anything finance related in an instant. He's more than worth everything I had to spend so far. And yes, he makes for an awesome guard, it's really fun to see him become attentive when he hears shit in the stairway.</br>  <br>what a dignified son of a bitch</br>  <br>You know what breed he is?</br>  That is one fucking beautiful son-of-a-bitch. My boy eats about 150 to 200/month. I give him the best though. That includes treats like bully sticks and dog sausages. I love that mutt bastard. Got him from a shelter.  <br><br>I have 2 dogs and spend around $17 a week on food. Don't buy such expensive shit.</br></br>  <br>you could put that 100 dollars into a better neighborhood</br>  <br>I'm at it. I'm a university student, but I earn a little on the side w/ photography and graphic design.<br><br>It's a german + belgian shepherd (malinois) and probably something smaller in there, too, as he's slightly smaller than reg. shepherds.</br></br></br>  <br>How the hell are you spending that much on kibble? I'm spending ~45 US$ On a 40# bag every 2 months or so, and that's to feed a damn Labrador. Try Tase of the Wild dog food, the first 5 ingredients are animal protein and it has no corn in it. Good stuff. Nice looking pooch Anon. Be good to him. Here's mine.</br>  <br>I was thinking shepherd. I have a purebred german shepherd, I love that damn fur child. Dogs are fucking 10/10. <br><br>Whats his name? He looks fucking awesome</br></br></br>  <br>see <br><br><br>i know right 8)<br><br><br>Way to go anon!<br><br><br>I'd say I feed him mid-tier shit, it isn't the most expensive, but I love giving him a little extra here and there, he's incredibly active<br><br><br>See your point, but it's not about paying for a watchdog, my neighborhood is perfectly alright.<br>He's just my beautiful motherfuckin pal now!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's one pretty ass dog as well! What's his name?<br>He gets meat in the morning, kibble in the evening. He's a bit choosy with the kibble and I train with him a lot, so I get him a good bunch of treats also.<br><br><br>They are awesome! Is he having any stomach problems? purebreds are hard to feed right at times.<br><br>His name is "Fips". He's 6 1/2 yo btw.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>starts building a pipboy</br></br></br>  <br>Freya, it's a puppy pic from last year, don't really have any of her now. Try that food, you can order it on amazon if your feed supply/pet store doesn't carry it. Save the meat for training purposes.</br>  <br>...the meat might be making him choosy as well. Think about it, why the hell would you want a bowl of cereal when you could have a steak?</br>  <br>Flips is a sick name, and 6 1/2? He's looking fucking awesome for 6. <br><br>Here's a pic of my Pure-bred. He doesn't have any stomach problems at all. I feed him chicken necks and biscuits. He's a healthy sucka<br> name is filename </br></br></br></br>  <br>I'll look into it!</br>  <br>Fips* sorry</br>  <br>wow that's one dope Zeus! I absolutely love the black mask!! Sounds like a great diet, good to hear he's doing fine!<br>Yea, when I say "6 1/2", people ask whether I mean months lol.. Due to him being a bit undersized of course, but he's insanely vital!<br>My biggest fear was not being able to give him all the action he would need, but I love seeing him run and play, so he gets all the action I can provide!</br></br></br>  <br>Nice dog OP. Much jealousy over here, always wanted a German Shepherd. One day... when i have a house (ie not an apartment) with a yard.<br>one day...</br></br>  <br>Yeah shepherds are very energetic, i work full time so Zeus only gets a run every night after work, but gets a beach trip every Saturday and he absolutely loves it. The short hair would be nice on Fips.. Zeus loses like a kilo of hair if you pat him.. even though i brush him every second day hahah</br>  <br>Raw necks or dried? How often and where do you find them? Might be a good treat/addition to Freya's diet. Does it give Fips the shits?</br>  I get the cheapest dog food I can find, and then I mix in left overs to keep it interesting.  <br>thank you anon.<br>look forward to it, dogs are great!<br>I wish you luck with your endeavors!</br></br></br>  <br>love German shepherds but their shits are horrendous. try making your own food and stop giving him that bag shit that gives them cancer.</br>  ...It's nice to have a thread that isn't all "nigger nigger faget retard" once in a while dog bros  <br>Raw. Dunno what they would cost in America.. As im from Australia. But a pack of raw necks from Coles (our supermarket) costs like 3 dollars, and its a decent full packed tray. so i feel like i get my moneys worth easy</br>  <br>I see! I bet he does! Does he love swimming? Fips is crazy about bellyflopping into water and fetching everything out there that you throw in!<br><br>Haha Fips lost an insane amount of hair, too, when it got hot. It's becoming less now though, I thoroughly brushed him like 7 or 8 times since he's here.</br></br></br>  <br>Thnx Anon. Just gave them a google. I'll see if my local butcher has any.</br>  <br><br>Am also good mates with my local butcher, so he gives me a few raw chicken carcass every now and then, and Zeus fucking loves them. Thats like his Friday dinner when i get a pizza, cause he fuckin' loves them</br></br>  <br>what kinda camera do you use anon?</br>  Louisiana leopard cur mix reporting in<br><br> 45lbs <br> 16 fucking years <br> gentle with even the tiniest of dogs <br> tried to murder a giant bully that wandered into our yard cause of retard owner <br> also REALLY REALLY hates poodles for some fucking reason </br></br></br></br></br></br>   <br><br>Zeus cries when i say its time to leave the beach like when you try and pull a kid out of the toy isle in the shops! He loves the water</br></br>  <br>he's doing alright so far.<br>The shelter people told us what brand works best for him and we've ben sticking with it mostly. He's gotten some shits when we mixed it up. What would you give him?<br><br>pic related, Fips thinks its yummy</br></br></br></br>  <br>Richtig sch√∂nes Tier, bin schon seit ein paar Jahren am √ºberlegen mir einen Welpen zu holen. Was f√ºr Erfahrungen hast du im Tierheim gemacht? Zu empfehlen?</br>  <br>that is fuckin sweet anon!<br>Fips always tries to catch ducks, but they're better swimmers than him.</br></br>  <br>dat doggy looks angry</br>  <br>don't use harnesses on big dogs, it actually reduces your control over them by putting the point of control in their center of mass.</br>  <br>I had a German Shepard awhile back he died at about 16-17 years. I used to get the meat scraps from the butcher and mix in abit of rice with some sardines to top it off. This is if you arent lazy or anything. I see most sheps on that bag stuff dying at 12-13 years and they get so horrible looking and can barely move. My shep was still running around like a silly little thing until the day he died.</br>  <br>Ich wollte zuerst auch einen Welpen, dann ist meine Freundin auf Fips gestossen.<br>Wir fanden gleich er hat ein tolles zu Hause verdient und wollten dann unser bestes daf√ºr tun. Die Leute haben uns ausgezeichnet beraten und nichts gut- noch schlechtgeredet, was wirklich wichtig war. Er hat ein paar Probleme (aggressiv gegen√ºber einigen R√ºden, braucht viel Auslastung, krasser Jadgtrieb), aber das wurde uns vehement mitgeteilt, damit wir gleich wissen dass er nicht nur die Schmusebacke ist die er oft sein kann. Dann wurde unsere Wohnung besichtigt, wir haben knapp eine Stunde ein Gespr√§ch √ºber Hund und Haushalt gef√ºhrt und dann durften wir ihn holen. Ich fand die Erfahrung eigentlich ausschlie√ülich positiv. Vor allem darf/SOLL man sich immer melden wenn was ist.</br></br>  <br>Never thought I'd say this on 4chan but<br><br>you're pretty cool, OP. Way to go</br></br></br>  <br>He'll catch one, one day. Trust me.. Zeus has a hate crime for cats, (typical Dog) Thought he'd never catch one cause cats are pretty quick and he's pretty big, so though he'd be abit slower... nope. Come home from work one day with blood all over the grass and half buried cat in the garden.. Zeus had blood all over his paw's and mouth and was sitting at the gate waiting for me like a happy mother fucker and like nothing happened. <br> don't worry it was a feral cat </br></br>  <br> bag shit that gives them cancer. <br><br>lol. look at the ingredients list for my dog food<br><br> Chicken meal, deboned chicken, whole potato, steel-cut oats, peas, whole egg, deboned flounder, sun-cured alfalfa, chicken fat (preserved with mixed tocopherals), oat flakes, chicken liver, chicken liver oil, herring oil, pea fiber, whole apples, whole pears, sweet potato, pumpkin, butternut squash, parsnips, carrots, spinach, cranberries, blueberries, kelp, chicory root, juniper berries, angelica root, marigold flowers, sweet fennel, peppermint leaf, lavender, rosemary. <br><br>CHEAP dog food is bad for dogs. if you love your dog you will spend on dog food. it's nothing compared to their livelihood</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rarely is he, he just moves too much for really good pictures unlike OPs handsome fella</br>  <br>I'll make sure and try to get him something of that sort every now and then... we have a butcher around the corner. Great to hear he did so well.<br>Fips is crazy vital and I'd love to keep it that way for as long as possible.. thank you for the tip anon</br></br>  <br>I've been thinking about going more raw with mine, did you ever have a problem with 'balancing' the diet - or did you just throw together meat and rice and some veg?</br>  Take care of him OP. I just lost my dog 2 months ago and miss the hell out of him. Pic related, it's not my dog but looks just like him. 175 pound Bullmastiff.  <br>As of now I have a (actually two) 5D MkII around the house. (Not mine, but I can use them whenever I feel like it)</br>  <br>Looks pretty sexy, did the shelter ruin him though?<br><br>Or does he still have his manhood?</br></br></br>  <br> Zeus Owner  <br>I've only ever fed my shepherd raw meat, never cooked. Raw is the best for dogs. When it gets cooked it looses all the good proteins.</br></br>  <br>now that's a crazy fella! Looks really cool though!<br>hahaha I don't know too many individuals who really like poodles.<br>16 years is a load yo</br></br></br>  <br> Believing everything you read on a bag <br><br>The best food is food you make yourself. If they can put so much garbage into Human food why the heck do you think they wouldn't do that for dogs.<br><br><br>Good stuff anon.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> ruin <br> "manhood" <br><br>neutering dogs is essential and improves their behavior while reducing risk of disease, reducing escapes, and prolonging their life span<br><br>people who don't modify their pets are redneck scum, basically.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice pooch OP. Here's my dawg</br>  <br>Nice I been thinking of getting a camera that can take shots like this. Your dogs beautiful son.</br>  <br> not believing the bag <br><br>it's a conspiracy! the ingredients are LIES<br><br>that shit costs like $65/20lb. sorry that you fed your shi tzu purina and watch it get seizures at 3 years old. this food is healthier for him than anything i could make.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Your dog is very photogenic</br>  <br>But then you can't fuck them<br><br>A dog you can't fuck is a broken dog, end of discussion</br></br></br>  <br> Not neutering <br>Good luck getting your dog to relax or getting your dog back when a stray female in heat passes by.</br></br>  <br>oh wow that's crazy....<br>I don't let Fips roam free in areas where I know cats can pop up. He has an insane hunting instinct. Sometimes he'll start crying when I don't let him get to a cat.<br>He's randomly caught mice from the fields many times already.. Never thought he'd be this fast!<br>I let him hunt flies around the house now though, he's having so much fun, feels proud when he finally gets them!</br></br></br></br>  here's my buddy since we're posting dags  <br>I'll leave my dog the way God made him</br>  <br>Just give him a handjob, problem solved.<br><br>Also enjoy your bone cancer http://www.naiaonline.org/pdfs/Long<wbr>TermHealthEffectsOfSpayNeuterInDogs<wbr>.pdf</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>cute</br>  <br>RIP to the fella. Would bet he was a cool ass guy.<br>175 pounds is massive man!</br></br>  <br>We're just different types of guys anon. I have just found it works out better for my pups to fed them on cooked meals.</br>  <br>He still has it. <br>I'm thinking about neutering at a later point to reduce risks and calm him a bit.<br>But as of now I would really miss his energy...<br>I'm really unsure as of now.</br></br></br></br>  <br> neutering your dog causes it to have allergic reactions to vaccines <br><br>lol, got some anti global warming pdfs too?</br></br></br>  <br>Wasn't anywhere new to him, Was in my backyard, so the cat had jumped my fence and that was the last fence he jumped lol.. <br><br>Gotta let him get it out somewhere, its good he likes hunting flies, and the mice i wouldn't worry about either.. good for them really.</br></br></br>  <br>He's had a tiger somewhere down his fam-tree eh? Cool pooch!</br>  <br>dogs don't lose any "energy" when neutered. typical brainwashing shit you hear from the same type of people who own confederate flag hats.</br>  Nice one anon. My dog is from a shelter too. Poor girl was abused for breeding...<br><br>Now, she's treated like a princess. She's the best damn dog ever too. She's lazy as fuck and enjoys laying with me when I play vidya.</br></br>  <br>yea he's just pretty as fuck!!<br><br><br>fuckin cute!! Happy belated bday fella<br><br><br>Yea I think so too..<br>I just don't let him eat most of them lol...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Poodles are pretty crazy dogs, pretty smart and shit they just have stupid cuts for shows.<br><br>He still runs around like mad, really active. So far he's recently developed phobia of load noises or things dropped or banged<br><br>He gets a mix of hard/soft kibble free fed and then breakfast/dinner plate of what ever I eat everyday. <br><br>Boiled turkey necks w/meat on em, toenails of dead cows/horse, biscuits and soft training treats. No antlers since his age and most of the time are too hard for a dog unless you have a bear of a dog or an avid chewer.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I will still have to read on it.. If true I think I will go for it, as I'm sure it'll reduce some stress from sniffing the bitches</br>  <br>crazy to think he's still this active. Awesome though!<br><br>Great to see he's taken care of like this!</br></br></br>  Both of my dogs. Damn, that dog is a veritable Adonis, OP  <br>Do you really think that removing a large amount of hormones from a dogs body won't fuck with the immune system and development? If it was so damn beneficial why doesn't humans get neutered?<br><br>If you want to avoid unwanted litters, just give the dog a vasectomy. Costs a little more but doesn't screw around with his body as much.</br></br></br>  <br>thanks /b/rotinho,<br>depending on your budget you might want to start a little lower though, you can still pay a K for a used MkII...<br>And remember.. the glass might be the most important part!<br>Upgrading is rather easy once you like what you do, lenses and cams are pretty stable in price</br></br></br></br>  <br>Neuter nazis like you are the ones that are full of shit, if you actually cared about the dogs you wouldn't let a perfectly healthy dog go through a risky surgery</br>  <br>ew</br>  <br>it is your duty, it's not a choice. your dog gets out one time, puppies are created, those puppies most likely suffer and die or are euthanized at pounds.<br><br>it's a non-decision. if you have any conscience whatsoever accept it as a reality of responsible pet ownership. millions of young dogs are euthanized every year because people though it was a choice for them to make. it simply isn't</br></br></br>  <br>good doge</br>  <br>Holy shit you are completely brainwashed, please go away. Neutering your dog does NOTHING to stop puppy mills and petshops from producing unwanted pets. Accidental litters is a non-issue. The problem is cynical people who breed low quality dogs for a quick buck</br>  <br>4chan is just like society, there's lot of shithat assbags, but every now and then, people are fucking awesome. And since dogs are fucking awesome most of the time, their owners might learn from them.<br>Truly appreciate it /b/ro!</br></br>  <br> puppy mills and petshops <br><br>which has nothing to do with your own personal dog. didn't bother to read the rest of your post.</br></br></br>  <br>The last thing you, I and the world has to worry about are Fips-puppies, it's not happening, I'm around the little adonis when he's out. <br><br>As I said, it's not an easy choice, I've heard very reasonable people from both camps...</br></br></br>  <br> it's not an easy choice <br><br>yes it is. pet animals are to be modified. end of story. <br><br>anti-neuterers are literally in the global warming denial, vaccines cause autism camp. same type of cockamamie bullshit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Awesome pals! Cuddly, too.<br><br>Haha sure he appreciates your words 8)</br></br></br>  <br>Oh for sure, my SO gets jealous cause if I have left overs it goes to my buddy instead of them</br>  <br>Do not listen to this person, she is insane</br>  <br>sounds fucking awesome to me! Good job man! She looks sweeeeet as heeell!!</br>  <br>Release him to the wild then, as God intended you fuckin mongoloid</br>  BTW, the dog-psychologist classified him as highly intelligent..<br>And it's crazy how many things he can pick up via context.. He knows the different names of his toys, figured out his dog-game in like 5 minutes and we've bought him mice that you can pull by a string, so they vibrate (cat-toy), 15 minutes in, he's pulling their strings all by himself because he finds it funny when they vibrate in his mouth.</br>  <br>I will say one thing though, make sure to socialize him a lot because dog aggression is way more common when you have intact dogs. <br><br>Neutered males get in fights too but intact males just seem to be more threatening to other dogs. He needs to have great social skills and self confidence to avoid dangerous fights.</br></br></br>  <br>I tried but my dog keeps coming back</br>  this is my adventure buddy, I've had him since he was 6 weeks old and we've never spent a night apart  Stop trying to impress people with your shitty 1.6x crop SLR.  <br>Fucking beautiful, is he pure white GSD or a mix of something? That broad skull tho...</br>  <br>Because he's dependant on you, like all pets made to live with humans in today's society. So get him neutered like a responsible pet owner or move to farm in Montana.</br>  <br>lmfao</br>  <br><br>God bless, you beautiful disaster</br></br>  I wanna post my dogs in this bread but I feel like they aren't on par with the other beauty's, One is a purebred Irish setter 70 pounds at 6 months also very tall, the other is a small 4pound shitzu Maltese mix his front right leg doesn't have any muscles in it so he only has 3 working legs. They're both amazing and I love them  <br>I swear all Germans sleep like this<br><br><br>Cute as fuck so you ever cut his coat short? My boy has short hair but its really thick around his neck so we have to spend 2-3hrs twice a weeks just on his neck <br><br>FFA I can still pull out chunks of his old hair</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>my dog is very similar, he can open and close doors, turn the sink on and off when he is thirsty (teaching him to turn it off was a chore but he does it now). you should train your dog to put his toys away when he is finished, my dog has a little basket that all his toys are in and he puts them away when he's done with them usually</br>  <br>I don't live in USA, I live in Norway where neutering your dog for non-medical emergencies is illegal.</br>  <br>Post those babies, after my cur I want a large dog again but the curs line that are 70 to 100lbs. Wright family line if I remember</br>  <br>Thanks man. They're at my parents house which is a few hours away from me, so I only get to see them every few weeks. Cuddles from those two are rare these days</br>  Fucking hell that's beautiful god and you're good at taking shots<br>Godspeed OP</br>  <br>This is the Irish setter I literally went out just to take the pic (it's wet outside he loves the damp weather)</br>  <br>*dog, not god<br>And I just noticed that dog=inverse of god</br></br>  <br>I've never had his hair cut but he does get raked every week to help get that undercoat thinned out, and if its too hot outside we just wait till its cooler, trail running at night is pretty exciting. <br>Bonus: unlike most husky's he is amazing off leash so he is rarely on one when we are on trail, and if he has to poop he goes at least 10 feet off trail</br></br>  <br>Move to a fjord?<br>Also, trips check'd</br></br>  <br>I can see that...<br>I try to get him together with other dogs every now and then. He has a couple smaller buddies, but he's getting aggressive with larger males</br></br>  <br>That's a good looking pooch there Anon. Beautiful coat.</br>  <br>This is the little guy his name is Skippy (obvious reasons) and the Irish setter is named Reese</br>  Say hello to Loki (Yes, I know every single husky is called Loki nowadays)  <br>Oh goodness so soft and silky beautiful dog <br><br><br>That's great, mine walks well off leash too but he can't play off leash since we live in the city and he has this play style of spinning around and defending with is ass or something so he doesn't pay attention to where the street is.</br></br></br></br>  <br>german anon gesichtet :D<br>Hei√üt der Hund Fips? :D</br></br>  <br>I love the brown eyes!!!! huskys with brown eyes are so underrated<br> my dog  is also a pretty brown eyed boy</br></br>  <br>thanks anon</br>  <br>Aw you said he can't use one of his front legs? Why is that<br>Other than that, scruffy looking dogs have a special heartwarming look all the time<br>That's a nice masks anon, cutie</br></br></br>  <br> UGH I just HATE it when my dog has normal biological reactions. Better get his balls cut off </br>  <br>that is super cool.<br>I will try and challenge him a little more with these types of things, he loves working mentally</br></br>  <br>Trips confirm dogs = gods</br>  <br>This two beautiful ladies are my life now, no girlfriend, no job, ending my studies, soon moving to other country, I enjoy every little thing with them :/</br>  <br>No muscles in the leg at all only the bones devolped he still keeps up with the Irish setter though lol</br>  Sweet dogs guys here is a good pic of my mutt  <br><br>Looks like he got some Doberman in his breed</br></br>  <br>the guy is super pretty! Silky soft!<br><br><br><br>haha appreciate it..<br>Yea.. weird, right?<br><br><br>super cute also!!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He'll end up punishing you for coming home late by closing the drain and turning on the faucet, flooding your apartment :3</br>  <br>gut gemacht! <br>Yap, das ist Fips! :)</br></br>  Red Rocket or GTFO  <br>Loki has an impressive mask!<br>And boy... those brown eyes....<br><br>BTW:<br>Here is Nina, my first dog love.<br>She still lives with my parents, she's like 12 years old. Never realized how small she really was until I got Fips lol</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Even when the black one, Eli, poop everywhere</br>  <br><br>Get in here!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</br></br>  <br>Sounds like he's still a bit too young for that</br>  Shitty pic but this is jess  <br>They look like they make for an awesome team! Enjoy every second bro!<br>Hope things will look up for you three!</br></br>  <br>Full grown anon?<br><br><br>That's weird but neat at the same time. Curious as to not amputate it, I assume everything but muscle is there so why bother<br><br><br>Purebred or mutts they're all great<br><br><br>For for said queen<br><br><br>You can litter train dogs too FYI</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>hahahaha I hope not!</br>  <br>Hey jess, hope you and owner have a great day!</br>  My dog helped me conquer my depression much more than drugs and other pointless shit, I can't explain more clear, she is worth so much. Soon turning 7 :)<br><br>Gratz on the buddy anon</br></br>  <br>Jack Russell 2 years old, Labrador 4 months old, both girls, really good relation<br> tky man</br></br>  Thanks everyone. Lots of beautiful dogs in this thread. <br>To the other husky owner, how impressed were you with your dog's athleticism? I knew the reputation they had before I got Loki but god damn you just cannot tire this fucker out! And as soon as it snows he seems to let instincts take over and runs wild</br>  <br>I feel you dude, they are really helping me to keep going</br>  <br>it is pretty cool, when people see him do it for the first time they are always amazed... but then again when he slowly opens the bedroom door in the middle of the night its given me a few small freak outs</br>  <br>Labs are great dogs, if you can handle a jack Russell a lab will be an ease. <br><br>I had a golden one for a while named Pitiful cause she's cry dramatically when I'd leave for school. <br><br>Potty training is the bane of most dogs, just stay consistent.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>thank you. I can imagine, dogs make you happy in a very special way.</br>  <br>You should probably start thinking about getting your backup dog.<br><br>One of the shittiest things about this cruel world is that dogs don't live as long as we do :(</br></br></br>  <br>whoa that's another beautiful specimen</br>  <br><br>I use two have a very large dog ( 111 pound ) and i never pay 100$ for food every month , i remember 2$ per day mostly with premium food (Nestl√© Purina PetCare )<br><br>Get in touch with people who work with dog and shelters , they know how two buy cheap but good food for pets<br><br>Also , your dog is very nice</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>hahaha I bet..<br>When we first got Fips, my girlfriend always wanted me to lock the front door when we were out, since we didn't quite know whether he could open doors or not.</br></br>  <br>Thank you... <br>Yea I've also realised I've been overpaying a bit in the beginning (buying smaller portions and all).<br>I think I'll get a good hang of it soon</br></br></br>  <br>You might want to consider removing the knob and having a keyhole on the inside of your front door, once a dog figures out how to open door handles the next step is figuring out how to turn the lock :)<br><br>But I've yet to see a dog figure out how to get a key into a keyhole.</br></br></br>  <br>mine never gets tired and even when he is ready to call it a day he will still get up and keep going until I'm done... I take mine of like 10+ mile mountain bike rides in the winter and he will run the whole time and still wanna play when we get home... Ghost loves the snow and the cold in general, they are a really fun breed of dog, just so happy to out doing anything</br>  <br>Yea, I can't say I handle the jack, she's a really good dog but I think she born whit that good behavior, the lab is really obedient, I can't stop to amaze myself, trying to be patient is my key for both of them</br>  How do you like one of my dogs? Got 2 of these, they both are Leonbergers. Both female, weight about 60-70kilos (60kg=132lbs) and in height 70cm (70cm = 27inches) Both eat like hell, but I don't care, can take good care of them. Need a lot of space though.  <br>Fuck bro, cut me deep there. Thats some real life shit I wasn't ready for.</br>  <br><br>Buy large , in France we have 16kg bag (36lb) and it's very cheap tan small bag.<br><br>try this one : <br><br>http://<br>tinyurl.com<br>/nr8g7mq<br><br>It's a very fait price for the weight !<br><br>pic related , my old dog .</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How far do you walk Ghost daily?
