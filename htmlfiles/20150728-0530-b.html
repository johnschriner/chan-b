He played a lot when I was young but I was disinterested back then.<br><br>Didn't pick up playing till 4 years ago, but with all the high tier gear sitting around learning has never really been an issue. Picked a lot of things up pretty quickly but also adjusted my taste in music to accomodate more complicated guitar music, very much interested in jazzy rock fusion stuff, post rock, chordal stuff, playing stuff involving dotted eighth delays is pretty fun too.<br><br>Doesn't take a ton of effort when you use drills from great players, watching them online and stuff.. Learned tons from the likes of Guthrie just through watching sessions, tutorials &amp; rig rundowns.<br><br>Learn a lot just from watching gear reviews too.<br><br>Didn't really intend that post to be that long but uh, w/e</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>dark souls theme.</br>  electric guitar is for pedophiles  <br>Does Yamaha actually make good instruments?

They're not really worth it for a new guitar, but as a second hand beginner rig, absolutely.<br><br>I chucked a fresh pickguard and at the same time, a bareknuckle humbucker that I can't recall the name of without looking up. It's got blues in the name but I can't remember what one.<br><br><br>I don't have a recording setup for this PC yet, I'm working on a studio setup right now.<br><br>Not interested in recording webcam audio, if I'm gonna record myself I'll do it right and get a couple SM57's and a DAC.<br><br>I also have to revise my 4x12 setup, I don't like my head, the 4x12 is fine but I need to get a head that isn't ass.<br><br>Still saving monies cause poorfag cause spend all money on gear lately.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you're a UK player, join thefretboard.co.uk and hit me up - I'm Hertz32</br>  <br>I'm just about 22, so you're doing better than me.<br><br><br>For the record, the Pacifica 112J I picked out from that pawnshop has a birdseye maple neck, not highly figured, but a solid piece of canadian maple. Not usually a fan of rosewood fretboards, but the instant I felt how solid the neck was, and the fact that it's just a slam together S type guitar.<br><br>I can't really push how awesome they are as cheap Indonesian guitars built with Jap hardware.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>lol ur underage u are still 17 ur birthday is on september</br>  <br>Listened to several of their songs, was impressed, but couldn't get into them.<br>Animals as Leaders, Intronaut, Meshuggah and Textures are more my thing.</br></br>  <br>deal with it, did you stalk my facebook? xD<br><br>Love me some AAL, was listening to their debut album earlier. Really fancy a TAM10 too. <br>Combustion was one of the first riffs I learnt on my 8 string.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I was pretty upset to hear about Justin Lowes death last week though, I do like Neo Seoul by ATB</br>  <br>Ride on, ride on</br>  <br>Used to play but retired after wrist / fap session injury.</br>  <br>'eh I tend to get stuck in forums. I might sign up and ask some questions, I have to find a fucking trem arm the right size for this LAG Arkane 66, it's such a great guitar to play, but fuck if I don't expect to be able to grab the trem arm while playing it to divebomb. Pickups are glassy &amp; hot as fuck.<br><br>Do you know, if a 5mm screw in type (fender trem) doesn't fit, too small, and a 6mm push in ball end type (floyd), doesn't fit, too fat, that it's definitely a 5.5mm?<br><br>It's definitely a push-in type, but I'm not certain as to which. It looks like it would accomodate the same type as what goes in an Ibanez Edge trem with the two plastic cuffs, but I'm not entirely certain.<br><br>Fuck if I don't know, it's been bugging me for ages, this guitar would be a dream to play, wizard neck, wide as fuck radius fretboard, jumbo frets.. yeesh</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It certainly sounds like an edge trem arm is the most likely candidate, but you could get a set of vernier calipers and find out? Or email LAG and see if they can send a replacement, most manufacturers will usually try and help you out in my experience.</br>  <br>fwiw I've been impressed with all the LAG arkanes I've tried, although I've not played a cheaper one. I played a pricey one with orig floyd and EMG 81 and EMG SA's in with a gorgeous Purple quilt maple top</br>  <br>LAG themselves yielded no response, neither did their ex-distributor for their short run of sales in the UK care of Rob Chapmeme.<br><br>Marshall owns them now, and I have yielded once more, fuck all results as to the full spec of the guitar.<br><br>Yeah, my caliper isn't digital, so the sub-mm stuff is actually quite difficult.<br><br>I should really take it into a shop, but it's such a cheap guitar I just want to be able to buy a part online and not pay a store premium for fitting and finding.<br><br><br>Yeah, they are french as I recall, luthier spec guitars mainly, that's why I was interested in this little cheapy beast. Great little player, 80 quid at cash generators shipped.<br><br>Seriously fuck this trem arm thing though. I so badly want to say fuck it and just put a floyd, a brass nut and locking tuners, it's already all-black hardware. Hnnng.<br><br>It also has a cutesy little cutaway at the back for access, ala washburn/ibanez bolt ons.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fair enough, an edge trem arm isn't exactly expensive though and if it doesn't fit you can always flog it on. Shame to hear that LAG are being useless about it though.</br>  <br>I have a saxophone that I used to play?<br><br>Mostly, I write.</br></br></br>  Rate my beauty  <br> http://vocaroo.com/i/s1Sz1jh0EmuT <br>Play some Stream of Consciousness you fucking faggot.</br></br>  <br> Mfw frets are worn out <br> Mfw no strings <br> Mfw volume and tone control knobs are now full of static <br> Mfw amp knobs are stuck and rusty <br> Mfw I have no NEETbux <br> Mfw I only feel guitar in my mind </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Would that happen to be gypsy jazz?</br>  Oh god, OP you're such a douche..

Floyds get easier the more you use them though :) I know a guy who can go from completely disassembled to in tune, set up and playing in about 45mins. It is his job though...

I was talking about another guitar?</br>  <br>I don't play instruments cause I'm too busy watching anime and cuddling with my waifu.</br>  <br>he reffers to the bridge, a floyd rose, lol</br>  <br>And most Jackson's don't have a floyd rose?<br><br>It's not the guitar that's hard to tune, it's the trem.</br></br></br>  <br>time stamped picture or you're just another lying cunt</br>  <br>weeaboo</br>  Because I only like stuff I'm good at right away.

I hated the floyd rose the most though. Such a pain in the ass when i needed to retu e or change strings.</br>  <br>Chuck Berry was white</br>  <br>Hendrix? Tosin Abasi? <br>The two most innovative players I know are black.<br>along side CHuck berry, john lee hooker and BB king etc of course</br></br></br>  <br>Floyds are a deal breaker for me, I just can'y get along with them</br>  Because I will not fake passion in a popular pastime for any reason.    <br>Well, i never had one before and had no idea how horrible they were.</br>  <br>i'm not an autist who thinks guitar music is still relevant</br>  http://vocaroo.com/i/s0EHjZyrCPeM<br><br>Excuse my son in the background at the end. Also, been playing for about two months, only on acoustic, and can't really practice due to work and family. R8 I guess.</br></br>  <br>Is that a gordon Smith?</br>  <br>They're quite simple once a person understands how and WHY they work. I can do a full string change and set it up for different tunings in under an hour.</br>  <br>They look okay but it's hard to see what they are when you use a potato cam, and on it's side as well.</br>  <br>bitch please, orchestral music is still relevant.

That's not a red special you autist</br>  cuz i play the bass bitch  <br>Sorry, it's what happens.</br>  <br>Yeah I was late to the game and Floyds just make everything other than dive bombing a huge hassle IMHO, I'm more a hardtail kinda guy anyway</br>  Because I like playing bass  I play drums  <br>I'm too lazy</br>  <br>when was the last rock band that did something really innovative and changed the musical landscape?<br><br>probably nirvana, that was 20 fucking years ago<br><br>the closest thing we have to that now is royal blood i guess, but, oh wait, THEY DON'T USE GUITARS</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ill be the first to admit i dont understand them. Tried to do a string change, when it came time to reset the bridge, i popped 3 strings at once. No idea what i did wrong.</br>  <br> http://vocaroo.com/i/s0EHjZyrCPeM <br>opeth/10</br></br>  <br>Who the fuck is royal blood?</br>  <br>if its a compliment, thanks, if not, thanks still, i know i still need to improve my playing</br>  <br>I can change a full set of strings on my Tele in 12 minutes, and that is without using anything more trick than a sting winder, I understand Floyds and why they are a godsend to some players, but for me they are a waste of time and a rage builder.</br>  ITT: Pretensiousness  <br>KoRn, SiKth, Meshuggah, Animals As Leaders, Periphery,Ed Sheeran fucking hell</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=bSd<wbr>tvfBQd6c</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>these guys, pretty fucking good for just drums and bass if you ask me</br></br></br>  <br> GTFO acoustic faggots <br><br>If you can't play it on an acoustic, you have no business playing it on an electric, you fucking noob.</br></br></br>  <br>a piano?</br>  <br>*SikTh my bad</br>  <br>'69 strat, modded with floyd rose, loaded with my endorsement dimarzio pickups, shit is cash</br>  <br>I didn't get it the first time either. <br>Have you tried googling step by step instructions or youtubed a tutorial? I found that it was important to not only follow the steps to a T, but also to understand what is happening when the steps are followed. It's a delicate balance between spring tension and string tension.</br></br>  <br>Youre right! Because a Piano will Djent great :D Totally different timbre dude</br>  <br>You should try listening to most metal, then tell us how guitar is not relevant.<br>This is coming from a bassist</br></br>  It's gay and there's nothing good written for it.<br>Good if you wanna pose like a fairy queen on stage (and you can do it), terrible if you are interested in music.</br>  <br>He plays a bass like a guitar, so it's kinda 50/50<br><br><br>Where have you been living.... under a rock!?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I googled instructions, but they werent clear. I got my dick caught in the ceiling fan.</br>  faggots with they had a music room like mine.  <br><br>Yes, it has the best tone I've heard, I usually play it in C#,</br></br>  <br>Yeah I know. I still play a set bridge in some of my guitars but the feel of a double locking trem is great, be it floyd or kahler. <br>Each has their pros and cons.</br></br>  <br>Kek I know that feel. I had to turn the fan off and rip it out before I could continue lel</br>  <br>How guitar is relevent to metal sure, but how is metal relevant to anything?</br>  <br>Oh yeah bro, Peavey Vypr and Marshall DSL. really jealous.</br>  <br> korn <br>nu metal was also like 20 years ago<br><br>math rock and djent are new-ish, and pretty interesting, but its the drums that make them good, the guitar is kinda irrelevent<br><br>i like ed sheeran but he's nothing new</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>???? Are you actually retarded.</br>  <br>How's the cheap korean marshall treating you?</br>  <br>Mike Tython withes he had a muthic room like yourth</br>  <br>not a fagg0t but I do kinda wish I had a music room like yours. Do you record aswell?</br>  Because I'm untalented and lazy  <br>no really it sounds exactly like this<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Zjk<wbr>Ne4UkYSs</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>metal has been circlejerking the same fucking thing for 30 years, thats exactly why guitar isn't relevent</br>  <br>I wouldn't have said so, Djent is mostly about the guitars. The drumming is imressive sure, but the guitar tone and technique was totally new.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=PfT<wbr>3vcG4qZc</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>So how is 10th grade going for you?</br>  <br>It really, fucking hasn't. you clearly havn't listened to ANY of the metal bands listed in my posts. Hell, even Asking Alexandria and Pierce the veil are totally different to metal 30 years ago.</br>  <br>Sounds like you don't listen to metal</br>  <br>I need an electric and an amp with a nice spacey clean channel and then I can get that sound, so soon, hopefully.</br>  <br>I actually am not. Are you even considering the possibility that not every single individual finds metal to be 'awesome' and 'epic' and omg DUDE did you listen to that 7 min guitar solo no one cares about?</br>  I'm not touching floyds since that nightmare time I had with one ibanez prestige and it's abysmal edge zero.<br>The fact it sounded like a turd and gfs pickups were superior to the stock ones was only the tip of the iceberg. <br><br> pot metal <br> shallow screw heads <br> some jap thought it's a good idea <br><br>Can't believe I bought into that overpriced and overrated "ibby" shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  &lt;object width="148" height="44"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://vocaroo.com/player.sw<wbr>f?playMediaID=s0g4Fb7fWy2v&amp;autoplay<wbr>=0"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src="http://vocaroo.com/player.swf?<wbr>playMediaID=s0g4Fb7fWy2v&amp;autoplay=0<wbr>" width="148" height="44" wmode="transparent" type="application/x-shockwave-flash<wbr>"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://vocaroo.com" style="font-size:xx-small;" title="Vocaroo Voice Recorder"&gt;Record music and voice &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;</wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr>  i do fag  fag  <br>you clearly don't know anything about metal brahhhhh</br>  <br>i don't get why djentfags think open notes are a new idea, the new thing about djent guitars is the rhythm, which comes from the drums</br>  <br>Sounds like you really haven't listened to much metal</br>  <br>I'm well aware of that, but denying it's relevance to music IS RETARDED. You don't have to like it, but recogise it as relevant at least</br>  <br>How old are you supposed to be in 10th grade? English is not my native language</br>  <br>Go back and listen to your music collection then find all your best loved songs then remove all the ones that use a guitar (including samples) and look at how many song you have left, I'll take a guess right now and say that 95% of the average music collection will include guitars, so unless you only listen to Elizabeathan chamber music or synth music then you will only be left with a handful of songs.</br>  http://vocaroo.com/i/s0g4Fb7fWy2v  <br>Chink detected</br>  <br>Open notes aren't new no, but the palm muting technique used is, as is the inclusion of atonal tapping licks and rhythmic displacement.</br>  <br><br>it literally makes the sound i want it to make.<br>someday ill get a budda amp but this is fine.<br>the vyper is just a toy that i got for super cheap.<br><br><br>no. i need to get an interface. or something. <br>me and my girlfriend usually just play punk songs. (shes the drummer).</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I hate what these new bands have done to that sound that meshuggah spent so long perfecting</br>  <br>KEK SikTh is as influential to djent as meshuggah and started djenting about the same time. Thorendal even reconises their influence on his playing</br>  <br>I know bro lol.<br>I bought one of the 100w heads to add to my collection. I was impressed. Still wanna do a tube changeout though</br></br>  <br>Man, I play guitar, I love guitar, honestly, I was just trying to point out the people that use metal as an excuse for guitar. I don't need an excuse and I certainly don't need metal to be it.</br>  fastest technical shredder all time<br> inb4 not enough soul <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=rut<wbr>yA12z3Ok</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Yeah I need to get one too, it would really propel my music to a new level. I'd just need to get some space and a drumkit.<br>Do you write your own stuff though?</br></br>  <br>Man I hated those shitty Peavey's too until a bud hooked one up to play alongside his Mesa, I'm not sure what he did but the combo of the two and his modded MIJ Strat sounded immense!</br>  My guitar  <br>Like 15</br>  <br>I know it's edgy, I bought it when I was 14. It's good quality though.</br>  <br>Nice! A7X are a guilty pleasure of mine :3</br>  <br>No, I don't like it (anymore), and I don't acknowledge it's importance to modern day music, because I don't care about modern day music I dont care about. I only care about music I like, and none of it includes metal as an important influence, in any case it's the other way around. Your music should thank my music for giving birth to the interstellar abomination that is metal.</br>  <br>Pantera is shit. Next worst is Five Finger Death Punch.</br>  <br>well said anon</br>  <br>ok i get you<br>it just feels like if anything from djent is going to carry on into the future, its gonna be the drums, the guitar kind of had its day, but its not the star of the show any more youknow? like, nobody really does guitar solos any more, they used to be in fucking everything</br></br>  <br>The dude has incredible technique, but he's not the fastest.<br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/-wbB9kbbPGo?t=3m22<wbr>s</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>This is even faster. Just watch for about 40 seconds.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>As if the two are anywhere near comparable lol</br>  well i dont play electric guitar because i play electric bass  <br>Alright so I'm supposed to be 15<br>I'm quite the smartass for a 15 year old, was that a compliment? Because if I would just be 5 years younger with the same brain. I would be an even better person I am now. If such is possible</br></br>  <br>modern metal solos have become breakdowns really, not massively technical but hey. If you wanna mosh then a breakdown is THE thing to mosh to. Suicide Silence, Emmure, Bring Me The Horizon. <br><br>Artists like Black Veil Brides still have huge shreddy solos and pull really young crowds too though</br></br></br>  <br>I've played one of their hollow bodies and it was like butter to play, the tone was amazing too, I just didn't have the money to buy one at the time.</br>  <br>royal blood are a copy of death from above 1979 so they aren't really innovative</br>  <br>I think we both know though that meshuggah are still the true progenitor of the sound<br><br>And I've never really heard of this Sikth band before but I'm not liking what I'm hearing so far</br></br></br>  <br>The dragonborn comes</br>  <br>we have like 7 or 8 songs ready for lyrics.<br>i got lyrics for like 2 or 3 songs.<br><br>im a really bad writer but no one else wants to sing or write. and im playing punk music so its not like it has to be ground breaking.<br><br><br>i was gonna get a cab/head but i dont need all that power. i like being able to dumb it down to 20 watts and play by myself. and then the 40 watts is plenty of power.<br><br>but ya, someday a budda or orange. maybe budda head with a carvin cab.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>indiefag detected</br>  <br>metal is kind of nostalgia: the genre though, and its too much of an echo chamber to make any difference to the broader musical landscape</br>  <br>well, yeah. seeing as Frederik coined the bloody word xD But Djent comes in so many flavours for s sub-genre it's unreal. everything from Periphery to Whitechapel</br>  <br>punk/ska/blues/folk<br>close enough tho.<br>DO YOU SEE A JAZZMASTER OR MUSTANG??! im not that indi.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd rather play violin and piss people off.</br>  <br>This one's mine. I usually keep this one at home. It can also be cut back to 25w but I rarely ever hit that switch</br>  <br> Ska <br> Punk <br><br>faggot</br></br></br></br>  I don't play electric guitar because I'm an adult  <br>So you masturbate to ponies in the basement cause that's to goddamn hipster</br>  <br>I'm not too sure. Bring me the horizon are getting SERIOUSLY FUCKING POPULAR and their last album Sempiternal has some heavy ass tracks on there. Shadow moses has 15 MILLION plays on spotify ( I just checked) and it djents a little bit I guess.</br>  <br>yeah you have a point</br>  <br>mah nigga</br>  <br>dude interference is normally a bad solder job<br><br>just take off the back plate and re solder all your pots/jack and it will be sweet!<br><br>I got blue tack in one of my guitars doing this job lol!</br></br></br></br></br>  Peep my all natural shreds<br><br>http://vocaroo.com/i/s0rVlT8VROa3</br></br>  <br>Here's a couple of JCM's in the personal studio, they generally stay there.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;630777777   <br>are you blessed with being able to play loud anytime? my house eats sound waves pretty well. but i still have downstairs neighbor who is home every once in a while.</br>  <br>i was more into acoustic as a teenager. still am for the most part. but much more into electric now that i can afford it. also having my own place not to piss my parents off.</br>  <br>How much did the JCM on the left cost along with the cabinet?</br>    <br>I actually am.<br>No neighbors for a couple of miles. <br>Here one of the old DSL40's. It's getting tired.</br></br></br>  <br>IIRC, I believe that one was $1400 used. I picked that one up around 7 years ago.</br>  Because guitar hero is much better  <br> getting <br>they were popular like 5 years ago<br><br>yeah the subculture is huge, arguably bigger than pop music, but its in a bubble, metalheads don't listen to anything but metal, or if they do their either ashamed of it or really really proud of having diverse music taste. and the entire subculture worships the "golden age" of the 70's and 80's, too much to do anything really new, i mean hell, metallica still headline shows.<br><br>meanwhile, for instance, in that same time period literally all of dance music has happened</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Yeah I do it's an Epiphone les paul model.<br>Though I mostly write my own songs and practice those I can play Inside the fire by disturbed. I started with that song because it suited my playing style best (although it took a while to learn it considering it's insanely complex and difficult).</br>  <br>No, I mean mainstream popular. They're getting air time on BBC Radio 1, their new stuff (Throne, Happy song and Drown) is in the top100 charts too.</br>  <br>Shit sorry I forgot what was there. The one on the left is a TSL100 and that one was $1500 from a guy who had a stroke and couldn't play anymore. The one on the right is a JCM900 and was $1400</br>  <br>http://www.officialcharts.com/artis<wbr>t/5240/bring-me-the-horizon/</wbr></br>  I bet you'll fags can't even shred on a classical<br>http://vocaroo.com/i/s0Sk6tZivc8M</br>  <br>Are you an guitar hero?</br>  <br>yeah the subculture is huge, but really really insular</br>  <br>One day you won't be 13 and you won't be so stupid</br>  <br>Beautiful!<br>Is that just you? What piece are you playing? Are you using a proper mic? My vocaroo's sound shit, laptop mic</br></br>  <br>Cello and alto saxophone<br>... electric guitar is for conformist posers</br></br>  <br>Although I like djent, you sound like a fucking idiotic kid</br>  Metal is dead /b/ros, nothing new will ever compare to it. Just let the good old shit be what it is and enjoy it for what it was.
