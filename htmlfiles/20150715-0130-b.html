Anyone got a Youtube video? cba with TOR</br>  post for interest.  <br>it was pretty much given to us</br>  Ok guys we are at 19 lets finish this.  went to sleep 10 hours ago, how tf did we get so far? we were stuck on 11 for 4 hours and counting.  <br> is there no YouTube videos of this? </br>  The bible quote right abouve the awnser bar is:<br><br>"Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free" (John 8:32)<br><br>For anyone that wants to know.</br></br></br></br>  Do you guys know anything about plants?<br><br>I planted sunflower seeds in three flower pots. Two weeks later, multiple seeds from two of the pots have sprouted into healthy ever-growing plants. However, none of the seeds in one of the pots went off. They're seeming all still inert and this bewilders me.<br><br>I got two of the flower pots from my dad who doesn't bother with plants anymore, they had blocks of dry dirt and weeds growing in them. I had to break up the dirt with a little gardening shovel and water and sift it around until it was grainy dirt again that I was satisfied to grow plants in. In these pots, the sunflowers have grown.<br><br>Now, in the third pot where nothing has grown, it's brand new. Fresh planting soil and plant feed. I don't understand why nothing has grown in the new flower pot with fresh soil, but the plants have taken off like crazy in the old ones that were just completely dried up.<br><br>Can you possibly explain to me how this happened?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  U touch Ur self at night so god dussnt want to let them gro lel rekt gg  Firstly OP, everyone has problems with their first marijuana grow. Your plants look young but good. Concentrate on growing for the highest thc content. Good luck op  <br>If you are that concerned about it, germinate them before sowing. If you have a kit, check pH and N content of soils, and compare.</br>  <br> germinate <br><br>Yeah, I truly understand now the importance of this.<br><br>I think I've only had a 50% success rate with these seeds by just planting them in the dirt. I could've improved this by doing the paper towel germinating technique.<br><br>I had no idea. I'm ignorant as fuck when it comes to planting. This is the first time I've really ever grown anything.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Also, Anon, what type of soil was used in the new pot? Some information not everyone knows, never use garden soil in a potted plant, though potting soil is okay for use in gardens. The garden soil has too much goodness that is meant to be dispersed in a larger area that need nutrients, it can kill what you have in a pot. <br><br>GOOD LUCK!</br></br>  <br><br>Interesting. Maybe I should dump of it out and mix it with regular dirt if that's the case. I'll look into this.</br></br>  Has anyone here ever dated a hooker?<br><br>I'm currently targeting one of my age (21), she's a single mother and single for long.

That's what you wanted, right? Well, I've decided I don't like people like you. You've messed with the community of the wrong psychopath. Before you get excited, you haven't even made me angry. I am a hard person to make angry. However, I despise people like you.<br><br>Your pitiful trolling skills are hilarious. trolling people and putting up proxies are level 1. Can you get someone to hang themselves? Can you get people to shove a spring up their penis? Your silly little "dan" won't protect you. I've hacked into many computers and spied on the users. I've hacked into games. I have been hacking since I had a computer. It's what I was raised to do.<br><br>You have no idea to the extent of fear which you should be feeling. All you are is just a community of internet creeps. Have you ever murdered anyone? I have no empathy and I will probably feel joy peeling your skin off your face.<br><br>You think I'm giving you an empty threat? Believe that. I have contacts in dark places that you don't want to know about. If you live even close to me you better fear for your life.<br><br>Track my IP if you want to, but I am smart enough to use a library computer.

He confided in me last night. I dont want to shame him or tell him Im not doing that for him. But how can i get myself to that point? I find poop disgusting. <br><br>Picture related, just send a picture of myself pooping to him at work</br></br>  <br>masturbate too much, frequent /b/<br> done </br></br>  <br>depends what level he's into<br>does he want you to straight up dump on him or does he just like to watch<br>i got a friend taking shits for me ...lets me watch and spreads that dirty asshole after and that's enough for me<br><br>it's also not his fault ...people can't control what they like so go easy on the guy</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just do it knowing it makes him radiantly happy.<br><br>Shut up and take a dump in his mouth so it can fall over the corner of his lip like a bag of leaves and he can get up and gargle his shame away</br></br></br>  <br>He wants to start with watching. He already stands outside the door when Im pooping and goes in the bathroom after.<br><br>His biggest fantasy will be if I poop on his chest. He wants to play with it and even eat it....</br></br></br>  I think even people who are into weird shit (no pun intended) realise that it is weird. It's not like they are niave to the fact that the majority of the population find poo disgusting. I mean, I have some pretty odd kinks and fetishes myself, but I realise that not all girls are gonna be into it, so you just accept it. Just because you have a fetish doesn't give you a god given right to indulge it and expect your partner to indulge it for you. If you aint into it, just tell him. If he can't accept that then you should find someone more mature.  <br>More mature? I think Im as mature as one can get in this situation. When he confided in me, I told him I admire his honestly and openness about it. I could tell he was ashamed. Last thing I want to do is kinkshame him.</br>  <br>Sorry read your post wrong. Long day.</br>  <br>well i sometimes fantasize about the chest thing but after some experience with watching he may do what i did and keep it a fantasy...never eat it though ...fantasize but never actually would<br>best think to hope for is he'd be ok with watching<br><br>also tip: watching on toilet and actually watching it come out are two different things...had a friend do it outside and even in a clear plastic box before.<br><br>at least he trusts you enough to tell you this ..maybe surprise him by inviting him in one time and tilting to the side so he can see<br><br>of course i have no idea how averse you are to the whole thing so do whatever you think u can haha</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>More mature as in he can accept that poo is an extremely niche fetish and 99% of the population are going to find it repulsive. If it's a real breaker for him and he can't fall in love without it, then he really needs to find a partner who is into it also, or at least doesn't find it a turn off. I'm assuming you find it a turn off? It's not about shaming someone at all. If he can't empathise with the fact that it makes you feel uncomfortable then he is emotionally immature.</br>    <br>I didnt like the idea golden showers before I met him but now I engage in it every week. But that went easier than this.. poo thing.<br><br>Im getting over my fear of him watching me poop. Tonight I'll lead him to the bathroom when I have to go.</br></br></br>  <br>Im the first girl he ever mentioned his fetish to. I dont think its a dealbreaker, its not like he can easily move onto another woman that is into it.<br>I just dont want to say no before giving it an honest try. But the idea of poop is kinda disgusting...</br></br>  <br>In the end though it is only poop. If you have a baby you're going to be covered in it all the time and it'll be far worse than your boyfriends</br>  <br>If you're already indulging him in golden showers, I'd say that is a pretty good compromise. You shouldn't be shy about telling him that the idea of poo disgusts you. If he likes you, he will understand.</br>  <br>Im just worried about bacteria.</br>  <br>I needed a bit convincing when it came to golden showers but now Im more of a piss slut than he is. I remember back then watching lots of piss porn. But scat porn really repulses me so it isnt really working.</br>  <br>Honey, it's not all about you. You don't like it, it's fine. Make him a deal.
