Searched the catalogue and no trap thread, so I started one          lurking     I'm always surprised how calm some of these traps can look when cumming. When I cum I'm spasming and flapping my arms and shit.    Your reasoning was logical. I only have this tribute. And two shemale beast videos if you want those.     sauce       searched the catalogue   not enough cancer for today   better make a trap thread   fuck off.        damn      Jesus Christ almighty. Too fucking sexy.    sauce for this one? Name or link?      sauce? name??      I have a clue about sauce man, just some random stuff I saved   Sure man post whatever you have         need some sauce or a name     Really though     Diamond x2        ask for sauce and name  must be new here      Kitty Lynn                                   whew. thank you based anon       no problem.    ive watched this trap's stream before on chaturbate but i forgot her username can anyone tell me what it was?     some high quality tarps in here     There's got to be more of this one    More of those<br/>        diamonds r us      sorry dont have more.   Can someone explain to someone from Scotland what all the shit with the flag is please?   Rednecks    feminists are trying to ban all Scottish flags   autism   I'm sorry, but did racism already lose? Oh, that's right. The national conversation isn't even over yet. In fact, it's only 86%. Does not having the lead at 86% count as a loss? Is that what you're saying? Because if you're saying that I can assure you that you're wrong. Why would you make this topic when the national conversation is still on? Racism is still playing right now and it has been the best ideology in the US for how many decades now? It's against one of the worst ideologies in history that just happens to have a lead because they're feeding off the projections of the voters. But you know what? They still fucking suck. Racism is one of the best fucking ideologies in the Neanderthal party, it was 50/50 last month and would of won the debate if the nigger didn't cheat. Maybe you should shut the fuck up before you make retarded topics like this. You know why? Because you're going to be embarrassed when racism wins and someone bumps this topic. Oh look at that, racism just got west virginia, just like environmental denialism did. Are you a fucking drunk? Are you retarded? Are you autistic? You are a fucking idiot and you should never make a topic on this board again and I'm fucking serious. I almost have a feeling you're the only guy making all these anti-racism topics because you're a faggot hater who doesn't like the Neanderthals because they're good. Fuck you, be good at something in YOUR life and then maybe try to troll these fucking teams on the board, like I give a fuck. It's so easy to spot out your threads now, you're a retard. Always doing stupid shit like this. Why don't you try to be a good poster? Just for once? For once in your fucking life try not to make a topic Iike this. That's just you, you're always right at getting it wrong. Fuck you. You are nothing.   That is the flag of American racist pro-nazis.  Just a flag of some faggots that got their ass handed to them 150 years ago by the USA ... A symbol of losers that losers identify with.  Short version:  During the US Civil war (in which the north wanted to free the slaves, and the south didn't), the flag of the Confederacy is the flag flying in the OP.  Confederacy=Pro-Slavery=Racism      here's my radical view on the Confederate flag -- context is king. You remember context, right? It's a word that serves to set the parameters of why, how and where something is used and what that usage means. It's a way that intelligent and reasoned people used to think because it avoids artificial either/or constructs. If the Confederate flag appears at a KKK rally, okay, I have a pretty good sense for how it's being used. But if it appears on a Confederate cemetery or in a Sons of Confederate Veterans meeting, it's probably something different. My idea is incredibly radical so hold your breath: a symbol can mean more than one thing. The Confederate flag is racist when racists use it, and when racists don't use it, it's not racist. But that's not good enough once the wheels of the social media mob start turning, there's only one proposition -- THE CONFEDERATE FLAG IS EVIL AND RACIST AND MUST BE BANNED AND REMOVED FOREVER    And the flag of traitorous losers.     and ironically enough, these confederate flag lovin hillbillies are historically from scotland. toppest of the keks.     Those damn feminists  Thank you for the shortest normal answer      Flag that meant slavery and incest   it's about being preaching tolerance while acting on great intolerance   North won the Civil War and got to decide what means what.    The Confederacy seceeded from the US because they went apeshit thinking President Lincoln was going to ban slavery.  They used the flag in question as their battle flag.  Lincoln was all like, "Well, I wasn't going to do it earlier, but since you've decided to start shit, now I will."  The US won. The South is butthurt about losing their negro labor.  So they keep flying the flag because they deep down refuse to accept they lost.  Said now decendents of those slaves want them to shove that flag up their pasty white asses.  That's pretty much it.                Yes all southerners are from Scotland you retarded cancer   That is the flag of my enemies. They resisted, but they couldn't stop deez nuts.  Essentially what's happening is that a bunch of rednecks think that their AR-15s can take out an M1A2 Abrams.  Many people losing their minds over a piece of cloth that never directly hurt them.   Really nigga     Why is it happening now? Was there a catalyst?      Y'know, this is actually succinct and fairly accurate for such a vast oversimplification.  Nicely done.      LOL those southern types seem to like the stories about them getting their asses kicked. The alamo, the civil war. Fly that flag while you can you fucking degenerates.   i am from the south and i don't fucking get it  as far as i figure it is just a bunch of angry niggers trying to piss off white people      Some racist shot a black church that killed about 10 people.    treason    also, there's a few famous movies that paint a good picture of the south and how butthurt they were.   Birth of a nation   gone with the wind   I like birth of a nation because of its accuracy, despite its 110% pure racism and white propaganda. That movie came out about 50-60yrs after the war so many people at the time were still alive from the war and the memories of before/during/after were still fresh.        Yeah the recent church shooting in charleston, South Carolina where a white 21 year old killed like 8?? African americans to "start a race war"   Here's some fun facts for you neckbeards.  1. The civil war in america didn't start until a few months after the south seceded. Yeah that's right you faggots, the war didn't start the Second the south secceded.  2. The war started because the confederates attacked fort Sumter after numerous pleas for the northern troops to leave the south Carolinian fort  3. Abraham Lincoln didn't want to free slaves. He just wanted to keep it from spreading. The only reason he passed the emancipation proclamation was to keep Europe out of the war.  4. The south for the most part didn't even want to be a part of the revolutionary war-least of all south carolina, which had it good with the brittish.  5. The emancipation proclamation freed nobody.  6. The only reason blacks were allowed to fight for the north was because the people who were fighting (mainly cheap labor Irish folk) abandoned the field after the emancipation proclamation.  7.the south was going to let blacks join the army in exchange for freedom  8. Most of the people fighting with the south didn't even own slaves.  9. The a,Erica flag supported slavery for far longer than the Confederate one did.  10. The American flag is the flag of traitors.  11. As is the indian.  12. As is the brittish.                            Actually my good sir, the confederacy delivered a can of whoop ass to the north, they just didn't have the structure needed to take over the existing government, basically they were just looking for a fight, won, they said fuck it  I'm Hispanic btw        It's been building for awhile, and the all the crap with the cops and white supremacists, this last couple of years put it over the top.  The thing to remember is that politics in the United States swings to the right and left of political position that's fairly centrist, if a bit to the right of what you guys see in Europe.  Basically, the further one gets from that center, the fewer people get attracted and the more get alienated. Eventually, the situation corrects itself, no matter how far to the right or to the left the pendulum swings.  However, in difficult times -- especially difficult economic times -- the pendulum swing out a lot further than usual, one way or another. This time, the combination of Middle Eastern violence ineptly handled by the prior administration, and an economic collapse ineptly handled by everyone, made for a much wider swing the right, than usual.  The correction is under way.             HE DID WHAT????    Niggers think taking down a flag will automatically end all racism immediately and the world will live in peace and harmony.    People really hate the Confederate Navy.     This flag thing is related to that???   mfw Americans ban flags instead of guns        It is the paradox of tolerance. You are to be tolerant of everything but the intolerant, which is what racists are. There is free speech, but just as one can't yell fire in a crowded theater, free speech doesn't top the safety of others. If this symbol of the defeated South is used in the ideology of dangerous people who do shit like shoot up churches, it has to fucking go. I would wipe my ass on the Confederate flag if I had one    Batman would disagree with your assessment that symbolism is worthless.    this is not really correct. the war between the states had less to do with slavery than trap threads have with being a woman.  this flag stood for the soldiers who died in that war and not really much else.  BUT to the victor goes the history.  i mean this is essentially like the native americans decided to say that they were upset and offended by the american flag because they felt as if it portrayed the ruination of their country. should the american flag be retired in that regard?&gt;  what about the lone star flag and mexicans?              This. Also people don't seem to recognize the difference between the Battle Flag of the Army of Northern Virginia in contrast to the true flag of the Confederacy.    Uhmmm. then why was the emancipation proclamation not even considered by congress until 3 years into the war if thats what started it?    Everything went to shit after stonewall was killed.  By friendly fire no less.      not really.  Irish, english, dutch, in fact VERY few are scottish because the scottish at that time are a poor nation. the south was run by wealthy aristrocrats that had the money to purchase land and slaves....       being this retarded      Southern and Northern culture is very different in the US. After the south lost the Civil war, their economy and way of life was greatly disrupted. Many southerners continued to fly the confederate flag as a way to ground a very shaken identity.  However, similalyr to the swastika, many people who aren't ideologically or culturally connected to the conferderate flag at all sport it to appear tough. Similarly to the swastika, the culture which first created the confederate flag commited atrocities against an ethnic minority (albeit to a far lesser extent).  Unlike the swastika though, the confederate flag represents a much wider culture which was in no way evil.   Asking many southerns to abandon the flag would be like if after we defeated the Nazi's the allies collectively decided to burn all of Germany's castles just to show 'em who's boss and desecrate the root of their culture.   And none of this wouldn't even be a thing if some autist didn't take a picture of himself holding a conferdate flag before going on an autist shooting spree.             That's because most people are both ignorant and stupid, and believe whatever they're told.  The one thing Democrats get right.       The Stars and Bars was General Robert E Lee's personal battle flag for his units. He was also the top general for the Confederacy.  Long story short, the South had most of the USA's GDP through it's crops and plantations which it then sold to Europe. The Union wanted a larger portion of the money so they put heavy tarrifs on the southern goods. They also didn't like slavery, but it was mainly about money.  The south said fuck that it's our money, federal government shouldn't overstep it's bounds, we're pulling out. The Union then didn't want to lose all of the money so they fought a war to bring the southern states where all the money was back into the fold. They were like oh yea, since we won, you should also free those slaves.  The south see's the flag as heritage and standing up for states rights, and blah blah blah. Not Racism.   However, the Klu Klux Klan as well as other groups with racist tendancies adopted the battle flag as a symbol. Thus the flag has taken on a meaning of racism.  TLDR. The union was greedy as fuck and conquered the south who rightfully succeeded. Racist Assholes took the battleflag and use it as a rallying cry for racism even though it's not meant to be that way.               The difference with Texas is that we wouldn't take our flag down to appease the Feds and the cry babies    Bigger question is: What's the big fucking deal? It's a fucking flag of long lost fraction. Nothing but a history relic.    Not to attack you or anything but can we stop calling them african americans. At this point anyone who was from africa originally is dead and the descendants are just americans now.    Trips !!! Oh YEAH     south who rightfully succeeded.  Holy shit, your speech was very secessful. You must be from the South     we call them niggers instead     South owns slaves   South owns crops   Uncle Tom's Cabin is released   Slaves become a moral issue   Confederate flag raised to support confederacy, main goal of confederacy is to keep slaves in existence for what was once an economic reason, but is now a moral reason. They believe the black is inferior.   On the other hand, the Union, once shunning the south for the abuse of slavery on economic reasons, are now given a moral standpoint on how beating and abusinv people could be horrific.     The confederate flag now stands today as not only a sign of the civil war but also the deep racism that flowed through the veins of the confederacy and their ideologies behind blacks.             I would agree, but the Confederate flag as we see it today wasn't even the true confederate flag.  That one was.  The flag on question was the battle flag, held in the arms of mainly poor southern folk who couldn't afford slaves.  It's a general ignorance of history by both parties.          DUBS SPEAK THE TRUTH.   trips cannot be argued with you.    only thing yall left out is that the south would have won had the french not been called in as a last resort.  ulysees Grant backed into a corner, french navy finally show up and bombard the Robert E Lee, entire war turns upside down.  thats like two brothers are in a fight with fists and arnold swarzenagger in his prime shows up with a bowie knife and starts slashing throats..  oh yea totally fair                Robert E. Lee, the one who won a few battles in the North, said from the beginning that the Confederacy would never win the war. The Confederacy never had the opportunity to take over the country even if they did or didn't have the structure necessary to - the Battle of Gettysburg saw to that.  Lee's reputation was so feared that the Union Generals placed in charge of the Union Army were too afraid to risk an attack, putting the North on the defensive. Lincoln rotated through these Generals until he came across Ulysses who had the balls to risk a loss by taking on the offensive.  The Confederacy knew they would need to rely on British support, and when that didn't come, the war was essentially over due to the south's smaller population and lack of infrastructure - which was further reduced after Sherman's march through Georgia which pretty much single-handedly demolished the Confederate economy.  The South got their asses kicked.  I'm white, but I don't support this "get rid of the rebel flag" shit.            I'd like to see your face when your retarded ass realize that'djust make it easier to kill more people. Nothings gonna stop someone that really wants a gun from getting their hands on one. We aren't faggots like you that have to have someone else do the fighting for us    Bait    Nobody in history, except India under Ghandi.    A lost fraction? I think you may mean faction and....as a South Carolina citizen i wouldn't expect a foreigner to get it.     not sure if troll or just stupid, North had slaves too     The civil war is a big mess, even now. The main thing about it, is it pertains to the liberal rewriting of history and liberal hypocracy. Flags should be hidden in museums to be scoffed at and truths should be hidden and lies should be used to pander. Liberals don't like doing, they like talking, the best way to talk is to make people angry, using national power to remove a symbol against national power. Scape goating and using hypocracy for sanctimonious, imaginary progress, just like the rest of any counter-culture movement, a popularity contest to see whose louder, more abrasive, more progressive, and can grow their hair out the longest. Flags are flags, and idols are bullshit, but if liberals can have idols, and rainbow flags and shit, why can't conservatives?      Cultural Marxists, aka progressive liberals, believe that the Tennessee battle flag (incorrectly labeled as the confederate flag) creates a mindset of racism. Just weeks before, the US flag was "just a piece of fabric" and standing on or burning it was their right. Now that they have found something they don't like, a flag is more than a piece of fabric and should be banned.   it's only ok if I say it's ok   muh tolerance       Its bait for dumb asses who have no idea what the civil war was about.    Civil war was about states rights vs. Federal gov't tyranny  The whole slavery/racism vs. "good guys" angle is 100% PC revisionist bullshit  Both sides had black fighting for them. Not everyone in the south owned slaves. Black were among those that owned slaves (Yes, black people owned black slaves down south)    in b4 "ur a redneck southerner"   And I am 100% born and raised in Northern USA          What this is about is that the flag has been a snub to the federal government and they hate it.   Oh look another idiot that thinks the civil war was about slavery. Both side's were pro-slavery; no one at the time thought of blacks as people. The north just wanted a majority say in the structuring because they're assholes, so the south retaliated; that's why it's known as "the war of northern aggression." You cant blame a group of people for wanting to resist this sensational, homogenous culture assimilation and preserve history.    Tfw the north was lucky to win. Tfw attaching slavery as a moral issue to the Union cause pressured England to support the union where they had been supporting the confederacy. Tfw niggerniggerniggernigger     this this this this this  100%  It is an anti-federal flag, not anti black, not racist, not pro slavery  Fuck off all you liberal cunts. eat a dick. 100% northerner           structuring of the nation, that is.    trips has spoken!!!!    The redneck flag represents anti-cuckolding, it is against being a submissive little bitch, those views are not acceptable in modern America.   The last state to truly uphold confederacy morals.    inb4 racism      Just dropping in from page 1 to inform you that I am from Texas and you are, in fact, a faggot.    Fucking sweet.    this flag was bought in Galveston Texas asshole.     I'm retarded btw  ftfy     Dallas does not count as part of true texas.  your a faggot, learn to be part of your state instead of fighting against it.      Lone Star rebel here .... and you're not a Texan    and dear it was actually Bolivar.  galveston is too liberal to sell this shit.      The Dixie flag was not the actual flag of the Confederacy, it was a battle flag adopted by the KKK and other racists to oppose and oppress the Civil Rights movement. My guess is that most of those who are using to to show "Southern Pride" and to remind them of their heritage wouldn't even recognize the actual flag of the Confederacy.   People are generally dumb asses, but none moreso than these "Southern Pride" morons.      Go back to page 1    Yankee fag!!!    autism everywhere    You just confirmed you are an idiot    but symbolism means what i want it to mean. nigger is derogatory, slaves were actually free, and /b/ only sleeps with Mlp fags amiright?&gt;       In the specific context over it flying over the South Carolina capitol (or whatever gov't building) it was only put there during the civil rights movement as a sign of defiance. So that is quite literally racist use in that context.   I can't help but wonder, since it only became a relevant symbol for the SC gov't at that time, and not the preceding 100 years, what if it experienced a similar resurgence in, shall we call it, mainstream southern pop culture (ie outside of kkk rallies) at the same time, and the whole "its about pride and history" thing was just an excuse for passive aggressive racism, but after generations people now only sport it on hats and bumper stickers because everyone (white) believed their peepaw's lies      Dear Scottish Person(s): Our Southern Fuck-tards stole your Cross of St. Andrew to make their fake ass flag bullshit. Later, they claimed those Burning Crosses they used were based on Yours, even though yours looked like this-&gt; X, and not this-&gt;+. We profusely apologize, and hope you forgive the baseless actions of these Stupid Fucks, Sincerely, The USA.      Its about crybaby niggers crying      Bunch of libtards got but hurt because 9 nignogs got blasted in SC. The mass media made a big fucking deal about it and some people pushed to have a civil war relic removed from the Capitol grounds in SC. Sounds like they won because the squeeze wheel gets the grease and no politician wants to come off as being racist.    mister obama is distracting us from the trans pacific trade partnership by stirring up some bullshit about a flag that no one has said anything about for 150 years.  funny how barely 2 years ago pic related was happening.      Except it wasn't liberals but Republican leaders in SC &amp; Alabama who are removing the flag. Hell, Jeb Bush removed it from Florida's Capitol building when he was governor. But keep on blaming liberals because it totally doesn't make you look like a pathetic jackass.    Clementa Pinckeney actually voted for that flag to be placed where it was on the capitol grounds at the memorial for a confederate soldier ...but liberals never let a good tragedy go to waste.    Best part was the families of the now deceased nigs forgave the shooter, and didn't want this to become a big deal.  Pretty much the only people who care are white women ages 12-25 above 220 lbs on the west coast who never learned actual history other than film and art history.      ok charmander, explain to me Nathan Bedford Forrest, who founded the KKK but was honored as a Confederate Veteran - he committed many atrocities against blacks, and vehemently hated them.    actually the current debate in question is about it flying over a memorial for Jackson....     succeeded  lol he doenst know what the word succeed means.    Just a quick rebuttal to all of the "The confederate flag isn't even the confederate flag" posts; it really doesn't matter for the sake of discussion. I'm not saying it's not important to differentiate the "actual" flag from another one for historical purposes, but it where is came from doesn't really matter. If you supplanted every instance of "the confederate flag" in this debate with "the speckled purple elephant flag", the dynamic of the issue wouldn't change in the slightest.  Language is malleable, and in society and history perception is reality. Confederate flag = Confederate flag ≠ Confederate flag = speckled purple elephant flag ≠ speckled purple elephant flag.      a minority group of people is representative of the whole     thats because they are a differnt species than human.....  but lets not go into that right now were sticking to one controversy at a time.   TIME TO START POSTING BLACK FACTS v CRIME RATES          squeeze   it's squeeky you fucking redneck.     People want to think that half the fucking nation at one point = EVILLLL!!!!!! and won't take 'it's actually far more complicated than that' for an answer.   Nikki Haley is a liberal now? Lindsay Graham too? You're a fool.    Miuh feelings.    even im am smart enough to understand that was an autocorrect. and im a redneck.  what does that make you sir by your own admission of idiocracy and redneckitude       We still do. But instead of providing them 40 acres and a mule as the north said we just provide them welfare    Didn't realize he could time travel and went by the name John May    Absolutely. Liberals in GOP clothing.    yea.. bowing to polical correctness in order to gain favor by a handful of yankees and/or the feds...  liberal       40 acres and a mule might've gone a long way to easing race relations had they paid up, it just added insult to injury and left a lot of people unable to provide for themselves.   It was a senate vote MORON , which is not made up of 1 person   The media here in america likes to blow irrelevant bullshit up into larger issues in order to divert the general public's attention from real problems or topics near election times, or in an attempt to start to sway the masses into feeling a way about something they didn't care about in the first place as a first step in some kind of twisted smear campaign.     Imagine if Ireland was still apart of the UK.  The Irish flags would be flown by the retards throughout the Kimgdom in honour of Their Heritage.      The confederate flag is treasonous and should be removed from all official state property. It's a flag for degenerates who can't face the fact that the confederacy was shit.   Yea. Using a single word that you don't appear to understand to describe all people you disagree with.  Moron.     When did /b/ become so /pol/?   Well looks like another Lincoln fuck over. Thanks for pointing that out.    Do all people from Europe need to be spoonfed like this? Holy shit you're fucking retards.    It will be a senate vote because Nikki Haley as governor ordered it. You're too stupid to be in this discussion.    Underrated post     leftists thought they wouldn't let a good tragedy go to waste     so your telling me that sacrificing what you truely wish to stand for in order to spare other peoples feelings is NOT liberal way of life?  but the trasngenders, but the niggers, but the mexicans, but the asians, but the homeless, but the chijun in africa, but... but..  fuck off and learn what your party is akin too.   you guys have less of a backbone than a worm.               238 blacks were shot dead in 2014 under this flag, yet it's not considered racist?   *your    What South Carolina does is South Carolina's business. If you don't like it there are 49 other states to go live in    /thread    Using something that some people are connected to while the politicians are passing secret deals behind closed doors.  I'm about ready to get the fuck out of this messed up country.       liberal pussyboy detected needs uncle sam to tuck him into bed      You clearly didnt read the post . FAIL. Nikki Haley was a child when that vote was taken.    What about all those innocent people in guantom just for being arab.  All under that flag.  It's not racist because we don't want it to be.          just proved his point for him     don't forget that flag flew over slavery for almost 90 years compared to the confederate states' 5.     Liberal SJW faggots want the flag removed from every inch of the earth and will use big government to do it.  Butthurt redneck southernfags who cling to an idealized "old south" that never really existed and are crying "mah freedoms!" because they don't want it removed.  Unfortunately, I live in Texas, so I have to deal mostly with the latter. They're both annoying, but at least the liberal people aren't biblefuckers.         There have always been secret deals...only difference is they have stopped denying it.   IT'S NOT ABOUT SLAVERY OR OFFENDING BLACKS.  THAT'S JUST THE EMOTIONAL ARGUMENT THE MEDIA USES.  THEY WANT TO GET RID OF THE FLAG BECAUSE IT'S A SYMBOL OF OPEN REBELLION AGAINST THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT        women are always liberals. and lindsay graham has always been a liberal... as well as a dicksucking faggot     It was different back then. Fuck, it was different in the 1950s   Hey guys, just the flag that oppressed native americans since since Andrew jackson   It was different then, too    But Batman isn't real.  And Symbolism can't cure social ills      Basically a bunch of racist assholes want to keep up the hope that someday they will rise up and destroy the federal government and put black people back into slavery. That's what the flag is about. Meanwhile the rest of us just want them to stop LARPing the civil war and get over their butthurt so we can move on as a society.    Exactly. The race baiting feds didn't like the fact that South Carolina failed to chimp out....so they had to attack us for something    I'm telling you that if a Republican does something you disagree with it doesn't make them a liberal. There is no liberal manifesto, no liberal way of life, no single "Liberal" box you can put everyone in. Politically I'm very liberal on many issues but I would not support a ban on firearms. I view it as a vital right. Do I fit your stereotype?     just took my bait  you forgetting where we are son?      Different    Same design with less stars.....        same thing with general Lee's battle flag   Also   implying it still isn't going on today           Fantastic point. Lets take down the flag that stands for oppression around the world at this point    ...yeah. i forgot. ... i thought this was /pol/    Letc just take down every flag!  While we're at it, let's get rid of every form of design so nobody gets upset at anything.  Maybe everyone should have all senses removed so they can't be exposed to offensive materials.       that is the exact opposite of what happened    "Money shot"  Unlimited power.  inb4 scales   I still don't see him here.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;624021771  One on the face and one on the hips.      bottom bitch reporting in       And one between the lips   Get in line      https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=BSj<wbr>eevE_nTg</wbr>  [ ]   that's because you're late      Awwww yiss.

It has to be awesome, so /b/ doesnt think furfags are complete queers. But what? What do I write that will convey both our superiority and mystery? I know...   go kill yourself.          Roy tried to touch my no-no, somebody send help   It better not.  Last one went though 7 years of furry.   I'll wrap it up in some network cable and spank it.         You can do the same to me    goddammit draz now play dirty bomb with me     Do you need pollinating?   I'm sure that it has a few more kinks than that       Well, that's better then spanking around my new $50 modem.  I might need to get a new rooter too.

How is it not? Name a genre easier to play    only cuz you have a nice butt..lemme install it    idk, you're pretty easy, HEYOOOO      Maybe, no experience so I wouldn't know    not the reasoning i was expecting but yay    heresy    i know those feels   its the reason you wanted, be honest       Why did they even have you get a new one?

Cod  legend of zelda   yes   This is b8      Any MOBA such as League of Legends and Dota 2.  Pff you boys know nothing. ET for the Atari ruined everything.    A single game nearly wiped out the whole vidya game industry... purely epic.    any free to play or pay to win game.     Custer's Revenge  The one where you run around fucking indians.  But other than that I'd have to say Half Life Team Fortress.. fucking hats and shit. Any game where you can make in-game purchases basically.       Id say farmville and all that social shit like candy crush   that arent really games  I know that but its one when not the biggest cancer there is. And its socially more accepted, even when its just for fast cash    Metal Gear Solid   Steam.   Pokemon Spyro Crash Bandicoot GTA      Damn, that's a good one. It taught Activision that they can just rehash the same game 3 times a year and people will buy it. And also that Crash Bandicoot should be killed off in favor of generic first-person shooters.    inb4 every single popular game ever   Anything that isnt CoD or Angry Bird sucks   This anon gets it.   Halo    Halo    crash bandicoot  Right in the nostalgia     /thread.    episode 3   Skyrim  99℅ of all mobile games  Mortal Kombat made the ESRB  Ocarina of time     1% is actually good      assassin creed franchise    Which is exactly the reason why Activision is the most despicable video game company on the planet. Worse than EA, worse than Ubisoft, worse than Konami, worse than fucking Imminent Uprising.    CSGO and TF2   hats   knifes       anyone???  Halo 4 (start of FPS jetback trend for console based games), Any EA sport game, CoD after MW1   this    CoD fucked over humanity   Batman arkham knight  Snake on Nokia phones  Made everyone think all phone games should be simplistic, short things     Do you have some?    Depression Quest    agree/disagree, halo was good until after halo 3, it was good until bungie left... I'm not a bungiefag bc i think they're the biggest sellouts, but got to admit when a game is good    Those are both optional things which have no effect on the gameplay whatsoever.  You should've picked stuff like Dungeon Keeper or Star Trek Trexels.      Atari was already in the shitter beforethat game was made...bubble just happend to burst around the same time it came out...nigger made that shit hella quick and the fact its not that bad is an amazing feat in itself   Sportsballmen 3: Why Play Outside?   how has that fucked things up, it has only made opportunities, you don't have to have skins to play    Wrong, because of the E.T. game was so bad the industry changed for the better.    With Minecraft, it's the community. Mostly kids and gaymur gurls. If it's audience wasn't so shit, I'd love it.    Actually arkham knight is good for gaming, it's showing the power of refunds     Minecraft makes children social.   Get out.   Starbound.   RIP the age of companies shitting out ports and getting away with it   Candy Crush, World of Warcraft  The Last of Us. Fuck that game   Almost every popular game on the play store/appstore is completely copied and rehashed from another game. Other games are just money hungry as fuck and sometimes even plain stupid. I mean, Candy Crush was just a blatant ripoff of every other gem swapping game. Then it got ripped off too. These companies like Electronic Arts and Disney will just pump out unoriginal games based on something and call it new.  pic related  Found this the other day.      Even without the community, it's damaged the industry.  It taught people that graphics can look like absolute vomit-inducing arse but it's alright because it's "retro"  It taught people that teaching someone else's idea is fine(what is Lego)  It taught people that games should ditch all sorts of storytelling elements and just have it be sandbox.          Battletoads is the greatest.   The industry never recovered.   The question isn't if the game is good, it's what it did to the industry    so you can't love it just because of the people who play it?  fuck you  i fucking love minecraft and i just ignore everyone else playing it how they play it        ITT: Games that have permanently damaged the entire video game industry and objectively made it worse.    Pic related.      Were slowly going to shit    yeah the sandbox thing is so fucking garbage, what is the point if the world you in has no purpose, i mean how is it fun to just exist in a gaming world that is retarded    It's just another element of games you fuckweed. And if it stops those fucks bitching about graphics that's a good thing, because it's not all about graphics.     Talking shit on one of the best games in history. You must be 10.   Anything based on a movie.   Let me just diarrhea 3 games and a movie out in less than a year. Speaking of I can not believe they are making a movie. god help us all     muh pc master race      apps   Who the fuck cares about shitty apps.      I love the modding scene on it.  Minecraft with 100+ mods is a great fucking game.     Five Nights at Cockshitters has permanently damaged the horror genre of video games. Now kids will grow thinking that cheap unoriginal jumpscares over basic repetition of micromanagement makes a masterpiece horror game. Let's not forget the kids that say it also has a great story when it has the plot depth of Foodfight   Don't care got refund    the King Kong video game was fun, i played it all the time as a kid    BANJO KAZOOIE NUTS AND BOLTS   PONG  Any indie/early access game ever   because things can be retro, there's no cock hunger from niggers to force every game to be super graphic intense fuckery  i really don't want to have to buy a $3000pc to play an indie game  i want there to be games that focus more on the graphical style than realism and pixel density       Dayz, god all the fucking survival horror game are garbage.     Spiderman 2, enter the matrix, goldeneye, riddick    THIS    This  tfw still no Banjo Threeie       "but the lore is good"  If its not in the game, its nonexistent. Well, technically its not even a game, its waiting     Wtf is this shit   CoD undoubtedly. Contributed to the decline in other multiplayer FPSes (Halo, Battlefield) by making popular the gimmick of leveling up to unlock things. Even Splatoon has that mechanic.   Early DayZ mod was one of the best gaming experiences I have ever had. Now the mod and the game sucks dick.     tfw sadness         While I agree that minecraft is shit, I disagree with the notion that it's non-existant graphics are among the reasons for this. There are plenty of awesome games with practically no graphics. Like Dwarf Fortress or Cataclysm DDA      I i wonder why they dont port pc to consoles and not the other way arounf-oh wait then you would hsve to make a good game in the first place    Well, he's not wrong.    Too many castles, too many powerups.   The flow is disjointed throughout. Pretty much everything in this game not having to do directly with Toad is either boring or downright painful to play  Nintendo was trying to do too much with this title. Should have stuck to what they were known for. Pic related.        Trexles broke my heart    ET didn't change it for the better. Nintendo did.    Unstable as fuck, mod conflicts    Sometimes they do, diablo 3, crysis, apparently GTA v   Starforge, it ruined any trust I have in any early access/kickstarter game ever.  videogames are for children reported for underage   Spore   Nice b8 m8 i r8 8/8 now i have to go to s d8 bcause if im l8 my prodt8 will be in a bbad st8    Well, I don't know about you but I enjoy Hearthstone, and it has a mobile version of the game. (if that even counts as a proper mobile game)    That shit was years before it's time  No HUD, crazy dinos, mad visuals      noice pic    Halo was great for the industry. It pushed the limits of games and introduced the best map creation and game type creation for any game at the time, at least on consoles. It also showed that you don't need ADS to have a good and competitive shooter. It made other fps game make there single player better. In all honesty, Halo was years ahead of the rest of gaming which pushed everyone else to try harder and make better.  But that back fired and halo lost its spark. Now it's just another shooter. It makes me sad.      Hearthstone is meh. But tbh I have never seen a good mobile game. Except for 2048 on the toilet. Any suggestions?    Minecraft is a good game you hate because you're 13 and trying to be cool  ITT: middle schoolers who watch Jontron        weapons have no effect on gameplay  nigga u high     not parent, and i agree with you...  but there are so many indie games that are just "meh" or flat out awful gameplay with practically no graphics...but the devs think their game is retro and therefore awesome.      But it isn't good. Like I said earlier, it has the plot depth of Foodfight. The fans are just saying it's good because it's edgy and kids love being edgy  Emulators      It does. Actually, youre right. Im playin some f2p shooter when i have time    What the fuck is wrong with you    THIS      Thats also what i ttied to say   Kill me fast   Final Fantasy Record Keeper, if you're an FF fan it's perfect. FTL is also on mobiles      implying that these games ruined videogames when crash and spyro were god on PS1 and pokemon best gameboy game ever   okay retarded cuckfag kill yourself      BANG you ded now   Minecraft FNAF Any pay to win game The newer total war games Pretty much any game with DLC that costs more than the game Hearthstone and the other card games Depression Quest         how did it change?  i got really excited when peole were really excited about the game years ago but then people started being all meh and i thought something had happened and the game was ruined  what happened?          fuck off   Half Life 3   haha so funi    There are 12 year olds that actually think this    Wait what happened    epic meme bruh    i remember really liking to use the spears and doing the king kong finishers   Mobile games in particular.  Any game that pewdiepie plays on his channel, i instantly hate those even before trying them.   Any suggestions on good emulators? They all look dodgy.    This is a thread about games that have ruined the industry, not games you just don't like you stupid sack of shit. I mean I don't like mobas myself but they haven't hurt the fucking industry.      Dub dubs speaks truth     FTL is on mobile  shiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee<wbr>t  Unlocked all ships on PC version.  </wbr>      https://community.wbgames.com/t5/Su<wbr>pport-for-PC/June-24-Update-on-PC-V<wbr>ersion-of-Arkham-Knight/td-p/575332<wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr>    Noez, dis mah thead now. DDDDO THE DEW    RETROARCH    Game is probably the worst console port of all time. So bad that WB stopped selling it to fix it. All glory to steam refunds.    youre fucking retarded shut the fuck up cum guzzler     2015   doesn't know the difference between   an app and an actual vidya      For gba and gbc I use John [GBA] Best DS emulator is Drastic, but it costs money. Definitely worth in my opinion though Don't get myboy. It's garbage.     Runescape   Everyone started being a dick against each other.  Also the removal of the L85 AWS, AS50 and M107 were the worst decisions ever made. The created a thing to go for, a mythical being. If you found one of those and a ghillie suit you feared for your life at every turn. Shit was so tense, damn it's hard to describe it.        games=/=vidya    There's no such thing as 'Ruining the industry'  Some games are good, some games fucking suck. That doesn't mean people will stop gaming or developers will stop creating games because of one shitty game.    So you're saying that having a different skin affects gameplay? I hope this is bait.   Gmod  The Elder scrolls online   are you kidding me if the glove doesn't fit then you must aquit you piece of shit lol thank mr skeletal fucking give me your rare pepe     Thanks      calling someone who DOESNT like Minecraft a pubescent  This is b8    Any CoD after Black Ops 2   you magnificent faggot    any cod after mw    no    wrong, any cod after black ops 1    Kek'd    Ebin maymay nigga    And maplestory   Sonic '06 Sonic Boom Minecraft CoD Atari Pac-man       be me   haven't played any Cod game except for CoD 2   feels good mayne      god wtf is that borderline copyright infringement bullshit. I mean its like they hardly even tried to make some of them look different  Give Goku a bigger head, no one will fucking notice.     Animal Crossing   Top 2 on my list aswell... Fuck IAP Also MMOs are now shitfest theme parks, thanks to WoW      Minecraft is a fun game. You probably just don't like the people who play it.     any single video game destroying entire video game industry  Get over your selves, faggots.     Youre fucking retarded     destroy   damage  Learn the difference      Yeah but this isn't objectively bad     Evolve.  Buy our overpriced pile of shit! Then buy it again in forty pieces for half of your wallet and all of your dignity!       Animal Crossing is the fucking shit you fucking nigger    he can't learn, he's autistic    any early access game     kek     I remember when games were actually games, they had a fucking STORYLINE and SOUNDTRACK and GAMEPLAY.  Minecraft is basically a map editor that used to come with games in 2004.     pro tip to dumb cunts in this thread: a game being good doesn't necessarily mean it hasn't damaged video gaming.   Care to explain why? I'm actually genuinely interested.    storyline: no soundtrack: yes gameplay: yes  If you can't just immerse yourself into doing shit, like building a house for yourself, building a farm and such, you are a downer with Asperger.        What's funny is this ruined the fucking gaming community more than anything because now there are fucking casuals everywhere praising the shit out of this game because fags like pewdiepie play it and praise the shit out of it.    /pol/ plz go    Just because your bad kid doesn't mean for you get mad.  Also Shenume.       building a house   building a farm   They should've called it Redhead Simulator.       Meh some people dig it. Look at The Forest. Theres basically no fucking story other than "A plane crashed your son is gone bad people are here go survive faggot" and it's still a fun game to play    no today anon not today     building a house for yourself  it's not real life fuckwit     You think this is a bad story? Go check DmC    That's a story, there's a basic aim no matter how much is left to you to decide. Minecraft has no purpose at all, it's just a time sink for autismos.    Point fucking proven, downer    It's not really DayZ's fault that it was wildly successful and people wanted to cash in on it. Sure it inspired assholes to make absolute trash like WarZ but that's not DayZ's fault thats the shitty people who make the shitty games.     Trophies, Achievements and an emphasis on online play killed it for me, fuck you i'm an anti-social fuck and don't want to rely on other people to 100% a game, it's bullshit.   I don't have an issue with trophies and achievements. I have an issue with online trophies and achievements.  Fuck that shit.      Its ok if you got a bot for it ;)    how   cock rate thread   tried doing diff comparison     neat choice of game      wtf i only got a 7, my dick is sad  <br/>      Hey /b/ I was wondering if someone could tell me what those little white dots are on the rim of my head  There is no pain and my dick is regularly washed . I know this is /b/ but a serious answer or two would be much appreciated.    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirsu<wbr>ties_coronae_glandis</wbr>   that's called an std, buy better brand name prostitutes with a better warrenty    Tipping your pizza guy   Don't tell me you faggots actually do this.    Why the fuck wouldn't you?    I'm not a cheap faggot like you, fat boy  I also don't order my pizza by delivery because i'm not a lazy faggot.       Because I'm not giving someone extra money for doing their job.     The guy brings food to your house, and it's part of the culture. If you can't afford to tip you can't afford to order out.     OP thinks hes better than everyone because hes a fucking prick  Have fun dying alone dickwad lmao      I'll bet she hired some priests to burn that sweater and send it to hell    Some of us understand basic courtesy, not that i'd expect you, the average /b/tard to comprehend.   U WILL SEX PICTURE BELOW YOU       Lost            Damnit, that's disgusting.   where the padlet at?   Not bad besides the grayscale       Time for me to continue dumping Dodger.      I'll be a dick.          white jigs         I will sex below you, you fucker. Speak proper english   First green txt.... here we go   be me 14 female    go to take a shower and walk in on my 17 year old sister masturbating on the toilet    freak out and slam the door    we shared a room so I knew we would have to eventually talk about what just happened    as I sit in bed I keep picturing it over and over in my head and begin to get horny   Ive never thought of my sister in that way before    but these images had me dripping wet.  cont?           Proceed.    this story sucks m8    Tits or gtfo    wowowowow my first greentext I am finally become the 4chan master memelord  fuck off     If you think it sucks ill stop but at least its true not like the other bullshit gt you read on here   stahphu    tits or gtfo    Knock on the bathroom door wtf I'm sorry lass but you're retarded     You may proceed.   I'd like to believe this is true, but unfortunately you're probably some dude serving pasta. If we can't get a damn tits can we at least get a timestamp and pic.  Is that all you want is tits no story I thought people enjoyed this shit ?   Proceed you silly shit   Too bad that's not your sister in the pic. That would be awesome though.  we want both   I would love a story but I would prefer a pic and timestamp to know what we're looking at here.    I could here my sister unlock the door of the bathroom so I pretended to be asleep    she came into the room got dressed real quick and went out for the night    when she left I took off my panties and began masturbating to the images of my sister on the toilet rubbing her pussy.    even writing this right now is getting me wet again.   anyways after a nice masturbating sesh I feel asleep    only to be woken up by my sister at 3am    she was piss drunk and could barley stand  cont?          Yes continue! Don't stop!    fucking show us your tits you dumb bitch  sage        samefag 14 years old fuck off       Im not showing my tits you fucking pervs im here to tell a story of what happened a few years back holy shit  Then fucking tell us   Go on!   Incest is wincest!!   Then keep telling your story so people don't ask for tits. And dont ask to cont, if people are in the thread they're likely in for the story.     show your puss puss   PASTA   Hurry up and tell the story then    Crudely put, but does make a good point. If you want us to believe your story's true it would probably be a good idea to at least proove that you are a femanon.   This story is crap...   Reads as a guy pretending to be a girl. 99.99% sure this is a dude trolling.      show tits    or gtfo!      around midnight here a knocking sound outside   look out window and see sister stumbling around   obviously drunk   decide now I can ask her about . . . umm, stuff since she won't remember anyway   try to think of things to say   here her start knocking way too hard again   my present advantage is lost if mom or dad answer door   I'll have to think of things on the fly   hurry down to entryway to greet her   open the door    get on the floor   everybody walk the dinosaur                 Not funny. 0/10    Bitch, do you not know "here" from "hear"? One time is enough, but twice? Damn.    Ok    Yeah, normally the rules are if you are female and using your gender to get attention, then you have to pay the entry fee of tits. So that doesn't apply here, but you sound like a dude acting as a girl.   So either show us the tits to keep our attention or take your horrible story and go away.      I got out of bed to help her into her bed so she wouldnt wake our parents    there room was literally right across the hall    I took her shoes off and the began to take her shirt off as well    thats when she pulled me down with her on to her bed    at first I thought it was an accident because she was so drunk    but then she started kissing me    I backed off immediately I thought it was so weird    but then the images of her in the bathroom earlier started racing through my head and i couldnt resist myself    we started making out like crazy not even saying a word    she reach down to take my panties off    so i did the same to her     she began rubbing her fingers up and down my pussy I was getting so wet trying not to make any noise.

No answering if you've actually used one, let everyone else struggle.    Is that a gear stick for a manual lorry/truck/semi (depending on where you're from)  Nipple infatuator   turns breast milk into cream soda    The black switch (splitter) on the front is to flip the transmission into high or low gears, the red splitter goes forward and backward, and controls the overdrives. There's something called the straight 10, which only has the front splitter and has 5 low gears, and 5 high gears... and then there's the super 10, it has an overdrive for both high and low gears. The knob in the picture looks a lot like the one on the Eaton-Fuller transmission in my truck, probably is the same one. The splitters are air operated as well, a lot of the stuff on trucks is air actuated actually, even the windows on some trucks.

See      mfw i didnt need to fill out an application for my current job     SD70M-2?    its a 13 speed transmission shifter front button is the plunger or range selector, goes between high and low range red button on side is called a splitter, used on the high side of the box. Basically, you shift your 1st 5 gears normally. Flip the plunger up and shift from 4th, back to the 1st position, which in high range is now 5th, or 6th I guess, if you count low. Now, depending on wether or not your loaded, you now have half gears at your disposal. How they work, is you shift a full gear, get your RPMs back up, move the button back, let off the fuel, and then get back on it again. you'll feel the truck shift. Basically they exist to ease the load on the transmission and driveline. There are also 10 speeds with no splitter, or 18 speeds, on which both boxes are equipped with half gears. You can spec out a truck any way you like , with whatever trans and rear ends are needed for what your going to pull with the tractor. 13 is usually a highway trans, 18 is highway/heavy haul. 10s are usually for city work or lighter highway hauls.      its easier than you think.

The ICAM is a hand held, soldier operated post attack device for monitoring chemical agent contamination on personnel and equipment. The ICAM detects vapors of chemical agents by sensing molecular ions of specific mobilities (time of flight) and uses timing and microprocessor techniques to reject interferences. The monitor detects and discriminates between vapors of nerve and mustard agents. The ICAM consists of a drift tube, signal processor, molecular sieve, membrane, and expendables such as batteries, confidence tester, dust filters, Buzzer, and Battery Pack. The monitor measures 4-in. by 7-in. by 15-in. and weighs approximately 5 lb.
