Inshallah brother. Recently I haven't been participating in these threads so I just lurk.<br><br>I know of it too. I also have access to the archives with the maps and shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Its okay..</br>  <br><br><br>Chen Out~</br></br></br>  <br>W-what?<br><br>What are you talking about? My clothes are fine.</br></br></br>  <br>(There's two of em, now. They are multiplying. Soon all will become Ryuko.)</br>  <br>Mah first hunger games win allllriiiiight</br>  <br>Yeah, I agree. How else will I stay awake until 5am just to talk to you?<br> Rin </br></br>  Haven't seen Asuka for a while.. where did she go?? And Nep Nep..  <br>Future's relative in a dream~. But maybe we can conjure up a big party.... Yes, that sounds great...<br>Let's fight for that, brother~.</br></br>  <br>Well, I'm girly enough, thankyou~ But you're more like a girl than a guy~!<br><br>That's not something I want to try to do...</br></br></br>  <br>Is something wrong with you, kiddo? You seem sad.<br>I offer shoulders to cry on for 5 yen.<br><br><br>You're really bad at this, aren't you? Watch me.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Uh.........<br>F-Five am?????<br>Go to sleeeeep!!</br></br></br>  <br>I have 20.

Fine&lt;3<br> Rin </br></br>  <br>Then how do I act mavho, hmm?</br>  <br> Forgot image </br>  <br>I get that a lot.</br>  <br>But I haven't even been around that long, I am just happy with my girlfriends win</br>  <br>She's adorable.<br>Especially when she gets all flustered and angry!</br></br>  <br>How do you know you don't want to if you've never tried? It's like touching bugs, it seems really bad at first, but they're really harmless.<br>Come on, give it a try.</br></br>  <br>I'm talking about your transform thing you do in battles <br>Its revealing so to say, don't you have a little bit of pride in you?</br></br>  <br>Except the fact that most bugs will fuck your mouth</br>  <br>Talk and act tough infront of others!<br><br>I think it's your perversion that is talking... aren't you a god? That's not very god-like...</br></br></br>  I also now declare personal ship with my OC, there now I can remane without any awkward ships, yay me  <br> Shell be on in a little bit, it's 3:20AM where she is at <br> Southern War Princess </br></br>  <br>I've never watched GoT, but I've lurked some of the go/b/ threads before. They seem interesting.<br> mfw no one can stop the sharia rape train singlehandedly </br></br>  <br>Okay, hit me and I will not cry.</br>  <br>You must have me confused with Ryuko. I tend to never transform. From what I've seen, she does it a lot.</br>  Does anyone else enjoy that feeling in the night where you're almost half-asleep, and your body gets all warm and comfy....  <br>I kinda want the caps from that now, jude you still have em? cus im sure the other thread wen 404</br>  <br>Who are you calling Kiddo,kiddo.</br>  <br>I dont browse /pol/ or /int/ or else I would so reg. Risk more often</br>  <br>I think you're comparing me too much to other Gods.<br>We do pretty much whatever we want, as long as we don't break any real rules.<br>And I can't procreate, nor am I male or female, so I'm not really interested in perverted stuff. Just doing this to get paid.</br></br></br>  <br>Wait.<br>YOU'RE NOT RYUKO!?</br></br>  <br>I'm actually over 1000 years old, I just stopped aging around my 16th year. Gods tend to do that.</br>  NEW THREAD WHEN?!  <br>I am but I go by Matoi. Only close friends or my strangers call me Ryuko.</br>  <br>R E V E N<br>R E V E</br></br>  <br>O...k....<br> hits softly <br><br>Oh, sorry, you looked like a male to me, I just assumed you were. But I think lifting skirts should be made into a rule... you don't want to cause trouble in the human world do you?</br></br></br></br>  Dubs chooses which Anime I watch next  <br> my strangers <br>I meant my close friends and strangers.</br></br>  <br>Huh? <br>...I guess I did. Huh.... <br>Okay, sorry about that.</br></br></br>  <br>Space Dandy dubs</br>  <br>see?...</br>  <br><br>If no one else will I can do a celebratory "My OC won and therefor I win" Gobby Games</br></br>  <br>It's fine.

We can't help being born this way, but there's absolutely nothing wrong with it.<br>When I get kids, I hope they are born furry too. The joy of going to cons and the social aspect in general is great. If not, there's not a lot I can do. It won't prevent me from dressing up at home of course. But, we don't go around 'forcing' our opinion on you, either you're born a furry or you're not. Stop your fucking hate.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Meh, there's nothing wrong with being a brony. The show is really well written and has humour for all ages.<br>It's stupid to post stuff like this so publicly though. Lots of people don't get how great the show is and how awesome the community is. It's unfortunate, but there's too many ignorant dumbasses in the world that judge without even having looked at the show (which everyone should do)</br></br>  <br>Oh wow I was there. Didn't know he got banned though. Deserved it.</br>  <br>thats obvious satire dumbfag</br>    Need advice b. <br>tonight a guy accused me of bumping into his car while parking. (I didn't) <br>I'm 100% positive he and his friend were using drugs in his car at the time. <br>I hear his friend tell about throwing a brick through my window. The driver then tells his friend to get his mag light from the car. At this point I sped off. <br>Legally speaking, am I justified for leaving if I feared for my and my passengers safety? Should I file a police report in case he tries to file one against me? <br>Would a couple tweakers even file a police report after trying some thug shit like that?</br></br></br></br></br>  quit trippin  yep you're screwed pal. they will file a report and your ass is going to prison.  Funny webm...                  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;628738884             <br>This gif made me so happy</br>      <br>lol. cultural revolution. great job mao.</br>      <br>I'm English and don't get it?</br>  <br><br>That's Kevin Rose from TechTV/Digg</br></br>  <br>Lol</br>  <br>The ball was still in play (not foul)</br>  <br><br>i dont get it, what happened?</br></br>  <br>Moot?</br>  <br>fake</br>  <br>Was a fair ball so it was still in play and dude shouldn't have touched it let alone jumped into the field of play to do so. When he realized what he did and that security was coming he tossed it back as if he dindu nuffin.</br>    <br>you're only allowed to take the ball if its a home run and the ball is no longer required to finish the play, however this man picked it up right off the field when the player should have picked it up. so he essentially fucked up the game, kinda like moving a ball in billiards.</br>  <br>i thought the same thing</br>      <br>How the fuck don't you get it?</br>    <br>We don't have baseball here so why would I get it?</br>    <br>Why doesn't that alien clean up her fucking room?
