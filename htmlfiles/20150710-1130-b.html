It could do damage to your GPU.</br>  <br>GPU?<br><br><br>graphics...</br></br></br></br>  <br>quick put water on it to cool it down</br>  <br>Post speccy pic or suck dick.</br>  eventually yeah, you're likely damaging right now. if it's 90c while idling you have a serious cooling problem. your mobo should safely shut down your pc if it goes beyond 99c.<br><br>Fix your shit.</br></br>  <br>Holy shit and I get scared when mine hits the high 70s. I'd unplug everything if mine did this.</br>  <br>it is, but its a laptop and it's kinda old</br>  <br>Graphics Processing Unit you fool.</br>  <br>A laptop should NEVER get that hot. That's just too much. I suppose you have never cleaned your fans, have you?</br>  Take the heatsink and fans off (takes a bit off effort), clean the thermal paste off (rubbing alcohol, lighter fluid or any other strong, non-corrosive solvent will work) and apply new paste.<br><br>90C under heavy load (very demanding games) isn't something to worry about unless you're playing like 8 hours per day almost every day but 90 C idle is really bad.<br><br><br>This will help too. I dusted my PC out and the CPU &amp; GPU temps dropped by 20 C, and new thermal paste dropped it another 10.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm bookmarking on overclocked gpu, I guess i just have to accept that my rig sucks</br>  <br>You know what? No. Just get the FUCK out!</br>  <br>Use compressed air, clean it out, and consider a cooling pad.</br>  <br>it would be extremely painful</br>  My GTX 780 ran at 90c playing only GTA 5. Probably took a couple years off the damn thing  <br>for you</br>  <br>Make sure your keyboard is cleaned as well, much of the heat dissipation is from there.</br>  <br>GTX 675M</br>  Your shit deteriorates way faster after 60 degrees C, so at 90... sheesh  <br>90°C is not enough to really damage the GPU but the cooler the better ofc</br>  <br>I guess I should underclock it. Man, I can't afford a new computer. This sucks.</br>  <br>Is it idle at that temp or does it have a load?</br>  <br/>   90c <br><br>jesus.<br><br>last time i had a gpu temp that high it died very soon afterwards<br><br>This was back when oblivion was new though, so i'd imagine they last longer these days.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Cooling pad dude.</br>  <br>It won't damage it immediately but it will shorten the lifespan. You can expect a decent GPU to last ~4 years (my last one lasted at least that long) but if it's consistently running over 70 C it's not going to last nearly as long.</br>  <br>mine died last week OP GTX470 stock cooler piece of shit<br>sorry to hear bro I know that feel</br></br>  <br>put it in a bucked of cold water, it'll be fine</br>  <br> will it die? <br>Eventually, probably right after the warranty is up. 95F is acceptable but on the high end. Will eventually cause micro-cracks to develop in the solder from constant heating\cooling.</br></br>   tfw work PC has 20 hyperthreaded cores and 64 GB RAM <br> still takes &gt;1 hour to compile AOSP <br>Graphene-based computing when?</br></br>  <br>cooling pad doesn't do shit for some reason.</br>  <br> GPU <br> posts pic of a CPU set on fire <br>Inb4 retarded faggot</br></br></br>  <br>http://m.newegg.com/ProductList?Key<wbr>word=Laptop+cooling+pad</wbr></br>  <br>might have to clean dust or remove heat sink and reapply thermal past between gpu and heatsink. the factory uses cheap shit and it dries out. I personally like Arctic silver 5. It shouldnt go above 75c-80c</br>  <br>Maybe I should open a window</br>  <br>nigga you serious ?</br>  <br><br>Hi Anon. I see you called someone a "faggot" I'm assuming you meant this jokingly, but I've been mulling this over in my head for several days and it does not sit right. Let me please (re)iterate you on this word. Not only does it aim hatred at a large group of people that I myself and many of my friends are a part of, the word has the power to tear down and undermine a fight that we have been fighting for decades. I don't know where you stand on the issue, but I'm assuming you value your rights to equality as a citizen of this country. You may think that this is only a word, a mere configuration of letters, but this word is the foundation that keeps LGBT people held in the depths of inequality, while men like yourself toss around hateful slurs in a joking way thinking immaturely that you are immune to hurting anyone. This is not true. Next time you throw this word out (however jokingly and privately you may thing you are using this- in this era NOTHING is ever private), think about those who have struggled for the right to feel safe in their own country. The word "faggot" creates a hostile environment and makes many LGBT people feel unsafe around those who have enough power in society to use such words. Don't make me feel unsafe. I have a right to my safety. And although I have tremendous pride in being a mature, strong, bisexual woman, it really sucks when your words get in the way of my pride. Thanks for your attention.</br></br>  <br>Probably</br>  <br> cpu mounted on PCI express card <br> manufactured by nvidia <br> cpu </br></br></br>  <br>That's clearly a gpu you fucking retard</br>    Is this happening while playing games or always?  <br> nvidia <br> GPU <br>It's a chipset, retard.</br></br></br>  <br> Visits /b/ <br> expects a non-hostile environment <br> kek <br>srsly doe, the word doesn't even mean that anymore.

I don't know where you stand on the issue, but I'm assuming you value your rights to equality as a citizen of this country. You may think that this is only a word, a mere configuration of letters, but this word is the foundation that keeps LGBT people held in the depths of inequality, while men like yourself toss around hateful slurs in a joking way thinking immaturely that you are immune to hurting anyone. This is not true. Next time you throw this word out (however jokingly and privately you may thing you are using this- in this era NOTHING is ever private), think about those who have struggled for the right to feel safe in their own country. The word "faggot" creates a hostile environment and makes many LGBT people feel unsafe around those who have enough power in society to use such words. Don't make me feel unsafe. I have a right to my safety. And although I have tremendous pride in being a mature, strong, bisexual woman, it really sucks when your words get in the way of my pride.

If you suspect he's shorting you ask him to weigh it out when you buy</br>  <br><br>Hi Anon.

Thanks for your attention.</br></br>  <br><br>You know, I was looking at the edibles available last time I was there. I don't know if it's the new regulations or what, but the limit the amount per serving to 10mg of THC.<br><br>Really, REALLY crappy.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Stop being awkward as fuck. You walk into a dealers place, you have 100% control over the situation, because even though you wont call the cops on him if he fucks you about, hes too paranoid to know that. Youre the boss.</br>  <br>I don't really have a weed dealer, but my hash oil dealer is someone who robbed me 5 years ago for $100 and pretends not to remember</br>  <br>Female dealers are usually some of the worst. They never have deals and sometimes short you but they get away with it cause they've got vaginas</br>  <br> robbed me 5 years ago for $100 <br> pretends not to remember  <br> 5 years ago <br> remember  <br><br>You're telling me you're still in contact with this guy? Holy shit how much of a loser are you?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Uh...no... i mean yeah sure sometimes but some dealers can be shady as fuck because theyre so paranoid theyve got like a gun on the desk a d a huge ass pitbull youre not in control of that situation it depends who youre buying from really</br>  <br>Not a local weed dealer<br>Don't be an ass</br></br>  <br>He wasn't at the college I went to went I first met him, so there was no way for me to even be friends with him prior to. And we both throw in.</br>  <br>But can you just go outside and light up or...</br>  <br><br>Impossible, we trade outside. I'll just get a scale then, they are pretty cheap. But what then, if I'll see its much less than I pay for, how do I, like, tell him or some shit</br></br>  <br>Eh ive heard that a lot she was alright though never shorted me but never gave me the deals also the quality of her stuff was never anything more than average i definetly prefer my bro homie dealers</br>  <br>If you werent a pussy and got a CC or borrowed a friends handgun, you would be fine. I live in Aus, so theres not really any guns involved so the customer is always in charge</br>  <br>It's up to you how you handle that situation. Personally I say avoid the conflict, find another dealer. If he has been shorting you it means he doesn't think much of you</br>  <br>Never go to a dealer who meets up in public spaces, fuck that noise youre just asking to be shorted</br>  <br>It depends dude i live in a crappy city full of nigs who will ape out at you for pointing out that the ounce is 2g short</br>  <br>They are cool I us ally get it from my friends and have a few guys that would deliver that I didn't mind they all usually hooked it up pretty good, and If the rare occasion arises when someone can't come through I can just go to the club or have them deliver so pretty good.</br>  <br>Agreed.<br><br><br>You should just get a new one and he'll be like wut, and you can say you were shorting me</br></br></br></br>  <br>How to deal with nigs:<br>Be more nig than them and chimp x 2, they soon learn u dont fuck wit whitey</br></br>  <br>Dude.....no. Im NOT getting into a fucking LETHAL gunfight with some cracked out nig over some fucking weed. Just no dude thats a shit idea.</br>  <br>Someone triggered the faggot</br>  <br> nigs <br>why are you buy from nig</br></br>  <br>Lags like a mother fucker. <br>The only good weed in this city so i guess i have to wait. <br>I just want to blaze man!</br></br></br>  <br>he's a big black guy who hooks it up. 150 a zip here in Arizona</br>  <br>I think he gets it from a dealer first, and then sells me. So either he is cool and Im just paranoid, or he shortens, or he... gets kudos from his dealers so he's cool with getting it for me... I don't know. Either way, he's gotta have some gains from it, right?</br>  <br>The city i live in is crappy n full of nigs about...70% nig</br>  <br>cartel weed for sure<br><br>thanks for supporting terrorism</br></br></br>    <br>buy weed in suburbs then</br>  <br>He trades dimes for nickles and calls watermelons pickles.</br>  <br><br>i just ask one of my siblings to buy it for me and bring it to me<br>too fucking socially inept to meet a stranger on the street and buy illegal substances from him</br></br></br>  <br>Its not a gunfight if you shoot the prick first. You sound like a pussy, no wonder they rip you off.</br>  <br> too fucking socially inept to meet a stranger on the street <br><br>You're a fucking idiot. That's not how you find a dealer</br></br></br>  <br> weight checking device <br> <br>You probably shouldnt be smoking weed, save whatever brain cells you may have left</br></br></br>  <br><br>Hi Anon.

Maximum damage control</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ok bro, whatever floats your boat.</br>  i have the chillest guy... comes out on his bike to meet u, totally stoned always laughing and sometimes spits a rhyme for you  <br>Do you have friends at all? Go to school? Cause if you're a NEET I understand why you have difficulty understanding how to find a dealer</br>  <br>he black?</br>  <br>What if you're friends are not involved in that sort of stuff?</br>  <br>Go outside, find the sketchiest looking person at the shops, ask him if he knows where to get on. I got my first dealer that way, just be confident and friendly but not wierd, its fucking easy and noone cares if you ask them, chances are if they dont sell it, theyll just think youre a crazy druggo so who cares, win win</br>  <br>My best friend from high school is a huge stoner. <br><br>Any time I want weed we just go to his grandmas place way up in the woods and get stupid, then she cooks us food<br><br>plus he smokes me out all the time</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Man my old dealer was this sketchy fuck that popped pills like candy and always had all these knifes, then he always asked for a ride to the bowling alley</br>  <br>faggot</br>  I feel lucky.

It was more of a pain in the ass to me than the money was worth. Drug users are usually annoying, uneducated and a bore. They'd always want to hang out and smoke like I was their buddy. Some of them I really liked. The dealer knows in the back of their mind that you probably shouldn't be doing drugs, so they feel guilty. You know you shouldn't be doing drugs, so you feel guilty. That guilt builds an awkwardness between both of you and instead of just getting your transaction done and over with you fill the gap with pretending like either of you are decent people by having a useless conversation.
