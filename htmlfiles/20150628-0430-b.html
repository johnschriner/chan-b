Do the same before a cat, and he will eye you with coolly polite and somewhat bored amusement. And just as inferior people prefer the inferior animal which scampers excitedly because someone else wants something, so do superior people respect the superior animal which lives its own life and knows that the puerile stick-throwings of alien bipeds are none of its business and beneath its notice. The dog barks and begs and tumbles to amuse you when you crack the whip. That pleases a meekness-loving peasant who relishes a stimulus to his self importance. The cat, on the other hand, charms you into playing for its benefit when it wishes to be amused; making you rush about the room with a paper on a string when it feels like exercise, but refusing all your attempts to make it play when it is not in the humour. That is personality and individuality and self-respect -- the calm mastery of a being whose life is its own and not yours -- and the superior person recognises and appreciates this because he too is a free soul whose position is assured, and whose only law is his own heritage and aesthetic sense.” <br>― H.P.

I kicked him so hard that he flew into the wall headsfirst. The kid had to get some stitches and whatnot, the owner of that retarded dog came out way too late to stop the stupid fuck from attacking. <br>Basically the next time you say a dog is more useful to humans, remind yourself that cats don't go around attacking people, hurting them or get aggressive towards cars passing by, because they don't need to be trained not to be retarded.</br></br></br></br>  <br> wanting a use for a pet </br>  Was a dog person my whole life, wife got me loving cats, they are chill as fuck and require very little effort.

Even I simply missed them, I can guarantee that the study has no impact on whether or not dogs make for better companions.</br>  <br><br>An owner of a cat is not responsible for the “predatory” habits of the species, only for the known “mischievous tendencies” of the animal. See also the landmark case of Buckle v. Holmes [1926] 2 K.B. 125 from the English Court of Appeals (Civil Division) which held that an owner of a cat is not liable for the damage caused when the cat trespasses.</br></br>  <br>You have no clue just how fucking terrible any and every untrained dog is, do you?</br>  <br>I'd rather a dog shit over my yard then have a cat shred my curtains and lounges.</br>  I prefer cats, I have three of them. <br><br>But I really like dogs a lot too. I'd get a dog, if I didnt live in an apartment in the city.</br></br>  <br>I'm a dog person myself, but I can tell you cats only are smelly when:<br><br>a) People don't let them go out their houses<br>b) They have 3 or more cats, probably dozens (Cats are extremely territorial, and order to keep their territories they must mark it with odor)<br><br>A normal cat will never pee or shit in their own house, and they never smell because they clean themselves</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Dogs love you<br>Cats hate you<br>That the log story short. Now for the explantion<br><br>Cats have higher stress levels when there in biggers family's. You know like mom dad and kids. Thats because they HATE to be petted. Thos has some thing to do woth my next point be now for dogs.<br><br>Dogs love to be petted because you know. There pets. They also love to be in big family's including mom dad kids uncle and cusins and grand parents and so on. The bigger the pack as they see it the more love they give you and fell from others. <br><br>Cats dont run up against you because they love you they do it to release a faramone maeking you like a dog marks a tree. To them you are the pets and you work for them. <br><br>Dogs mark taratory around your house so other dogs out side your "pack" stay away. <br><br> Dog: he feeds me and picks up my poop. He must be my god <br><br> Cat: he geeds me and pick up my poop. I must be his god <br><br>When a intruder invades your house a cat hides but a dog has to be up in his business like are you friend or foe.<br><br>Dogs learn because they are loyal and we can get a under standing of how smart they are. But cata are defiant and do not want to learn so we miss out on how retarded they can be some times.<br><br> Getting stuck up in a tree, locked themselves in rooms, knocking over stuff, falling in the fish tank/toilet, suffacatinf baby's because they want a worm place to sleep, and lets not for get the skitsofrantic mood swing they get that send there owners the vary people that cat, love, feed and shelter them to the hospital. <br><br>Dogs on the other hand have a history. There useful and loving. The japanese akita waited for his master at the train tracks for years forbhis dead master to pick him up until he died of old age.<br><br>Dogs even wolves will make new friends and remember them years after they see echother.<br><br>You want to see some thing fun? Tie 2 cats tails together and throw them over a telephone pole and watch how they work together to get free lol</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> An owner of a DOG is not responsible for the “predatory” habits of the species <br>So ifmy dog kills a cat, then he shouldn't be put to sleep</br></br>  <br> I am literally a fag person </br>  <br>that whole post</br>  <br>And EVERY fucking dog owner with a greasy-ass dog doesn't smell like a fucking dog dick,ass and piss factory.</br>  <br>You know cats have a parasite in there poo that gose into your brain to make you love the way they look sound feel and smell alowing you to put up with there shit right?</br>  <br> "He's completely right" <br> "I just got btfo" <br> "How can I get back at him?" <br> "I know, I'll make ridiculous statements with no basis! That'll show him!" </br></br></br></br>  <br>i love brainless people on /b/</br>  <br>No, that law does not apply to dogs, because they can and should be trained.<br><br>Plus, your faggot dog would get his ass handed to him by any self-respecting razor clawed feline.</br></br></br>    <br> cats hate to be petted <br>I have a cat sitting on my lap right now that is purring and nudges me when I stop petting it for too long. Apparently my cat is a masochist.</br></br>  <br>cat urine reeks man, I say this as man who cleans carpets. Cat piss is literally the worse smell I encounter in my job. that and cat owners should not let thier cat's outside becuase of thier vicious killing nature</br>  That feel when I got a woman , no fucking cat or dog or marmot -rat species in my home. got a wonderful little girl who loves me and her mom. I'm all for having a pet if you want one, but honestly that shit is a pain in the ass and should be avoided if you don't have the time for it.  <br>shit man, kids are 10x worse than either a cat or dog. You should put that little cunt down.</br>  <br>champion names are retarded.</br>  <br>You have NO idea what you talking about. Just because its chemical composition cat piss is extremely odorful and penetrating. <br><br>BTW cat piss used to be use to make parfums just because their properties to stick to the skin.</br></br></br>  Sleep tizight puppers  Cats love to be pet, whoever said they dont is an idiot.<br><br>All three of my cats love being pet. They are vocal, very friendly. They never hiss, scratch or bite humans (one of them has hissed at the vet but that is because of stress). They love to play, one can play fetch with beer bottle caps.</br></br>  <br>but what about the LITERALLY part</br>  <br> taratory  <br><br>Is that even a because then English wanted I know also spelling.</br></br></br>  <br>So are cats like niggers that need to be protetcted and they are retarded and dogs like white and smart people that can learn things?</br>  <br> cats HATE to be petted </br>  <br>And you have had experience raising kids? It can be difficult at times, yes. but honestly it is way more worth it knowing she will likely out live me unlike a pet or slave.</br>  <br> Cat piss is literally the worse smell I encounter in my job. <br>I never said it wasn't, I just said a normal cat would go out and pee and shit in the outside, and thus their owners are not smelly</br></br>  <br>Dog: "I MARK TARATORY!"<br>Cat: "Lol u so dum"</br></br>  I'm a dog person because I'm looking for companionship, not a mutual agreement  <br>no dogs are like niggers because they can be trained but if you don't train them they run around and be loud and do stupid shit.</br>  <br>most owners just don't let their cat out because indoor cats live longer way longer.<br><br>cats are like ninjas put a bell in their neck it only makes them a more perfect stalking and killing machine.</br></br></br>    <br>If you're at cat person, you're probably also a stay in your mother's basement, seeking for the slightest bit of affection person.</br>  Rawr  <br> A dog is only as good as their owner <br> even a halfway decent owner can raise a damn good dog. <br> a halfway decent dog is a damn good dog <br>Sorry, but no. A dog has to be 100% well-trained to be a halfway decent animal. Even a 50% trained dog is a fucking monster. Those are the dogs that rip the faces off babies.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>PROOF</br></br>  <br>cats cuz they are more usefull then I am<br>I can learn much from those fuckers</br></br>  <br>I don't know what kind of dogs you've come in contact with, but I've never heard of that shit.</br>  Grew up with cats, love them, but I think both just have very distinct personality profiles. I don't think I'd like to own a dog because I'm not used to it and they require a little too much energy for me, but they're great and likable animals. Also, cat owners know cats are dicks. It's kind of part of the fun, and yet they can also grow to really like you and be friendly, which feels like a huge victory considering their default setting is fuck you.  <br>only dog that is a 100% trained is the guide dog for blind people.<br><br>every other "trained" dog i met turned out to be a cunt.</br></br></br>  <br>cats be like<br> fuck you, and fuck everything that moves </br></br>  <br> Sorry, but no. A dog has to be 100% well-trained to be a halfway decent animal. Even a 50% trained dog is a fucking monster. Those are the dogs that rip the faces off babies. <br>You are a moron, I live in a 3rd worl country where 99.9999999% of dogs are not trained and you see dogs literally every corner, yet you don't see news of dogs bitting or killing babies.<br><br>I'd say it is worse for a dog to have a bad owner, than to be alone and not trained.</br></br></br></br>  i own 4 cats that hang around in a park that is dead in front of my house.<br><br>I hang out in that park and all four of them hang out with me.<br><br>They even follow me around on walks.<br><br>Nobody messes with me because I have a cat posse.<br><br> I'm a cat person because I like the fact that my cats won't die if I leave then alone for a day. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> thinking a cat's subtle ways showing showing affection = subtle human emotions <br> thinking the gap in their intelligence is so large that cats can't have emotions <br>Not my fault if you're too retarded for common sense and basic perception.</br></br></br>  <br>How's India my pundai friend?</br>  <br>basically</br>  <br> reading "NYC" as en-wy-see <br> not just reading it as New York City <br>Holy shit, people actually do this?</br></br></br>  cat people are snobs  <br> Thats because they HATE to be petted. <br><br>Holy shit how can you be this stupid.</br></br></br>  <br>when we had 2 dogs and 3 cats whenever i took the dogs for a walk the cats followed us and walked with us.<br><br>any dog that tried to mess with the cats would meet the dogs in bloody-eyed murder-mode.</br></br></br>  <br> when I call my cat an asshole, she just looks at me like, right back at you fuck face. <br>Fuck yeah, cats don't take shit from anyone.</br></br>  <br> Affectionate <br>Yes, I have a feline that literally follows me around more than any of my dogs have. She sits on my lap while I play video games, follows me outside and watches me water, sit in the bathroom while I shower etc.<br><br> Smart, wise <br>Im sorry, my last dog ate its own shit constantly and one of my current felines taught itself to use the toilet. It doesnt flush mind you but thats 100x smarter than the dog I had.<br><br>Fuck you, you've probably never even owned a feline.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not India, try your backyard (If you are american)</br>  dont fuck with cats<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=jBq<wbr>KthehPec</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br> asserting that being having something depend on you completely makes them your friend <br> still not picking up on the fact that he's just to dumb to perceive a cat's friendship </br></br>  <br> fat neckbeard took on the tyranical German Shepard like a warrior straight out of lotr <br> lying to me <br><br>How dare you.</br></br></br></br>  <br>My cat(s) literally follow me around and rub their face on me wherever I go. Cat's can be extremely affectionate, I don't get why there are people who believe the stereotype that cats only look down on people.</br>  cats fucking suck  <br> I've been in one or two people's apartments where they didn't let their cat outdoors, used cheap litter, and didn't clean the box <br> I'm completely ignoring that every dog ever reeks to high hell after a minute of activity and/or getting slightly wet </br></br>  <br>God I hope you die of the worst cancer possible.</br>  <br>Dog all the way</br>  <br> Cat owners are anime faggots  <br><br>Holy shit, I don't even have to do anything. <br>You're invalidating yourself. Just through sheer force of faggoty</br></br></br></br>  Dog, of course<br><br>Also, the original</br></br>  If your idea of a pet is someone who ignores u wants to leave but is too lazy to get its own food why not just try a bed ridden tard. <br><br>Dogs become part of the family. Cats after a year u hope just run away</br></br>  <br>the thing is both dogs and cats are selfish cunts that enjoy attention and will do anything to get this attention. cats are just more inclined to enjoy quiet time by themselves. and dogs can go into 'sleep mode' and become inactive when nobody pays attention to them (this is actually the greatest difference between dogs and wolves and why we don't keep wolves as pets they are insufferably hyperactive cunts) they both pretty much use and order humans around to do their bidding but dogs have a more humbly looking approach than cats, but they still demand food petting and attention same as cats. they are all like "yes thank you master thank you for looking at me oh mighty" and cats are like "nice of you peasant that you finally recognize my need" but that's all the difference there is.</br>  <br>cats can suck my fat hairy dick</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>i have a lab<br><br>http://original.livestream.com/theb<wbr>igshow20<br>lost my job but so streaming goodfellas and talking shit<br><br>donate a buck to happysadidk@gmail.c</br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Did you know their heads and tummies glow under UV?</br>  <br>Don't do it, it makes mustard gas.</br>  <br>Because they are retards who have never owned a feline and shouldnt be allowed to.<br><br>They all flock to other dog owners and spew the same generic garbage. The funny thing is I own several dogs and cats, and my personal opinion is cats are far better pets. <br><br> Because many animal bites are never reported, determining the exact incidence of bite wounds in the United States, let alone the world, is difficult.  <br> In 2012, there were approximately 70 million pet dogs and 74 million pet cats in the US.[1] Recent reports estimate 4.5 million dog bites per year[2] and in 2008 this resulted in approximately 316,000 emergency department (ED) visits. <br> [3] Substantially more dog bites occur than cat bites. These two species account for the majority of (non-human) mammalian bite wounds encountered in the ED. <br><br>Yes tell me how much better dogs are for family pets than cats.<br><br> More pet felines than dogs, more dog attacks than cat attacks. <br><br>Whoa, I just noticed dogs are like niggers. Even though they make up the smaller portion they still cause more problems. Congrats owners, why not just go adopt a nigger.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   4030 divided by two <br> not liking both </br>  <br> can smell cancer in humans" <br><br>lol .... no. Because it doesnt make any sense. Cancer is made out of YOUR OWN TISSUE.</br></br></br>  <br> If you neglect a dog they'll make your life miserable. <br>So they're not good companions. A companion doesn't inconvenience you and demand your attention for the entire duration of it's life.<br>Also, "neglect" is a funny word to describe disregard for<br> always having to feed it at specific times <br> having to walk it multiple times a day if you don't have a yard <br> having to clean up its shit every day regardless of whether or not you have a yard <br> having to keep it on a leash in public because it can't be trusted <br> having to keep it inside, tied to something, or in a fence because it can't be trusted <br> having to spend hours of time and effort (and often money) for months just to keep it from being a terrible creature <br> etc. <br>There's just no getting around the fact that they can be useful tools, but they're shitty pets.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>lol i came to the same conclusion just a different path, now we know dogs are a minority and cause more harm than cats. An they are also trainable like niggers.<br><br> Dogs confirmed nigger pet. </br></br></br>  <br>  can be trained to crap in a box <br><br>trained? no, that's instinct, you stupid retard. they know how to do this when tiny little kittens. dogs, however, are stupid and need to be continually told where to go to relieve itself.<br><br>you<br>DENSE<br>C U N T</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> dogs can also just be let outside to shit and piss.  <br>lol.

Basically it's "Stop liking what I don't like". I'm not gay, liveral, or an sjw but who really cares about something so trivial?  <br>Liberal*</br>  It's because this place is the only place where sexual frustrated in the closet homophobes can post their hatred bullshit and find others of the same mind set.  Because if everyone gay-married, there would be no procreation, and we would die out as a species.<br><br>A lifelong relationship with a member of the opposite sex is difficult.

Basically homosexuality is only ok when they do it.</br></br>  More amateur lesbians!  <br>No, just no.<br><br>Homosexuality is an ancient trait, not a latent one. It springs from primate hareems where one male would sexually control the majority of females, leaving the majority of male primates with no mating options. It was literally last resort to fulfill a biological need. As we evolved so did the behaviour, it was literally only outlawed for a brief period of human history.<br><br>There are also aspects of control and dominance over others.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Read the filename. :)</br></br>  <br>Where did you get this image. Some "girl" on whisper gave it to me saying it was her gf like 6 months ago. I posted my real dick to her with my face. I'm not afraid it was bogus</br>  People don't understand that gays marriage doesn't effect them at all unless they're gay themselfs. It's all opinions and personal feeling. There's no legitimate argument against it.  <br> my real dick </br>  <br><br>God damn, I loved this post. Can I have it?</br></br>  <br>No, just no.<br><br>Homosexuality is observed in hundreds of species. It was not developed in the past 4-5 million years in primates alone.</br></br></br>  <br>I support lesbian just cuz pussy</br>  <br><br>Because fags can't make babies and lower the rest of the normal humans to their disgusting perverted ways. Many reasons. Stop being a faggot liberal fag..</br></br>  <br>yes but you must agree that most people are not 100% or 100% gay people suppressed it for during those periods</br>  because first it's gays, then it's polygamy, then bestiality and pedofelia. you watch, in the next 50 years there will be dog fucker pride parades  <br>I'm mostly just concerned because it's been major fap material. Curious to know if this is like a widely circulated photo everybody uses or something instead of what I thought was private It took me weeks to pry this out of her. Weird to talk to a fake chick for weeks</br>  <br> Because fags can't make babies  <br>And this is a bad thing why? There's already tons of hero couples making babies.<br> lower the rest of the normal humans to their disgusting perverted ways. <br>See now you're just being delusional. You're just letting you're feelings get in the way. Also nice ad hominem</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice illogical fallacy try again</br>  <br> illogical fallacy </br>  <br>those nerds just love that punk jesus too much to let a girl eat some pussy</br>  <br>You're absolutely right. Before gays the interracial thing was unheard of. Now you see a nigger and a white person together and its basically just another couple. You ask a gay supporter why they agree with fags getting married but not with someone being able to marry their dog. "Because that's wrong!" Well I'd be willing to bet other people think two of the same sex getting married is wrong but somehow your opinion is above theirs. Fucking liberals.</br>  <br>Like apples to oranges. Gay marriage is still 2 humans marrying. Interspecies marrying is different and shouldn't be allowed</br>  <br>its all yours, my friend</br>  <br><br>see this<br/></br></br>  A marriage is a legal contract. Plain and simple. If any party is not a human the contract isn't legal. That's why all those people worrying about people marrying animals are stupid  <br>This is the most solid fucking argument and shut libfucks down everytime. Like, ok yeah why don't we just make MURDER legal, right? God wrote the Bible and it says sodomy is a sin, the Bible governs the law of man, if America doesn't want to open a gateway to hell we need to fire the scotus immediately!</br>  Seperation of church and state. if churches don't want to marry faggots they shouldn't be forced to. same way we dont force faggots into camps to be made straight.  <br> he didn't read the law <br><br>You fucking idiot. Churches are not being forced to do anything. The state is being forced to recognize gay marriage. The word church is no where in the bill.<br><br>Wait are you pretending? 10/10</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You are stupid. No church is being forced to marry dudes. This is purely a legal status</br>  <br>More like the most retarded argument. 2 guys marrying doesn't equate to marrying animals. ,</br>  <br>two dudes can consent to marrying<br>a dog can't</br></br>  <br><br>Mark my words, they will be. the tax exempt status that almost every church takes means they will have to marry gays or be shut down.</br></br>  <br>So why is it ok for two humans to marry but not a human and an animal? You can't define love. Me and my dog love each other. Equal rights!! Oh and ok, human dog not ok, what about a man and a child? I want to marry a 7 year old and she's convinced she wants to marry me. That's two humans why is that not ok?</br>  If being gay is right then how come only 5% of the population is homosexual. Oh that's right, because it's an abnormality and the stupid American government is only making it seem completely normal.  <br>yeah i can just see the dog refusing</br>  <br><br>I have nothing against civil unions, but they shouldn't force temples, churches, mosques to tamper with their faith to cater to homosexuals.<br><br>Marry as much as you want, just keep it out of the holy sites that doesn't wish it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because liberals are hypocritical, contradicting and just plain stupid.</br>  HOLY SHIT I KNOW THOSE TWO GIRLS  <br>The dog doesn't even understand the concept of marriage so why does it matter?</br>  <br>Actually in reality there is no right or wrong. We can do whatever we want. We have free-will. I have married my Chevy Impala recently after our 5 year. So if you want to marry a child go ahead! Muslims do it all the time. There is no god that will send you to hell for it. You won't be smited down. You are just confining within the boundaries of the norms of our society.</br>    Does the Supreme Court mean that all US states now have to allow people to get married in their states, or only that they have to recognize gay marriages made in other states?    <br>... so you're just making it up? Nice argument.<br><br>Good fucking god, another one. No one is making the churches do anything. Educate yourself.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Because there's no way for an animal to communicate if they want to be in the marriage with you. The child doesn't have an understanding of marriage and most things in life. They're not developed and knowledgeable enough to agree to marriage.</br></br>    <br>Ok then. That's the answer in looking for. But not all liberals agree. They think it's ok for two faggots to get married, but if it goes any further then That's immoral.</br>  <br> tax exempt status <br>thats the problem, why the fuck shouldnt churches pay tax like everyone else?</br></br>  <br><br> No one is making the churches do anything. Educate yourself. <br><br>You are gonna feel dumb as fuck as soon as it happens.<br><br> surly the gay movement will stop now and wont continue to push their shit further :^) </br></br></br></br></br></br>  Next ill be able to marry 10 year olds, hey maybe i'll even marry my fucking couch, i mean if goverment will recognize any fucking marriage why not? fucking nigger president letting these sjw faggots fag up my country  <br><br>That has the UK all over it</br></br>      <br>Congrats on being stupid. Keep calling me a liberal if it makes you feel better<br><br> he doesn't hate gay marriage so he must be a liberal Hurr durr </br></br></br>  <br>this idea has been refuted several times already ITT. two men can consent to marry each other as responsible adults. kids/dogs/inanimate objects can't</br>  <br>Its already been done to schools, they take loans from the government on the terms that common core be used. You can believe what you want, but remember me when it happens bb.</br>  <br>What the fuck is wrong with you? I think it's ok for two consenting adults to get married. That's it. Why are you so scared of a mass acceptance of pedophilia and bestiality? It's totally nonsensical.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Yeah and hetero couples don't do that shit at all</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>A faggot is not sexually attracted to the opposite sex! They are unnaturally attracted to the same sex, meaning there is something mentally wrong with them! It is an abnormal trait that equal to an anorexic person thinking they are overweight. But you think they have the mental capacity To consent or choose to get married? I disagree but if they are allowed to get married then I think any form of marriage should be allowed not just a larger demographic.</br></br>  Does the Supreme Court decision mean that all US states now have to allow people to get married in their states, or only that they have to recognize gay marriages made in other states?  <br>You should feel dumb as fuck right now.</br>  <br>Oh man I guess I'll have to break it to you. There's 'mentally handicap' gays who are smarter than you. In fact most probally are because you sound stupid as hell<br> he can't accept the fact that gays are smarter than him </br></br>  <br><br>all states have to allow gay people to get married and fully recognize all same sex marriages.</br></br>  <br>Hey faggot sorry to break it to you, but there are pedophiles and children smarter than you. In fact there are dogs smarter than you.</br>  <br>Well whether or not the churches should pay taxes or not is opinion, but greedy priests take the tax exempt status 501c3 so more people will donate. Thats why you see so many rich priests in nice houses driving nice cars when they preach about said things being sinful. But there are some churches who choose to pay taxes and not get as many donations so the government has no hold over them.</br>  <br>their molestation of children isnt ignored on the account of it being "homophobic"</br>  <br> says the person who thinks all gays are mentally handicap <br>yhandicap you just can't accept that other people's opinions and ideas differ from you're own.</br></br>  <br>Fucking LOL. Yeah, that's because there's no separation of state and publically funded schools that are literally designed to do what the DOE says. Holy fuck, dude. The Federal government doesn't make private schools do anything.</br>  <br>You don't even have an argument except telling me there's smart gays? I never said there werent. I said there's no way someone with a mental disorder like homosexuality is more capable of consenting than a straight child or a dog that doesn't understand the concept of marriage. Give me an argument otherwise you already lost and are resorting to insults because you have nothing else.</br>  <br> you just can't accept that other people opinions are different than your own <br>Can you?</br></br>  <br>Go to Reddit you'll find alot more over there bro</br>  <br>Yeah I can and that's why I don't care if gays are allowed to get married. I'm bit gay but I can accept the fact that they can get married.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br> implying heterosexual couples don't do this <br> implying heterosexual couples don't have higher rates of child abuse than homosexual couples <br><br>If this is bait, then I definitely took it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Your whole argument is broken because gays can consent you're just delusional in thinking they cant</br>  Maybe gay marriage will put an end to HIV running amok in gay communities.  <br>Paedophilia and rape are also ancient, can I rape your dad when he was 12</br>  <br><br> hurr durr stop liking what I dont like  <br> who really cares about something so trivial?  <br><br>This is the dumbest argument ever, you could say it about literally everything. <br><br>Next is pedos, and then after that is fucking corpses, every faggot marriage argument also suits them and dog fuckers too.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You put peanut butter on it and a dog will love that shit. And that is true love and who are you to refuse true love.<br>Here boy</br></br>    <br>why do you always feel the need to look at what the phone is looking at.. you already know what the photo is gonna be so don't look at the phone.</br>  <br><br>Oy vey the goyim know</br></br>  <br>Did you even read the thread? We already talked about those arguments and they got btfo. Stay mad</br>  <br><br> implying heterosexual couples don't have higher rates of child abuse than homosexual couples <br><br>Prove it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> anti gay marriage faggots think that's a valid argument </br>  <br><br>Not everyone is gay you fucking idiot</br></br>  <br>So you're biased first and foremost. I'm straight and I don't care if gays get married because I can't think of any immediate way it affects me. I just think they're mentally handicapped. why do gays want to get married? It's an institution designed by religion where gays are not even accepted. HOLY matrimony? Being gay is a physical or mental anomaly meaning it is related to science not religion. Why do they want to be able to marry?</br>  <br><br> Minorities would never want more influence un-proportional to their size, trust me :^) </br></br>  <br>I'm delusional because I think a grown man who lacks attraction for the sex he is supposed to be attracted to is capable of consent but a child isn't? Expand on that. I think my argument is rationally justified.</br>  <br>Marriage is a lot broader than religion. Nice try though</br>  <br> I think my argument is rationally justified. <br>And that's why you're a fucking retard</br></br>  <br>I'm with you op, I just didn't care enough to make a thread stating it</br>  <br>Those arguments are still being debated.</br>  <br><br> Homosexuality is observed in hundreds of species <br><br>so is RAPE and PEDOPHILIA</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> When in doubt, just ad-hominem the opposition :^) </br></br>  <br><br> If something occurs in nature, it's totally fine for us to do it <br> Appealing to nature :^) </br></br></br>  <br><br>I see you're projecting, degenerate.</br></br>  <br>And you lack an actual basis with which to combat my argument. That's why you're a fucking retard.</br>  <br><br> In my opinion, I was right, so the others got BTFO. I'm enlightened :^) </br></br>  It's a problem with our species, if everyone was gay humans would go extinct. Maybe it's part of evolution or population control, dont know. Nothing we can really do about it I guess.  To those saying it slows procreation, you're fucking retarded. People will be gay whether gay marriage is legal or not.  <br>Meh, whats wrong with pedos?<br><br>also, if you want to fuck a corpse, thats your business surely. It's a decomposing lump of fleshy meat. It can't consent to marriage because it is an inanimate object so I don't see how people wanting to marrying one would even be an issue. It's like saying, 'hi I want to marry this decomposing lump of steak.' 'Well sir, you cant. It cannot consent to marriage becasue it has no capacity of thought or speech and neither is it alive. Also, please don't fuck it, you might get maggots on your dick'<br><br>Marrying animals is trickier but fair enough, you and your jack russell love each other very much and you demand that you can get married. Do you want to be known in your neighbourhood as the guy who married that dog? Do you? No you don't Unless everyone is marrying their dogs because thats ok in the area where you live. Fine, then noone is batting an eyelid. It's the cultural norm.<br><br>So.... people in your street are now marrying their kids, their dogs and their dead mothers. What does this mean? More single normal women out there looking for heterosexual relationships for you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> marriage is a religious institution <br><br>Read a fucking book you nigger</br></br></br>  <br> Not everyone is gay <br> Posts this on 4chan <br>Come on anon. everyones a little gay.</br></br></br>  <br><br> I have to convince myself that everyone is a bit gay because I'm insecure and unsure what sexual orientation I have, even though I deep down know that I'm bisexual but can't fully admit it :^) </br></br>  COUNTING UP THE ARGUMENTS ITT<br><br><br><br> 1. if everyone gay-married, there would be no procreation, and we would die out as a species (or: gay marriage leads to underpopulation) <br> 2. everyone has a responsibility to be a parent. being gay is shirking that responsibility (in favor of sexual gratification) <br><br><br><br> 3. churches should not be forced to do something against their religion, which performing gay marriages is. <br><br><br> 4. being gay is wrong because it's an abnormality; only 5% of the population is gay <br><br><br> 5. marriage is only for child-producing couples <br> 6. homosexuality (or gay marriage) lowers the rest of humanity to the disgusting perverted ways of homosexuals <br><br><br><br><br> 7. allowing gay marriage is a slippery slope to allowing polygamy, bestiality, pedophilia, people marrying/fucking anything they please etc. because there's no principled way to prohibit these things but allow gay marriage <br> 8. the rise of homosexuality led to race mixing <br><br><br> 9. God wrote the Bible and it says sodomy is a sin, the Bible governs the law of man <br><br><br><br><br> 10. gay couples who adopt will sexually abuse their adopted children <br><br><br> 11. gays commit suicide <br><br><br> 12. homosexuality is a mental disorder since attraction to the opposite sex is unnatural <br> 13. argument from analogy: being attracted to the same sex is like being anorexic and thinking you're overweight <br><br><br> 14. since homosexuality is a mental illness, homosexuals can't consent to marriage <br><br><br> 15. gay marriage is an example of minorities wanting influence disproportional to their size </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What's wrong with pedos? Besides the obvious mental scarring towards a child, it's not necessary since an underdeveloped child cannot become pregnant, it's not natural and it's a problem. If everyone was a pedo then humans would go extinct, same with gays.</br>  <br>kids who have sex are mentally scarred because of the societal guilt placed upon them.<br><br>no guilt no mental scarring</br></br></br>  The biggest problem to me is that while the SCOTUS the the President and all of America is worrying about legalizing gay diddling and Caitlyn Jenner and such, ISIS is controlling large chunks of the middle east and chopping off heads.<br><br>At some point that shit may come knocking on America's front door and a large chunk of the population may be so sick of all the tolerance and bullshit and welcome them with open arms.</br></br>  <br>Yeah most of those arguments are stupid epically the slippery slope fallacy</br>  Let gay people marry and do whatever they want.. more bitches for me  <br>Who cares about sand niggers in the middle east killing eachother? In fact who cares about gay marriage? We shouldn't care about either</br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br>Its a mating tactic, usually fir betas. It is natural, but socially unacceptable. That is a fact like it or not, doesnt make it less true.<br><br>Its basically getting them while they are young and easier to manipulate. Again, its an ancient practice, but that doesnt mean its well past time to evolve past the practice.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah most of the opposite arguments are equally stupid. Especially the ones saying that gays should be allowed to get married.<br> see how I don't add anything to back up my opinion? It means I'm automatically right. </br></br>  <br><br> In my opinion the opposition is stupid, so I can feel smarter with my opinion :^) </br></br>  <br>pfft ha good one faggot good one</br>  <br> His rebuttal "that's retarded" <br>So begins the name calling when they have no real argument.</br></br>  <br><br>+1 good work</br></br>  <br>It's actually an interesting problem for conservatives. Religious conservatives will freak out about biblical implications, but the idea of smaller government control and a less intrusive government is fundamental to many republican platforms. I personally agree with OP. I liken it to my neighbors keeping chickens. Their chickens haven't degraded my property value so in have no interest in seeking to have an ordinance against them</br>  <br>Pretty much, the easier to manipulate the more betas feast on the opportunity, still doesn't explain the attraction to children though.</br>  <br>Because you're arguments make so much more sense</br>  <br>So pedos and gays aren't unnatural and should both be equally accepted. Thank you!</br>  I don't care about gay marriage and would have nothing against it, but then I imagine how happy the libtards and feminists must be now and think that they are winners and some kind of revolutionaries<br>makes me want to vomit</br>  <br><br>Oh, I can't. But that's exactly the problem. You can't prove that homosexual couples do either.</br></br>  <br> OH NO STOP UR GIVING ME TEH GAY </br>  COUNTING UP THE ARGUMENTS (cont.)<br><br><br> 16. marriage is a religious institution. religion is against homosexuality. (compare 3.) <br><br><br> 17. focusing on issues like gay marriage will make our society sick of its obsession with tolerance and thus more likely to embrace the coming ISIS invasion <br><br><br> 18. (implied?) homosexuality is tied to pedophilia. (compare 10.) </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Abuse can interfere with development. To cope with overwhelming experiences of distress, the brain can alter patterns of signaling from the pathways involved, which can ultimately leave those regions underdeveloped from reduced input. The brain of a child who is raped, for example, may react by reducing the connectivity of the regions that were hurt. You can have science or you can have an opinion, can't have both. Quit trying to justify mental illness.</br>  <br><br> You can't prove that homosexual couples do either. <br><br>I never claimed anything like that, you fucking idiot. You are the one spouting dumb shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Who cares about ISIS? Stopping buttsex is way more important!</br>  <br><br> Still believing that one dubious report that claimed this, when it was disproved a long-time ago <br><br>Pedos, not even once.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Because fags can't make babies <br><br>so, if a heterosexual couple can't make babies they shouldn't be allowed to marry? ( or be required to get a divorce if they are already married)?</br></br></br>  <br> assumption, the post <br>I'm rather confident that I am bisexual anon. Who the fuck second guesses themself like that?</br></br>  <br>MFW that was my first post and I have made no arguments.</br>  <br> with our species <br> implying other gay animals don't exist </br></br>  <br><br> Implying that "everyone is a bit gay" isn't assumption the post - 2015 :^) </br></br>  <br>implying i care more about my species than other animals</br>  <br><br> Implying that's not a small minority of animals out of millions :^) </br></br>  <br>If you've ever had a single gay thought, ever, you are a bit gay. That is far less assuming than<br> lol just because anon says that everyones a little gay means he's in deiail over his own sexuality </br></br>  <br>Well gee you sure showed me with all those sources and statistics</br>  <br> Implying it isn't a genetic or neurological defect in species to stop it from reproducing. <br> our retards can't reproduce, our fags can't either because of the lack of wanting or desire. </br></br>  isn't marriage a religious thing? why would you want to do a religious thing in an anti-religious way?  <br>this</br>  <br>I am not condoning rape of a child.<br><br>One could enter into a loving relationship and then just wait until the child is physically and mentally prepared for penetrative sexual intercourse</br></br></br>  <br>also this</br>  <br><br> Implying I've had gay thoughts, implying you're not grasping at straws, implying you can be gay just by thinking about something <br><br>Your post is just a huge fallacy, good try though :^)</br></br></br></br>  <br> implying it's not a combination of genes which when activated in the right gender can increase reproduction rate <br>Do you even epigenetics?</br></br>  <br><br> haven't even proved his own proof about how often it occurs, and how "widespread it is" :^) </br></br>  <br>People who go for "loving relationships" with children most likely have a mental illness. What could you possibly relate to with a child? What similar interests could you have? How could you have a conversation about anything in your adult life and expect a child to comprehend a word you are saying? If you actually believe this you should seek a therapist.</br>  <br>I sincerely doubt you have never had a gay thought anon. You post on 4chan after all. It's hardly grasping at straws,</br>  <br>Apparently it's not but they've yet to explain why it isn't.</br>  The complainers simply can go to &gt;&gt;/pol/ tbh.  <br>Or inclusive fitness, more generally.</br>  <br><br>Fucking stupid Mormon</br></br>  <br><br>Then why bother with all the "gay couples sexually abusing, etc" images if you weren't implying something.<br><br> oh wait, people actually choose to spend their free time here getting mad <br><br>Nevermind, carry on.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What are you even talking about? Are gay people a majority? Anywhere? Do you honestly believe that it would become a majority in the future? Wtf.</br>  <br><br> I sincerely doubt you have never had a gay thought anon <br><br>Another assumption, you're a master at this.<br><br> You post on 4chan after all <br><br>Because 4chan is clearly affiliated with homosexuality, right :^)<br><br> It's hardly grasping at straws <br><br>It literally is, bisexual anon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>well, I get on with kids fine. We tend to talk about all sorts of stuff relevant to their lives. Of course I am not interested in having sex with a kid cos it's pretty difficult to do so without hurting them but I would worry more about someone unable to relate to a child than one who could</br>  <br><br>I didn't even post the pictures, I just called you out about how fucking stupid that statement was.<br><br>Reminder that you couldn't even prove your bullshit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>he is a dumbass dont ask his such hard questions</br>  <br> Because 4chan is clearly affiliated with homosexuality <br>Yes, yes it is.<br><br> Another assumption <br>Doubt is an assumption?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> People actually spend their free time here, defending homosexuality because they can't deal with people having a different opinion  <br><br>You're the stupid one here anon :^)</br></br></br></br>  states right vs federal over reach  <br>this argument comes down to what you mean by the word 'child'. 3 yr olds?
