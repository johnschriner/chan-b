Our clauses in this agreement usually end up with us owning their resources and us getting rich. You think we did anything other any establish military bases in strategic points and grab all the oilfields we could during the iraqi war? You think we called it quits but kept our fucking soldiers on the ground years later for shits and giggles? Everything we fight either ends up paying us to make it stop or we cripple them for life and make them pay us to help them around.</br>  <br>And one hell of a statesman.

But it's up to you to decide what's "French" and what not. <br><br> Also, I think the culture is no only changed by changes in demography but also by other media <br>Yes, but according to my understanding of "culture", no TV or school can turn a middle Eastern population into "France".

But I still feel friendship and pride whenever an amerifat gives us a pat on the back.<br><br>You got niggers, we got mudslimes. Meh, we'll overcome it anyway.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Long live the land of the free! Even though we're unfortunately your vassal...</br>  <br>First point: yeah ok my statement is probably a bit candid. But take for example the illustrator Riad Sattouf who just published the second volume of his biography. He has assimilated both cultures ( arabic and french ) and has done a pretty good job out of it imo.<br><br>Second point: if I consider culture as the common background of experience and knowledge, then yes, watching the same TV shows as little americans kinda makes you an american if you spend enough time doing it. Same as learning to speak/write french or getting bored af reading Diderot during high school.<br><br>3rd point: I'm no expert in ancient history but that probably took more than a few decades, also those are a bit outdated examples.<br><br>But still, thanks for not calling me a nigger right away.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    has the best toast and potato styles  <br><br>The feeling is mutual, for me anyway.<br><br>If it wasn't for France we probably would have lost the war against England.<br><br>Plus french food is amazing and, along with italy, has had a huge impact on american restaurants. <br><br>You guys make cool cars too, but unfortunately we don't get any of them in the US.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't totally disagree with you. But I feel like people like Riad Sattouf (i dont know him tbh) are more the exceptions than the rule. I agree that it would be a fruitful thing if cultures were to blend and take the best from one another, but I'm afraid in most cases and for most people this doesn't happen. And yes, I'm against Americanization too. Giving up our cultures in Europe makes it even less likely that immigrants will assimilate. <br><br>Yes, Rome did not go down in 3 decades, but that was before globalisation, global population explosion etc. It is likely that France (and other European countries) will have a majority-non European descent population by 2100 and I doubt whether the result will ressemble today's France, and I also doubt whether the "new French" will want to have anything to do with you. Look to Niger or Yemen; 7 children per women and birthrates are still not falling, this is our future.<br><br>Salutation de l'allemagne, je veux seulement que votre pais reste ce qu'il est...</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Lets in Muslims<br>French philosophers are shit<br>Full of Negroids<br>Only made two good movies, Amelie and City of Lost Children, the rest are shit.<br>French Revolution is shit.<br>Towers and cheese and bread.<br>The worst classical art in the art history book.<br><br>Go on thinking its great, its not.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>lose pakistan?</br>  <br>Montaigne, Descartes, Diderot, Bergson ; Mirabeau, Danton, Robespierre, Bonaparte ; La Tour, Fragonard, David et Manet te chient allègrement à la gueule.</br>  <br><br>Bro...</br></br>  <br>Again, can't say for sure what will happen. People who don't want to blend in are usually very rich or very poor people living in ghettos ( you were talking about Clichy, think the blond families from the 16th arrondissement in Paris want to see arab groceries in their neighbourhood ? ). But if a majority of the population has got non-european descent, that means a part of that majority won't be poor and living in ghettos and will be blending and say "holy shit, french baguette mixed with hommos is great" ?<br><br>Hab Spass in Deustchland, ich war in deinem Land 5 Monaten lang, das war hammergeil.</br></br></br>    France is cool guy  What is with French air traffic controllers?

You come in to land and it's all sivous plais bonjour macherie canapé bulloibaise and it's like GIMME A RUNWAY YOU FRENCH FUCK    I am just going to leave this here...  lol fuck the brits      <br><br>It is ultimately a problem of definitions. To me, at least, replacing a population is not just "change", even if traces of the old population may persist (in culinaric or other areas). Think of, say, Hawaii. The polynesian population was almost entirely replaced by Whites, Blacks and Asians, and although some rites may have survived, this is certainly not a mere "change" of the original Hawaiian culture, but the latter has died out. Whether the newcomers were rich or poor didn't even matter that much. They just olverwhelmed them numerically. And this will happen to European cultures too, at the current rate of immigration rather sooner than later. <br><br>But again, you're right and we do not know for sure how things will evolve. But "optimism is cowardice", as someone once put it.</br></br></br></br>  France has more nukes than china.      <br> no work <br> no work ethic <br> weak military <br> strong body odor <br> overrated food </br></br></br></br></br>     molecular Gastronomy <br> french cooking <br><br>pick one (1)</br></br></br>  <br>En l'occurence le film a été écrit par un mec d'Hara Kiri. <br><br>Mais bon après tant qu'on reste dans une certaine "élite social" et qu'on évite les cassos et les enfants, la liberté sexuelle est quand même assez grande en France.</br></br></br>  <br>most wars in history kek nice try faggot the only wars you won were because of a dwarf faggot</br>  <br>actually the jews have won the most wars</br>  <br>Ah bah oui scénario de Reiser ( cf. ma couverture de BD ), je me le télécharge de suite tiens !</br>  <br><br>Molecular Gastronomy was created by Hervé This and Nicholas Kurti. <br><br>Hervé This is French, he graduated from the same school where Marie and Pierre Curie worked.</br></br></br></br>    Niggers <br>  Niggers <br>  Niggers <br>  Niggers <br> Free Niggers <br> More Free Niggers <br>  Niggers <br>  Niggers <br>  Niggers <br><br>Yeah, not so great, sorry.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  http://www.hltv.org/match/2296863-c<wbr>loud9-envyus-esl-esea-pro-league-se<wbr>ason-1-finals<br><br>still got your shit pushed in by USA</br></br></wbr></wbr>  <br>Hmm I don't see the hawaiian issue happening at the scale of a country like France.<br>Ultimately, french people have developped a sens of pride and cling to their own culture, without being very patriotic at the same time. ( might explain while a lot of posters here, probably once tourists in France, depict the french as arrogant fucks ). Also see the terror attack against the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in January, a fucking lot of people went down in the streets, and I'm sure a majority of it knew they wouldn't like that newspaper if they read it, but still protested because it was an old french newspaper with roots dating back to the 60's.<br>So if this happens, it won't be as easy as ovewhelming the french frogs with numbers.<br><br>Oswald Spengler RPZ my Anon.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Kek</br>  <br>Not really into French cuisine, I wouldn't list it as a plus. I don't know anyone who explicitly likes French food, goes to France for the food, or compliments the food there. <br>I do like croissants though, thanks. <br><br>Nuclear power is great though</br></br></br></br>  <br>The people you are talking about, the one with 7 children per wife, they don't make a difference when it comes to defining the french culture. <br><br>They are segregated specially and socially, they don't have influence on the cultural production, on political decision, on the way of life of people who lives outsides these ghetto. <br><br>The only immigrants or children of immigrant who has an impact on what is the french culture is the one who have become westernized.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Being French, I have no idea which French meals are sold outside our country. Can you tell me?</br>  <br><br>Not the person you were replying to, but in america off the top of my head i've seen stuff like<br><br>Boeuf bourguignon<br>Fois gras<br>Escargot<br>Ratatouille<br>Coq au Vin<br>Crepes<br>Steak au Poivre<br>French Cheeses of all kinds<br>Wines of course<br><br>usually, but not always, this type of food is sold at high end, expensive american restaurants.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sandnigger,yeah.But honestly we don't have a lot of nigger,black people act like regular people</br>  <br><br>Also I will add that what is considered the "best restaurant" in most american cities is usually a restaurant that has french, or french inspired food.<br><br>French food is associated with fine dining, expensive meals, and is something you would do for a special occasion, such as a date that you want to impress, or an anniversary.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know if french cuisine (outside of very expensive/gastronomic things) is something you can experience outside of France, especially in the US. <br><br>The ingredients aren't the same, and one of the strength of french cuisine is about the quality of the ingredients. We don't use shit tone of spices, or very powerful condiment. <br><br>So i don't think you can experience french food without french ingredient.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And as always, I'm amazed that foreign food is usually common food in its original country. bœuf bourgignon, ratatouille, crèpes, steaks and cheese are plain common food. I mean, it wouldn't surprise anyone that a student, say, can cook any of these meals.</br>  <br><br>We absolutely love those foods in america.<br><br>They are very often prepared with the most expensive ingredients, and are served at very expensive restaurants.</br></br></br></br>  <br> very expensive restaurants. <br>like village inn</br></br>  <br>Restaurants here (UK) seem to do pretty standard food but with an obvious French twist. Things like steak, salads, fish dishes or risotto (cough Italian) all are feature French cheeses, cooked with French wine and so on. Tl;Dr its nothing grand. <br>French restaurants do serve omelettes (croquet monsieur/mademoiselle etc) but I cook those at home with my own ingredients so I don't have them because they will have ingredients I don't want inside...probably restaurants try too hard to shovel as much French stuff in as possible.<br><br>I will not comment on the worse dishes which I don't think are actually French but are made by French cafes and restaurants, such as fucking croissant-pizzas</br></br></br></br>  <br>faugettes, faugettes everywhere.</br>  <br>Boeuf bourguignon is kinda hard to cook, I wouldn't be able to do it with my shitty student-house electrical plates.<br>The rest is very easy to cook yeah, even Jesse Pinkman could do it.</br></br>  <br><br> "Free" healthcare <br> "Free" education <br> "Free" justice <br>hah<br> No religion <br>except a shit load of muslims.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because the British were never nazis</br>  <br>Yup.<br>Bunch of stuff free, nice food and culture.<br>And test of paternity is forbidden by law.<br><br>What a nice country for a golddigger.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> croissant-pizza <br><br>Whoever did that, we have to chase him with our french pitchforks.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Found the stoner.</br></br></br>  <br><br>The only good thing about france is that they kickbanned the romani</br></br>  <br>Free? As in nobody pays for it? Doctors, teachers, hospital &amp; school staff all work for free? We used to get free cotton in America, but the North made us stop.</br>  <br>camembert, cider and crêpes are good. the white people are obnoxious and about all the 3rd world animals theres no need to comment.</br>  <br><br>I don't see how a real boeuf bourguignon can be fit to be served in a restaurant, because it involve very long cooking. <br><br>But i've never worked in a restaurant.</br></br></br></br>  tais toi Mohammed  Ta france de marde pleine de negres et de fucking arabes.. Tu te la garde.. Personnes en veux...  <br>cant give a good argument pro france but the best argument con is you are french .</br>  <br>I was impressed at the audacity of serving that. Don't really blame you when traditional foods are massacred to such an extent</br>  <br>Agreed, takes a few hours to boil.<br><br>Therefore, if you're a good restaurant, you anticipate the number of people who are gonna ask for the boeuf bourguignon and you prepare the dish right before the customers arrive.<br><br>If you're a shitty restaurant, you cook boeuf bourguignon once a week and you throw a portion in a jar and microwave it every time a customer demands it.<br><br>The less dishes are on the menu, the more likely the first option.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I couldn't with my shitty kitchenette either.
