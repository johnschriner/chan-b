Be chill as fuck, learn to take a joke, be open minded and talk to lots of people. The rest will come on its own.</br>  OP changing so much about yourself, isn't it a bit too much? You don't just become alpha my friend. Of which reasons would you like to become an "alpha"? Don't you think it would be much better pursuing something that would make you happy instead of a social fiction in the form of "alpha".  <br> workouts, gym and diet are on their way <br><br> hard character, play hard <br>how.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What this guy said, but I'd also like to add that you should learn the difference between a joke or banter and getting bitched out, if it's the latter assert yourself so it doesn't happen again or constantly</br>  <br>this 100x</br>  confidence in everything you do/think/feel  <br>Having said this i also agree with these<br><br><br>You should really pursue confidence and happiness, but make sure you do it the right way and instead of becoming an alfa you becone a dick</br></br></br></br>  avoiding everything what could be considered as beta - legit  <br>This is not hard, trust me. Just search for some workouts on youtube and do them. Trust me, all bitches will be yours. <br><br>Workouts:<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=44m<wbr>gUselcDU</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=u4Z<wbr>ZNdud1mg</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>I know I'm changing a lot of shit about myself. Basically what I've said. The thing is, I've been feeling like shit for around a year now, I've finally broke up with my gf that I didn't love anymore, I'm starting to miss sex.<br><br>I've been bullied basically the whole time I've been in school, for always being the youngest. that shit leaves you with no confidence starting your young adult life. Things have been better since I started boxing and working out.<br><br>I've been doing something I hated, just for the money for about 2 years now, and decided to go for something I like a bit more, but that pays less. <br><br>I want to be happier, basically, and I think the idea of "alpha", which I know is just a stupid social concept, goes well with what I imagine being a happy, fulfilled man would act like. fake it till you make it?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Can't even make sense of my own shit there how badly i phrased it. Don't become a dick is what i was trying to say in that last bit of jibberish</br>  <br>ok, shit answer, I know but ... the first time I got laid, as in, the actual first time was when i finally decided to act like a dick that didn't care about anything... and that made me think so fuckin much!</br>  <br> fake it till you make it? <br><br>"Sow a thought, reap an action; sow an action, reap a habit; sow a habit, reap a character; sow a character, reap a destiny." Stephen Covey<br><br>Now I'm gtfo /b/ and going to martial art class.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>OP, I commend you. By taking this step you have become alpha no matter what people tell you. <br><br>Now just stop coming here<br><br> hanging out with loosers like us will only bring you down. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>are you my spirit animal?</br>  <br>dunno what to say. I'm starting over, with literally no friends whatsoever. and my workplace is going to be pretty lonely, too. <br><br>where do you start in meeting people in a new city, if you're done with school, and you pretty much work alone?</br></br></br>  I used to be a beta faggot that let kids and teachers pick on my in high school because I was too much of a bitch to do anything about it.<br><br>It's remembering the embarrassment and soul crushing feeling of those events every day of my life that allows me to be alpha.</br></br>  Talk to people<br>Party hard with people<br>Teach yourself to say "no"<br>Do thinks which everyone will like<br>Don't give up<br>Make them say "Ohh.. i want to be this guy"<br>Open mind<br>Make your body look better (gym)<br>Start making a lot of friends<br><br>But don't forget about one think. Be yourself.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I myself am not really a person that would fake it to make it just so that i would take a shorter path to making it. Our lives tho im sure differ in a lot of ways but i would still not reccomend it to anyone to fake it, to be honest i hate it when people fake shit. Im sure you need a starting point tho and nothing needs to be in a final form. Let yourself adjust</br>  I get that being alpha means not giving a fuck. <br>And I grasp the idea. But how do you start? as in, baby steps? I currently give many fucks, for unimportant shit and for unimportant people that will never help me in any way whatsoever. So how do I start not givving a fuck, when I've taken the habit to do (from parents, infance, school, society etc)?</br>  Do coke, fuck some bitches.  <br>this</br>  <br>Become cuck<br>Watch trap porn<br>Loose job/become neet<br>Live with parents<br><br>This is what you must do op<br>Then you can become king of /b/ and noone can stop you</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  FB girls.      <br>More pls</br>      <br>More of her Anon or other pic like this one.</br>  <br>a whore, can't even scuk proprely</br>          Can you guys post some feet?      <br/>        <br>I remember her.
