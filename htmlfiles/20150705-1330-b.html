[ Hey /b/ let's play a game of chance.<br>It's simple.<br><br>If you get dubs, you'll be permabanned within the next hour.<br>Else nothing happens.<br><br>Are you willing to play, or are you too much of a pussy?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I aint afraid of no ban  Pfft  <br>Heroes are never forgotten.<br>Cowboys never die.</br></br>  ROCK AND ROLL BABBYYYYYYYY!  Your mum's a ban!  <br>Bye bye anon</br>  Us mum is still a ban!  I like tacos  <br>I'm not scared FAGGET (actually I am)</br>  I have a big mosquitofag in my room, what can I do?  <br>Post picture of the mosquito.</br>  <br>get a big box to put it in</br>  Let it suck the blood from your throbbing erection.  Name him Bob and let him live with you forever  <br>this</br>  <br>Shotgun with buckshot.</br>  burn down room  <br>Yea basically</br>  <br>suck mosquito cock</br>  <br>Let it bite you in the dick</br>  <br>To prevent any fires and burning down the place for a stupid mosquito. I would recomend to use your garden hose and take it down.. its safer</br>  <br><br>these</br></br>  do you think there will be a nuclear war soon?<br><br>webm not related</br></br>  <br>I hope so.</br>  its damn scary... murricans are sending their weapons to the border. what is this? any news?  <br>i mean we are not hearing anything about that anymore... its all about greece</br>  and how realistic is a war with russia? i mean i really cant imagine that  We are all fucked. Russia is going to pull some stupid shit and then it's game over.  <br>youre also european?</br>  <br>me too mate<br><br>I don't think it will happen very soon, but I'll be surprised to survive the next 15-20 years</br></br></br>  i mean to be realistic? its not gonna happen in the next few years no?  <br>Yeah, but realistically I'd say there is going to be a major war in 1-3 years. You can thank nato later ;)</br>  I hope it does, I hate this life and always wanted to die violently.  <br>My name is not important</br>  <br>Yeah, but realistically I'd say there is going to be a major war in 1-3 years. You can thank nato later ;)</br>  I doubt it. We live in a world where bying or pying off ends up being better solutions. Cheaper in the long run then war.  Didn't John Titor state that a war between Russia and America would break out in late 2015?  <br>This. I wouldn't mind if all human life ended right now.</br>  <br>I just want the EU to build shitloads of vaults as opposed to spending all the GNP on military like two certain gay ass countries, and then one of the certain gay ass countries drops a nuke which sets of yellowstone and wipes out large amount of world while the EU rides it out for a long ass time in the vaults, emerging like 5000 years later with the true purity of man</br>  <br>i dont know, on the one hand site, i really think, that it is unrealistic, because stupid and no one profits from a war, on the other side, people ARE quite stupid</br>  <br>Im down</br>  <br>careful, you might cut yourself on that</br>  <br>Nope</br>  <br> vaults <br><br>nigga plays too much vidya</br></br></br>  <br> emerging like 5000 years later with the true purity of man <br><br>Then in reality we were such pussies that we stocked each vault with Arab/nigger/Indian immigrants in order to seem more politically correct.</br></br></br>  Most likely not.<br><br>If a country need to go as far as to use nuclear devices as a neccesary means to win the war, it's safe to assume the opposing side are of such strenght that they are in posession of nuclear devices themselfes.<br><br>And no one wants full on nuclear warfare. It just fucks up too much.<br>Which is why it would be likely that if someone starting using nuclear weapons in war, the rest of the world would get pissed and wreck their shit for breaking(I'm assuming this) like 514 intenational warfare laws.<br><br><br>If anything, I suspect that before a nuclear war, technology will reach the point where a small group of people can make their own nuclear device to use. Think ISIS or whatever.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 14 intenational warfare laws. <br>wow this is actually quite nice... what do you mean by wrecking their shit?</br></br>  <br>s</br>  <br>Fukken NATO or whatever Idon'tEvenFuckingKnow.<br><br>The rest of the world would realise that they should not do this because it's absolute bullshit.<br>So they may choose to send in armed forces to stop their bullshittery</br></br></br></br>  <br>wouldnt be the result of this another nuke by their own?</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>Wow, /b/'s average user age really is 14 years old isn't? Fucking edgebabies.<br><br>Anyway, I honestly see a 50/50 chance of it happening. Hopefully there isn't a nuclear war because it's obvious once the first nuke is launched we ALL lose, but I could definitely see tensions getting so high that eventually Russia or China just stops giving a shit and starts launching nukes anyway. Really I pretty much leave it up to a coin toss chance that the none of the leaders of the world send out a nuke because they're too buttflustered to do anything else.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>i would like to discusss that option. is there really any benefit from starting a nuke? i mean a real benefit? no. in general a nuke only works as an instrument of power. in the moment you launch it, you loose your power.</br></br>  <br>thats also why a nuclear weapon in general is not that powerful anymore, because you cant use it. the only thing, that frihtens me, is that, if someone got cornered so bad, that the only way is a desperate nuclear attack. and as an aswear the opponent will also launch their nukes. thats the the thing. so how realisitc is it. exspacially with the context of ucrain situation in addition now to the falling euro cause of greece?</br>  <br><br>Exactly. Just check this shit out and now realize the bombs we have now are even more powerful, and there are thousands of them owned by several rivaling countries. We reeaallly don't want nuclear war, only an oblivious child would say "hurrdurr I hope fer teh nookz, nook all teh stoopid peepul XDD"<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=T2I<wbr>66dHbSRA</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>"hurrdurr I hope fer teh nookz, nook all teh stoopid peepul XDD"<br>makes me laugh</br></br>  <br><br>When's high school starting back up? September?</br></br>  <br>Not for them, they got kicked out of school for bringing those razor sharp edges into school.</br>    anyway. maybe i try another time talking.<br><br>good night</br></br>  <br>I usually set off a couple nukes for 4th of july every year.</br>  <br>No fucking shit that's why you posted anonymously.</br>  :)    I'm sure the nuclear bomb will prove to be the greatest mistake mankind will ever make.  <br>:(</br>  <br>Depends on how America conducts it's quest for greater power. Also the Chinese, sand-niggers and Russia may initiate it too.</br>  <br>We nuclear now.</br>  <br>There's never going to be a nuclear war because deterrence works. It's basically "look at my cock, my cock is bigger than yours, but I'm never going to fuck you with my cock, no matter how much I want to because if I do you'll fuck me back and I don't want to take a huge dick in the ass."</br>  <br>Until one of them wants to fuck so bad they just stop caring about having to take that dick in the ass.</br>  <br>:)</br>  <br>:(</br>  <br>:)</br>  <br>I just want to know sauce on the porn in webm</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;625863181   I'm feeling curious /b, so let me ask.<br><br>Why did you try meth knowing one hit and your stuck. You knew it wasn't going to end well.<br><br>I can't imagine having my first pipe or needle and thinking to myself, "oh I can't wait to see how this turns out". I mean you must be mentally retarded to even concider it.<br><br>I'm in Perth aus and we have a big meth problem. All my retard mates are doing it, some have better control then others but they're all on that same path to fucktupnessville.<br><br>I'm not against drugs I enjoy mdma, shrooms and a bit of weed but if never touch the sweet puff know what power it will hold over you. <br><br>It's a sad problem with sadder results.<br><br>Tl;dr why did u do meth?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Never have and never will. After binge-watching Breaking Bad (while high on weed), I thought "Hmm.. I wonder how it would be. I'd try it just once"<br><br>Finished watching the show and came to my senses.<br><br>How long have you been an addict, OP?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Never tried it but been around it enough. It's hard to get away from it tbh. Watching mates fuck themselves up is hard though. When I see them it makes me angry cus they knew better but you still feel sorry for them.</br>  <br><br>Yeah man, just stay away from that shit and you'll be okay. <br><br>Any crazy stories?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm in south alabama and wish I could.find some fucking meth.</br>  I don't do meth anymore, but I used to.<br><br>Only people with no self control get addicted to shit like that, so I guess most people.<br><br>There isn't any sort of magical ingredient that's guaranteed to get you hooked, it's just most people can't deal with coming off something like that. The higher a substance makes you, the harder it is to come off of it.<br><br>I used to work a job that was incredibly demanding, and I basically needed meth to keep me working at my best, but I was never stupid enough to go use it for fun and just have a good time.<br><br>If you're a week willed person that will submit to an addiction easily, stay the fuck away from it. But if you're that rare breed that can actually suffer through a temporary withdraw then consider it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  My buddy bought a fat rock for my birthday and we went on a 4 day high together.<br>Had a couple binges after that.<br>I don't smoke anymore.<br>It's not as addictive as people think.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah they arnt too far gone atm. They are losing it though, crazy crack rants and argument over petty shit. You can see that they are ashamed though, hate themselves. A few have given up on trying at this point and are just going with it, which makes it worse on their friends as the more it's around them the harder they find it to resist and the cycle continues.</br>  I'm from Perth, I don't take meth or any drugs and none of my friends do either! <br><br>Particularly not meth, in fact I've never socialised with anyone that does meth..<br><br>Get better friends that aren't from Kwinana?</br></br></br></br>  <br>How long between uses? Did u find them time between decreasing?</br>  Yeah, fuck meth, heroin, crack, cocaine, bath salts, and most other drugs. Psychedelics are the only good drugs.  <br>Done it more than once, and I liked it. A lot. So much that I knew I should probably go there again, especially as an old fart. Plus it's the one drug I've witnessed in a long life that's truly as bad or worse than it's reputation, as far as fucking people up goes.</br>  <br>Haha you would be suprised at how easy it is to get and where it's huge. Just go to any house in North perth and you're guaranteed to find a junky or two.</br>  <br>Why did u do it?</br>  <br>While most psychedelics aren't harmful to your body or particularly addictive, those things can make you do some stupid shit if you get too fucked up.<br><br>Plus, excessive use of psychedelics can cause mental illness. That is entirely subjective, though.</br></br></br>  I did meth twice, and I'll never touch it again. I just don't care much for it. Coke doesn't really get e off either, I'm more of a heroin guy.  addiction to stimulants is nowhere near as hard to break as an addiction to downers  <br> I should probably * go there again <br>* NOT!</br></br>  <br>You took Shrooms right?<br>You drink alcohol?</br></br>  <br>Yer there's always too much of a good thing. You can drink too much water which fucks with the electrolytes in your body. But I've seen enough to know meth is the real deal. Can turn a genius into a fiend. Too much acid will send you to the psycho ward so they're both silly in their own way.</br>  <br>Agreed. I used to smoke occasionally before work to get through all nighters. It isn't very addictive unless you have a weak will. Although the crash is horrid depending on the quality and how much you smoke.<br><br>Eventually, I started to use every day just to avoid the crash. After 5 months of that I quit cold turkey. Waste of money and you start to slip into insanity.<br><br>Definitely not worth it. 4 years sober now</br></br></br></br></br>  I'm a casual meth user for five years now, I'm twenty two. I live by myself and make my own money with a legal job<br><br>ama</br></br>  When was the last time you yurofags thanked a US soldier for protecting your ass from the ruskies?<br><br>Americans, when was the last time you thanked a US soldier for saving the petrodollar and allowing us to keep a standard of living well above what our actual economic output should permit?</br></br>  <br>Well say goodbye to your chevy truck, iphone, and mcdonalds<br><br>Aint such a pretty picture is it</br></br></br>  <br>says the one on /b/ begging for respect while your XXXXL dependapotomus wife goes out and fucks random guys/spends all the allowance money we give you</br>  <br>Britain has that tiny island rathole advantage. Like Iwo Jima.<br><br>Also,<br> Protecting us from Russians <br> Crippling us economically because 'hey we want to be the big rigs' <br> Fighting wars for oil and not telling soldiers what they're getting into <br> lolno <br> Telling the French that basically won you independence to eat shit because they disagreed with the Iraq war and being the most petty arseholes to ever exist. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why Atheists have higher IQs than people who believe in God?  <br><br>That part is self-explanantory.<br><br>The REAL kicker is that atheist know more about religion that people who believe in god.<br><br>http://www.pewforum.org/2010/09/28/<wbr>u-s-religious-knowledge-survey/<br><br><br>Religious people literally fail at life.</br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because they're not idiots.</br>  edgy  <br>Says the atheist who can't even grammar.</br>  Us Christians don't feel the need to prove our higher intelligence with online IQ tests. We are already generally happier in life, have loving friends and families, great social lives, help our communities, etc. But you atheists can have "higher" IT'S because that is such an important part of life.  I assume atheists are more curious since they will always have one more question to ask than a believer. A believer will stop at "god made it" - an Atheist will dig deeper.  <br>IQ's* Sorry.</br>  <br>Still going to hell, fag.</br>  <br><br>Hell doesn't exist, fuckwit.</br></br>  <br>religion was a very clever invention in order for the elite rich and powerful to control what they believed to be the lesser understanding people.

I beg of you , end this post in dubs...</br>  Thoughts ?  <br>No your comment made me think a bit further. This irrational behavior is normal for extremists though. It's the staple of insanity.<br><br>I'm really curious what's going to surface in the coming years about ISIS. It could just be there is sort of an international "don't ask don' tell" policy around them, because everybody has something to hide.</br></br></br>  <br>The job could easily be finished.<br>Nuke'em and be done with it, no one will miss them.<br>Muslims are a disease that NEEDS to be taken care of.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Where do these prisoners keep coming from</br></br>  Do I fuck my friends mom tonight?  Get pics if you do OP   625863458   Definitely will have cam set up..she told me she is lonely tonight and no one WI be home and incited me over</blockquote>]
