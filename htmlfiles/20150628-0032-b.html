You can eat good steaks all over the world without beeing part of that shithole.</br>  <br>I guess now it becomes a battle of which amendment it falls under. The 10th or the 14th. Personally, I think you should just do whatever you want.</br>  <br>Guess I haven't seen a place that offers a gigantic steak I shouldn't be able to physically eat outside of Texas.</br>  <br><br><br>Except the Supreme Court just said that doesn't apply. So it doesn't.</br></br></br>  fag haters here <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;624317235   <br>Not correct. What the Supreme Court said is denying gays to marry violates the constitution.</br>  <br>I think your mistaking Texas for Louisiana</br>  <br>The supreme court said that denying gays the right to marry is unconstitutional so the this amendment is not applicable.</br>  <br> autism speaks </br>  <br>texas has one of the strongest economies of any state, unlike liberal faggot california</br>  <br> buttmad the post <br>lol faggot</br></br>  <br>you do realize that the federal government should not and does not have this authority over the states. idgaf if gay people get married, but its up to the states, not the fed</br>  <br>Lel, they prohibited banning it. Goodbye Texas have fun with the national guard.</br>  <br>I don't remember the constitution saying anything about faggots or gay marriage</br>  So are they gonna try to secede again?  <br>According to the Supreme Court it does. You may not agree with the decision or like it but every state is bound by this decision and the Feds will enforce it.</br>  <br><br><br>Which means it supersedes the 10th amendment. It's the same bullshit racists tried in the South with Jim Crow laws. You can't create a law under the guise of the 10th Amendment to supersede other ones.</br></br></br>  <br>i think its funny that people clown the south, when we always have the lowest taxes and unemployment rate. enjoy your liberal faggot state</br>  <br>At least one of the fifty states still has testicles</br>  <br>Exactly, so they have the same rights. Proved yourself wrong faggot.</br>  <br><br><br>Except it does. If it didn't you would be your own country, and you're not. Know what happened the last time a Governor tried to tell the President to go fuck himself? He got an in-person introduction the the 101st Airborne, and the rest was history.</br></br></br>  Texas is taking a gamble here but it knows its got a ace up its sleeve. <br><br>Marihuana is legal in Colorado and California (medical card) both go against the federal law<br><br>Either way Texas takes something: gay marriage or others states pot</br></br></br></br>  <br>Prove they have that right<br>Butt fucking faggot</br></br>  <br>funny, pretty sure weed is still federally illegal</br>  <br>Read the ruling</br>  <br>If this is true, I have never felt prouder of this state I chose as my home. Not because it is denying gay marriage, I actually wholeheartedly support gay marriage, but because it is standing up to the federal government. I am a bit sad it chose THIS to stand up for, but at least I know it wont back down when they make guns illegal or try to force some other horrible thing down our throats.</br>  <br> Obvious American <br> Calling America a shithole.  <br> Top kek at this faggot pretending to be something he is not in order to be edgy &amp; "cool". <br><br>And before you deny it faggot, know that foreigners (even fucking Canadians) do not call their conservative groups "Republicans". <br><br>Edgy leftist retards like you are just as annoying as hard right extremists.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There is no federal law for gay marriage it was a ruling on constitutionality</br>  Lived in Austin, Houston, visited small shit towns along the way. This state will not be missed  <br>Being from texas myself I personally have no problem with the fact of gay marriage. I think it should be voted on by the people of the individual state to see if the majority wants it. If legalized any religious institutions should have the legal right to deny anyone the service of marriage if they believe it contradicts their religion. And yes states rights is the issue here and should not be violated by the federal government because that would indeed be unconstitutional. But since the south lost in the civil war trying to protect states rights when has that ever stopped the federal government?</br>  We could need more Texas'es in the world.  <br>I call testicles "Balls" but maybe that's why you live in Texas</br>  <br>Except denying gays the right to marry violates the constitution since straight people have that right. You are denying gays both liberty and property. This makes it a constitutional issue not a state rights issue.</br>  <br> Civil war when? <br>when the media has whipped everyone up <br>also the states is probs going to split up into 3 or more diffrent countries</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck the ruling and fuck you<br>stay salty faggot</br></br>  <br>OP is a lying faggot and all that texas nigger attorney said was a bunch jew faggot shit about how raptor jeebs died for our sins and such.</br>  <br>Faggot, live in peace and enjoy your LBGT parades where you live</br>  <br>You do realise that people from outside of the US are away of what your conservative party calls themselves.<br><br>I'm from the UK and I call US conservatives republicans.</br></br></br>  <br>I call US conservative republicans, "Shitheads"</br>  <br><br>Rofl faggot doesn't understand how laws work.</br></br>  <br>I am the law</br>  <br>You seem to have a very loose grasp on what a democracy is. If there is a majority vote against a topic it becomes law. Otherwise you are infringing on the rights and choices of the majority of the people. This is something the federal government has had no problem in violating. There is no such law in the constitution regarding marriage so explain to me exactly how that would pertain to the constitution itself?</br>  <br>Fuck h8 brah</br>  <br>hahahaha you inbred moron. google California's percentage contribution to the GDP of Murica and compare it to Texas. Unless that was trollbait, in which case fuck you.</br>  <br>Republicans and conservatives are two different things.</br>  <br>Read the ruling and weep you homophobe</br>  <br>The majority is stupid, and will happily wreck the rights of minorities, given the appropriate social conditioning. <br><br>Democracy isn't nearly as simple as 'majority rules.'</br></br></br>  <br>In some cases large groups of people elect representatives to vote for them as a whole. Other than that yes it is exactly that simple.</br>  <br>Ruling doesn't apply faggot<br>Texas and other states voiding them lol</br></br>  <br>http://www.angeloueconomics.com/kee<wbr>p-up-with-ae/texas-surpasses-califo<wbr>rnia-as-leading-tech-exporter#.VY6R<wbr>bsvn_qA<br><br>How does this make you feel?</br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Did you not read what ive been posting? I actually support gay marriage but if the majority do not agree on that term than I will not cry about it like a little bitch like everyone from every other state did to get their way.

Still you can't deny silicon valley's incredible contributions to the tech world.</br>  <br>But they're not pushing. They made an exception to those states as long as they had a valid structure of law to enforce.</br>  <br>No it doesn't. As long as the 14th agrees with the federal ruling the 10th has no say.

Hit me up!<br><br>For the rest of you, an image I keep for reactions that I'll likely never get to use.)</br></br></br>  <br>you say what you're looking for, and wait for people to offer to partner up with you<br>such as</br></br>  <br>I haven't slept in *Looks towards the clock* sixty..... five hours now? Depressed but this erp thread helps</br>  <br>no i mean literally how do I ERP once i've found a partner<br><br>are there general rules/standards that should be followed<br>is there a format<br>how good of a writer do i need to be<br>etc</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> No standards on writing really mister, you just need to have imagination and not be dull and you'll find someone ^^ in general there's a few rules that everyone follows. *Words in asterisks like this is an action* "Words in quotes like this is speech OR thoughts, depending on the person" (And words in brackets like this is outside of the rp) l</br>  <br>The woman notices the young man across the room people watching. Her eyebrow raises slightly as she wonders who this new person is.</br>  <br>different people have different preferences. some like to reply in paragraphs, with lots of detail. others want rapid replies that are to the point and get to the "good stuff" so to speak.<br><br>if you say you're a rookie up front, most people will be more forgiving while they chat with you. if you do it enough times you'll get a feel for what you like</br></br></br>  <br>h-hi! sorry, I haven't been feeling very well<br><br><br>I thought you were someone else heh, but awh. have you participated at all?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Moderate-superb writing recommended. Proper grammar and spelling a must. Make sure you choose first or third person for your posts and make sure you don't overlap them. Choose past or present tense for your posts, MAKE SURE you don't overlap them.<br><br>Many people write actions and dialogue differently, usually using a symbol to devote an action (such as *chokes the milf* or //deepthroats the cock//)</br></br></br>  <br>Aw, I'm sorry. Is it your brother's fault?</br>  <br>I've been carrying masters to my skype dungeon all night. I got 4 just in the past few hours. Been a fun time. What about you cutie?</br>  <br><br><br>hmm ok<br>Is there somewhere I can read ERP sessions so I can get a feel for it? I don't want to fuck up and have someone get mad at me</br></br></br></br>  <br>as his blue-grey eyes are roaming from person to person they lock with your for a moment before he breaks contact and continues looking around as if he didn't notice you.</br>  <br>Addendum: if you don't prefer styling posts like that, simply write things like a novel. For instance, <br>"She stroked his cock slower, teasing every ounce of pleasure out of her desperate son. "Are you enjoying this, sweetie~?" she crooned, looking straight into his half-lidded eyes with a pronounced smirk.</br></br>  <br>Lurk erp threads, they're up nearly every day. I would point you towards the last thread because it was quite extensive but unfortunately it closed.</br>  <br>i-i don't think so! I may have to get some more rest.. how have you been?<br><br><br>oh that's good, no I don't participate in lewd stuff very much.</br></br></br></br>  <br>there;s this guy named Bloodninja, he kind of invented modern ERP. you should google him</br>  <br>Just lurk the thread if you're really that unsure if yourself, but honestly decorum here is fat and loose. People are looking to get their jollies, not critique someone's creative writing abilities.<br><br>Ignore the trolls, though. Make sure you just do not engage. If you're not thick-skinned they could get to you, I think.</br></br></br>  Sorry to budge in, but is anyone a god and have a copy of the "loli pussy cat weo -shave it remix" music video thing? Part of it is OP's .gif. Thanks in advance!  <br>  invented modern erp <br>...you best be trolling</br></br>  <br>Fast and loose*, fuck. Lesson 3: PROOFREAD BECAUSE AUTOCORRECT IS A REAL COCK.</br>  <br>hey, everything i learned about ERP was from reading his stories on bash.org</br>  <br>Uhm, okay I guess. Mommy was nice today, but some boy tried to convince me to tell daddy on her... I don't think I wanna do that.<br><br>What's "lood" mean?</br></br></br>  <br>A sudden half smile unconsciously appeared on her face as the strangers beautiful glanced at her for a moment. Then as he moved on the smile left her face, she stared down thinking oh well whatever, and goes back to looking around.</br>  Get me a submissive maid, pronto. My cock is gonna explode.  <br>Tfw bash reminds you about who bloodninja is<br><br>I put on my robe and wizard hat...</br></br></br>    <br>He puts the book down and walks over to you when you are looking away and says in a . "I don't believe I have seen you here before."</br>  <br>(im sorry im not really feeling well enough to rp as her.)</br>  <br>soft-spoken voice (sorry not sure what happened there)</br>  <br>I've...actually been trying to find work as a maid, if you're hiring... How many square feet are we talking?</br>  <br>(Aw fair enough. feel better, friend!)</br>  <br>Does a mansion sound good to you? I'm just a lonely man, spending his days in his once so lively mansion.</br>  <br>renewing my interest</br>  Any male anon up for some bicurious erp with a bicurious guy...?  <br>Oh, uhm gosh. I've never worked somewhere quite so big, but I guess...I'm gonna be a little blunt, here... If you pay me well enough to bump another place off my schedule in the afternoons, we'd have a deal.</br>  <br>Money isn't an issue. Do we have a deal?</br>  <br>She jumps a little from the surprise of hearing a voice right next to her. Then trying to keep her cool she responds with a friendly, "well I've never actually been here before". Then when she realised you were the boy from across the room a sudden flush of pink fills her face.</br>  <br>I suppose so, sir. Do you have any specific processes, or should I just get in there and uh...Do my thing?</br>  <br>He adopts a friendly smile and notices you blushing. "Well let me be the first person you meet then. My name is William. Nice to meet you." He reaches his hand out to shake yours.</br>  <br>Just do your thing, one thing though.. never enter my office without my permission? If that's clear I'll be glad to welcome you, miss.</br>  <br>Oh, sure, no problem. Should I handle the res of your house, though? No wive's or children's bedrooms off-limits?</br>  <br>She smiles and regains her composure though still blushing a little. Valerie, she says in a more confident voice as she returns your handshake. Nice to meet you too, she says while playfully bowing.</br>  <br>Just the office. I'm divorced. My kids will be around the house sometimes but they won't bother you. You can do their rooms as well.</br>  <br>He seems amused by your bow and does a quite dramatic one himself bowing low and extending his hand with his other behind his back and looks back up at you with the same smile and then laughs a little after trying not to. "Quite formal aren't you?"</br>  Oh, I get it now. The E stands for excrutiating.  <br>I'm going to bed in a little bit but I like these threads, if you're on later I'll try to find you.</br>  <br>Alright see you soon i hope</br>  <br>"Fair enough. Suppose I'll grab my things and set off to work, then."<br><br>After some dallying in her car, she returns with a vacuum and large bag of various cleaners and scrubbing implements. She starts in the foyer, working on larger tasks like sweeping and scrubbing before getting to the finer points like dusting. She gives him a friendly nod and smile whenever he's in her line of sight, whisking away sweat with a dirty rag as she goes about her chores.</br></br></br>  <br>Different strokes for different folks. Works a little better when there's three or four active stories though.</br>  <br>She blushes again and gives a little laugh, "yes I suppose I am". She says while trying to hide her face.</br>  <br>maybe skype my bicurious friend?</br>  new trap thread!<br>ITT we post girls with feminine penises<br>no shitposters pls thank you<br>go go go</br></br></br>    <br>thank you &lt;3</br>  Haha all the shit pictures.
