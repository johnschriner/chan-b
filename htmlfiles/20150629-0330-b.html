Or soundgarden from my youth, even primus..  <br>eminem just hurt himself</br>  <br>Definitely over rated, only valuable because without those fags, no stones, no stones=no Zeppelin.

Shame they weren't around for very long (and there's zero chance of me going to their reunion show because it's sold out)  <br>Ill bet hes got the heathen hammer as well</br>  <br>I couldn't give a rats ass about some random emo anon's opinion. It's a great band.<br><br><br>Agreed the only song I like of that album is Crimson Day</br></br></br></br>  Anyone remember them?  <br>As far as black metal goes this band is so average. Nothing stands out. Their are thousands of black metal bands that sound like this.

Feeling tired in the afternoon, put down the caffeinated soda and pick up a cucumber. Cucumbers are a good source of B Vitamins and Carbohydrates that can provide that quick pick-me-up that can last for hours.<br><br>3. Tired of your bathroom mirror fogging up after a shower? Try rubbing a cucumber slice along the mirror, it will eliminate the fog and provide a soothing, spa-like fragrance.<br><br>4. Are grubs and slugs ruining your planting beds? Place a few slices in a small pie tin and your garden will be free of pests all season long. The chemicals in the cucumber react with the aluminum to give off a scent undetectable to humans but drive garden pests crazy and make them flee the area.<br><br>5. Looking for a fast and easy way to remove cellulite before going out or to the pool? Try rubbing a slice or two of cucumbers along your problem area for a few minutes, the phytochemicals in the cucumber cause the collagen in your skin to tighten, firming up the outer layer and reducing the visibility of cellulite. Works great on wrinkles too!!!<br><br>6. Want to avoid a hangover or terrible headache? Eat a few cucumber slices before going to bed and wake up refreshed and headache free.
