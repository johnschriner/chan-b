Just be smart about it.<br><br>I'm in my mid-30s, and I've turned down three eager &amp; willing 15-16-year-olds over the last few years, simply because you can't be my age and NOT go to jail for fucking them.

I was looking up into the trees and saw a goblins face. The jaw was moving up and down like a puppet animation. It kind if looked like a papermacha float of a goblin head.  Best looking celebrity thread. (Bonus points for underrated) I'll start with Jennifer Carpenter  <br>She has the hips and ass of a 12 year old boy.</br>  Rate my thick Latina g.f /b/. also, thick Latina thread? G/f rate thread?  Hyperdimension Games v7 part 2!<br>Paintball and Shorty is apparently a lot of things.</br>  <br><br>Fair enough, a friend of mine is into that study and he's having a hard time. But he's lazier than me however. I think he had around 4-5 resits and he had to pass all of them after having them done 3 times already.<br><br>He had to wager it all on a last shot on 5 different subjects.<br><br>I still haven't heard from him, I assume he didn't make it kek.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So I've been called Hoshi and Booker in the span of about an hour.<br><br>Any more ghosts you paranoid retards obsess about?

Reagardless of race, sexual orientation and stuff.  <br><br>I could buy your wife, your kids and wherever you live.</br></br>    <br>what are you, superficial?</br>  hello guys, hate my imageboard<br>everything will be allowed<br>everything...even cp<br><br>https://freechan.eu.org/</br></br></br></br>  <br> Kinmoshit <br>Kill yourself</br></br>  <br>is this one of these so called 'honeypots'?</br>  <br>no<br>this one is totally safe</br></br>  Hey /b/, I'll keep this short because I'm on mobile.<br><br>The girl I'm seeing wants to start dealing weed. Her family doesn't have much money and she wants to supplement her income by dealing. I don't think this is a good idea because I don't think she fully grasps what she would be getting herself into. Can any dealers share some stories or perhaps some pros and cons of dealing? I want to know if I'm overacting or if she's being naive about it.<br><br>Also, drugs general: what's anons favorite illegal substance?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm white as fuck, friend. Canadian fucking white.</br>  <br>Just make sure to have a separate personal supply.<br><br> Also on the very off chance she gets robbed she should make sure to have a smaller stash hidden somewhere that she can lead them to it and not have everything stolen.</br></br></br>  <br>lol &gt;100 grams<br>you me 3 ounces?</br></br>  y u no loli bread /b/?      <br><br><br>Kik?</br></br></br>  Its Murr Monday!<br><br>Post 'em.</br></br>        Cocking your girls!  <br>Tinychat /picjerker</br>  <br>please,put your dick between her feet</br>  <br>No problem</br>  lets have an electronic music thread<br>my fav producer right now is probs vicetone, the drop at https://<span>youtu.be/nD-p8-k2PMM?t=14m5<wbr>7s</wbr>  [ ] makes me hard af</br>  <br>xD Ah good times...</br>  Have you heard of Skrillex?
