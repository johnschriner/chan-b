That's a dirty tactic<br><br><br>Doesn't mean some girls don't get meaningful or beautiful tattoos. This should be scrutinized on a case by case basis. Who is the chick in question? Where is she in life? Where is the tattoo? How big is it? Why did she get the tattoo? Does it look good? Anyone should think of variables instead of generalizing.

And I'm in a state that already legalized it.</br></br></br>  <br>Y-you are aware that the pic is fake right?</br>  <br>Exactly, for attention and to manipulate them. The guys just deal with it to try and get some play. They always move on after a while if nothing comes up. Unless the male friend sticks around for years, then he is in love with her and just waiting and hoping you'll see his white shining armor.</br>  <br> Smoking weed is gross. It smells bad and does not improve your shitty personality. <br><br>I can sense your vigor. If this is what angers you then you most likely have a shitty personality.</br></br></br>  <br> How do you know that this guy doesn't show it off when it's a appropriate time to take his shirt off? <br><br>Do you have autism... from where is this picture? What is facebook? What is twitter? What is instagram? <br><br>You faggot tattoo people are braindead morons go cuck yourself with some niggers and watch your wife take the bbc up her asshole you manlet</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>P-prove it.</br>  <br>The only acceptable tatoos are cultural.<br><br>And I mean their own culture, not someone else's because it looks cool.</br></br></br>  <br>If you get a tattoo when you're young, you will end as one such old person with a tattoo.<br><br>It's called aging.<br>It happens to everyone.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I have no idea where this picture is from. But the guys face isn't in the fucking picture. How do you know that this isn't solely for the fucking tattoo artist? <br><br> You faggot tattoo people are braindead morons  <br><br>Says the guy who thinks that someone having a tattoo is a indication of their inherent worth. Also I don't have any tattoos; I'm just open minded about shit that doesn't matter that much.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br> using the fedora incorrectly <br>kill yourself, then go back to reddit</br></br>  <br> What's wrong with chinese grills? <br>Their love is directly proportional to amount of money you're willing to spend.</br></br>  <br>he's right though, stoners smell awful and find the sound of their own piss hitting the bowl interesting. and most of them are unemployed and keep ranting about spirituality or some bs and think they are amazing philosophers.<br>but to each his own.</br></br>  <br>Even if it's for themselves solely and they don't show it off to anyone but people their romantically involved with?</br>  <br>Works awesome. Get along really well, never cheated on him, nor even tought about it</br>  <br>I think your fedora's on too tight edgelord.</br>  <br> sun in her eyes <br> sun behind her <br> eyes wide open </br></br></br>  <br> generalizing this much <br><br>It's like I'm back in fucking elementary school. That's enough 4chan for me today.</br></br></br>  <br>I am a generic anon...hear me roar.</br>  She is a single mum with kids younger than 10, fucking run!!!!! Learnt from experience.  <br>When they use phrases like:<br> I've been through a lot and now I just want to live life to the fullest. <br>or<br> I've been hurt many times before. <br><br>Both are clear signs that she has some baggage and will most likely bring unneeded drama into your life.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>she is a faggot like OP</br></br>  <br>That's true but everyone has some type of baggage. Just like everyone has gone through non-pleasurable experiences</br>  <br>I don't want people like that around me, I can be picky about who my friends are.</br>  Fucking lol'd<br>10/10 if troll<br>7/10 if copypasta</br></br>  <br>Checked.<br><br>Also, yeah I can agree with that but I feel like people who purposefully and vaguely verbalize it are the ones who have had the more hard core shit go down in their lives that is not worth bringing into your own.</br></br></br>  <br>youre getting confused with korea</br>  I've got some <br> has to many guy friends that aren't gay <br> has drawn on eyebrows <br> thinks feminism means women&gt;men <br> thinks there are multiple rapes (the ones that don't make sense such as stare rape, fart rape, ect.) <br> her weight starts with "two hundred and..." <br>  unnaturally dyed hair(colors like blue, green, purple, ect.) <br> Black <br> Mexican  <br> peircings are fine unless excessive </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You can think I'm angry if you want. I'm not passionate either way. I really think it smells bad. I really don't see the benefits of it over other things. I have been high before because experimentation. I didn't notice the smell while I was high. So that is a plus I guess.<br><br>I find drinking, which is statistically worse, is a better way to get intoxicated. I like drinking. Its a fun thing to do once in a while. I prefer the effects/smell of cigarette/cigar smoke too. But I rarely smoke.<br><br>You probably look at me and think, "Diddly doodly! This guy is a square!" and that is fine too. Really. I'm not passionate about these things you value so highly. Generally the people who are, have a personality that irritates me.<br><br>I'm sober most of the time because I like to be sober. And when I want to mix it up I drink when I want to have fun with people I enjoy being around.<br><br>Again. I really don't care what you do in your free time. Go smoke right now if that floats your boat. Power to you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ugh fuck man.<br> thinks feminism means women&gt;men <br> thinks there are multiple rapes (the ones that don't make sense such as stare rape, fart rape, ect.) <br>So much this.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Please see<br/></br>  All women are batshit fucking crazy. Pick the level of crazy you are personally prepared to deal with and fuck it.  <br> has never even met an MFT. <br><br>Seriously?<br><br>1. They really want to be girls, so they end up taking on all of those characteristics over time anyway. <br><br>B. They've got other mental problems brought on by the stress of what they've been going through.<br><br>Third. If they transitioned young, they probably are mentally female by the time you meet them, so your points are all invalid.<br><br>IV. If they transitioned later, see 1 and B, plus they're stuck with a body that has more male characteristics.<br><br>Face it. You are a faggot who wants to fuck a hairy dude wearing knee socks.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well said anon, but...<br> "Diddly doodly! This guy is a square!" <br>The fuck would say that apart from Ned Flanders?</br></br></br>  <br> Uses gas instead of char coal. </br>  <br>This anon is a faggot, but at least I think he's being honest.</br>  <br> &gt;Talks like a girl <br>How is this a good thing according to your standard?<br> &gt;Dresses better than most girls <br>That only applies to tumblr traps<br> &gt;Takes care of self better than most girls <br>How so?<br> &gt;More willing/open to suggestions that perhaps usually only apply to men. <br>Proof? She doesn't want to be a man, wants to be treated like a girl.<br> &gt;Despite 4chans claims of being 'mentally disturbed' acts a lot less bipolar than the average woman <br>Nope. The statistics are pretty clear.<br> &gt;Acts with logic and reason rather than emotion and whim. <br>Nope. What part of "wants to be a girl" and "is mentally female" don't you get.<br> &gt;Willing to go the extra mile to please their male partner as they willingly have embraced the female gender rather than being born into it. <br>Still wants to be treated female, not like a fuck puppet. As a note to you chasers, a real MTF probably won't want you anywhere near it's dick.<br> &gt;A lot less likely to cheat due to male origin. <br>kek</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't really care about your conversation but I just wanted to point out how much I like the way you listed your points.<br><br>Its really irritating and I can appreciate the thought that went into it. If you came up with that, I like you.</br></br></br>  <br>What can I say. It's fun to slip into a verbal conversation, but just one out of several. 1, 2, 3, D, 4, 5.<br><br>Life's what you make of it. Try to enjoy yourself.</br></br></br>  <br>this.
