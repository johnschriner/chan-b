If you don't have the balls to tell your boss that HE has to pay you and not the customers, and you get mad if the customers don't pay part of your salary....you are a piece of shit.  <br>There are a lot of problems in this statement.<br><br>Tipping should be like in whole europe: they tip, still your boss pays you a full wage. It works and is a win-win.</br></br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=q_v<wbr>ivC7c_1k</wbr>  [ ]<br> /thread </br></br>  <br>But if you're allowed to bypass the restriction, why not just do it?-every restaurant owner ever</br>  I always leave $1, no matter how much I pay  This whole "Servers are paid under minimum wage" is complete horseshit spread by servers to try to guilt people into tipping.<br><br>Server employers are required BY FEDERAL LAW to match any wages up to minimum wage. If the minimum wage is $7.15 and the server only makes $4 that hour after tips, the employer MUST pay an increase of $3.15 to make up to it.<br><br>The only time servers make less than minimum is when they let their employers walk all over them and not follow the law.<br><br>I don't tip because you dont deserve it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Tipping should be like in whole europe: they tip <br> in whole europe: they tip <br> they tip <br><br>I have never tipped anyone in my life unless I didn't want to carry around a wallet full of copper. But tipping a few cents hardly counts as tipping.<br><br>Tips should be given for exemplary service and I sure as hell won't tell a server in advance that I won't tip them unless they go above and beyond and then watch them throw a hissy fit and get shit service.<br><br>Do your fucking job properly and stop being a glorified beggar or get the fuck out of the service industry.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>tipping is great. it makes for great service and cheaper food. just travel a bit and you'll see. the service blows in europe for example. <br><br>of course i can afford to tip and i tip well. the system works.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't know where the fuck you've been, but the food is much cheaper in Europe (in most countries) and I've never had bad service in my life (and I've eaten in just about every country).</br></br>  <br>wrong. you're a fucking liar clearly</br>  <br>This is because your a fuck ass poorfag.<br><br>I'm european, and I tip when the service is good. You are paying for the food, but if the service is good (a smile, a little chat with the waiter etc.) it's extra. If I feel fine I tip you (even 5€ if I'm in the mood), if the service is meh i don't tip.</br></br></br>  it really depends if i had a good service and enjoyed whatever the fuck i was doing. <br>im not tipping them for shit service</br>  <br>This thread will always have the same results<br>Have Liru instead</br></br>  <br>I dont' tip for one reason. Imagine the delivery person coming to your door. They knock and you open. You exchange niceties and exchange food and money. You pay the exact amount and close the door. The best part is imagining how they look down at the money trying to see if there is a tip and then being upset as they drive back to their workplace.</br>  Types of people who don't tip<br> niggers <br> Jews <br> spoiled brats who have never worked food service </br></br></br>  <br>its not. thats the job descripton. you get trained or at least briefed all that social yadada.</br>  <br><br>Except that it's the paradigm, the utter and total paradigm, for employers to not follow this.<br><br>Employers simply don't do this. This 'law' is easily bypassed and loopholed by poor reporting and employers having all the power in the employee/employer relationship.<br><br>Not saying they shouldn't, or that servers shouldn't stand up for themselves... <br><br>But to pretend that this 'law' is actually 'real' and/or enforced, or existent in any way, is patently false.<br><br>Find one server, ever, that has ever been compensated "up to minimum wage". You'd most likely be fired for daring to report that you made BELOW minimum wage, officially. <br><br>Further, you're actually taxed based on the national average rather than your actual experience / income. This further fucks the server.<br><br>It's a shit industry. Don't work in it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This. Being from Europe I never tip unless the service warrants it. Tipping is a reward, not me paying the waiters' wages when the boss is too cheap to do it. I find it nonsencial to tip everyone, especially if the service has been slow or otherwise inadequate.<br><br>When I do tip, it's 10 to 15% of the total sum. In higher end restaurants where the service is generally better I usually end up tipping 15€ or more, usually by telling the waiter to round my bill up (say, if it's 132€ I just tell them to make it 150€).<br><br>In Europe the waiters are paid normally, though, so they don't rely on tips to survive. Whenever I travel in a country where this isn't the case, I tip unless the service is a complete disgrace.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Where can I play this game?</br>  Everybody gets not wanting to to a shit server, but it's bullshit to automatically know you're not going to tip when you go in. Most restaurants require the servers to pay a tip share to bussers and bartenders (and food runners if the restaurant has them). Usually that's 3.5% of the cost of your meal. That's why the standard tips are calculated in percentages- the more you spend, the more I pay to wait on you; it's like paying rent to wait in a restaurant. <br><br>The douche bag at the beginning of the thread IS right, if you don't make minimum wage through your tips, you must be compensated. Servers put up with the work because usually it does pay well and the hours are often pretty good. It only pays well if you work your ass off, though.<br><br>Just as a side note, most major restaurant chains in texas no longer apply automatic gratuity. So if you're from there and not a complete dick, ask your server before you stiff them on your $400 dinner party.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yes, clearly, because I've only spent the last two decades traveling and I somehow decided not to eat anything this whole time. There are about a handful of countries in Europe where I haven't spent any time (Faroe Islands, Latvia, Estonia, Georgia, Moldova, and probably some of the tiny ones that I can't even name off the top of my head).<br><br>I've gotten subpar service at times, mostly during busy lunch hours, but it was never flat out bad. That's not to say it can't happen, but in my experience, the service here is exactly the same as it is in the States. I was there about a month ago, and aside from having to pay about twice as much for food on average (higher living standards, I know, but it's still expensive), before the tip, there was no difference in service.</br></br></br></br>  <br> the service blows in europe for example. <br>It doesn't. Not in a way discernible from the United States, at least. I know this because I've lived in 7 European countries for more than 6 months and because I've travelled in the United States for over a year total.<br><br>Both continents have the odd place here and there where the service is absolutely rotten and the waiters stare at you from under their brows, and both have their high-end restaurants with extremely courteous and quick service. And then there are the little family-run places where the service is nothing to complain about, but nothing remarkable either, and every variation of the aforementioned. All in all the service is, on average, the exact same.<br><br>The only difference is that the waiters in the United States actually need the tips to pay their bills and in Europe the tip (or rather the waiters' wages) is paid for in the price of the food. After normalizing purchase powers, eating out in the US costs the same as it does in Europe after you account for the tip.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't tip because you have your paycheck and I'm not going to sponsor you, faggot. unless you impress me somehow, that is. if you don't like it, find a better job</br></br>  I only tip when the service is pleasant. But if the server has a shit attitude, then no. Only give tips to deserving poorfags  <br>And who would serve you food if all the waiters just "found a better job"? Would you go to the kitchen to fetch your meal?</br>  <br>that's basically what you have to do in most places in europe. the service is atrocious.</br>  <br><br>fuck off with your demagogue statements. tipping is not a right, get the fuck over it. you want to make more money, tell your boss to pay you, fucking spineless faggot. if I would receive bad service because I didn't tip, I would never get back to that restaurant and tell everyone I know not to go there</br></br>  <br><br>as a european, I say you're full of shit</br></br>  <br>I went to an outdoor bar and left without paying. I also stole tips out of a tip jar. Those are my thoughts on tipping.</br>  <br>I tip le fedora every day m'lady</br>  A tip, in Europe is a compliment you give the restaurant/waiter for good or exceptional service. It's an optional bonus, not something restaurants should count on. A way to express your gratitude for satisfactory, good or great service.  <br>That's absolute bullshit. You don't get to keep your job as a waiter in Europe if you don't serve your customers. After all, they're paid a proper wage instead of whatever pennies their bosses and customers throw them, like they do in the States.<br><br>I'm  &amp;  so I can claim to know what the fuck I'm talking about.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm not defending tipping, I'm claiming that waiting isn't a job you should just quit to find a "better one" just because your boss and your customers are too cheap to pay for your services.</br>  <br><br>this.<br><br>i am going to sound like a hypocrite because i feel bad that servers only make like $4/hr so i always tip. but YOU woke up one morning and decided to be a server, so YOU know you are making dick money. I deal with this shit at work, people at my office's warehouse bitch left and right about having to do shit and i'm like, don't fucking work in a warehouse. same thing; don't work in a restaurant. <br><br>i have a friend who thrives on it though. if rent is coming up he can pick up a shift and does his little song and dance to his tables and makes enough to pay rent and go out drinking. but that isn't a guarantee, but he acts like he knows it will happen but it doesn't always happen. it's so fucking backwards</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>yes, it is. if, as a customer, I don't get the meal delivered to my table, that means that the restaurant is shit, so I'm never going back. this hurts sales, therefore the owner should make sure the customers are happy. if the waiting staff are not paid well, they will deliver shit service and customers will not be happy. ergo, leaving the job is a valid way to increase quality and your paycheck as a waiter because the restaurant owner would have to deliver the meals themselves if there is no waiting staff. you're a betafag cuckold who cannot stand up for himself if you don't understand that</br></br>  <br>Agreed. Nearly across the board service has been horrible in Europe. I think they need to institute tipping over there. I hear it's coming.</br>  <br> tipping <br>kek</br></br>  <br>My thoughts are shills need to get the fuck off of 4chan.</br>  <br><br>My problem with this image is that I don't know if I'm going to tip until I've already ordered my food. I don't tip just for the sake of tipping, I tip based on service. I feel like the person that made that image probably doesn't get a lot of tips because they're a crabby bitch that will spend 3 hours making images like that and complaining on social media about it, instead of getting me my fucking fries before they're cold, and my bill less than an hour after I've finished my fucking meal.</br></br>  <br>someones seen Resevoir Dogs</br>  <br>What you eurofags and Canadians fail to understand about tipping is that it almost eliminates shitty service (unless you are in a shitty place to begin with). <br>If you don't do a good job, you simply won't be a waiter long. <br>On the other side of the coin, if you do a great job in a good restaurant, the amount of money you can earn far exceeds a "proper wage". <br>I know it's a foreign concept to the socialist "everyone's equal" ways you are used to, but nothing will drive someone to bust their ass like the ability to make more money. <br>You put similar employees in two environments, one which allows tipping, and the other doesn't, and the ones in the tipping environment will outwork the others 10 out of 10 times.</br></br></br></br></br>  I tip, I don't give a flying fuck if you actually need it or not. You provide good service you get a little extra for yourself. About the only way I won't tip is if you fuck up, especially in a blatant way, and make no effort to fix it.<br><br>Pays off in the end because places you frequent will know you're someone worth going the extra mile for. Free shit, better than average quality even if their average is fantastic, plenty of benefits.</br></br>  <br><br>boo fucking hoo<br><br>you want good service, pay your employees a good wage. tipping has nothing to do with it</br></br></br></br>  <br>yes, exactly. this is part of the reason service sucks in europe.</br>  <br>Normal people usually wait for servers to do their job and then judge if wheter they deserve tip or not, why would you tell him to do a shit job at the beginning?</br>  <br>"low food prices" lolololol It's cheaper to go to the grocery and buy dinner than eat out. The truth is tipping became a thing because of big business use it as an excuse not to pay their workers minimum wage and stupid fucking cunts want tips because some can make an easy fortune on tips. My brother was a waiter for several years and made a small fortune and invested his earning and he's fucking rich now all from tips working at a bar &amp; grill. If these cunts want equal pay, they should strike till they get minimum wage and then tips will become a real gratutity, not a fucking replacement for wage.</br>  <br><br>but you've never been in europe, anon</br></br>  <br><br>How can tipping eliminate bad service if the waiter doesn't know if they're even getting a tip until after the service is completed? I mean, if it's custom there I agree, it cuts down on bad service. But to say it almost eliminates it is ridiculous. As long as there are people who hate their job (there's and abundance of these people in the restaurant industry), there will always be shitty service, tipping or no tipping.</br></br>  <br>Any server who's pissed off about somebody who doesn't tip is aiming their anger at the wrong people. Be pissed off at your employer and legislators for making your wage abysmally low, and having to leave you at the mercy of strangers.</br>  <br><br>Commenting about Europe from your moms basement doesn't count anon.<br><br>Try actually going there.<br>The service is great, especially in the small mom&amp;pop places. There is no tipping, it's even considered by some to be an insult.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If someone hates their job and does shitty work, they won't survive on the low wage itself. <br>The statement "waiter doesn't know if they're even getting a tip until after the service is completed" makes no sense. Do you know when you're doing a good job? <br>Of course they know when they are doing a good job, it's not rocket science.</br></br></br>   paramedic saves your life <br>  doesnt give paramedic tip  <br>  "its your job" </br></br>  <br> There is no tipping, it's even considered by some to be an insult. <br><br>this is how you know which of the two continents is full of poorfag peasants and which is full patrician noble restaurant enterpreneurs<br><br>top fucking kek amerilards</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>WTF IS THIS GAME AND HOW DO I FIND IT!?!</br>  <br> If someone hates their job and does shitty work, they won't survive on the low wage itself. <br><br>then find a better job, faggot</br></br></br>  <br>Exactly my point fucknuts<br>Might want to read the history of my debate, and figure out what side I'm on before thoroughly embarrassing yourself again.</br></br>  <br><br>They may know they're doing a good job, that doesn't mean they know that they're getting a tip afterwards. the two are related but just because one happens doesn't mean the other will too.</br></br>  <br><br>except that statement I quoted is not an excuse for tipping, you retard. see <br><br>you expect tipping from customers yet let employers fuck you in the ass like the spineless faggots you are</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>http://www.ulmf.org/bbs/showthread.<wbr>php?t=26107</wbr></br></br>  <br>For the overwhelming majority, they know they will be tipped well. And at the end of the day, their effort is in direct relation to the amount of money they earned.<br>Sometimes people just don't tip well, and it's normally one of two reasons:<br>1. Niggers<br>2. Canadians</br></br></br></br>  <br>yep, that should be /thread<br><br>still you're a faggot for watching CH</br></br></br>  <br>  {Autistic ignore mode activated} </br>  <br><br>in superior european countries, the waiters are paid well and do a good job even if they don't get tipped<br><br>top kek, americunt, land of the free :^)</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>To add to my point, my statement about the waiter not knowing if they're getting a tip until afterward does make sense. Unless the waiter expressly asks the customer if they're tipping, the waiter has no way of knowing if he's getting a tip until the tip has been given. They may expect it, but that doesn't mean they know they're getting it. I don't know what's so hard to understand about that.</br></br></br>  <br>Point being, Europe allows tipping. You tip for exceptional service, whereas in the United States you tip for ANY service, lest you be called an asshole by your peers.<br><br>Do you honestly believe waiters in the States are inclined on working their ass off if they're getting tipped no matter what? I for one would do my best if I were a waiter in Europe, because I'd not only get my normal hourly wage of 10€ (depending on the country, naturally, but this is something you'd earn in Northern Europe) but also the tips I'd land for doing a very good job.<br><br>Of course if you paid waiters three fiddy and didn't have a culture of tipping, they wouldn't really care about keeping their customers happy. In that scenario (and that scenario only) would your argument be functional.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> be delivery boy <br>This is me so hard haha</br></br>  <br><br>Idk what you're talking about. I live in Canada and the people here tip just fine. In fact I've heard complaints about Americans tipping from some of my restaurant friends. Maybe it's travelers and not exclusively Canadians or Americans?</br></br>  I work as a waiter (UK) and I don't get any tips. Anybody that tips the money just goes straight to the boss. I'm not paid minimum wage either.  I generally tip waiters and waitresses, because there is a large degree of variable service among staff at restaurants. When you go out to eat, you are mostly paying for the service. I have had exceptional waiters that made my night, and I have had dogshit waiters that made me miserable. I don't have any problem compensating them for going above and beyond what their job required of them.<br><br>That being said, delivery boys and bartenders can go fuck themselves. I'm not tipping you for driving to my house, or popping the top off a fucking bottle. Half the bartenders in NYC are assholes anyways, so I've never felt an ounce of remorse about it. <br><br>The bottom line is that your finances are not my concern, and anyone is perfectly within their right to simply pay for the cost of the meal and leave. If you decide to treat them poorly because of that (for example, ignoring them or spitting in their food) you are perpetuating the problem and are a worthless horseshit employee who doesn't deserve an extra cent.<br><br>Get over yourselves service workers. Your jobs are not that hard.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They don't get tipped no matter what, which is base of my entire argument. In your environment they do, so you could actually take your statement and apply it to yourself<br> You get tipped according to your work. A kick ass waiter has the potential to make far more money than a shitty one. <br>I really don't understand why this is so hard to grasp.</br></br></br>  <br>What part of Canada? Does all of Canada tip? Canadians are infamous for being shit tippers here. Maybe it's just certain parts. I'm in Florida BTW, lots of Canadians some here.</br>  <br>If your boss had to pay you more then food prices would be higher, so you are paying either way.</br>  <br><br>Have tipping, but give people the option of cutting out the waitress all together and being allowed to order and get their own food.<br><br>How is this not the logical choice? At the door they ask, "would you like waitstaff provided this evening? there will be an additional gratuity added to your bill if you choose this." Then the consumer can decide if it's worth it.<br><br>There problem solved.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   mfw when i live in australia and am not expected to pay someone else's wage so that their employer doesn't have to   I've known a lot of servers, baristas, etc...<br><br>With tips, they usually make 12-15 an hour, which is good money, and they never pay taxes on the tips.<br><br>Every single one of them will still be like "I only make $3.50 an hour".<br><br>So no, I don't feel bad not tipping. I've lived off of $7.50 an hour, no tips, and done fine.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  They earn more money than me, waaah. Doesn't matter if they work harder <br>  Democrat detected </br></br>  <br><br>I should say that I tip sometimes. Places I go a lot, especially bars, get at least 20% from me. This is because if I'm going to be going there multiple times, I don't want them recognizing me as a "non-tipper" and spitting in my food or something.<br><br>I tip for three reasons - To avoid bad service (most of the time), to reward good service (some of the time), or if I'm on a date and don't want to appear cheap (some of the time).</br></br></br></br>  <br>You do pay taxes on the tips. In fact, if you don't tip, they are paying taxes on what the government assumes you are tipping</br>  Why aren't we tipping the chefs directly?<br><br>Anyone can grab a plate of food and bring it to a table. Why do I have to pat someone on the head for doing that?<br><br>I'd much rather go to the chefs and tip them if it was a fucking awesome meal. At least that takes a real skill.<br><br>Seriously, I have a coffee pot at my house, I know how to refill coffee thank you.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I do my tip exactly right. Sometimes I use a calculator. I usually give 10% at diners and 25% at nice restaurants. I've noticed that motherfuckers still complain about tips not being enough. Some bitch at waffle house had the nerve to get on to me about a 10% tip once and I'm like bitch, what do you expect? She was upset that I was her only customer that night and I said so just because your job isn't getting any business, you take it out on your only customer. maybe you need to get a new job then and quit blaming the only fucker that gave you money this evening and she said she quits and walked out in front of the other employees and they all said they were so sorry. the other time, I gave this waiter who by the way was flaming a 25% tip, you couldsee it on his face that he was upset and he just acted like a dick, then he came back to the table with my card and said for you information, we tip 25% at this establishment right in front of my date. I told my date excuse me and got up and walked towards the managers office and just walked in on him and he said sir may i help you and i said yes, blain here tells me that I have undertipped me and embarrassed me in front of my date. my ticket says this amount so 25% from this amount is this and that is what I gave him. the manager said than kyou for informing me of this and refunded our money and then fired blain, and he yelled at this manger saying that this was against his civil rights, you can;t fire me. big scene at restaurant.  <br>Tipping is wrong, if you tip you are enabling evil money mongering tactics used by restaurants. If we all stopped tipping they would have to pay their employees more.</br>  <br>wat? No you don't. Tips are cash, and no one reports them as income.</br>  <br>Literally not what he said, but nice try anon.<br><br><br>I worked waitstaff, I never fucking paid taxes on it, it was all under the table. Everyone knows this is true, stop acting like waiters claim their tips, the never do because it's a goddamned nightmare.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But you DO get tipped in Europe as well, and not just by tourists from the US. I know this because fuck, I've lived in Europe for 25 years, eating out three or four times a week in the past 7 years. I'm also dating a former waiter who can confirm that they get tipped. In addition to the 10€/h pay.<br><br>Even here a kick-ass waiter has the potential to make more money that a shitty one. It's not like your wages are predetermined by the government. An employer can choose to pay a better waiter more money hourly or they can choose to give them bonuses, whichever style they prefer. Or hell, they can just fire a shitty waiter. That way the shitty waiter earns nothing for their shit work.<br><br><br>Because the chefs already get paid a normal wage. Sure, I'd prefer to tip the chef personally (that's why some European places actually have a shared tip pool, which is then added to the pay of everyone working the shift, including the chefs), but since tipping is really a thing simply because waiters would live on the streets if it weren't for tips, the money is given to them.<br><br><br>This I agree on.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> needing a calculator to find 10% or 25% of a number <br><br>/b/ for you</br></br></br>  waiters are the most self-important and entitled people out there. Your job is to literally take thing to and from tables. This is a job that anyone can do, which means you are not a valuable worker. How much you make directly correlates to your skill level. Your sense of self entitlement doesn't factor into that. You deserve to make just enough to survive like a Mexican with 10 roommates in a 1 bedroom apartment. Because then maybe you'll be motivated to do whatever it takes to increase your skill set and be employable. I'm not going to enable your failure mentality by throwing you some money because you were able to bring my plate of food to the table without falling on your ass.  <br>Love it. Sounds exactly what an entitled faggot would do.</br>  <br>I'm not a fan of tipping but it is pretty much a requirement for anything service based here in Las Vegas.</br>  <br>...that's what they are there for? who wants do do math on a napkin? not all of us are fucking vulcan faggot.</br>  <br>You must be a special kind of retarded. 10 20 and 25 percent are super easy to calculate in your head.</br>  <br>I guess it boils down to perspective. Seems to me people who don't consider themselves to be high achievers are anti-tip. They just want the "norm" and "fair" - IE Countries with socialistic mentalities.</br>  <br>You're a fucking tard, to find 10% of any number to literally move the fucking decimal point over once.<br><br>$32.41 &gt; $3.24<br><br>$79.81 &gt; $7.98<br><br>If you want 25% you just multiply that by two and add half of the original 10%. fucking tardbos</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>fucking tard, see </br>  <br>literally more than I have ever learned in a math class. Thanks anon</br>  <br>Companies should pay their employees appropriately for the work they preform. Those that rely on tips to survive are basically the nobility of beggars. You have to interact with them, they have to present you with a smile and gracious nature or you will suddenly begin to question what to tip them. Instead of presenting some sob story for change they just have to act like a slave for a bit and you give them money. I think tipping should never be an obligation. I say this though I've not tipped a handful of times, and pander to the system at hand for the people that are in a situation that need it. As for the picture, that's bullshit. You tell someone at the start that you are not a tipper and your chance of being a victim of food poisoning just went up. If you don't tip, don't. If everyone stopped tipping it would force the food industry to rethink the way they do business.</br>  <br>Actually, poor people (that would be to say "underachievers") are more keen to tip and to give money to charity.<br><br>Socialist countries also give more money per capita to aiding those in need.</br></br></br>  I use a five star system. Each star is 5%. This means a tip of up to 25%. <br>The first is friendly. Smile when you talk to me and that's already a 5% tip if nothing else.<br>If your restaurant has free refill on soda, my glass should never be empty. 10%<br>Helpful. Different from friendly, I generally have questions about the menu, so be sure to answer them fully. Also, give me tips on what's good and what's not. 15%<br>Is my food hot (or cold, whichever it should be) when I get it? This message you brought it out as soon as it was ready. If not, do you take it back without complaint? 20%<br>Something extra. This is hard to describe and very rarely achieved. Did you do something to go above and beyond everything else? If so, you just got a potential for a 25% tip. <br>With this system, I usually tip 15-20% usually missing the sending extra and a full drink.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm <br><br>I think people should be rewarded for being excellent at a skill, not just because they're underpaid.<br><br>The chef deserves a reward, for one thing it is way more exhausting being a chef, sure you don't have to deal with customers, but your entire job is based around cranking out the highest quality in the shortest amount of time. That's why being a line cook has been considered the most stressful job in numerous surveys, even beating out hear surgeons.<br><br>The second thing that frustrates me is that waitstaff is not optional. I do not get to choose to get my food or not (and on a side note, yes I tip, generously even, and am very courteous at restaurants, I'm the guy who wipes up his crumbs on the table and stacks plates for the staff at the end of a meal). I think if people were just more thoughtful we wouldn't even need waitstaff, since we can get our own food, or at least their jobs would be rolled into being janitors and sweeping up after.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So what the fuck is the point of that? Are you anti tipping and wanna be a cunt or do you think that is just a reasonable amount to leave everyone regardless of whether the service was hood or bad?</br>  <br>But what happens if I don't tip bad waiters/waitresses? How could I know they are bad until after the meal is over?</br>  <br><br>FUCK YOU JEW FAGGOT. GO FUCK YOUR FUGLY GIRLFRIEND AND LIVE OFF THE GOVERNMENT JEW NIGGER&gt;</br></br>  <br><br> hear surgeons <br><br>Meant to say, HEART surgeons.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> If you want 25% you just multiply that by two and add half of the original 10%. fucking tardbos <br><br>oh sure and while im at it ill just add the square root by the pyhagorus theory</br></br></br></br>  <br>If you honestly can't divide a number by two or add two numbers together you seriously shouldn't be driving because you must have some retardation.</br>  <br>I never brought "poor" into this, talking about work ethic.<br>Read into shit much?<br>  Socialist countries also give more money per capita to aiding those in need. <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World<wbr>_Giving_Index</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>This</br>  <br>Exactly this, I will tip if the service was good if it was crap or I had some moody hung over bitch serving me fuck right off am I tipping</br>  <br><br> call someone a deadbeat that lives off the government <br> has no idea how to do percentages <br><br>Is it hard deciding what part of your welfare check goes to food when you can't even do basic math?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can afford a three thousand dollars shirt. I just don't buy it.</br>  <br><br>Between the two of these comments, I lost it. Both were topkek</br></br>  <br>I always give ladies the tip if you know what i mean :^)</br>  <br><br>No waiter or bartender I've ever known has ever claimed a fucking cent of their tips. Do people do this? It's totally unnecessary and you pay more in tax for no reason.</br></br>  <br><br>Dolls don't count anon</br></br>  <br><br>No, they don't. He's just a rertard</br></br>  <br><br>While agree that cooks work way harder than the waitstaff, I have to say i think the waiters should get the majority of the tipout (if it's shared). I tip the waiter for the service, and i pay my bill for the food.</br></br>  <br>Why do people always try to make these threads about minimum wage? Servers, bartenders, delivery guys, and anyone else who works a tipped job, is not showing up for minimum wage. Pizza delivery people are making $15 an hour on a slow day. Bartenders probably do better, and servers (especially in high end places) do even better. So tip, or don't tip, but this isn't about minimum wage</br>  <br><br><br>No, they don't.<br><br>It's just like, did you know you can actually claim your gambling losses on your taxes and get a refund? Well you can, bu what's the catch? You have to claim your winnings too.<br><br>See, waiters complain that they make $3.00 an hour, which is generally not true anyway as employers in MOST states have to pay you at least their state minimum wage, but waiters only have to claim whats on their W-2 which reflects a lower wage.<br><br>So essentially, even if a waiter did make $3.00 an hour, with tips they might be making around $12 or so? so, not bad, but then they're turning around and claiming to the government that they only make 3 so they pay lower taxes. So in reality waiters are making even more than whatever they do per hour since THE REST OF US pay taxes on our shit.<br><br>This is why waitstaff should at least be optional in all restaurants.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I tipped this waitress one time and she fell real bad. The tray fell out of her hands and there was a huge mess. I never did it again since then.</br>  <br>Tips are only able to be unreported if they are in cash. Many tips today are written in on the credit card receipt, in which case they automatically show up in your W-2 and are taxed</br>  tipping is polite  <br>I'm a server and bartender and this is completely not true or is not in practice</br>  ITT: neckbeards with no job who can't afford to tip when taking their pony figures out to friendly's  <br>Because they are underachievers, and will always look at the worst case scenario.</br>  <br>I'd have the balls to tell the waiter that he's being fucked over by the minimum wage laws and that he should lobby or protest to receive the minimum wage he deserves. <br><br>It's not his fault. It's the legislators or the individual company's fault. It's not my fault either. <br><br>Also, i'd tip if there was a specific reason to tip such as a witty waiter/waitress that made our meal more enjoyable but being expected to tip, even under minimal service is not my problem.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Butthurt waiter who's shitty, low-paying job emasculates and humiliates him by making him beg for strangers' money.<br><br>If you want handouts so bad, why not just be a bum?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Seriously, i wish my teachers had just laid shit out like this and called people tardboy. Learning with /b/!</br>  <br>I wipe your garlic bread on my nuts</br>  I don't tip because I'm a cheap fuck. I'm not ashamed. When there's an exploitable system, you're a fool not to take advantage of it. <br><br>Bracing for butthurt.</br></br>  <br>Agreed</br>  In the United States there are two distinct groups of people who do not tip, niggers and children. Which one are you?  <br><br>I see pubic hair, call the manager, make a shitstorm so hard I get a free meal and you get fired. that sure showed me</br></br>  Can we talk about the reality here which is that no matter how much you pay waiters to do their job, they will always feel entitled to a tip.<br><br>I don't care if they're making $30 an hour, they'll still gladly come to you at the end of the meal, smiling, with hands open expecting your money. No matter how much pressure we put on the bosses to pay more, waiters will always feel like they "earned" a tip just because they did their job.<br><br>Their only justification for tipping is, "Why tip? Well because we tip, that's why!"</br></br></br></br>  <br>This. Eurofag here - If the service is good and I'm happy with food, drinks etc - I tip. If not, I don't. As simple as that. <br>I do understand that those people are working at minimum wage, but I can't make everyone happy. Besides, I did not force them to take this job</br></br>  <br>You're a servant. You have no balls you neutered faggot</br>  <br>Dude I know you think your being helpful but no one gives a shit about you wiping up your crumbs and servers actually hate people who stack there plates for them, it's not helpful, it makes clearing more awkward. Its a restaurant not your friends house.</br>  As a European, I don't tip. If I tip one person, they other person will feel bad, and how fair is that? <br>Unless it's a Muslim, I will tip a Muslim because I fear the Muslim and will do anything not to offend him.<br>I have a jealously of Americans that can't be put into words, oh, I love they savory flavor of cock. <br>Cheers</br></br></br>  <br>not a waiter. but i actually have money to tip. nice try though</br>  <br> Tips for good service are now handouts <br>Wow, man, lay off the Fox a little.</br></br>  People who don't tip at the cafe I work at tend to be the whiny rich little hitches, the kind that give complex orders, say they are in a rush, then sit down to eat. I worked at a junior college and then at cafe near a retirement community in a wealthy area. One of those places tipped well, the other got angry when I pointed at the self serve drink cooler.  <br>Don't forget Canadians</br>  <br>I work in an upscale restaurant, and before I started working there I always thought to myself, "Tipping is optional. Fuck them."<br><br>But not anymore.<br><br>Unless/until you work in a restaurant, you have no idea what goes on behind the scenes to get your meal from the kitchen to your table. It's a shitload of moving parts, sometimes utter chaos.<br><br>And we don't even take home the entirety of the tip you leave. We're left with a portion after we tip out the food runners, bussers, etc. <br><br>You don't need to tip 20% every time you go out, and certainly not if the service is bad. But 12-15% is absolutely necessary if you'd like to dine out and have your every food need met.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is complete and utter bullshit. We get minimum wage and we walk with a portion of whatever tips we made that day.</br>  <br>Not only does the World Giving Index coincide with the amount of "socialism" (like true safety nets in the form of unemployment benefits, free or inexpensive healthcare and so forth, not the self-announced socialism of China and Russia), it also goes hand in hand with the GDP. Finland and Sweden are extremely socialist in this sense, and they give more money and labor to charity than more capitalistic France. The US, UK and Australia are near the top because of a solid economy with high GDP, but they also have safety nets for people falling out of the system (just not as well-covering as those in Northern Europe). If you claim the US is not "socialist" in this sense despite Obamacare and similar other recent advancements, you'd be still stuck in Cold War era rhetoric.<br><br>Myanmar is the world capital of Buddhism, that's why they're at the very top, and despite being a relatively poor country, they have a very strong mentality of helping the poor and the weak.</br></br></br>  <br>  advancements </br>  <br><br><br> I deserve extra for doing my job <br><br>And I'm guessing you tip the mailman, garbage man, construction workers, electricians, cashiers, anyone who helps you find stuff at a store, plumber etc. etc.<br><br>and before you pull this "But we're paid so little!" why aren't you shitting on your bosses? Why is it the consumers job to augment your pay? You KNEW this was how it was when you got hired so why are you bemoaning it now, and at the wrong people even!?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A tip of my fedora HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH :^)))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))<wbr>)</wbr></br>  <br> Doesn't tip <br> Gets booty blasted when someone messes with his food or ignores him.  <br>Tips exist for a reason man. If you are gonna stiff me at a bar, I'm gonna remember your face and tell all my co-workers to ignore you. I can always just tell my boss we were too busy.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Then fuck you too, you don't appreciate when I make the effort to try and make your life a little easier, I wont pay you more for doing your fucking job you already get paid for.</br></br>  as someone who worked in catering for like 10 years i always thought it was fucked up how the boss paid us shit wages and expected the customer to make it up<br><br>i hardly ever saw tips anyway. most bosses had a tip stash, then would dole it out to those they deemed worthy of tip reward. it was obvious they'd keep like half for themselves</br></br>  <br>It's good money if you're working doubles 4-5 days a week, and it's in season. Right now it's out of season so we're not walking with the same money we would've made in, say, March.</br>  I've always wondered what to tip the pizza delivery guy. I generally tip between $2-$4 for a pizza. and that's on top of the $2 they already include for the delivery (pizza hut). So what is proper tip for delivery?  Business owners tend to use the forecasted tip when they're making their payroll. I know a guy used to work in a diner. The diner payed around $5 an hour from actual sales, the difference was made up in tips. They only paid minimum wage if tips didn't add up.  <br>Subjective, of course, but I consider socialism an advancement. Human happiness is, to me, more important than limitless freedom. Funny how the US has neither.<br><br><br>Waiters deserve NORMAL PAY for their work. Right now they are docked that because of the culture of tipping. Employers can't be assed to pay when they can make the customers responsible for that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>As  said credit card tips are claimed automatically and most restuarants do about 70 to 90 % of sales in credit cards. And you are right most servers don't claim the cash unless they need to prove they make money for a loan or apartment.</br>  <br><br><br> waiter gives shitty service <br> gets stiffed <br> IMMA POST THIS TO FACEBOOK AND TALK ABOUT WHAT ASSHOLES PEOPLE WHO DON'T TIP ARE <br><br>Every. Time. Oh, but don't call out the waiter on their performance of their job; because we all know ALL waiters give fucking immaculate service all the time. That waitress who got stiffed on her tip? She was probably giving the customer fucking foot rubs and back massages too!<br><br>Fuck you cry babies.<br><br>Get a skill, or learn a trade, and get a real job. And if you're in college, fucking tough it out, we ALL had shitty jobs before we made it, stop bitching like life is especially hard for you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How much you tip is up to you, but the delivery charge goes to the store, not the driver. The delivery charge exists for one reason only, so that they can advertise ate one price, and charge you a higher price</br>  <br>Got news for ya my high-brow friend. The reason America became as powerful as it did, was capitalism. So peddle your pro-socialist BS elsewhere. <br>While the US is creeping towards socialism with Obamacare, it wasn't because it was the will of the people. In fact, it was overwhelmingly unpopular and pushed on us by wonderful progressives who think they know how best to run our lives. That will change soon though.</br></br>  restaurants don't want to pay their employees a decent wage. tips help a lot. i work at wendy's while going to school, and i'm jealous of those who work at dunkin donuts. my buddy works there and he says with tips, they get $12 an hour, and compared to my $9.50, that sounds pretty nice. and don't say, "well why don't the higher ups just pay you more?" we've been trying but they don't budge. so tips help us. and then there's the people who think, "fast food workers are idiots. why don't they just get better jobs?" here's what i say to that, "Get a job? Get a job? Lemme just put on my job helmet, get into my job cannon, and fire myself to jobbie land, where jobs grow on jobbies!" there are no jobs! i've applied to warehouses and companies, but unless i have some sort of degree or training, it's not happening. so please, just tip, because if they got rid of tipping, you'd probably end up paying more on your bill  <br>it's for 3rd world countries, where workers get paid nothing, and have no rights or unions.<br><br>I don't tip - because I don't go to the 3rd world.</br></br></br>  <br> No one tips server. <br> They all go to their boss to make up the difference. <br> Boss is losing money because he has to pay his servers more. <br> Food prices go up <br> All these no tipping retards complain about rising food price </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this</br>  If you work a shit job, you get a shit pay.  <br>America got to where it did because we didn't get fucked in the world wars.</br>  <br> Right now they are docked that because of the culture of tipping. <br><br>THIS IS NOT TRUE IN ALL STATES.

How? By plundering other countries, because that's all fine and good in the world of capitalism. Do I need to remind you of their policy of slavery, imperialism, partaking in wars that are none of their business just to get the extra buck from selling arms and fuel to both factions and the current trend of having wage slaves in third world countries, essentially robbing those countries of their labor force?<br><br><br> assuming everyone on 4chan is from the States <br>I don't need to petition my local government because things run pretty well around here.

Ask me anything. I might take some pics and do a new thread later, or I might not.  Fuck off   New USA FLAG <br>  Prove me wrong. (Pro tip: You can't.) </br>  <br>Pro tip: I can</br>  ok  <br>Something happens in murrca: yurropleb circlejerk<br>Something happens in yurro: nobody cares</br></br>  <br>Thats pretty gay, fag</br>  <br>this is factually wrong see </br>  <br>/thread</br>  Yesterday called, it wants its b8 back  All these anti gay marriage threads and I have yet to see one argument against it. Basically it's "Stop liking what I don't like". I'm not gay, liveral, or an sjw but who really cares about something so trivial?    <br><br> Cherry-picking your own sources, still can't provide statistical data <br><br>Keep dodging the bullet :^)</br></br></br></br>  <br>The third reich did fail because they flaunted their dick at everyone. Then everyone bombed,steam rolled and raped them to submission.<br><br>The Romans were brought down by corruption, the Christian religion, and most of all like the US now, because the elites are being, assholes to the population. If you're not given anything to fight for and you lose your identity as a country or have the same stake as everyone in the top tier there's no need to strive and fight for that country. Mongolians because of the plague and they were nomadic illiterate fucks. The Spanish mainly greed, and the catholic religion held them back( that iswhy latin america is shit, I am catholic btw) The French well the fought 2 world wars, and got dick fucked. The British well they were assholes to everyone and after WW2 they had to give up their colonies so the US pardoned a lot of their war debt, or else it would've made britain pay their war debts until 2050.</br></br></br>  A moment of silence for a fallen enemy. To get things of of the way - I'm not American, I'm not religious and my political views are those of communism (not the gay shit that millennials spread around, the true cold war era soviet worker's communism). It doesn't matter which country I'm from, just a former member of the CCCP. America has always been our enemy, but it has also been a worthy foe, a foe which fights for what it believes in and isn't afraid to call out others on their bullshit, an enemy which had always stood for tradition, values and heritage. And no where was that more evident than the south.When I think America I don't imagine fat stupid corporate billionaires, I don't imagine corporate people who want everyone to be happy and no one to feel discriminated so they would buy more products. I imagine proud southern people, people who aren't afraid to speak out against the cancer that is spreading on the planet. The cancer of the "oppressed". You know, we aren't so different , we both agree that in order to exist a person must follow certain number of unwritten rules, and that just because someone "feels" different that doesn't allow them to spread their cancer on an established society.<br> But sadly here we are. My ideal union fell apart years ago, and now thanks to the disease that is the European union, the cancer is reaching even our states, regardless of the fact that most of us still identify more with Russia than the central European cancer factories. And now even the mighty south has fallen, in one swift move your "government" has banned a symbol of pride and honour for the real Americans and has defiled the sanctity of marriage. Uncontrolled and uncertain things like feelings and insecurities are going to control your lives and the land your children grow up in, and that is a fate I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy.<br>A moment of silence for you USA, you were a worthy adversary.</br></br>  I like your words <br><br>I'm from this cancerous European union btw</br></br>  black men are more popular with white women now than every before.<br><br>how does it make you feel?</br></br>  <br>women love this<br> pic related </br></br>  <br>I don't know if dick size correlates with anything. But I do have a huge dick and I am black so then again wtf do I know.</br>  <br>heres a baby nigglet</br>  Weird pics thread      <br>Why would you do this to yourself!?</br>  No trap thread?
