For the sake of your country and for the good of the free world it leads, please vote for presidential candidate Bernie Sanders in 2016! I've never felt so passionately about a 73 year old Jewish man from Brooklyn, let alone anyone in American politics. As a Dutchman, I am confident this man will restore your country to it's former glory, with true, fundamental reforms. Universal healthcare, fair taxes for both the rich AND the poor, the revival of the middle class, curtailing of the power of lobbyists and the mega corporations they serve (no more super PAC's; voters should decide an election, not the amount of money pumped into a campaign, powerful friends or media bias), free college tuition, a raise of the minimum wage to 15 dollars an hour at the very least, a renaissance of American infrastructure creating good roads and bridges and millions of jobs in the process.<br><br>Sanders finances his campaign solely through small public donations from ten of thousands of ordinary supporters. The man is brave, honest and true. Please, look into him at the very least:<br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/UsWf0TuM6AA  [ ]<br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/sKpMB_kW35I  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Bump for the good of America and all of humanity.  <br>This man can save America #feelthebern</br>  <br>He won't just save it, he'll make it greater than it ever was. He won't just revive America, he'll bring a renaissance.<br><br>I know that sounds stupid and vapidly idealistic, but I truly believe it.</br></br></br>  <br>omg that makes him look like the Crypt Keeper</br>  Anyone in this thread is kidding themselves  <br>You've let the recession choke your idealism. This man has a track record of integrity, independence and sweet juicy righteousness. Just listen to him, it's all I'm asking, please.</br>  Aussiefag here. Seriously fucking vote for this guy.  No one in America will vote for a socialist. Especially a socialist who seeks to raise taxes, nullify NAFTA and TPP, and who gets their support from foreigners.  Rand PauP 2016!  <br>Have you ever asked yourself what socialism is? and he's a democratic socialist, mind you. What about socialism do you hate specifically? I think the cold war has made you wary of the term, and the effects are still showing. Bernie seeks to raise taxes on the very wealthy (who have only gotten wealthier since the 70's, while everyone else was declining) as well as close loopholes multi-nationals use to not pay a dime in taxes.<br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/BFAq-4Vv5c0  [ ]</br></br></br>  Bump. FEEL THE BERN!  <br>A democratic socialist is still that. I've watched sanders on the daily show and some other news program. I'm not "wary of the Cold War" because I never lived it. Bernie simply doesn't have enough money to run a campaign in the U.S. American business lobbyists will simply not allow him to be elected because of his thoughts on wealth distribution and where jobs should be. Cheap labor doesn't exist in the U.S. but Bernie seems to think that businesses are willing to pay a person $15 an hour to work a register or $19 an hour for a skilled factory worker when they can go to Mexico and pay the workers a dollar fifty for the same job. Again, Bernie will lose in the democratic primary to Hilary Clinton because she actually knows about American Fiscal issues</br>  <br>Look into democratic socialism, as opposed to untempered socialism. You won't find Lenin, you won't find Marx, you'll find universal healthcare, proper treatment of veterans, fair taxes, and in general some of the happiest countries on the planet.<br><br>When I said that you were wary because of the cold war, it's because I believe that it has turned socialism into a bad word. into an insult, while many don't even know what socialists believe.<br><br>All you're giving is practical considerations. Fundamentally, Sanders has it right. <br><br> Bernie simply doesn't have enough money to run a campaign in the U.S. American business lobbyists will simply not allow him to be elected because of his thoughts on wealth distribution and where jobs should be. <br><br>People should chose their leaders, if that's not the way it is, the last thing you should do is bow down to however has stolen the reigns of your fucking country.<br><br>And as for cheap labor, companies make billions in profits, they can afford to pay their workers more. It won't bankrupt them. Do you even know how much of a profit margin there is on a pair of jeans? on an iphone?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Bernie simply doesn't have enough money to run a campaign in the U.S. <br><br>People keep saying this. As if they're fine with the only people getting to run for anything being the people billionaires pick and choose.<br><br>Can't never could.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm in America. I'm voting for Bernie.</br>  <br> &gt;When I said that you were wary because of the cold war, it's because I believe that it has turned socialism into a bad word. into an insult, while many don't even know what socialists believe. <br>To be fair, the rise of neoconservatives and moral majority politics didn't exactly help socialism's image in America, either.</br></br>  I would worry about your own country. Americans simply are "rugged individualists" and don't care about their citizens unless they contribute something of worth to society. Also people in charge are people also and as long as they don't infringe on our rights they're fine.  <br>I really can't tell if this whole thing is a troll thread or not.<br><br>If so, 9/10, made me mad</br></br></br>  <br> Americans simply are "rugged individualists" and don't care about their citizens unless they contribute something of worth to society <br>You mean the basic precepts of capitalism?<br> &gt;Also people in charge are people also and as long as they don't infringe on our rights they're fine. <br>That depends on the context of "in charge." Does that mean in charge of the country, or in charge of private interests and businesses? If it's the former, it's because they're obliged to attempt to care about people and the potential infringement of rights; if it's the latter, they're not obliged to give a shit about anybody's rights, so long as they don't impact profits and aren't flagrantly abused in a public setting.</br></br></br></br>  Bump. Only real candidate  <br>Damn straight</br>  <br> Amerifriends <br>stopped reading</br></br>    <br>Well, that's not the socialists fault either eh?<br><br>I do worry about my own country, my country has a population of 17 million. We are just riding the waves America makes in the world economy. If America does poorly, we suffer, if america flourishes, so do we. <br><br>And when did individualism start to mean that you didn't care about others at all? America was always individualist, but it was never about callous disregard for ones fellow man. <br><br>The people in charge should be their to serve the good of those who elect them, not to serve their own agenda. That's the entire purpose of democracy. Are you really fine with the decline America has seen? Are you really okay with the homeless epidemic? With the bottom 50% of people owning just 2% of the wealth?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Bernie is the only candidate who won't keep running this country into the ground in the name of corporations and banks.  I don't always speak sincerely on 4chan, but when I do, it's to endorse Bernie Sanders.  All those deodorants are the reason children are dying  <br>dave thomas makes the best hamburgers</br>  Bernie seeks to have an a America where regardless of worth to society people are all special snowflakes and everyone is the same and there is no insentive to do anything for the elite of society. We would become just like Greece.    i will vote for bernie over billary any day of the millennium.  <br> implying i would vote for a jew </br>  Bernie 2016  <br>Sincerity bump</br>  <br>I challenge you to find me a source for that. No way in hell he said that or anything along those lines.</br>  This is for the OP. Kankermongool.  <br>as of america hasn't suffered enough at the hands of a jew names bernie</br>  <br>Some people are clueless, probably watches fox news</br>  Jew? Brooklyn? His ass will be assassinated during the inaugural address, because 'Murica    <br>you democrats better not fuck this up, I swear if you hippy fucks nominate Clinton over this guy you are no better than dipshit asshole republicans. Don't be fuckin dumb democrats, vote for Bernie</br>  I really hope Bernie wins. He's the only candidate that seems to care about America and the middle class.  <br>You are literally retarded. It's not a quote.</br>  <br>That's communism. He wants make it so that no matter who your parents are, you can become a great man if you are talented and work hard. A decent standard of living for everyone. There will still be very rich people, and some people will be poor, there just won't be as much of either group.</br>  <br>Probably</br>  <br>Is bernie paying moot to make these robotic posts?</br>    Going a little off topic here, but I want to hear /b/'s insight to this.<br>The powerful elite supposedly destroying this country with their corporate greed and such, to what end are they working towards?<br>In the end, they too are Americans (most of them) and I assume the lure of wealth and power for them is so they can enjoy the finest things this country has to offer. They are after all, just human beings. Mansions, fast cars, beautiful women etc all the trappings of wealth. But if you've completely destroyed the country in which you live, whats the point? Nobody is going to care about your vast wealth if the American dollar becomes a joke. Nobody is gonna care about your Ferrari when people are scrounging for food in the streets. Whats the point of being king, if youre king of a shit pile? Whats the point of a billion dollars if nobody places any faith in your currency anymore?<br>Shouldn't these people above all else want to PROTECT the country that affords them these luxuries, the country that makes all their hard work mean something? The country that gives value to those dollars theyve spent their whole life chasing?</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Well, that's not the socialists fault either eh? <br>No, it's not, but socialism has had an uphill struggle ever since it began being associated with anti-patriotic rhetoric and underwent several decades of absolute incomprehension by the American populace. As a traditionally capitalist country, the only way the U.S. can feasibly transition into something of a Democratic Socialist system is for a near-collapse of the market, and the conviction of several hundred extremely wealthy people towards charitability in the form of either taxation or privately funded social programs that the people later nationalize, and willing foot the cost thereof.<br>As it stands, retention of American businesses and domestic investments are the hobbling block of anything even remotely smacking of Socialist policy. Money will fly right out of the country if major companies suspected a significant loss in profits due to regulation, taxation, or disfavor. This country hasn't been honestly democratic in decades, and the globalized economy proves that.</br></br></br>  <br>I didn't say it was. Still doesn't mean I don't want to know what you are basing such a retarded claim on. Do you seriously think Sanders is asking for a 90% corporate tax?</br>  <br>Greece is a democratic socialist state. They seem to be doing fine right now right? Right? No one wants to pay for each other. Hell people in poverty in America have it way better than other countries. Does it suck? Yeah. But is it fair? Yes.</br>  <br><br>"Socialism is bad." ~ Every politician being paid by the corporate oligarchy.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Man, you guys sure don't like that Bernie that only exists in your fevered imagination.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Libertarian fantasy economics. Tell us again Rand how we should bring the gold standard back you deluded loon.</br></br>  <br><br>Why do I keep hearing this?</br></br>  <br> Do you seriously think Sanders is asking for a 90% corporate tax? <br><br>A 90 percent tax rate isn't unheard of, even in America. Back in the fifties when America was growing like a mother fucker the top income earners were taxed at about that rate and the country was doing very well. But Republicans like to act like that shit never happened.</br></br></br>  <br>That literally goes against all the major points he makes in his speeches. Don't be petty. <br><br><br><br>You are arguing for total deregulation of free markets with that image, you know that right? We just had a global economic recession due to that shit. And no, while in theory that is true, it is absolutely dumb when it comes to the basic needs people cannot ignore. There are goods like basic healthcare, food, water, shelter that people cannot go without. Not all value is subjective in a practical sense.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;The powerful elite supposedly destroying this country with their corporate greed and such, to what end are they working towards? <br>More money, to invest in their company, their personal coffers, and political lobbying to ensure enough level of deregulation to complete the cycle and make more money.<br>That's a basic oligarchy, Anon. You're arguing against material culture here. You also forget that the vast majority of those powerful elite are going to die relatively soon; what do they care if the country is economically and socially run into the ground, they're covered for it.<br>You use the example of being king of a shit pile; that's exactly the point. Being the richest king of the shit pile still means you're king. You don't have the mentality to put yourself in the place of those elitists.<br>In the culture of success that we've created, it doesn't matter if you're wildly successful and a hundred other people eat shit in lesser positions for it. You won, fuck the little guy. Keep moving up. There's no national fidelity to this sort of material wealth; they could pack up and be billionaires in some other first-world country if they wanted. More profit in other markets. Why should anyone want to protect the country that they reap the luxuries from, when that's more of an obligation than necessary?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Do you really think that a 90% tax will hurt corporations? When a corporation makes billions of dollars, 90% tax still wouldn't hurt them nearly as much as internal corruption and frivolous bonuses do.</br></br>  <br>Yes, it happened, but literally NOBODY paid it, you dense fuck.</br>  <br><br><br><br>this is the only valid point in this thread</br></br></br></br>  <br> Jewish man from Brooklyn <br>They're going all out this election.</br></br>  <br>I hear you. I'm an American and I'm born and raised in New York City, and frankly it's completely ridiculous to me how people have adapted to shit wages and just seeing crazy desperate homeless people everywhere. I can barely go out without somebody begging me for money and yet if I go to the neighborhood I grew up in or almost any random location across Manhattan or the edges of Brooklyn (to name a few) I see the most ridiculous displays of wealth and prosperity. And nobody's fucking happy, I'm almost sure about it. Went to a rich high school, have had rich friends; they're not blissed the fuck out all the time, and meanwhile everyone else is trying to just make fucking rent on declining wages and rising costs. <br><br>The rationale for all this is capitalism and, therefore, reason and fairness, but it isn't reasonable to assume that hardship and inequality for everyone will create sustained social or economic progress (quite the fucking opposite, if history is to be learned from), and, for people who scoff at a 15 dollar minimum wage, McDonalds et al can fucking afford it big time and if you believe it's rational and fair for employers to build enormous profit off the backs of their employees and then go about cycling almost none of that back to them, you have your head up your ass.</br></br></br>  <br><br>He's not a gay trans-gender-neutral fox-kin. They're not going all out just yet.</br></br>  <br> &gt;Greece is a democratic socialist state. They seem to be doing fine right now right? Right?  <br>They fucked up because their pension system was incredibly stupid and corrupt to begin with, on top of their other fiscal irresponsibilities, and now they have no money. They didn't set stringent limitations. Democratic socialism can work effectively if everybody attempts to work at social and economical issues rationally and pragmatically, which is to say it almost never fucking works because of a handful of careerist assholes trying to get the best of a good thing over everybody else.</br></br>  <br> He's not a gay trans-gender-neutral fox-kin <br>How are you so sure about that?</br></br>  <br>Greece is an INSOLVENT decocratic socialist state. Do you expect ANY state at all to do well when it's on the very of bankruptcy?<br><br>Germany, The Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, The UK. All doing fine, never took as much of a beating as america did during the recession. <br><br><br><br>90% private tax perhaps for the very highest brackets of a persons income, and then we're talking rare exceptions too. Never 90% of a company's profits, that'd be just absurd and stupid beyond belief.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Greece is a democratic socialist state. <br><br>It's funny how many Americans consider Greece socialist.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Gee, fuck. Now I'm not so sure.</br></br>  <br>the jews caused the recession</br>  <br> Why do I keep hearing this? <br><br>Someone probably took something out of context as an attack. I guess just making shit up gets a little old sometimes.</br></br></br>  Bernie FTW  <br>Agreed, and even with a 90% taxation, no matter how absurd that sounds, they would still turn a profit of billions in many cases. Still waiting on that source buddy, if you and him are the same guy.</br>  <br> Yes, it happened, but literally NOBODY paid it, you dense fuck. <br><br>So, at what point of my statement did the truth of it make you so pissed off you started calling me names? Was anything I said untrue?</br></br></br>  <br>bernie for a jewish nursing home</br>  <br>And you would consider them...?</br>  <br>the US Government is so far gone and totally corrupted at its core that it dont matter who gets elected president it wont change anything and it wont fix anything,</br>  'nuff said.  <br> Never 90% of a company's profits, that'd be just absurd and stupid beyond belief. <br><br>That's generally why there's brackets. Do I think we need to bring back such a rate? No, not nearly. Does it show that it can be done and the country will more than survive? Hell yeah it does.</br></br></br>  Didnt know he was jewish, looks like trump gets my vote  <br>i second this</br>  Man it is hard being the city on the hill that is America. Everyone always wants to get in our business.  <br>Not a fucking chance I'm voting for a far left Jew. I might as well ask Tumblr to rule the world.</br>  Is there any Republican that isn't going to be a complete joke as a candidate?  <br>you'll ask tumblr to rule the world if you vote for Hillary</br>  <br>Not if you're a libtard.</br>  <br>Thought he was good until I found out he wants us to pay more taxes to the government for bullshit projects.<br><br>Which most ultimatly would be moving us to communism.<br><br>Plus he's a fucking new which makes this funny because conspiracy peeps always saying "Jews re trying to push communism"<br><br>Fuck Bernie and ffffffuuuuuuck yooooouuu!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ditto</br>  <br>trump and his great wall of mexico</br>  <br>She's more facebook. Bernie is tumblr. Maybe Biden will get in and we can vote for myspace.</br>  <br><br>Nope, different guy.<br><br>I mean, I don't want the superbly and excessively rich to just give out their money, but there are way too many loop holes where someone can just avoid paying any taxes.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>You were going to find out eventually, so I decided to mention it right in the opening post. I know it's a big point for many of you for some reason. Please do listen to him at least though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Not if you're a libtard. <br><br>So they're all going to be a complete laughingstock. Noice.</br></br></br>  <br>you guys think people will behave the same, work as hard, produce as much under 90% taxation.<br>I doubt that's true.</br></br>  <br> 2015 <br> trusting a shifty jew </br></br>  A voter for Bernie is a vote for communism.  <br> Which most ultimatly would be moving us to communism. <br><br>Do you know anything about communism? Cause it takes a whole lot more than "higher taxes" to make anything communist.</br></br></br>  <br>They will be to idiots, yes.</br>  <br>He want's companies and rich people to pay more taxes by closing the loopholes they've been exploiting for decades. He's never said anything about more taxes for the working man.</br>  <br>read about the fabian society. implementation of communism will happen at gradual pace</br>  <br>People are not going to be taxed at 90%. Nobody is seriously saying that, especially not Sanders.</br>  If you want America to end up like Greece, vote for this guy.<br><br>I like being able to choose from 18 different kinds of deodorant, so I'll be voting for someone else.</br></br>  <br> you guys think people will behave the same, work as hard, produce as much under 90% taxation. <br> I doubt that's true. <br><br>No, and no one's saying that. What I was getting at was that it's happened and we thrived. We have plenty of room between crazy high and what we actually have.<br><br>And having high taxes does not, and this needs to be repeated a lot for you guys, in any way make things communist.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Did you learn what communism was through a G.W. Bush speech?<br><br>The only issues I have are his "WOMYN NEED FAIR WWWRAGES" talks.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off isiah goldsilvershtein</br>  <br>as if america can afford more debt at this point</br>  <br>Trump is a troll candidate. The fact that he's got any sort of poll numbers shows how retarded America has become.</br>  <br> read about the fabian society. implementation of communism will happen at gradual pace <br><br>What is it about conservatives and the slippery slope? Every time anything changes in the slightest it's "next thing you know everyone's going to be fucking dogs in a gulag!"</br></br></br>  <br>No.</br>  http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates<wbr>/bernie-sanders-believe-candidate-s<wbr>tands-10-issues/</wbr></wbr>  <br>No he's not</br>  <br>Look at this chart and tell me again that your country can keep going the way it has. That it doesn't need major change. Greece collapsed because their government stupidly borrowed to provide the people with a standard of living they couldn't afford. Other European states who didn't do this are fine.</br>  <br>Wow he sounds stupendous. I better put a vote in for this commie.<br><br>I own a business and I enjoy my loopholes you filthy cunt. <br><br>We need less regulations and less restrictions else you don't get extras yourself.<br><br>The better I do the better you do. If you restrict everything it's going to raise the prices on everything including your taxes. I'm sick of working May ass off and handing over shit loads of money to the fucking government for shit I don't and will never use.<br><br>Minimize the government. Let us live happy, wealthy lives. not restricted fuck you at every corner lives.<br><br>You'll pay for voting for him you just can't see past your nose.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How did you even get that from my post?</br>  <br>Well said</br>  <br> you guys think people will behave the same, work as hard, produce as much under 90% taxation. <br> &gt;I doubt that's true. <br> No, and no one's saying that. What I was getting at was that it's happened and we thrived. <br><br>Different times bruh. The economy was bound to expand no matter what through a massive population boom. Can't support it now with this stagnant economy. The government needs to come to grips with it's massive spending problem and operate within it's means instead of asking even more from it's citizens. Sanders appeals to populist morons who think that more government can give them everything they want. He's wrong and they're wrong and it will lead to dire consequences.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Wat?<br><br>Closing the loopholes for taxing the rich wouldn't cause debt, you bumpkin. The US would be able to pay for nearly all the things the common people need if we did this. Imagine roads without potholes, education institutions with adequate funding, better funding for health care -- all programs that are constantly being picked to the bones and thrown away because the costs rise.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're right. We'd better raise taxes.</br>  <br><br>well fucking put.</br></br>  <br> The economy was bound to expand no matter what through a massive population boom. <br><br>You pulled that directly from the inside of your ass.</br></br></br>  <br>He totally is a troll candidate. He supported the Democratic party for the majority of his life. Then decided to go all Colbert to:<br><br>1: Self promote<br>2: Discredit republicans by acting like a moron<br><br>Have you listened to anything he's said or read anything he's written? If you have, how can you take him seriously?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>spend, spend, spend ! i'm the us can afford it.<br><br>btw, in my socialist shithole i cant even get access to cancer drugs, but we'll pay for tranny reassignment surgery<br><br>socialism doesn't work. there is no fucking utopia</br></br></br></br></br>  If you aren't voting for Bernie then you either hate America or you don't understand what's going on.  <br>Even Idra likes Bernie, and that motherfucker hates everybody.</br>  <br>People bitch about the deficit but only want to fuck over the ones with the least to make it up as opposed to taking more from those who have the most. <br><br>Trickle down voodoo economics, none of that shit worked. The rich keep getting richer and the poor are getting poorer.</br></br></br>  My votes going to paul. He stands firm on freedom for the individuals of this country. No I don't give a fuck about abortion. Personally early term abortion under certain circumstances should be allowed but late term I'm board of being prego abortions are not needed.<br><br>Anyway he stands for liberty on ever issue including getting out of foreign conflicts, stopping drones on home land, and reducing the police state.<br><br>He has stood I front of congress numerous times and took up countless hours preaching why we need liberty and not communist police state we are moving into.<br><br>Other than abortion issue which clearly women want to choose to kill their children he should be a sure pick.<br><br>Again fuck Bernie high tax sanders</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hahaha truth.</br>  <br>Nope. You haven't bothered to research anything. Take a look at the years when the top marginal tax rate was that high. Look into it.</br>  <br> If you have, how can you take him seriously? <br><br>The question isn't if we take him seriously. It's if he and the dipshit Teaparty fuckheads take him seriously.<br><br>And they do.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>China and Russia would love this pussyfart</br>  <br>Fuck yeah, Canada. Canadafag here, 4 hour ER wait times for muh FREEEE healthcare.</br>  We dont need some eurofag , whose homelands GNP is based on Tulip exports, to tell us what we need for our country. Fuck you! Go jerk off to a Vincent VanGogh painting!  <br> Take a look at the years when the top marginal tax rate was that high. Look into it. <br><br>I know there was a population boom at the same time. Correlation =/= causation.</br></br></br>  Feel the Bern, bitches. Fuck Hillary, royalty cunt.  <br>Do you have your companies money stashed in the Cayman Islands? Do you have a lawyer (or a team of them) that you hired specifically to find you ways to pay as little tax as possible? If not then you have nothing to fear, it's not the small businesses that are at fault.<br><br> The better I do the better you do. If you restrict everything it's going to raise the prices on everything including your taxes. I'm sick of working May ass off and handing over shit loads of money to the fucking government for shit I don't and will never use. <br><br>With all due respect, you are NOT special. This ancient argument I keep hearing for free markets jungle economics: It won't happen to me. I won't ever need social security. I won't ever need free health care. Bad luck doesn't care how hard you work, a government should remedy that. Everyone deserves a fair chance to make the best out of their lives. That happy wealthy life is just there for a small sliver of the population, who got a good head-start. What will you do if disaster strikes you? Will you stand for the right of the wealthy to wallow in their money while you shiver and starve?</br></br></br></br></br>  Bernie is weak as fuck. We need a strong president who will kick both China and Russia in the balls.  <br>Finally. Someone in this thread with common sense. I would much rather Ron be the one but unfortunately he will never get the chance. Ron Paul is the epitome of being ahead of his time</br>   implying the President has any power <br> implying Congress won't laugh at every single one of his proposals </br>  <br><br>Nigga, I live in the US and had insurance and still waited 3 hours in the ER when I tore my back a few years ago. Your health system is just as bad as ours and we have to pay out of pocket.</br></br>  <br> The question isn't if we take him seriously <br><br>Do you even government? He needs to draw support from people all over the political map to actaully win the presidency. The republican nomination, that's another story. But I don't see how even republicans can take that dolt seriously.<br><br>His rants aren't even coherent or remotely based in reality. "I'll force X to do X or they're FIRED!!"</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Implying there is such a thing as free healthcare </br>  <br>The Dummycrates deserve him.</br>  <br>At least you have the option to pay for better health insurance or pay to go to a better hospital. That's outlawed here. Everyone gets the same shitty service, a socialists dream. That is unless you know someone, then you can skip the line.</br>  <br><br>The economic boom at the time has been attributed to many things.<br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Econo<wbr>mic_history_of_the_United_States#Po<wbr>stwar_prosperity:_1945.E2.80.931973<wbr><br><br>The baby boom was much more likely a result of the economic boom, not the cause of it.</br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>GTFO</br>  <br>Bernie sandpussy the president? Do you think this is a fucking game?</br>  <br> Do you even government? He needs to draw support from people all over the political map to actaully win the presidency. <br><br>Yeah, just like obama and how much support he got from the Red parts of the country. Did you just wake up from an eight year long coma?</br></br></br>  The Bernie will never get elected cuz Americans are too retarded anyway.  <br>You don't need me to do it, that's true. But can you blame me for trying? What happens in America is everyone's business really. You guys are the largest economy on the planet. If you fall, we all fall with you, if you rise, we too climb.</br>  <br>You can't just flip things around for the convenience of your argument. Remember, that was a time before birth control where people didn't have much control over whether they had kids or not. Pretty much fucking = kids. More kids, more consumers. More consumers = more customers. Pretty simple.</br>  <br>Go watch more foxnews</br>  <br><br>i wait for hours at my gp and my oncology appointmemts.<br><br>i'm forced to undergo CT scans regularly because we don't have the MRI resources here.<br><br> mfw i get another cancer because of fucking Ct's constantly. <br><br>Fuck canada, socialism may seem great in theory but it doesn't work</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Implying there is such a thing as free healthcare <br><br>The only people making money off healthcare right now are the insurance companies. Those fuckers who are leaching off a necessity would be right out of business with single payer.</br></br></br>  <br>They aren't a threat you coward.</br>  <br>He pulled a ton of supporters from the middle. Obviously hardcore democrats and republicans are hard to flip. But contrary to what you might think, you can be more than either a republican or democrat in america.</br>  <br> You won't find Lenin, you won't find Marx <br><br>Yes we would. One thing socialists like is their fuckd up leaders</br></br></br>  <br>So because crack heads and heroin fuck ups failed in life I should pay more to the government to restrict my life?<br><br>I cannot express how many of the same homeless scum are out on my streets everyday trying score more crack and heroin.<br><br>I don't need to pay for their treatment . I don't need to babysit them. They make up their own minds in life and make choices they choose. <br><br>You wanna help, maybe you could open up a non profit and waste your life away trying to fix these fucking losers. I'm not gonna go down that path and don't enjoy having you force me down it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You didn't even look at the link:<br><br>"The "Baby Boom" saw a dramatic increase in fertility in the period 1942–1957; it was caused by delayed marriages and childbearing during depression years, a surge in prosperity,a demand for suburban single-family homes..."<br><br>Again:<br><br>"it was caused by... a surge in prosperity"<br><br>Flip that around.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd rather vote another nigger into office or a bitch ass cunt than an open kike</br>  <br>Yea china and Russia can just be ignored, pussy tier leadership is the way, worked wonders for the eurofux</br>  <br>There are still healthcare insurance companies in single payer canada. And they still suck.</br>  <br>Bernie is a piece of shit, I would rather see Donald Trump get elected.</br>  <br>No, I don't. You people make and break the entire world economy. You can't afford to just put the more attractive looking candidate in the drivers seat again, but for your sake and ours.</br>  <br>kek</br>  <br>Top kek, right cause what we really need is another Bush to lie us into wars that don't benefit America.</br>  <br>Conservatards eat Putin's propaganda up with two spoons.<br><br>This is slightly less embarrassing than being impressed by Kim Jong Il stories.</br></br></br>  <br> Holy fuck you're retarded please watch this video before you have children you uneducated fuck https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=3ug<wbr>DU2qNcyg</wbr>  [ ] </br>  Jeb Bush cant melt Sanded Berns  <br>Yet this country is more socialist than it has ever been.</br>  <br>Buy guns if you are scared</br>  <br>so we need bernie</br>  <br>And is financially the worst off it's ever been. Coincidence? I think not.</br>  <br>That's communists. Lenin and Marx were communists. My country is democratic socialist. We have no statues to either.</br>  <br>Hahahah</br>  <br>this guy is too fucking annoying like most other jewtubers</br>  <br>China and Russia are "not a threat"..... this is why Bernie sanders and his left wing fucktards would be the wet dream of China and Russia</br>  <br> I don't need to pay for their treatment . I don't need to babysit them. They make up their own minds in life and make choices they choose. <br><br>So by not putting in anything for public services you think these kinds of problems just, what? They just go away?<br><br>You do not live in a vacuum. The money you make living in this society and enjoying the benefits of having shit like roads and people around you who can fucking read is your responsibility too.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Exactly my point!</br>  <br>Truth</br>  <br> You didn't even look at the link <br> wikipedia <br><br>Please</br></br></br></br>  <br>checked</br>  <br>Nah, we need to undo the socialism.</br>  SANDSTORM 2016: BERN IT DOWN  <br>checkd</br>  <br>Fuck guns, buy CPUs, they win the battles china's winning now</br>  <br>quads in a bernie thread confirm election win</br>  <br>Right because if he gets elected then we will be invaded....you are straight up stupid.</br>  <br>And when some people don't have anything intelligent to say, they throw out words like "Fox News" or "Racist" and think they are unique. You're not unique, just brainwashed. Typical liberal.</br>  <br>checkd for quads</br>  <br> There are still healthcare insurance companies in single payer canada. And they still suck. <br><br>Without insurance in America one health crisis can put you in bankruptcy on the best case. In a position like my mother, let your insurance lapse and no doctor will touch you at all. <br><br>If we can make health insurance less a necessity there'll be less money paying third party non-healthcare professionals to juggle money around.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>this.</br></br></br>  <br>this old kike doesnt stand a chance</br>  Anybody know what Fabian-ism is?

It's not "buy insurance."<br><br>Redistribution of wealth? Dude, they keep cutting taxes on the top guys. That's not an increased distribution of wealth. In the heyday of us being scared of the red menace was when we were really redistributing wealth die to much higher taxes on the higher earners.<br><br>This is a fact.

If there to dumb to understand how there being taken advantage of then all I can do is laugh at them  I actually think it was a very unfair portrayal of both the men and women involved.
