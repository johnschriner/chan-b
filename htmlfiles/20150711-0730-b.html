I love that film<br>Anyway pic related</br></br>  <br>FUCKING GREAT FILM</br>  <br>It's a foreign film, and I don't see people talking about it very often ; But 1 and 2 are easily my favorite action movies of all time</br>    <br>It's an English film it's hardly foreign, do yanks honestly think this?</br>  <br>I think he's talking about the raid m8 not dog soldiers</br>  <br>Yeah I was haha</br>  <br>Fuck me man too high</br>  <br>This movie fucks my mind in the ass</br>  <br>lol</br>  <br>I really like this - but since nobody knows about it - had no one to talk about it with.... everyone thinks it's a horror for soem reason, but it's a super good young person drama comedy.</br>  <br> not the raid 2 <br><br><br>this movie is absolutely brilliant but i dunno if its underrated, people just dont get it the first time</br></br></br></br>  <br>Art imitating life imitating art Art imitating life imitating art Art imitating life imitating art Art imitating life imitating art Art imitating life imitating art Art imitating life imitating art</br>      <br>Shit film. Only 1 "good" performance and that's Jake and it's his 2nd worst performance next to the day after tomorrow</br>  <br>Brothers is not an unknown good movie - this is a big screen good movie. It was up for Academy Awards and shit.</br>  <br>I can't believe it only has 85% on Rotten Tomatoes.<br><br>Fuck those people. <br><br>That movie is fresh to def.</br></br></br></br></br>      <br>Not really sure if I would classify that as 'Underrated' , per se..</br>  <br>I've been wanting to see borgman forever, but all links on <br>rapidmoviez <br>/dead</br></br></br>  <br>What? This was a mainstream film on it's release and was actually pretty good.<br><br><br>This isn't underrated either. It's just a bunch of moralfags complaining. <br><br> omg I couldn't sleep <br> omg this movie needs banned <br><br>Fucking normalfags</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It really is, probably the best choreography I've seen in any action series</br>  <br>I don't think I agree with The Raid being underrated. It was so well received that The Raid 2 received an international release, which is really rare, especially for an Indonesian movie. Really enjoyed both of them. Cant wait for 3.</br>  <br>most overrated - underrated film of all time<br>I couldn't watch it for more than 30 minutes. <br><br>in b4 can't stand subs - because not true City of God is one of my favorite movies of all time.</br></br></br></br>  David Lynchs Dune.  <br>Fucking this. I love City of god</br>    <br>Anything with Jake except day after tomorrow and brothers is great</br>  Birth of a Nation<br><br>Best fucking movie ever.</br></br>  <br>Say that you love me.<br>torrentreactor.com/torrents/1070128<wbr>1/Borgman-2013-DVDRip-x264-HORiZON-<wbr>ArtSubs</wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>Man thanks - for this I give you someones sister in the shower - he said she's 18 &gt;.&gt; <br><br>https://mega.co.nz/#!8BsAVBSA!hPwCH<wbr>BsBoho9Nfx-5fa8-L92Rb0UvIrpNILtpx96<wbr>-xA</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>    <br>Glad to be of service. :]</br>  <br>harry blobber and the sourcerer's balls</br>  <br>will watch later, thanks anon</br>  <br>No problem, enjoy. :]</br>      How much testosterone do you have /b/?  <br>a lot<br>fuck you</br></br>  7  <br>7 testosterone</br>  <br>'How much' seems a bit irrelevant.

Get more from her. She ain't sending.</br></br></br></br>  Let's get a cuck thread going  Let's get you cancer, faggot.  Let's fukken not!  <br><br>I've cucked my share of married/taken women, getting cock behind their mens' backs. They tend to be pretty fun fucks!</br></br>  shit thread OP  <br>Funny as fuck. "Damn niggers"</br>  Some taken women I've enjoyed:<br><br> A 20-something married blonde spinner. Seduced her over Yahoo Messenger of all places. Gave her a bareback creampie in a hotel room. She wept in the bathroom while I left. She told her hubby. He tried to track me down, but I gave her an alias and lied about where I lived. </br></br>  <br><br> A 30-something fit married nigress: Fucked her on her own couch while her hubby was working the graveyard shift. We had to listen carefully the whole time, in case her little kid in the other room woke up. She was my sex toy for four different nights, until she got spooked, thinking her hubby was on to her. </br></br>  <br><br> Had a long-term domination over a 26yo brunette married bank branch manager. She was so fucking cute. She would meet me in an abandoned Bob Evans parking lot to suck/swallow me during ever lunch break for two weeks. We met up in a hotel several times to fuck. She had a tight pussy that tasted amazing and had just the sweetest little whiny coos when I would fill her up. <br><br>She would send me masturbation videos on command… call me Sir… loved to be slapped in the face. Good times.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Fucked a well-to-do 43yo white yoga teacher in the back of her SUV behind a grocery store in broad daylight. She had a domination fetish as well. Called me "Master" while I plowed her tight twat. She lost it a week later and left her husband, spontaneously moving to Florida. Obviously, she was not happy at home. </br></br>   The stories and information posted here are artistic works of fiction and falsehood. <br>Only a fool would take anything posted here as fact.</br>  <br><br> Met a 20yo Chinese college student on Craigslist. She wanted to lose her virginity before she had sex with her bf. I was 36 at the time. Met her at her home, while she was on break, and her family was away. She had a sheeted mattress on the floor in a back room of a big house, all ready for the event. She had a pussy as tight as a butthole, and she was in pain, but I penetrated her and deflowered her, as she wanted. She whimpered and clenched and writhed and cried out, but it was fucking paradise. Slept with her till morning, and she thanked me up and down for a week afterwards. </br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, I hear you. My stores do sound unbelievable, I guess. I was married to a bitch for ten years, and when I finally wised up and left her, I realized that I had all my wild oats yet to sow.<br><br>I never specifically sought out taken pussy, but I'd be lying if it isn't a thrill to fuck a hole claimed by someone else, right under their nose.</br></br></br></br>    <br><br> Had a white dirty-blonde 47-year-old live-in girlfriend of another man sneak over to my place every two weeks or so over four months for a fuck session. She was short, cute in a maternal way, and a squirter. She accepted my creampies, as she'd had a hysterectomy. </br></br>  <br>Op is a beta fag that can't please his woman.</br>    <br>Keep going. Ever gangbang anyone?</br>  <br><br>Was fuckbuddies with a 44yo girlfriend of another man. She lived in the state south of mine, but would travel to my city every few months or so on business. When she was around, she would tell me her hotel and room number, and we would schedule when I could stretch her claimed cunt. I would wrap myself in a condom for her, but she would swallow my seed bare, like the good slut of a cucked man.</br></br>  <br>On gay actually. I love black cock.</br>  <br> corporate paid faggot schilling this shit <br>Move along people nothing too see here</br></br>  <br><br>No never. I've been propositioned that, and I've responded to Craigslist posts for that, but I've never gone through with it. I haven't yet felt comfortable with the idea, but I'm open to the possibility.<br><br>I had a 55yo fuck buddy who was a middle school teacher who once mentioned (albeit in a really horny mindset) that if I could find another guy to come over, she would let us both take her, but I keep this part of my life really private, and didn't have any friends or trusted people I could approach.</br></br></br></br>        <br>Let's give you AIDS, queer fuckboy.</br>    <br> being this upset </br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br> Things that never fucking happened because you look like a forest fire. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You know why your stories sound like bullshit? Because they are</br>  <br>Hope you die of HIV, faggot.</br>    <br>Not upset, just disgusted and humored at how pathetic men have really become. There are literally hardly any men out there in this country. Besides myself and some others.</br>    <br>source?</br>                <br>Nope. You're not a man. You're a faggot posting on 4chan on a computer. You are just as pathetic as us you idiotic egotistical fuck.</br>    <br>No, I'm a man that doesn't fall for the whole JIDF cuck bullshit like you did.</br>  <br>Wtf is up with her toes??</br>  White power.  <br><br> Fucked a tall, bi black college-age girl with an athlete bod, who was in a relationship with another black girl. She was so adorable in the way she cried out when getting fucked. So [legally] young and hot. <br><br>I'm not sure if this counts as cucking, because the girlfriend eventually found out, and ended up giving me head when HER gf (the one I was fucking) was out, lol. She had some chub on her, was big-tittied, and didn't swallow, but the head was good, as was cumming on her big brown titties.<br><br>In retrospect, I should have asked them for a threesome, once they both knew I was into them both, but I moved away before getting to enjoy that.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> things that never happened part 2 </br>  <br> black face <br> white legs <br>wut?</br></br></br>  <br>Cucks are retarded, ignore the bullshit.</br>    <br>sauce?</br>  <br><br>Why aren't you doing this stuff? It's honestly not that hard. At all. There are taken women out there, who are not happy in what they currently have, that will crawl out of the fucking woodwork to get a good, attention-giving, confident fuck from someone other than their SO.</br></br>  <br>Are you a white guy? <br>I fucked my college roommate's girlfriend when I was there. He was totally convinced I was sexually inexperienced and laughed at me regularly. I just let him believe it and fucked her regularly. <br>He was unfit and I was very fit, on the track team, and she was thrilled to have someone fit fucking her finally. She said her boyfriend couldn't get a full erection and they mostly cuddled and did oral sex.</br></br></br>        <br>There we go. Post moar. Get rid of these faggy ass nigger cock lovers.</br>  <br><br>Yeah, I'm white. <br><br>I'm 37 and divorced. Didn't start doing things like this until I concluded that my marriage was shit, and divorced. I was religious and married young, so I seem to be on a mission to get all the different kinds of pussy I missed out on in my younger years.</br></br></br></br>  <br> wannabe Dan Bilzerian detected. </br>  <br>The "real man" rhetoric is coming out now. Self congratulatory attack speech for the less adventurous.</br>  <br><br>No trolling. I'm being completely sincere. <br><br>Obviously, it's a numbers game; you'll catch one good married pussy for every half dozen promising leads you make. You'll need to be patient and calm, and not make decisions based on a lack of sex, but on mindful goals of getting what you want.<br><br>If it helps, I get the best results when I look for a submissive girl to dominate. That's when I start getting replies from more married or in-relationship women than single ones. Does anyone have any ideas why this is? I'm genuinely curious.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>name?</br>  <br> dogfart.com </br>  <br>How do you justify being a cuck? You can't. You might as well just end your life right now. <br><br><br> hurr I fucked like 15 bitches on Tinder. <br> I am now pussy master.  <br>Fuck outta here, punk.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think he just wants to be himself, having fun.</br>  <br>Have you ever knocked one of these women up?</br>  He's in the cucklus clan.  <br><br>Ok, so help he out here. Where did I say I am the ultimate pussy master of the seven continents?<br><br>What I'm saying is that it's easier than the scoffers seem to think. It's not rocket science, or something restricted to some elite group of douchebags. I'm saying that with a modicum of effort, you can be getting your dick wet in married pussy too, IF it's something you genuinely want to try.<br><br>Unless you are a completely mindless, cynical dipshit who can't visualize your own success at something you've never tried, which could be the case.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Not to my knowledge, no. I wrap up more often than not, by far.</br></br>  <br>Damn, you so cool anon.</br>  <br>Would you if the couple was really into cuckolding?</br>  <br>You're playing with fire, idiot. I could have fucked a bitch with a baby and a boyfriend but I chose not to. She's too much of a stoner hippy for me and she doesn't have the same body as she used to as a teenager when I found out about her.</br>  I see this shit all the time what is "cuckholding" please explain  <br><br>If I can keep my anonymity safe, then yes. <br><br>I just can't trust people to the point of making myself vulnerable to child support down the road. I keep this casual-fucking part of my life VERY private. My closest friends and family don't know anything about this side of me. I wouldn't want to get in a new legit relationship down the road, and then have this mouth to feed shoved upon me years from now.<br><br>If I could use a fake name, and never give them opportunity to find me in the future, then yes, I would happily work to knock up another man's woman. That's a hot idea.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You sound threatened and insecure as fuck. We're just telling stories and you're getting all competitive</br>  <br>I thought about that too but I don't want some kid running around with my DNA that I can't pay for.</br>  <br><br>Okay, so, just to clarify, you call me an idiot, and then you go into detail why you didn't fuck a girl that you were not attracted to. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Cool argument, bro.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, fictional stories. This is /b/. Not /cuck/</br>  <br>I was before but not now. She's not so much a milf as her body is ruined from a miscarriage and a baby. And her boyfriend is a slob that can barely support her. Too much drama to stick my dick into.</br>  <br><br>I hear you. That would bother me to a point, but I could probably put it out of my mind fairly easily. The tangible threat of having to financially care for a strange child—with my DNA, yes—and having my loved ones know that I was out seeding a stranger's hole is what would really bug me.</br></br>  <br><br>Oh ok. I'm just trying to grasp your point. So, what you are saying is that when you HAD the opportunity to fuck her, you WERE into her, but you resisted, because of your moral code, yes?<br><br>Not being sarcastic or trashing your point of view; just wanting to understand where you're coming from, or why you called me an idiot.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I had sex with a married neighbor when I was 18, she was just under 30 at the time. Moved out on my own and never really talked to her for years. I found out at a funeral a few months ago that her 14 year old daughter is mine. It kind of fucked with my head but her husband makes 10x more per year than I do. Kind of turns me own now when I think about it. She has 5 kids from 4 different men (he knows).</br></br>    <br>Why did you feel the need to tell us this?</br>  <br><br>Wow, that's hot and amazing. Were you approached at all to be in the kid's life? Was there any threat that this will be held over your head somehow?<br><br>That said, congrats on the hot MILF neighbor sex in your teens, man.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She chickened out. She talked a big game and saw my dick and was all thirsty over it and was like "oh my boyfriend and I's relationship sucks and I wanna cheat" and all this shit then she never said another word of it. So fuck her then. She doesn't have the tits she used to have nor the ass. She's got a mom body. And not a good one. I'll post a pic if you want.</br>  <br>Thought this was a share your stories thread.</br>    <br>There is literally nothing wrong with being a cuck. If both you and your partner enjoy it then who cares? It's way better than the beta faggotry I see here everyday (loli, furfags, traps). It's not hurting anyone and is done privately between consenting adults so what is the problem? <br><br>tldr:; there is literally nothing wrong with being a cuck. prove me wrong<br> protip: you fucking cant </br></br></br></br>  <br>It was a quick and awkward conversation. She didn't threaten me but told me to never tell anyone and to never approach the kid about it. I probably had the worst deer in headlights look when she told me. Kind of sucks because my daughter seems like a great person.</br>  Overrated game thread.  <br>stupid to think that game is overrated</br>  <br>I don't think so it had a shitty third person shooter with a stupid eIi going all over the place when you're hiding making the tense full moments pretty dumb and the story was descent not like we haven't seen any movie done something like that</br>    <br> shooter <br>this is why you didn't like it<br>TLOU sneaky mode is what makes this game worth it</br></br></br>  <br>uncharted</br>  <br>and you have to play it with decent headphones to appreciate it at 10/10</br>  <br>uncharted 3 was pretty dope though</br>  <br>Everyone bitches about ellie not being detected by AI but if she was everyone would bitch harder about ellie fucking up their stealth</br>  <br>This.<br><br>I only ever played 2 hours of it. It was laggy as shit.</br></br></br>  Witcher 3  Final Fantasy 7 is the classic most overrated game. 9 is way better, but will never get any praise because it wasnt first. Same goes for ocarina of time and twilight princess.  <br>Sounds like a personal problem.</br>  <br>your pc is potato as shit</br>  Fable 3  <br> having a shit system that can't even run Skyrim </br>  Jak II was incredibly overrated. The vehicles sucked, the shooting was horrible and the time travel story was poorly executed. Jak I was the peak of collectable platformers, and the sequels ruined it.  This.<br>Its a REALLY GOOD GAME. but not a 10/10. maybe a light 9/10. I love it, but its a bit overrated tbh</br>    Max Payne 3  <br>I'm calling bull shit, i played that game in average 5 hours a day for like 3 years.<br><br>Beat it nearly completely 3 times, and never got bored with it even once.</br></br></br>    <br>Gtfo right now cunt</br>  <br>i have probably spent ~400 hours on that<br>not sure how you could dislike it</br></br>  <br>protip: grow a brain</br>  <br>nice heresy<br>dissing the game that gave birth to the fps genre</br></br>  <br>So you played it on ps3.</br>  <br>Skyrim was shit compared to every other elders game. fucking cancer story line,.</br>  <br>overrated? Everyone calls it CoD shit</br>  Anygame that you like  <br>Up until waw those games were very good and creative. mw2 was the last one with an ounce of dignity in it.</br>  <br>Gotta be bait. Just fucking has to be.</br>  <br><br>wat dude. i enjoyed half life but that props goes to wolfenstain</br></br>  <br>That game was the reason I stopped buying video games. People told me it was amazing. So I said ok I'll try this zombie crap out. Start playing, thinking ok the beginning is kind of cool..keep playing and getting bored fast..finish the game in a couple of days. At the end I was wondering why I played the game and was pissed that I spent 60 bucks on it. Take it back to the gamestop and receive a 25 dollar credit, after the game being out for like 2 weeks...get call of duty black ops 2 and never played any other game since</br>  <br>No I agree, a game can be overrated and still be good. It doesnt deserve the amount of praise it gets, it wasnt as good as oblivion.</br>  can't tell if this is a troll thread or everybody is just retarded  <br>Beat me to it. I was gonna say every COD ever</br>  <br>Last good one was WaW, which was also the best</br>  <br>wolfenstein might have come first, but half life was a huge step forward in terms of technology and gameplay that turned it into a real thing<br>without it I doubt fps games would be nearly as popular today</br></br>  This shit  <br>I thought oblivion was WAY worse.<br>Oh look, i get to climb a tower, yay.<br><br>But them duplication cheats..<br><br>Morrowwind was just too fucking hard for me to enjoy, not gonna say it was bad, but i didn't like it much.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>WAW was just cod 4 with wwii guns. it was lazy and not nearly as good as mw2.</br>  <br> what is goldeneye <br> what is quake </br></br>  <br>kek, gtfo summer.</br>  <br>Half life was mostly based on the quake 3 engine so no</br>  <br>Like my fucking God. Get over it already.</br>  <br>HOLY SHIT CAPTAIN HELPER. WHAT AN AMAZING STORY.</br>  <br>It had zombies, and tanks in multiplayer, and a better campaign than both</br>  <br>quake 2 engine, 3 wasnt out yet.</br>  <br>No thats wrong. Those are when COD was good. It was post MW3 that things went downhill and now its just the worst thing ever.</br>  <br>they are games</br>   inb4: its a good game <br>no, it really isnt.</br>  <br>My god. Quake use to be the shit, i just nostalgicly came in my pants.</br>  <br>hmmm... nah oblivion was better</br>  <br>Off yourself fag</br>  <br>Still, some revolutionary engines id techs are</br>  <br>theres a reason its one of the most modded games. Quake live used to be the shit in middle school.</br>  I almost slipped into a coma playing this. I cant believe it won something like 30 awards.    Overrated is fucking Five Nights At Freddy's. I hate this fucking shit for kiddos. Poodiepie made this shit popular. It is not even scary. Shit overrated for brainless humans.  <br>Its is good, but that's about it.<br><br>Without extensive modding that game wasn't even worth $20.00.<br><br><br>What game was never overrated. It was a crappy game, and people thought as much.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>totally overrated.<br>also GTA V, far Cry 4, Minecraft and a lot old games, which are classics today</br></br>  Morrowind. People always say its the greatest of the elder scrolls series. Now it is garbage that doesnt hold up. Frustrating game mechanics, a poor quest log, limited voice acting and lots of text. The character animations look like everyone has shit in their pants, and are trying to walk without the shit touching their ass cheeks. Morrowind is not the best in the series, Oblivion and Skyrim are better.  <br>i just finished this and it was bretty gud</br>  <br>rage was trying too hard to be a fallout/quake hybrid. thats why it suffered.</br>  <br>Literally every call of duty<br>Literally every pokemon game<br> I fucking love pokemon but this shit is getting out of control <br>Literally every battlefield game<br>Literally every sports game</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That didn't give birth to fps you fucking faggot. Wolfenstein did</br>  Any pokemon game    <br>I've always wondered why the little Jak was in the future.</br>  <br>Poor mans Legend of Zelda</br>  <br>This is the most overrated game of all time</br>  <br>soundtrack, tho.</br>  <br>Skyward sword is the poor mans legend of zelda.</br>  <br>I agree. I think it won goty, don't know why. I played it and honestly didn't see what was so great about it, I didn't even care about the characters.</br>  <br>I actually agree on the pokemon thing.<br>Its not the same games i played in school.</br></br>  <br>My friends loved it</br>  <br>overrated as fuck... boring storyline, archetypes and races absolutly unnecesary since farm can dissolute any initial choice, feel like a hack and slash in first person. Putting aside your necesities of an exciting life on your own, i dont see a good game here.<br><br> inb4 bait <br> inb4 codfag </br></br></br></br>   Call of Duty games <br> BattleField games <br> Later Halo games <br> Fallout </br></br></br>  <br>burn</br>  <br>Nah</br>  <br><br>You fucking idiot. Tlou is the best fucking game EVER. Best story, music, voice acting, gameplay...it fucking has it all. Go back to your COD buddies and goddamn I wish summer kids would go the fuck back to 9gag or their mothers' skanky wombs,</br></br>  <br>I I don't think anybody rated this game higher than utter shit</br>  <br><br>Oh and Borderlands 2</br></br>  <br>Kek maybe if you're on console</br>  <br><br>haha, implying 7 was first. it was ...7...<br><br>9 sucked balls actually. 3, 7, 8, 10 were all masterpieces</br></br></br></br>  <br>The fact that there has been better JRPG games since then doesn't matter, FF7 was still fucking fantastic in 1997</br>  <br>Maybe best game on ps3. maybe. little big planet might beat it. Definately not the best game ever. Try xenoblade</br>  <br>Gta 5 sucked so much dick i only played it once. Minecraft can be fun if you play the "story".</br>  <br> get call of duty black ops 2 and never played any other game since <br><br><br>Good luck when you start junior high in the fall.</br></br></br></br>  <br>In 1997. Its 2015 people still say its the best. not best of the time. people legitimately defend it as the best game ever.</br>  All of these.<br><br>I do not understand how people can find these games so enthralling.</br></br>  <br>isn't that some wii babby only game</br>  <br>Final fantasy 3,4,5 <br><br>Seven was a joke in comparison</br></br></br>  Thinking a game is overrated is fucking bullshit.  <br> Oblivion <br> Better <br>lel ebic meme bro</br></br></br>  <br>Oh look, its contrary o' clock!</br>  <br>Bait. <br>Cause the best part of that game was the<br>Ellie R34.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, no.</br>  <br>Its on 3ds now, or you can pirate it like everybody else and play it on dolphin.</br>  ITT: a bunch of sweaty fats think they are enlightened video game connoisseurs whose personal preferences are valid critiques of games.  <br>It looked like shut, game play was rough, and it was just fucking boring</br>  <br>most people give it a 9/10 and it was one of the best rpgs in recent memory</br>  <br>This is why most of you autist retards don't get laid...no empathy and no understanding of emotions. Enjoy your mom's basement for eternity.</br>  <br>shit-tier gameplay but god-tier story</br>  <br>moralfag pls go away</br>  <br><br>because the sandbox thing is fun for a lot of people, and not everyone is into wizards and warriors.</br></br>     GoldenEye 007 <br> Halo </br>  <br>I havent even finished the story. Still pissed off cause i payd 50 bucks for it.</br>  <br>Wow your opinions are shit.<br>6 &gt; 4 &gt; 9 &gt; 5 &gt; 3 &gt; 2 &gt; 3 &gt; 10 &gt; 7 &gt; 14/11 &gt; 12 &gt; 8 &gt; 13</br></br>  <br> good game <br> overrated <br><br>Pick one</br></br></br></br>  <br>main story line was shit, but mods made it great</br>  <br>Good luck with your life period. God bless you</br>  <br>That's 4chan in a nutshell</br>  <br>Twilight princess is underrated actually. Ocarina may be the most overrated game ever. Huge historical impact, does not hold up today</br>  <br>Halo 1 and 2 were awesome. they actually cared about the single player back then.</br>  <br>CoD 1-4 were great games</br>  <br><br><br><br>It's not even the violence. I'm cool with violence.<br><br>I dislike the game for many reasons. The biggest one being all the people that think it's some sort of fucking Godsend.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 9 sucked balls <br> 9 SUCKED BALLS <br> 9.SUCKED.BALLS!!! <br><br>Kill yourself</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's not part of the game. That's for perma virgins like yourself.</br>  <br>I agreee its bait though</br>  FNAF, all of them. Fucking cancerous youtuber bait games that suck and have a story that only idiots and children believe is actually good. The guy made the same game three times continuing a half assed shitty story that was vague enough for people to make speculations about the story even though the dev really had no fucking idea what he was doing.  <br>ASSFAGGOTS are universally acclaimed as cancerous shit.</br>  <br>But they arent mutually exclusive. For example, minecraft</br>  <br>Graphics (but not art sytle) are a useless point. No voice acting is a pretty minor thing do. Morrowind had far more depth than Oblivion and far, far more than skyrim. You were free to build your character as you choose and not locked into a class by an idiotic perk system (granted Oblivon wasn't either). You could actually miss attacks. There was no radar/minimap so you were more than an arrow. The risk/reward of exploring was huge. From interesting lore/mini stories (Many the same quality of Lost odyssey's text based stories you could find). And every piece of cool shit wasn't tied to a quest that points you directly to it. Tonnes of Easter eggs from a giant guar to a talking mudcrap to Indiana Jones. Not to mention the varied and inspired creatures that were everywhere. None of this over used crap - oh a wisp, or a troll, or a giant, or an elemental, etc. Haven't seen those thousands of times before. Just look at http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:<wbr>Beasts. That JUST the beasts. They were not only unique but their locations were as well. No game since has been nearly as immersive nor "explorer" friendly as Morrowind.</wbr></br>  <br>Fallout is one of the funnest games I've ever played.</br>  <br>And? That doesn't mean it's overrated, that means you don't like them as much.</br>  <br>I didn't have a N64 as a kid and have never been able to finish ocarina on any other platform, it's so clunky and slow :(<br>Twilight on the other hand was a really great game, wish I had it on gamecube where the fucking waggle controls didn't get in the way of gameplay though.</br></br>  <br>I finished the story, but still wish i had my money too, lol.<br><br>Fucking blew.</br></br></br>    <br>  wishes summer kids would leave <br>  is a summer kid <br>Kek</br></br></br>  <br>I was saying that twilight princess was underrated compared to ocarina. Its criminal how that halpens, twilight princess was so much better. at least on gamecube.</br>  <br>For a tl;dr: Morrowind truly brought you into another world, and while it had its issues it was by far the strongest game for modders to build off of.</br>  <br>Isn't that what this thread is, basically? People saying what game they feel is overrated is usually based on a dislike of the game itself.</br>  Calling everything that some faggot will post<br> Pokemon <br> Metal Gear <br> Mario <br> Zelda <br> GTA <br> Final Fantasy <br> Kingdom Hearts <br> CoD <br> Uncharted <br> Minecraft <br> Batman: Arkham <br> Resident Evil <br> Mortal Kombat <br> Witcher <br> The Elder Scrolls <br><br>Did I miss one?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The best part of this is knowing your wrong, and it making me smile!</br>  <br>Overrated is a bullshit term used to feel superior because you can't understand how people enjoy something you don't.</br>  <br><br>I'm not saying its shit my any means.</br></br>  <br>Nah, homie. I genuinely feel the GTA series is completely overrated.</br>  <br>upboat</br>  <br> 9/10 <br> overrated  <br><br>Nigga, you retarded or something?</br></br></br></br>  <br> wants to think of something clever to say <br> says kek </br></br>  <br>cod4 was god tier for its time</br>  <br>5 was cool, but Rockstar fucked online up to the point that I stopped playing</br>  <br>This and fallout by far. Absolutely mediocre games that people sperge about over and over.</br>  <br>You have a right to an opinion so I won't argue. Honestly, I just wanted a reason to use that gif.</br>  <br>this.<br>its fucking controlled great and was just awesome to play.<br>especially because in multiplayer, you had to be smart and scavenge shit and use stealth. its not just like COD running in with full ammo and nukes and killing everyone.<br>I even hated how the story ended but I still love the game</br></br></br></br>  <br>They are top tier time wasters. If you don't want to get involved in any real story or character development and just want to dick around for an afternoon you can't beat 'em. For the niche they fill they do it, arguably, the best.</br>  <br>Game was good but yea, really overrated</br>  <br>4 was legendary and mw2 built on it. then they started copy pasting everything.</br>  <br>Get a better computer.</br>  <br>HotS is the only true MOBA</br>  <br>hipster much? or fedorian patrician?</br>  <br>No I understand how people enjoy it. We all play games that other people don't like. Don't get so butthurt over it.<br><br><br>Tis a good gif.</br></br></br></br>  <br>/thread</br>  ITT reddit  <br>this. I always hated them</br>  <br>They shit on the online completely. Its that and the retarded community of the online as well.</br>  <br> 9 masterpiece <br><br>Fuck off you massive homo you haven't got a fucking clue what you're talking about. Spend half the game drawing magic for the shit GF system</br></br></br>  <br>Transelemental Extra Virgin Olive Oil.</br>  <br>Fallout 3 is fucking awesome. but thats also because I just love post apocalyptic stuff. like if Fallout 3 was almost exactly the same, but based on a different planet, I wouldnt have thought it was as cool. but its still fun to play and cool shit to explore.<br>though Im only a little bit into Half Life 2 and so far dont really care about it, so I agree with that. it must've been cool for its time I guess</br></br>  <br> calls autistic retards <br> talks about empathy </br></br>  <br>Then calling a game overrated is redundant. Each game is rated exactly as it should.</br>  the uncharted series, LA Noire, Assassins creed series.<br><br>ALSO TROY BAKER STOP BEING IN GAMES</br></br>  All I know is that I used to defend playstation allstars as decent, but look at this shit. I cant even play isaac and try to have fun.  Ocarina of Time.<br><br>I prefer Link to the Past.</br></br>  Assassins creed  <br>Is no one going to acknowledge Wind Waker? I still fucking play that game. Just beat the Wind Temple again yesterday.</br>  <br> Kingdom Hearts <br>I fucking love kingdom hearts.<br>everyone has either never played it and assumes its shit, or they have played it and love it.</br></br></br>    Majora's mask ftw!  <br>Underrated post, every game from Blizzard has been very underwhelming for me in comparison to all the hype and attention all of them get..</br>  <br>Dude, everyone loves Wind Waker.</br>  <br> The biggest one being all the people that think it's some sort of fucking Godsend <br> all the people <br><br>Hipster faggot confirmed. GTA is too mainstream for you.</br></br></br></br>  <br>My friend worked on The Last of us at naughty dog studios... :(</br>  <br>I played it and still think it's shit. Nigger.</br>  <br>I just beat the ice titan in the first one. feels good man.</br>  <br> Twilight princess is underrated actually. <br>hell fucking yes.<br>I always put TP in the "unpopular opinions" threads</br></br></br>  <br>This guy has nailed it. FUCK those games, seriously, any every virgin faggot who plays them.</br>  <br>A.) get a comp made after 2011.<br>B.) don't use hundreds of mods haphazardly thrown together. <br><br>Also for Skyrim a good CPU &gt; a good graphics card. Thanks to Bethesda being console fags it is single (maybe double, can't recall) core and DX9. But with mods you have tonnes of scripts running and that needs a good CPU. Also, RAM. At least 6 gig if you are on windows 7 or higher.</br></br></br></br>  <br> god-tier story <br>at it's best it's an average muh emotion story. it's nothing special, just some basic story you see in almost every movie or game today.</br></br>  <br> GTA <br>I've only played V, but after an hour or two, I got tired of it. It was so tedious.</br></br>  <br>U mad bro?</br>  This shit does NOT hold up. Try playing it again. It's awful.    <br>I know, just posting most common shit everyone posts.<br><br> Assassin's Creed <br> Red Dead <br> Sonic <br> WoW <br> Saints Row </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah but childhood memories bro. They are indestructible.</br>  <br>Perfect dark was always better.</br>  <br>Then you have an opinion.</br>    <br>thank your friend that game was gold<br>OP is a frustrated xbox/pc fanboy with sexual orientation self-conflicts</br></br>  <br>That does not mean is overrated.</br>  <br>Fuck you Zelda is the shit.</br>  <br>You can blow of Natalia in the cut scenes. <br>Just sayin.</br></br>  <br>How is that overrated?</br>  <br/>  <br>Nigger do you not know how to read?<br><br> The biggest one being all the people that think it's some sort of fucking Godsend <br><br>Yeah, all the people that love this game think it is some magnificent adventure. Are you a potato?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I would not say better but that was a fucking awesome game in and of itself.</br>  <br>graphically, sure. but it was and is a hallmark in the fps genre for consoles.</br>  <br>Up. Blow up.</br>  <br>The ending is awful, that bitch should have died.</br>  <br>its more about the gameplay in these rather than the story or the overall game. like everyone loves to just pick up GTA V and run around doing stupid shit. no one constantly replays the story like with other games</br>  <br>That one and THUG 2 were so fun back in the day.</br>  <br>You liked ff9<br>Fucking pedo</br></br>  <br>kek</br>  <br> Assassin's Creed <br> Red Dead <br> Sonic <br> WoW <br> Saints Row <br>Haven't played Saints Row, but I stopped playing Assassin's Creed after maybe 30 mins. Played Red Dead Redemption for maybe 60 minutes before quitting.<br><br>WoW, on the other hand, was good for about 3 weeks.<br><br>Sonic? Whatever... Sonic 2 was okay, I guess.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  This game was such a massive shit in the face to all the Arma 2 fans!  <br>kill yourself</br>  <br>that's some shit taste</br>  <br>The game is poorly designed. It's controls are unusable. But everyone sits there and goes "muh nostslgia". The game sucks. It may have been cool at the time, but it objectively is bad</br>  <br>right????? she knew Joel for a year and he killed the lady that basically raised her</br>  <br>Everyone was having a fucking blast with the hacked money. Like I was playing that shit every day for a few hours. Then they took it away and basically forced us to do those shitty missions with tiny rewards. I quit right after that.</br>  <br>Arma 2, the war mod for dayZ.</br>  <br>Oh please, go and hurt yourself. Its because all people like it and you have a burning desire to be different and unique, so you say you hate it. If i'm wrong, give me some actual reasons why you dislike the games.</br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>isaac is op as shit if you git gud</br>  <br>I will fight you<br>That game is the reason why I never enjoyed a game again. It was that good.</br></br>  <br>That's not how being objective works.<br><br>Sure the game is dated as fuck, but you judge it based on the time it was released, not against everything that has been improved in the last 20 years.</br></br></br>  <br>#failedb8</br>  <br>That game was gay.</br>  <br><br>Anyone who says they hate COD either sucks at it, or didn't like a few of them, and pretends the series is crap. It's the #1 gaming franchise in the world. I admit, Advanced Warfare and Ghosts were a bit weird, but the others are fine.</br></br>  <br>Just making sure lol</br>  <br>I one never got into the Half-Life series...I got bored before finishing 1 and played 2 largely for having fun with the physics...the series just comes off to me as another dystopian fight-the-power story.</br>  <br>My jak can do fine against kratos, but isaac got hit with the nerf hammer super hard. Pre patch he was untouchable.</br>  <br><br>Best game ever made.</br></br>  <br>Everybody's just retarded.</br>  <br>mad at my 5.7 k mmr, faggot?</br>  The PS4 system in general is overrated shit has nothing on it but remakes, copycat games, or exclusives that lose their value in a week  <br>Actually own a ps3 and ps4 faggot only because I didn't enjoy the game doesn't mean I didn't play it</br>  <br> It's the #1 gaming franchise in the world. <br><br>50 Shade of Grey has sold a fuck ton of millions of books, but that don't make it Shakespeare.</br></br></br>  <br>Trips confirm</br>  <br>The game was Uncharted meets Left 4 Dead, cept it had a story. It was tooshort, had decent gameplay, but yes, obscenely overrated</br>  <br>Exactly! save humanity? Nope</br>  <br>Mw2 was the last good game in the series.</br>  <br>Another fucking guy that keeps complaining about remasters...</br>  <br>Kek, back when the game was fun, no one even cared about the heists anymore when that happened. But rockstar milking that cash cow dry, even though they made like almost 3 billion dollars in sales alone, and that was for the original version too!</br>  <br>Actual good taste, except for putting 7 behind fucking 10<br><br>7 is the fucking best game ever made.</br></br></br>  <br>holy shit this!</br>  <br><br>I just posted that. It is the best game ever.</br></br>  <br>are you fucking retarded? COD has become the shittiest series with the shittiest community. there were a few good ones but the most recent ones have just been garbage.</br>  <br>Left 4 Dead is soooo good. The 4 player in 2 was fucking great.</br>  <br>THEY ARE GOOD AND FUN GAMES DESIGNED FOR MULTIPLAYER.<br><br>They are not the best shit on the world by far, but they work and they are fun.</br></br></br>  THIS goddam franchise....<br>Weak as shit.</br>  This is really life killer.Thanks This game i lost friends,family and I leave school now i live in my sister basement 10/10  <br>Red dead was awesome after the first couple of missions.</br>  <br>Another fucking hipster douche</br>  <br>yea, I hate it now, but I loved MW2</br>  <br> Steal a car, no one stops you <br> Shit controls so you can't even drive the car <br> Boring gameplay and story (I tried to play 3,4, &amp; 5) <br> The world has a generic design and feel to it </br></br></br></br>  <br>Black ops 1 was the best one imo, mw3 was just good enough to play, then it went downhill</br>  <br>Its not. It really isnt. you probably still only own a ps1, but every xeno game fucking shits on 7.</br>  <br>then play saints row.</br>  <br>I don't hate COD, I just think they're too easy, not enough complexity. the designers of the game are quoted (although i am paraphrasing) saying, 'The amount of bullets needed to kill is such a low number because we want to reach may demographics, so if you can't shoot very well, you still get kills if you're facing the right direction." I personally prefer games that truly reward the talented.</br>  <br>Why can't we all agree that they all are great? Why do we have to shit constantly on what someone else likes.</br>  <br>Agreed. Mad that I payed even $30 for it. It runs like absolute shit.</br>  <br>played it upon release, regretted spending my hard earned €60 just 30 minutes into the game</br>  <br><br>No, I have a PS3, PS4, PC, and the PC runs everything from Calico to PS2.<br><br>It was the best game ever.</br></br></br></br>  <br>nigga, you must be high, nobody liked fable 3 to begin with</br>  <br> lots of text <br>Yeah, why is that kind of shit present in an RPG?<br>I want to hack stuff, reading is for nerds!</br></br></br>  <br>MW2 was the point where it should have stopped (even though black ops was my favorite) mw3 was shit</br>  <br>I have.</br>  <br> Why do we have to shit constantly on what someone else likes. <br><br>I hope you're enjoying your first day on 4chan.</br></br></br>  <br>Exactly. Class A Judaism right there. They would have made so much more money if they had just let things slide.</br>  <br>That's because you're a power gamer; you only give a shit about finishing games and getting achievements. I bet you would have skipped the cutscenes if you could have. People like you are the reason games like COD are so popular. Seriously read a fucking book and get some imagination about you, you piece of shit.</br>  <br>Ayyy, another fan of black ops! That game had so many memories for me!</br>  <br>Thanks :^)</br>  <br><br>Is this the only game in this thread people actually agree on?</br></br>  <br>because people are wrong</br>  <br>Some people earlier had a quiet agreement on wind waker.</br>  <br>This.<br>COD is objectively a good series.<br>Controls are good, graphics are good, story delivers what it has to.<br><br>It lacks in the originality/invention department because it is so geared to its fanbase it almost fears change.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Opinions cant be wrong, but they can be stupid</br>  <br>so it's good because of memories...</br>  <br>Pretty much.<br><br>It's like the fast food of videogames. Not nutritious and can be dangerous in high amounts.<br>But it's good mindless shit that works.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah that's the problem. Everyone complains that its always the same, but once they change it up, they complain that its not COD anymore.</br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br>Because they are such mindless sheep that's they feel they will be ostrisised for having their own thoughts, so it's much easier for them to be a part of a group and not feel so alone. FF7 wasn't overrated at the time, but people like it now because everyone else does. The majority of people probably haven't even played it.</br>  <br>You porbably only ever played CoD, Battlefield, and Madden and thought that Last of Us was <br> OMG SUCH GUD STORIEZ AND GAMPLAY </br></br>  legend of zelda  All the dungeon walls looked the same. The last battle with Ganon suffered from lag. Also in 1998 it really wasnt nothing new.  <br>The Left 4 Dead series generated the most yelling of all the LAN party games I played.<br><br> Call for help when you're down you dumbass!!!! <br> Fuck you I needed that health pack! <br> Just go! FINISH THE LEVEL!!! DAMMIT!!!! <br> I swear to god if you get us killed again... <br> WTF why did you do that!?! <br> ...and that's what you get for shooting me last time. <br><br>PIC Related: Altitude is an underrated game and the only one that caused more yelling during LAN parties</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Yeah, im not gonna buy a new COD game, but i still pop mw2 or black ops in the ps3 sometimes.  <br>They're not enthralling, they're entertaining. And greatly so, which is why they're so popular.</br>  <br>It was THE game you had to have when you had a little get-together at your house or something back in the day. 4 player vs. was the shit!</br>  <br>I played it for the first time on 3DS. It wasn't that great.<br><br>That does not mean it is overrated.</br></br></br>  <br>g8 b8 m8 8/8</br>  Attention any VET / MED / DOCTOR fags<br><br>So, cat had kittens this morning on our windowsill.
