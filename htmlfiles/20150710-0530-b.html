I see you called someone a "faggot" I'm assuming you meant this jokingly, but I've been mulling this over in my head for several days and it does not sit right. Let me please (re)iterate you on this word. Not only does it aim hatred at a large group of people that I myself and many of my friends are a part of, the word has the power to tear down and undermine a fight that we have been fighting for decades. I don't know where you stand on the issue, but I'm assuming you value your rights to equality as a citizen of this country. You may think that this is only a word, a mere configuration of letters, but this word is the foundation that keeps LGBT people held in the depths of inequality, while men like yourself toss around hateful slurs in a joking way thinking immaturely that you are immune to hurting anyone. This is not true. Next time you throw this word out (however jokingly and privately you may thing you are using this- in this era NOTHING is ever private), think about those who have struggled for the right to feel safe in their own country. The word "faggot" creates a hostile environment and makes many LGBT people feel unsafe around those who have enough power in society to use such words. Don't make me feel unsafe. I have a right to my safety. And although I have tremendous pride in being a mature, strong, bisexual woman, it really sucks when your words get in the way of my pride. Thanks for your attention.</br>  <br>fuck off shitfag</br>    <br>I'm bi, but sucking cock doesn't compare to eating out a girl, IMO.</br>      <br> Faggot </br>    Wish my wife loved my cock as much as I do.                Mine.  <br>kek</br>  <br>ooh shit<br><br><br>fuckin nice mate<br><br/></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>damn. Love precum<br><br/></br></br>    <br>me too m8, I think its my favorite</br>  <br>especially stringy stuff like  shits beautiful man. I found a site a couple of years ago. Some spanish guy who took artsy pics and most of them were like HD closeups of cock and precum. I cant remember the site name and its killing me<br><br/></br></br>  <br>Would sit on/10</br>    <br>Try to find it!</br>  <br>Vaginas definitely don't smell very good</br>  I sucked a cock for the first time sober last night. It was a real crap experience coz it was a grindr meet up that ended up being my fat boss, took what was there though aha  <br>been searching for fuckin ages man its hell<br><br/></br></br>  <br> it was a grindr meet up that ended up being my fat boss <br>fuck thats rough. I've had no luck with grindr or growlr. <br><br/></br></br></br>  Freshly shaved. Feels good.  <br>that fucking sucks man, dont settle only go for people you are into</br>    <br>nice dick and body<br><br/></br></br>          <br>damn<br><br/></br></br>  <br>holy shit that is nice<br>more</br></br>  <br><br/></br>  ill be honest though, these massive dicks make me feel kinda bad  I love it  <br>got a set I can download?</br>  <br>fucking hot! and why?<br><br><br/></br></br></br>  me  <br>just those pics sorry m8<br><br/></br></br>  Me.  <br>Im only a bit above 4", but at least its been said it looks nice and I naturally bottom anyways</br>  <br>dat head man<br><br/></br></br>   There are people in the world who don't like cock       <br>nothing hotter than a bottom with a smaller dick mate. Revel in it. I'm a switch but more of a top and I love sitting on the edge of a bed and sucking a bottoms smaller cock only to feel it burst with cum in my mouth. Smaller cocks are better for oral anyway<br> when you take it to the base and let him facefuck you <br> tfw you fuck him hard and make him your bitch after the facefuck <br><br/></br></br></br></br>  Personally had this dick inside me. Not bad for an older guy.  <br><br>really nice<br><br><br>that sounds awesome as well, I just roll with what I have</br></br></br></br></br>    Can't both be nice?  <br>looks tasty. How was it?<br><br><br>Yeah man no point worrying about it<br><br/></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I like both. Not a fan of gay porn though, weird huh?</br>      <br>I've found 98% of gay porn is pretty shit and focusses on ageplay. Also a lot of one time performers are trying to get into straight porn but get stuck with gay stuff and dont enjoy it. A lot of amateur stuff is good but the general quality is poor<br><br/></br></br>    hi guyz, i've the opportunity to suck my first cock, this one, should i go for it ?  best angle    <br><br>It was pretty nice. Average length but had a nice fat bulge in the middle. I sucked him while he toyed my ass, then he lay me on my side and fucked me. Didn't last long inside me unfortunately.</br></br>  <br>ooh damn. Cocks in condoms is a favourite of mine too<br><br/></br></br>  <br>I see, well I just stick to straight or shemale porn<br><br>gayporn is a little too deep off the end for me</br></br></br>  <br>that him in the pic? Also did he use a condom?<br><br><br>Yeah I was like that and then descended into the gay stuff. That being said though I've always known I was bisex <br><br/></br></br></br></br></br>      <br>thats nice<br><br/></br></br>    <br>another one</br>    <br>fuckin hell<br><br/></br></br>      really hot  how about a ring?  <br>cute <br><br/></br></br>  <br><br/></br>        <br>gay/straight?</br>      <br>more?<br><br/></br></br>  Me    <br>Idk why mobile ways uploads upside down</br>  Just leave this here<br>Bump for interest</br>  <br>bump</br>  bump op  <br>moar</br>  Password isn't Niggerfaggot Can anyone help me out  <br>Pad? tell us</br>  whats the url? hint?    <br>wat ?</br>  <br>MOAR</br>  <br>Niggerfaggot</br>    nudes!!  <br>case sensitive sperglord</br>  <br>MOAR</br>  <br>YES MORE!</br>  BUMP    name?

Seems to just amount to a bunch of fags sitting on their hands, staring at an ugly layout, waiting for somebody else to contribute.<br><br>Anybody care to explain the appeal?</br></br>  General stoner thread.<br><br><br>also, I just cleaned out my pipe and I have a marble sized ball of resin (pic related). I've tried smoking it out of my pipe but it keeps getting clogged up and its messy. what is the best way to smoke resin? I am out of bud and I want to get the most out of this resin.</br></br></br>  <br>Dont. The only reason your getting high is lack of oxygen to your brain. That is all the shit thats left over from weed no actual thc is there</br>  <br>Bullshit that is not resin</br>  <br>Idiot.</br>  <br>maybe you should make the ball a bit smaller so its not the size of the bowl</br>  <br><br> 2015 <br> not injecting resin </br></br></br>  <br>Don't listen to this dude</br>  There's no real non-messy way to smoke resin. Try the hot knife technique.  <br> This motherfucker is an idiot. <br><br>Honestly OP, i would break it into smaller chunks, put a screen in the bottom of your bowl.</br></br></br>  <br> not true <br>OP has a good size ball of poor man's wax and it'll get him right for a good while.</br></br>  <br>Thats a sick resin ball you got there op, nicely done.</br>  put the resin on the tip of a knife. put fire on there resin. Then mix the resin with tobacco and roll a joint  <br>How long did you wait before cleaning your piece to collect that much? <br>What technique do you use?<br>I usually heat my piece and scrape it with a bobby pin</br></br></br>  <br> This <br>All resin is ash, water, and tar the little bit of THC that sticks to it is almost nothing not to mention in heating it you loose some THC.</br></br>  Ex-broke stoner here. Get a pack of pipe screens, wrap the resin in one and try to hold the bowl at an angle so it doesn't melt into the bowl hole. Smoke it and laugh at the term bowl hole. Or go get some weed man, even if it's not alot you can still mix the two. Dry weed will keep burning if packed hard, and it will slow burn the resin into a smokable product. Welcome to weed science 101.  Resin is nasty and you should all feel bad for smoking it.<br><br> Here is what I am smoking. </br></br>  Put it in your pipe with a screen, put the light to it for about 5 seconds, inhale while still lighting. Its a lot like smoking hash but not as nice or strong.  <br><br><br>y'all are dumb. I get folded off some resin.</br></br></br>  <br>For 15min, from your lungs having a coating of tar and ash.</br>  <br>Dumbass over here, stop talking about stuff you have no idea about.</br>  <br><br>This. It's just pot. If I don't have pot, I just won't fucking smoke. Not dying for a fix.</br></br>  <br>Regardless of the disagreements regardinh resin and how much THC it actually contains...<br><br>Fuck smoking resin, OP. Just clean your pipe throw the resin away and figure out a way to scrounge together $20 to go pick up; and if you can't do that...take a little break. Don't be a fiendy mess, shit is not cash</br></br></br>  I smoke so resin last month because i had no cash. NEVER AGAIN.  <br>Jesus clean your pipe more often</br>  <br> throw resin away <br><br>I love you rich kids who say shit like this.<br><br>Resin, for weight, has more thc than average weed does<br><br>not all of us live in legal states or have infinite trust fund money to just buy weed constantly</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So you have a degree in biochemical engineering?<br><br>Please tell me how the fragile THC structure is maintained after being heated readily and mixed with an acidic solution.</br></br></br>  <br>i broke off a three bb sized balls. thats what ive been trying to smoke</br>  <br>Not OP...I know people that will literally NEVER clean their pipes. I'm talking to the point of not being able to drag even 25% of what you could when said pipe is clean simply because of laziness. How would they compensate? Pack more bud and suck harder. Fucking idiots, KeK</br>  <br>break up the ball, use a bong</br>  <br>roll resin around in some ash to prevent it from just melting through. it needs to have some kind of base.</br>  <br>does your pipe have a screen? If its still being fucky try the knife method</br>  <br>Or you can sell weed and always have as much weed as you want to smoke with minimal effort.<br><br> I got 2 regular customers and 5 inconsistent ones. I get about 1-2 grams a day to smoke. </br></br></br>  I used to be the resin king, shit will get you high as fuck but doesn't last as long really. Using a screen helps with the messiness of it. Take it out of the faucet in your bathroom sink if you don't have any lying around.<br><br>A little bit of resin goes a long way..</br></br>  <br>i used a paper clip. ive had the bowl for about three months and this is the first time i cleaned it.</br>  <br>Yeah just be a degenerate drug dealer faggot</br>  <br>This!! Better to wait than wreck your health with that garbage.</br>  <br>Dude stfu, i can tell you that resin can keep me high for a couple hours and sometimes can even be stronger than bud i just dont prefer to smoke it cause it taste like shit.</br>  Grow up and start doing cocaine like an adult.  I miss weed.<br>I'm so sick of the shit tier high of getting drunk off alcohol.</br>  <br>How does ash and water burn?</br>  <br> implying a couple grams of quality herb every three to four days is rich kid bullshit. <br><br>I'm 21, and have been smoking long enough to know what's pathetic and when to keep the habit done in moderation rather than excess...<br><br>But I do live in Southern California. lol</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Or you can grow your own like a real man. Faggot.</br>  <br>Hot-knife it!</br>  <br>You would have to smoke kilograms of something to get an alveolar cloating of tar thick enough to interfere with gas exchange.<br><br>However, people calling what you are smoking 'THC' are almost certainly wrong, if it's been left in a pipe, exposed to the air and burned once then it'll be heavily oxidised giving a different pharmacological profile.<br> just gotta fact check that last point. </br></br></br></br>  <br>You can tell when somebody is from southern California when they won't shut the fuck up about it. Most of it is trash, fuck socal</br>  <br>There is still carbon left from the plant material which requires higher temperatures to ignite.</br>  <br>You sir are an idiot and should kill yourself</br>  <br>Two regular customers who pick up how much at a time? Do you sell anything under a dub? How much do you re-up on at a time and how often? <br><br>I smell bullshit on the 1-2 g's a day and the whole "infinite weed" line. <br><br>Source: I know my shit</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How much do you work? I hate alcohol, but I like to relax after working all day. I have money, but getting a reliable connection is the problem. If there's some THC in it, I don't see any problem with smoking resin.</br>  <br>Friend grows it and he sells it to me for $5gram.</br>  <br> says somebody who isn't from SoCal <br><br>Are you retarded? I can find great weed in the most random states if I know where to look. The same can apply to California...the fact that people get mad about us having access is dumb as fuck</br></br></br>  Using resin is just like using every piece of an animal. Some do it out of desperation, I do it because it's a waste to throw it away. Save some money and hit the black shit for a day, you know?  <br>I wasn't referring to marijuana at all dumbass</br>  <br>He would be losing money. Nutrients and electricity and soil or maintaining hydro pumps costs more than that. A good grower can usually get 1 gram per watt at most. maybe 1.5.</br>  should i fire one up today, guys?  <br>Nice one OP how Did clean it up?</br>  <br>10-20 hours weekly...school is what takes up most of my time. Understood...but all that means is that you need to meet more people. I have 5 different connects that I go between so I'm never at a loss</br>  <br>I do this all the time when i run out. What i usually do is put some of the stems i have saved in the pipe and then the resin ball. This will cause the ball to harden faster and not all melt into your pipe. Still tastes like shit but you'll get high OP.</br>  <br>I sell an ounce a month, which costs me $140.<br>I sell it for $10/g, and of my main two customers one buys a half which is $140 which means I got half an ounce to myself is I don't want to make a profit. My other regular gets like a dub or so twice a week.</br></br>  <br>That's the weakest escape attempt I've ever seen. You must be 'tarded</br>  <br>That's what I always did with my resin. Pack half a bowl and put a small ball of resin on it then pack the rest and then another ball on top of that. That single bowl can last like 20 lights because of the resin.<br><br>People either say "There is no THC in resin" or "It's like a THC concentrate" neither is true. There is some THC but mostly from the fact that resin is made more from the buildup of un lit leaf that gets sucked in or drops in when you pack a bowl and then it gets coated in actual tar. So if you smoke good weed your resin will be good.. <br><br>Either way it's not good to smoke but who the fuck cares.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's outdoor.</br>  <br>gross<br><br>resin does contain small amounts of various cannabinoids, but its so fucking gross and not that great for you (smoking anything isnt healthy but straight pot tar is worse)<br><br>just save up your stems in case youre out<br><br>either smoke em as is (gross) or grind them for the keif (not as gross but you can still taste a distinct "stem" flavor)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You don't seem to understand words today, I'll chalk it up to you being a degenerate stoner.</br>  GUYS!!!!<br><br>i have the best method for smoking resin. who wants to hear it.</br></br>  <br>Why is that even a question nigger? blaze that shit up!</br>  Theres so much hatred in this thread its killing my vibe man, I mean look at this resin ball art I made. Look at it! Im so special cant you see?  <br>Let the dubs be heard.</br>  <br> smoke ground up stems instead of resin <br><br>fucking lol<br><br>stems don't have any thc at all</br></br></br></br></br>  Knife rips dood  <br> what are trichomes <br><br>you're literally retarded</br></br></br>  <br>That just gives you a killer headache. Do not attempt at home.</br>  <br>yes what are trichromes?<br><br>they're part of a fucking flower bud you goddamn imbecile, not a fucking stem</br></br></br>  You guys are all faggots an don't know shit about terps <br>smoke wax faggots</br>  <br>I suppose that balances out if you actually have somebody that gets half o's off of you. But an ounce a month? You're barely selling...how much do you smoke a day? 10-14 g's (considering you'rs selling shitty weed, $10 g's are kek) won't last anyone who smokes much very long...</br>  <br>i'm not talking about the giant fuck-all stems holding up the kola, i mean the tiny ones that are holding the bud itself together, the small stems THAT ARE PART OF THE FLOWER</br>  <br>Two main customers everybody watch out for this guy</br>  <br>OK, youre going to have to do this carefully. <br><br>First you want to get a paper clip, and form the bottom into a coil.<br><br><br>like pic related</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>your weed has stems inside the buds? LOL</br>  <br>You don't seem to have somehhung worthy to say back to me...I'll chalk it up to your lack of opportunities in life which leads to you barely being able to afford weed let alone being able to move to a state in which cannabis is legal for medicinal consumption</br>  <br>confirmed for non-smoker<br><br>high school must be rough</br></br></br>  <br>You are a piece of shit dude, you are overcharging the fuck out of that guy, i hope he finds a better weed connection.</br>  <br>OP just pack a bowl of nug and put the resin over it, toke and let it melt into the bud for supercharged bowl.</br>  <br>thanks, my negus</br>  sfur        Okay, /b/.

Benefits are what we grudgingly hand the poor; the rich are awarded tax breaks. Cut through the euphemisms and the Treasury accounting, however, and you’re left with two forms of welfare. Except that the hundreds given to people sleeping on the street has been deemed unaffordable. Those millions for $150bn Disney, on the other hand, that’s apparently money well spent –whoever coined the phrase “taking the Mickey” must have worked for HM Revenue.<br><br>Politicians and pundits talk about welfare as if it’s solely cash given to people. Hardly ever discussed is corporate welfare: the grants and subsidies, the contracts and cut-price loans that government hands over to business. Yet some of our biggest companies and industries operate a business model that depends on them extracting money from the British taxpayer. The operators of our supposedly privatised train services are kept afloat by billions in public money. Or take the firm created by billionaire Jeff Bezos: last year it emerged that Amazon had paid less in corporation tax to the UK than it had received in government grants.</br></br>  <br>feel your pain dude...</br>  <br>man, it must suck to be a dole scrounging lazy fat assed cunt</br>  Truth. My country would never have seen a recession if corporations actually paid all of their taxes. Instead you have these asshole tax haven countries that our companies just flock too and they hide their money there. I mean what the fuck is wrong with the world. It's not like there's not enough money to go around. We could easily feed, clothe and educate all the people in the world and still have money left over for people to be rich but instead the upper class would rather just sit in all that wealth and maintain their power for their generations. Money is a sickness that cannot be stopped.  <br>We should stop benefits and make people work. Guess what, if you work and earn £20k and pay no tax on it, you're better off than if you earn £20k, pay £2k tax but the state gives you £1k back in in-work benefits and wastes £1k running the civil service.</br>  <br>talking about Disney<br><br>Do you know the difference between a scottish man and Walt Disney?<br><br>Scotish men sometimes wear kilts but Walt Disney</br></br></br></br></br>  See, I work hard in a decent paid job. Feckless layabouts being restricted to mere £20k/year doesn't really bother me. If you're not a dole scrounging cunt you'll be fine. I for one, am appreciative I've now been lifted out of the 40% tax bracket.  10/10 girls    Bump  Password isn't Niggerfaggot <br>Can anyone help?</br>        <br>MOAR</br>          <br>THIS is what a real 10/10 looks like.</br>  <br>OP said girls not guys</br>  pnxreq06u20z  <br>haven't seen a 10 yet -- keep trying, faggots</br>        an easy 10      <br><br>MOAR</br></br>    <br>alex tanner</br>  Here.
