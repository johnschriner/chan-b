I would rather jam a hot poker into my leg than have it.<br><br>TLDR; I can't have sex. I've also never touched alcohol and never want to. I don't care if a person drinks, but I'd have more in common with someone like me that doesn't drink</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice trips, and he's not answering the sex part because he's b80ng</br>  I'm talking to this chick that's a know it all, not sure if I should continue this.<br><br>What do?</br></br>  <br>Women have no way to understand what loyalty is</br>  <br>this guy knows whats up</br>  I know that I'm conceeded and I know that I'm a dick, but I really don't see the point in being in a relationship other than the fact that a girlfriend might just suck my dick and make me food. Otherwise they would be a drain on my wallet and a waste of my time.  <br>I agree with most of the ones being posted, but something else I'd like to add is a woman who keeps your relationship personal. If you go on instagram and twitter and any social media, you'll see people in relationships pretending to have the time of their life in picture and post "cute" bullshit letters to each other publicly for everyone to see.<br><br>The whole thing's just for show. The people in the relationship are just doing it for likes and to make people think they're such an amazing couple. But in reality, they're just empty and faking their way through their relationship to sound as trendy and "cool" as possible.<br><br>This is more the case for women but I've seen men do it too. An occasional post is fine, but when you're obnoxiously posting over and over about your relationship, it takes away the personal side of it. Any personal thoughts you have about the other person, you're just shouting it in the eye of the public so people can see you say it. <br><br>That's one thing I really appreciate about my girlfriend. I'm glad she doesn't care about trends. If you really mean something from your heart, you tell your significant other it yourself to only be shared with the both of you. You don't post "Hey babe, it's been 3 years together and I just want to say..." etc. on Facebook.<br><br>Kind of a rant, but that shit bugs me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I laugh at all the stupid shit some anons say on here, but irl nothing is funny enough to me which is weird because the garbage some btards spew here is autistic as fuck... What kind of humour do I have</br>  <br>Physical traits /b/ looks for in women<br> A penis </br></br>  Has to be a sugar momma, has to take cum in mouth or face each time, has to do anal and swallow occasionally (two times a week).<br><br>I have all of that now though (anal and swallowing might be more like once every two weeks now) the only thing I`d really like to have that I don`t is a threeway with another girl, its been brought up but she`s not willing to go for it just yet, we have one of her female friends picked out and everything.</br></br>  <br>Let's see. Most certainly already what OP said (intelligence, loyalty and responsibility) but also very important others...<br> <br> Not complaining every 5 seconds about fucking everything <br> Not being a bitch <br> Respects you <br> Similar interests (the opposites attract thing doesn't work, it's bullshit and is doomed to failure) <br> Genuine honesty - the ability to say what she feels to my face and not just over text <br> Empathetic and accepting (don't get me wrong having a racial sense of humor is great but actual racists are fucking retarded) <br> Open-minded <br><br>The most important: Loyalty, intelligence, similar interests, not complaining.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>thats stupid, why do u want to support her? ditch the bitch join the race.. my father said tht</br>  <br>Kek</br>  <br>i like where this is goin</br>  <br>I always Kek at couples who do that shit.<br>A. Watson, you and your girl are annoying as fuck</br></br>  Intelligence<br>Independence<br>Dependability</br></br>  Intelligent, doesnt want kids, non religious, attractive, career driven, and funny.  <br>Kate King is a model for Dolce and Gabbana and she's a wallflower lacking in social skills. In her interviews she doesn't say much and it's very obvious how introverted she is</br>  <br>You're right. Social media whores (literally in this case) do NOT deserve to be in any committed relationship, unless their significant other is also a social media whore, in which case they deserve each other. <br><br>I never post how I'm feeling on Facebook. It's nobody's business. Likes are meaningless. My first girlfriend thought the same way, but nonetheless was a complete disrespectful cunt in person and had to go.</br></br></br>  <br>see<br/></br>  <br> not complaining <br>that's just part of having a relationship. You tell each other everything, the good and the bad. You help each other through everything. If you can't handle listening to your girlfriend when she's having a problem with something, you're just in the relationship for selfish reasons. You should care enough to listen and actually give a shit.<br><br>Now if by complaining, you mean "This burger you got me doesn't have enough sauce, I hate it" and basically any kind of "This thing you did isn't good enough" then I agree.<br><br>But if she legitimately has a problem, no matter how small, like an annoying bitch at work or something, it's your job to listen even if you don't want to. You don't even have to help, some girls just want you to listen. Work on developing a more sacrificial, unconditional love.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Damn man have you considered counseling regarding your feelings toward sex? For once on /b/ I am actually expressing genuine concern, not trying to be a douchebag.</br>  <br>OP<br> subjective.  <br> bullshit <br> I'll take anything I can get m'lady.  <br><br>vs<br><br>What normal people look for:<br> Looks if she attracts you to how she looks <br> How she acts around you  <br> Trust and respect </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  the thing with atractive woman is that atractive men wants them, mayby sucssesful men. She will leave you while ur on chan...  <br><br>This is why I haven't tried to get with any girls for the past 2 years.<br><br>Surrounded by too many basic fucks.</br></br></br></br>  Femanons,<br><br>Look in this thread and realize how many guys are looking for intelligence. Please stop acting fucking retarded because you think guys want quirky girls who just parrot back their opinions. We know you're better than this. Thanks. <br><br>-Anon</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm the same way, anon. I want to, I do, because I feel like sex is a big part of a healthy relationship but I can't because I'm messed up in the head and if I were to do it, I'd get so uncomfortable and want/try to isolate myself from the person permanently.</br>  Ass, titties/ ass AND titties. <br><br>Ass.<br><br>Asstitties<br><br>Assandtitties.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Those are delicious.</br>  <br> "basic" <br>you're only adding to the trends</br></br>  <br>I've been seeing a counselor for over 5 years, and while I'm not suicidal anymore and don't hurt myself after masturbating like i used to. I still don't think this would ever change. <br><br>I don't know, my brain is a mess... I was abused as a kid yada yada, exposed to sex drugs and prostitution at a very young age... never partook in it, but it was always around My brain is just scrambled.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I've been in multiple long term relationships and can definitively say that the three most important principles I look for now in a compatible partner are:<br><br> &gt;self-reliance <br> &gt;ambition <br> &gt;compassion <br><br>Self-reliance is obviously the most most important. I hate having to check in every hour or even every day, to make plans exclusively with my SO, and on and on sucking up my time and energy driving this person around. It can be fun to be dominant in a relationship when it comes to fucking but when you're doing other shit and living out your lives there is nothing more disheartening than having to carry someone elses baggage alongside your own. Fuck that-- I look for women that can hold their own and arent afraid of the dark-- that seek their own adventure.<br><br>Compassion and ambition are two sides of the same coin and maintaining them in a life requires a tricky balance. I dont like bitches driven by the lust for money because most often they become consumed by frivolous expenditures, but I also hate bitches that devote their time at someone elses benefit. Women should work hard to earn but should also know that the pursuit of ego and material gain is non-essential to the common pursuit of awareness and understanding. <br><br>Thats my 2 cents OP, i wont settle for less</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Intelligent <br> Honest <br> Career oriented (not walking baby factory) <br> not fucking blonde </br></br></br></br>  <br>Why are u with an counselor?</br>  <br><br>In fact, it's why I steer clear of relationships. It isn't just sex but intimacy. Also, I don't smoke/drink either and wouldn't be much fun. I could offer conversation (not often) and loyalty.</br></br>  <br>am socially retarded and i've had guys tell me they are surprised cause i look "normal" and wouldn't have guessed that i stay home every single day n night and that i was extremely socialyl awkward and shy<br><br>im just gonna die alone</br></br></br>  <br>Actively competes in a sport.

You're completely right, complaining is in every relationship. I did listen to her, but NOTHING I did for her was ever good enough. Absolutely nothing. I should have elaborated a bit further. <br><br>For example, I'd often make dinner (I was the better cook) if I was home before she was done with work, and despite me deliberately making sure I made nothing she disliked since she was picky, she'd still manage to complain. She's just make shit up. Once I made a simple box of pastaroni (which she liked) and she told me I made it "too salty". I added no salt. <br><br>Once we went to a concert, tickets paid by me (she was the one that wanted to go) and afterwards I took her to taco bell for food. I pulled in a vacant parking lot nearby so we could eat, and she complained and got all fucking pissy because "my lights were on" for too long, and was apparently blinding a car that had pulled in front of me. I hadn't even parked yet. <br><br>She was just an annoying, spiteful, unappreciative bitch.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I feel ya on independent.

I actually used to see a counselor and a therapist and a psychiatrist, but now I only see a psychiatrist and a therapist. (I also call him a counselor)</br>  <br>If you start going about transitioning I swear to fuck...</br>  <br>That gets boring, trust me. I've been there.

But having had multiple girlfriends, I've personally found dating someone who is essentially yourself to be incredibly dull. <br><br>Though I understand your plight. The one good thing about dating someone very similar to your own personality is it's easy to understand them. Their intentions, reasons behind being moody, etc.</br></br></br>  <br>A girl that makes jokes that I really appreciate, such as: "someone 'found' my credit card today and bought one bagel. Seems appropriate". She can have my heart forever</br>  <br>what kind of kindness? like having pity on you and fuck you , or a mothers kindness and fuck you</br>  <br>seems to have a lot of trouble "respecting" his girlfriend.<br>"Respect" means not treating her like a pair of tits and a warm pussy that also makes sandwiches on occasion. Treating her like an actual human being. Not beating her when she doesn't put enough ketchup on your fries.<br><br>So in my book it sounds like he's admitting to being pretty fucked up</br></br></br></br>  <br>Whats hilarious is that you think I'm immature for wanting a girl who can be respected. Have you thought of a women as a human being before or do you think they all just walk the Earth for you to try to fuck? No wonder you don't care about intelligence, you can't handle even simple concepts.</br>  <br>I tried, but my mind will just lead me to suicide one way or the other lol.<br><br>I do agree with you though. I just can't make it man. I mean, I have a job making decent money, I have hobbies, talents, interests, lots of good friends, so if that can't keep me afloat, I don't know what can.</br></br></br>  <br>lol'd and check'd</br>  <br>Loyalty hands down. Too much intelligence would mean that she would eventually drop her bullshit facade and become opinionated. Responsibility would just mean she is good at covering her own ass.</br>  <br>I doubt it. He looks like a scrawny dweeb, the girl is probably the dominant one in that relationship. He's definitely fucked up, but only for being a helpless pussy. <br><br>Also, that's not really what respect should imply in a relationship. That's just not being an asshole.</br></br></br>  <br>this</br>  <br>A vagina</br>  <br>LOL and still you bitching. I know who to blame, society an ur mother. Well you just hang in there</br>  <br>Damn, son. I value loyalty as much as anyone else, but are we a little insecure?</br>  <br>She has to fuck the way I like it.

I'm just curious on other peoples' thoughts on this</br>  <br>Free spirit</br>  <br><br>Well, they're not always like that; but I grew up with sisters. <br><br>My youngest sister is a moron that I can corner in an argument easily but they oldest is a lawyer. She always could pick up on the slightest flaw in an argument. <br><br>I mean, intelligent women exist but (hold the fucking phone) they're usually not neo-feminist jackasses that use personal and emotional attacks over logic.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I have been fortunate to date a lot of intelligent, kind, interesting, attractive women<br><br>now all I care about is how big their tits are</br></br>  <br>Nah nephew. Just speaking from experience</br>    <br><br>It's really quite simple (but it took years and many girls to figure this out). Enough good looks for you to be attracted + intelligence (unless you are an insecure POS) + sense of humor. That's it. The rest is fungible.</br></br>  <br>why are men so obsessed with girls and relationships?<br>You're wasting time you could use for science and shit.</br></br>  <br>no wonder women are so privileged and more educated in this day and age</br>  <br>yes iagree</br>  <br>Boobs</br>  <br>Women are privileged? What fucking planet do you live on? You have no idea how difficult it is to be a woman at this day and age? Have you ever walked down the street or down the aisle in the grocery store and had to wonder if today is the day some fucking nutcase will just go off the deep end and rape you? No? Didn't think so.

In all honesty, if you treat anyone like a subhuman then you're just a shitty person with either an ego problem or you just simply hate people. And if you hate people, at least try to hide it as publicly showing it is just downright embarrassing.<br><br>Respect involves alot of things. First, genuinely listening to what he/she has to say with a willingness to compromise in a meaningful way (this doesn't mean changing who you are or your values, but simply find a common ground). Second, believing in their own goals and ambitions and offering them support. That doesn't mean you can't offer suggestions if you disagree, but it does mean not calling them stupid for wanting to do something with their life you may not inherently agree with or be interested in. And lastly, I'd say just admiring their qualities as part of the person that you love.</br></br></br>  <br> men are treated unfairly in court <br><br>yeah, and for the most part, men make the court rulings, not women.</br></br></br>  <br>Bullshit. I'm a handsome white guy and I get girls just like I want. Respect buahahaha!</br>  A lady in public and a whore in the bedroom.  <br>White men are privileged? What fucking planet do you live on? You have no idea how difficult it is to be a man at this day and age? Have you ever walked down the street or down the aisle in the grocery store and just go off the deep end and rape a woman No? It's really fun and easy.</br>  <br>Men are treated unfairly in court? Aww, you mean they didn't let you get away with raping a woman? Cry me a fucking river.</br>  <br><br>As a guy who loves cooking, I'm pretty damn sure rape doesn't cross my mind at the grocery store. <br><br>Maybe the price of bananas. Rape? Nope, not on the menu. That's some nice exaggeration you have there.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Women are privileged. I hope the next life you will be born a man. It will teach you. Asswipe faggot.</br></br>  <br>I can agree with that, thanks anon. Definitely something I needed to consider. Sometimes I don't agree with my girlfriend, but I still need to support her with what she wants to do and not make her feel stupid for it. The last thing I want to do is shit on her dreams.</br>  <br>Fuck you. Its always rape this rape that blaa blaa blaa. You are mentally disturbed. And society should not be run by sick people.</br>  <br>Maybe not then and there, but if given the chance with no consequences, you will rape. It has been proven that men in times of war will rape women of the enemy nation, sometimes even being commanded to by their officers. No, you may not think about rape every second of the day, but all men will do it, given the chance. This is not my opinion. This is history. It's how nations are conquered. Just because in our current society you have no need for it, does not mean it's not there. ALL men have the innate desire to spray their seed into the womb of foreign, enemy women are pass their line on, this conquering an already oppressed people. REALITY.</br>  <br>Women are not fucking privileged. AT ALL. Shut the fuck up.</br>  <br>prove it</br>  <br><br>Your overgeneralizing. History does not prove that all men rape...it just proves that there are a PERCENTAGE of men who are held bound up by the laws of society and when those constraints aren't there, they go wacko. Again, not ALL men.</br></br>  <br><br>Naw, I don't think so. I hate kids and anything that makes that happen...naw.<br><br>You can just do...whatever it is you do. I willfully uphold the law. The people you seem to dislike the most are the ones who do. Asian and white males.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Michael J Fox didn't rape!</br>  <br><br> loving <br> kind <br> compassionate <br> affectionate <br> peaceful <br> mentally stable <br> playful, energetic, enthusiastic, happy <br> healthy / in decent shape <br> curious, adventurous <br> honesty, genuine, loyal </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Good for you. I'm a handsome white guy too, I just prefer not to be a shitty person. But hey, whatever floats your boat. "Get girls just like I want" - and I'm guessing they don't stay around very long.<br><br>Glad I helped. Thing is, respect is a two way street. Everything I said applies to both people in the relationship. If she can't accept who you are or support you in your endeavors then she isn't the one for you. If you're the one treating her like that, chances are it won't last very long once she gets tired of your bullshit.</br></br></br>  <br>Quite the opposite. A woman can claim a man raped her without any evidence, and the judge and jury will almost always send the innocent man straight to jail because they buy into it just because it's a woman saying it.<br><br>Those situations are practically "guilty until proven innocent" and if you can't prove innocence, tough luck. Women use this to their advantage fairly often as threats and even sometimes follow through with it because they're mad at their ex or want money or whatever. So it really is unfair.<br><br>A man once recorded a girl who was molesting him to use as proof in court later. I'm pretty sure the woman once even tried to claim he raped her at some point in court, could be wrong though. And he still got sent to jail for "voyeurism" because she had her pussy out to tempt him, and he was recording that.<br><br>Literally what the fuck?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>some more:<br><br> good sense of humor <br> confident, not overly fearful or worrisome <br><br>doesn't have to check em all of the list but the more the better.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want her to be dead</br>  <br>Unquestioning obedience reserved for I alone.</br>  <br>Great selections.

Because you know... NO WOMAN gets away with false rape claims and then tells a survey about it.</br>  <br><br>I'd like to see those reports. Men and women both have been convicted of false claims outside of rape by a jury trial. I mean, my sister is expert at it and has told me in private that it's "a shooting gallery to appeal to the jury." Some of the jurors didn't graduate high school.</br></br>  <br>Goto the south.<br>Like Georgia, Tennessee, Louisiana etc<br>They're all over.</br></br></br>  <br>Why the fuck would a woman make up being raped?

Think about the type's of people who typically serve on a jury. Usually they too stupid to figure out how to get out of it. They tend to be very simple people and they tend to do whatever they are told, which is usually by prosecutor because "He's the good guy trying to bring the bad man to justice!"</br>  <br>Sucks to be by yourself</br>  <br>And they all have their dad's and brother's semen in their cunts and their parents are siblings.
