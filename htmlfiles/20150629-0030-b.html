Religion Thread<br><br>We haven't had a true religious discussion on /b/ in a long time</br></br>  <br>Gays can marry and Christians are butthurt<br><br>Can any Christian here explain why they are butthurt</br></br></br>  <br>Gay gene doesn't exist</br>  <br>What exactly do you want to talk about then?</br>  I used to be a christ fag cuz my mom used to tell me as a kid ge was real. There is a story in the book about giants u cereal u believethat shit? And how about that u believe in christianity eventhought jezus was a jew? I quit being christian when i was like 13. Or how about that you need a book to behave normal?    <br>Proof?</br>  religion is brainwash used to control masses and keep people away from any real truth ya big dummies  <br>Nice trips m8. Other athiest in this thread here. The book says it is not holy. Forgot toadd at my story i might join the starwars religion cuz epic lulz</br>  <br>Idk. I kinda just have a gut feeling that in the next century or sooner, we'll see religion as just a silly myth people believed in.<br><br>What do you guys think. Could it happen that soon?</br></br></br>  <br><br>So tobe clair i am this</br></br>  <br>The lack of proof that there is a gay gene</br>  <br><br>2015 - still talking 'bout religion</br></br>  <br>Christians believe in the bible and the bible clearly forbids homosexuality. Some people may try to explain that away, but those people have probably not read the bible. I can give more specifics (passages) if there is interest.</br>  The easiest way I find to show my opinion on religion is through the movie Religulous by Bill Maher. Politics aside, he nailed this movie and religion. I'm sure it's torrentable and is definitely a laugh or two.  <br> 2015 <br> Not flying dank memes <br>Sure feels like summer in here</br></br></br>  <br>Being this buthurt lel m8 pls just stop being a fag about it. There decisoins dont afect you now does it? Ur buthurt man maby god just banged you up the ass?</br>  Bad religion  <br>Sure let's see them</br>  <br>So I guess there is no evidence?</br>  <br>:O</br>  <br>butthurt summerfag christian?</br>  <br>giants were real fuck you</br>  <br>buzzwords: the post</br>  <br>Theres no evidence for either. But it can't be a choice. Unless you can enjoyably be gay for a day</br>  <br>Was not the fag u were talking 2. But place evidence forthe stupid fags who didnt read the book.</br>  <br>I think that once we start connecting the dots of how this gs become interconnected that it may seem obsolete but it also plays a part in developing humanity to its own stage of evolution. Of course, the real issue is are we going to survive each other and is human going to be crushed under it's own weight. Religion is playing a huge role in that right now, as all of us who frequent here know, religions like Islam are are pushing boundaries(not every single person, just radicals). So it is hard to tell if we are going to be able to make it to a point of absolute connection with each other and all of the constructs we have created.</br>  <br>lol yeah i bet youre so intelligent and fulfilled right?<br>really changing the world and living the dream?<br>thats why youre on 4chan at 6 am?</br></br></br>  <br>nahh</br>  <br>it's actually hilarious because you're the one acting like a christian. "Just because there is no proof doesn't mean it doesn't exist Hurrrr" also on a side note i'm bisexual, and i actually don't support gay marriage. It's a christian tradition and they fucking hate us. idk why any intelligent homosexual would want to get married.</br>  <br> being this new <br>Sure feels like summer in here</br></br>  <br>XDDDD DOCUMENT THIS SHIT GUYS SRRY I AM ON PHONE</br>  <br> reply to someone that says christians are butthurt <br> say gay gene doesn't exist <br> gets butthurt </br></br></br>  <br>Leviticus (third book of moses) says: "You shall not lie with a male as with a woman, it is an abomination" , which leaves basically no room for interpretation (Lev 18,20). Also, the story of Sodom and Gomorrah, where two cities where destoryed for their sins, of which one was homosexuality. That story is not as easy to sum up, but basically the male inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah wanted to rape two angels that were sent to the city (disguised as male humans). There are more bible passages on this topic that i have not in my mind.</br>  <br><br>Didnt realy read ur duscusion just wanted to rek. This athiest star wars fag here. Excuse me</br></br>  <br>summarize it for me?</br>  <br> leaves basically no room for interpretation <br>what does it mean to lie?</br></br>  <br>Hey i never said there was no gay gene. This is why 4chan is faily lel</br>  <br> still talking about summer <br>sure feels summer in here</br></br>  <br>i printed it out and put it on me mum's rfrigerator :D</br>  <br> thinks I'm talking about summer <br>anyone else getting hot here?</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>geys i hav photo evident</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It is another thing that you believe that the bible tells lies, my point was to explain why christians condemn homosexuality.</br>  <br>Bill Maher a liberal late night host travels the corners of the world debunking every major religion and offering insight as to why and how religion got to where it is now. <br>Seriously funny interactions.

Bout as close as i'm getting to God this morning.</br>  <br>Mmmmm, kind of. People try to have them, but invariably someone comes in trying to tell all the religious people that they're retards that should be dismissed out of hand or telling the secular people that they're bound for hell and should all be dismissed out of hand. Literally every discussion I've ever seen about it on here degrades into that and it usually happens immediately.</br>  <br>oh yeah haha i didnt think about that.<br><br>the church my mom goes to started accepting gays a year ago so maybe it wont be a big deal here</br></br></br>  <br>do you think masturbation is a type of prayer?<br>are you mexican?</br></br>  <br>Plus the fact that the only religious threads were with that stupid chick and only questioning atheism</br>  <br>maybe because no one has anything else to talk about</br>  <br>wow that guy really hates atheism</br>  <br>To them, there's a difference between liking gays and liking gay marriage.

Hurt like hell for years before it ever showed up on a MRI.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Possibly psychosomatic. A lot of chronic non objective pain, particularly back pain can be unexpressed emotion and stress. Sounds hippy dippy but there seems to be some anecdotal truth to it. For example I get issues where I feel like I have to piss all the time and it hurts to pee when I'm really stressed out and under slept. There's nothing that show up on any tests. It's just stress. Stress causes lots of health problems. Get into meditation, regular exercise, and talk therapy. It might help.</br>  <br>  <br>I agree with that assessment, though be it quite unspesific. Myfacial release and Mckenzie would probably sort you out. 85% of lumbarpain cases are "unspesific". Do yoga, take a walk every day, preferably in rural areas and hope to fuck your physio is competent.

Return of the Jedi idk xD  Ask a Greekfag anything.  PAY DEBT, YOU LAZY GREASY GREEK  <br>Well mr.faggot, it all seems that the debt will not be paid. <br>The question is, if the eurozone will stand still.</br></br>  They are definitely not Lannisters, if you know what I mean...  <br><br>bank holiday? atm's closed? do you expect to leave the EU / euro? what do you think your country should do? have you withdrawn your cash from the banks yet? ( i hope you've got your cash and have prepared, food, water, etc.. )</br></br>  <br>Why are you such a debt dodging faggot?</br>  Why don't you lazy faggots pay your taxes. Look what you've done.  <br>Why are you welching on your legally binding deal fucktard.<br><br>Pay up you greasy, hairy, fat fucks.</br></br></br>  <br>whats the general expecations of you greeks in regards to the referendum? Will you vote for or against the offer of the euro-zone?</br>  <br>Why does Greeks does not want to work and does not want emigrants working?</br>  Why is your country so lazy and corrupted?  <br>are you planning on leaving?<br><br>if not what weapons will you carry in the riots/civil war of the next week?</br></br></br>  <br>Wheres our 240 billion?</br>  being lazy for the winnnnn  What's it like to live in a country that used to rule the world and now is a quaint, rather insignificant backwater? I guess we could ask any European that as well.  why do you people look like Turks  <br>By joining the Euro your country got low interest rates and used it to borrow like fucking crazy until they were bankrupt. Is this a widespread cultural stupidity. Like, If you have massive credit card debt and your retired fixed income parents agreed to payoff your loans if you promised to pay them back interest free, would you begin to act responsibly or would you go get two more credit cards and max those fucker out again? Just how entitled are the Greek people?</br>  What will happen if this deal falls through and you can't pay debts?<br>I'm being serious here, what will happen to your country and what has your government said?</br>  <br>This greasy greek is so lazy that he wont even answer our questions.</br>  <br><br>Aren't you ashamed to have stolen money from people? From french people, german people and many others?<br>Did you know that your debt is held by people?<br>Those people asked for nothing, you just took their money and won't repay them.<br>You guys should be ashamed and of course, it also means no countries will ever help you again</br></br></br></br></br>  Do you find it manipulative that people blame banks and the financial crisis for Greeks problems rather than the Greek government for irresponsible borrowing to finance gold plated pension and luxury wage increases while allowing the wealthy to evade taxes?  We've been trolled by op  <br>I love 4chan for posts like this...<br><br>But seriously you wet back greek fat fucks. Answer the question.</br></br></br>  <br>why you don't pay debts?</br>  <br>lol<br>How does it feel to successfully troll the entire world, Greece?</br></br>  <br>Opinion on the GD?</br>  <br>Kek. All my this.</br>  Do you think greece will leave EU / abandon the Euro?  <br>There is right now a bank run.<br>O don't know yet if I should vote YES (to the EU austerity measures) or NO. <br>If we vote for YES, the new austerity measures will make the economy collapse. The taxation will be at extremely high rates, but troika will keep on lending money, so we'll be paying our debts. So, typically, no bankrupcy. <br>If we vote for NO, well, sudden death. Grexit, ank no one knows what's next.<br><br><br>No no plans right now. Many firens have left, many will leave, but I have no plans right now.<br><br><br>The debt can't be paid. Greece is producing nothing, and the austerity has made a lot of bussinesses leave the country. So no, a debt of 320billion cant be paid.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I got extra Milo and more weed and time off work to watch the next few days like a movie. Please don't let your guv pay up, I really want to watch the world laziest riot.  <br> Implying <br>Imp. Lying.<br><br>lol</br></br></br></br>   implying the greek people had anything to do with this <br> implying /b/ have any idea why this debt crisis is. <br>uneducated merucans</br></br>  <br>Why doesn't Greece stamp out it's corruption and widespread tax dodging? Why do Greek people think they can be in a wider European community and enjoy the benefits but are too lazy to pay their taxes to stay in it? Are Greeks special somehow? Why do get get everything they want and throw their toys out of their pram when the taxman comes?</br>  <br>Kek</br>  Will you let the Orthodox Church continue to dip its hands in your government?    just saiyan'  should people who're on holiday there right now be worried?  <br>THEY FUCKING PAID PENSION TO DEAD PEOPLE.<br><br>THEY SPEND MOST OF THEIR TIME TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO NOT PAY TAXES.</br></br></br>  <br>Why do Greeks still think it's ok to retire 10 years earlier than every other country in the EU. You lazy, tax dodging corrupt greasy irresponsible fucks.</br>  HAHAHAH GREECE Y NO U WORK XDDDDD  <br><br>from us here. prob be best if greece voted against further austerity, and told the eu central banks / IMF to go fuck themselves. IMF / central european banks are all a bunch of criminals and fraudsters anyhow. greece is not the only country with insane debt they can never pay back, nearly every major country in the world is near bankruptcy with it's debt.. including the us with 18 trillion in debt, and CHINA... greece may be the canary in the coal mine so to speak, but other eu countries are also in peril.. spain comes to mind. the way forward is to get rid of the global central banks, and for each individual country to re assert it's sovereignty.. let the euro die, establish solid currencies backed by gold for your country... don't let foreign banks enslave your people and run them into deeper poverty with austerity.</br></br>  <br>Russia will come after you.</br>  <br> The debt can't be paid. Greece is producing nothing, and the austerity has made a lot of bussinesses leave the country. So no, a debt of 320billion cant be paid. <br>That wasn't the question. The question was - is this inbred, cultural stupidity? Why the fuck did you borrow what you couldn't pay back? You know, like not reading questions before you answer.</br></br>    <br>there wasn't any question you dumbfuck</br>  The next five years will be bad man.<br><br>But then we'll all be coming over to holiday, because you have history, great food, lovely climate and it'll also be cheap.</br></br>  <br> be Greece <br> fuck up economy <br> promise to fix for 300 billion loan <br> kek only joking <br> fixing economy is hard work and we all just bought new boats on credit, time for a party </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Greek bankers and politicians are crooked as fuck. The people fester in poverty getting paid in IOU's and are owed years of back pay, reducing circulation to disastrous levels and creating a shadow economy, economically destroying the entire country. Greece borrows cash to fix it, but pockets the fucking money without paying the people, putting the cash back in circulation, or winding back up the legitimate economy &amp; generating the tax revenue it needs to survive.<br><br>Same fucking shit Spain, Italy, Ireland, and USA did, only Greece has been at it far longer. This is your future, the rest of you.</br></br></br>  <br> they <br>not the people, the politicians did you neckbeard, calm down before you sprain an ankle</br></br>  The problem is the Greek mindset. They barely work, they have way too many holidays, they have zero ambition, and everything was given to them with no realistic way of getting payment returned.<br><br>In best long term solution is for them to leave the EU and the Euro. Sure, it'll screw with the rest of the EU a bit, but Germany and France are sure to cover everyone and recover quickly.<br>But the real treat comes from Greece going down the shitter. The country will get so fucked and destroyed that as soon as the dust settles they can start rebuilding from scratch, and hopefully the firey passion from thousands of years ago will be ignited once more.<br><br>tl;dr<br>throw Greece out of the EU to let them crash and burn so that they can rebuild from scratch</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>eu give money to banks not to greeks</br>  <br>ummmmm one big NO</br>  <br>Church has a great power here. Both politically and economically. I hope that the crisis will make this power fade out... But during crisis, people usually turn to god, so....<br><br><br>This<br><br><br>If eurogroup doesn't decide something until tomorrow, then it's almost certain that we'll leave €.<br><br><br>Fascists. Nothing more, nothing less.<br><br><br>Your money, asshole, were spent (amongst others) in the guns your country made.<br><br><br>The answer was not going to you, asshole. To your "question", the corrupted politicians borrowed the money, in order to pay the people working in the Public Sector, and of course, make (their corrupted) deals with German, French Russian (and other) companies. Happy now?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Greece <br> rebuild <br><br>Sounds like hard work. The Greeks will probably just leave it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This, plz. It'll also encourage Italy, Spain and Ireland to actually pay their debts (which they can, if barely, afford).</br>  Where's the fucking money?  <br>Foreign wealthy fucks will continue to buy and carve up your countrys real estate into little pieces and sell them to each other.<br><br>We will get your country as a vacation destination, and you Greek people can live on the streets in slums and mow our lawns (of your old homes) for bread money.<br><br>And that's just how we want it.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>THE OLD GODS ARE ALIVE AND WELL MY FRIEND ! :D</br>  <br>in EU banks</br>  <br><br>Oh, sorry, is rebuilding your own country too hard for you?

Britfag here, <br>Thanks for supporting the end of the Euro annon. <br> raises glass </br></br>  Greece is a great example of both the political left and right getting their way. Rich ass pensions and wage increases, no taxes for the wealthy, and borrow like a motherfucker to fund it all. And don't blame the government. They people put them there again and again, it's been going on for decades. Consequences, Greekfags.  I think EU should just kill every greek and turn the whole country into a one huge Las Vegas.  <br><br>Ireland isn't actually too bad. They just go about taxation the wrong way. I think Ireland is an easy fix if Germany, France, or another rich nation sends over some professionals to advise them.<br><br>The Irish government has the problem that for the most part they're trying to do the right thing, they're just a little retarded as to how to do it.</br></br></br></br>  She wants you to tell her how rough you'd fuck her  Skull fuck.
