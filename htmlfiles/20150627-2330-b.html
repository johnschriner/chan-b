Stop picking on Eruka!</br>  <br>Eruna in my district?<br>We lost already..</br></br>  why is it that everytime i visit america i see the american flag being displayed EVERYWHERE!. Its inside Walmarts, outside restaurants, at every town plaza, under every bridge, at every school and university. It is displayed throughout 50% of houses in a single block. You can not drive 10 miles without seeing an american flag. My question is why? in my home country (france), you cant display the french flag because it can be considered racist by some, only government and famous monuments can properly display the flag   france <br>kek</br>  because we are proud of our country  feels bad to be french  because why the fuck not?  ever since 9/11 and the war in iraq, people have put up flags as a support of our military but since it is over people have been too lazy to take them down  <br>Because you are a tourist. And where foreigners vacation America is displaying their flags with pride. That happens no where else. There's one at school, one at any government building. That's about it. And well Wal-Mart is Wal-Mart</br>  <br>this</br>  <br>Cuz 'MURICA!<br><br>and this<br/></br></br></br>  <br>when i tour other countries like the UK and Germany i do not see anywhere near the same amount of national flags as i see in the states</br>  <br><br>That is because the frogs are a bunch of cheese eating surrender monkeys. Nothing to be proud of.</br></br>  the american flag is racist as well, remember the native americans?  i was wondering the same thing  <br> France </br>  the french are dirty people  <br>this</br>  <br> Muh vagina has sand in it <br>Why do you care so much about a nation taking pride in its sovereignty?</br></br>  <br>because most other countries, like france (lol) don't have shit to be proud of, and they are ashamed of their shit country</br>  <br>The Frenchfries get triggered by the white in our flags.</br>  <br>Nationalism us a crazy drugdrug.</br>  <br>Except nobody gives a fuck about those useless drunks.</br>   france <br>AHAHAHAHHA MUDSLIME INFESTED COUNTRY, you guys have terrorist attacks every few days</br>  <br>fucking this</br>  <br>Don't worry froggie, the American flag is the next to go. We'll all be socialists like you soon enough.</br>  <br>why would any one care that some1 might find your flag racist? if you have any patrioticy in you yiu then shove your flag in their face. because it is your right. and no im not an american</br>  <br>I have an American flag blanket I come into every night. Muh favorite</br>  <br> France <br> gave us Statue of Liberty </br></br>  only way to keep americans employed is by making sure they're constantly making and buying made in the USA flags   I'm French <br> Put up French flag in yard with pride <br> Mudslime neighbor are pissed <br> They burn my flag while I'm away <br> Go see the police <br> Tell me to fuck off <br> MFW France is now Middle East <br> MFW I can't be pride of my homeland </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Proud* my bad</br>  <br>I dont believe you</br>  <br>kek</br>  <br><br>Your flag is pristine, fly it with pride froggie.<br><br>pic related</br></br></br></br>  <br>enjoy your diversity</br>  <br>Isn't socialism wonderful? You must be so proud to live in such a tolerant and diverse country</br>  <br> france <br>Please, stop complaining about our nation long enough to fix your own.</br></br>  <br>Because Americans are brainwashed. They live in a country that shit on themselves and where they have 0 liberty, 0 privacy, and more like in a oligarchy than a democracy, but their government made huge manipulations and propaganda to make perfect patriot puppets.<br><br>This country have no story, it's been constructed over a huge genocide, they're just english and other european colons, they shouldn't be nationalist at all, but they're one of the most nationalist and chauvinist people of the world.<br>This pride is just made by the government so mass of people are more easily manipulable and people won't mind being shit on or suffer for no reason if they're said "it's for murica".<br><br>This is also for that reason that all these poor people repeat all the time that they're "so free" and that the national symbol of their country is "freedom". <br>They're one of the less free country right after north korea, russia, china and other shit countries, but they keep that FREEDOM all the time.<br><br>It's just sad that americans are so stupid and their government are such assholes, I don't have anything against the people actually.<br><br>But I think being american is one of the worst thing to be proud of.<br>Especially when you see over what the country is built on like a said.<br>A colony establishing after a genocide and which is not race mixed with the african slaves they forced to make come on their land to serve them. Both races hate themselves, they have a shitty story, no root, yet no one want to recognize they have european or african origins.<br><br>This is america.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  too much nationalism  because americans are brainwashed into being nationalistic retards at an early age by their school system.<br><br>in most civilised countries nationalists are generally considered a pain in the ass. being proud of something you have no control over, i.e. where you're born, is what people who achieve nothing use to increase their feelings of self worth.<br><br>i might be a fat cunt working in mcdonalds, but i'm working in mcdonalds in murka! greatest country in the world!<br><br>you see it in belfast in northern ireland. you know you've entered a poverty stricken shithole estate because they've flags on every lamppost. if they took the flags down they'd instantly increase the value of their properties by 20%, but they are too stupid to do this.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I wouldn't even care if they worked and adapted to the country's tradition but nah, they are like niggers, but they fuck goats and don't make good cuck materials</br></br>  <br>Sounds like France is the one with issues. Seriously though, I live in Texas and can't think of the last time I saw the US flag. I know they have one at my town's government building, but at Walmart and every other house on the block? Give me a break. <br><br>... unless you were here the few months following 9/11, then yeah, that was pretty ridiculous.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh look, another America-hater. You sure are cool and socially-relevant! You certainly think outside the box to come up with such original and unique ideas about another country! <br><br>Surely, you are ahead of the game hating the United States, and have in no way hopped on a bandwagon like some mindless sheep following whatever seems popular at the time. Surely your obsession with the United States is warranted and does not in any way make you seem strangely fixated on a country other than your own.</br></br></br>  <br>... <br><br>You two should get married. It's legal here now.</br></br></br>  france will soon be an islamic country  <br> France <br> Socialism <br>Fucking kek</br></br></br>  <br><br>All fascist regimes are the same.</br></br>  <br>Holy fuck kek</br>  You can also add to all of this that even their educational system is brainwashing:<br><br>in many other countries, you learn to be a critic, to question things, to have your own opinion, to make things better, etc...<br><br>In america, their educational system is like "it's like that, eat what we say and deal with it", it's more like force-opening skull of kids, putting things on it without letting them choice, pushing everything and closing it.<br><br>And then you wonder why they're all brainwashed? In other dictatorial countries, they openly oppress people, in america, they make them believe they're free, but it's not that different.<br><br>That's why you see flags everywhere, people are conditioned to "love" their country, even if they have no reason to, just because it's interesting for their government.<br><br>This is actually sad. Also cringe-worthy when you see dumb extreme nationalists patriots etcs exhibing their pride everywhere. But mostly sad.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>not sure what you're trying to say, but it sure sounds like a lot of butthurt jealousy to me</br>  <br>Texas seems to display the lone star flag more than the U.S flag</br>  Well no shit, people have to show their neighbors how they aren't damn commies, and are, in fact, american. Fuck this country, shame that it's actually not too bad. We complain, foreigners complain, but I don't really give a shit, as long as I have food, shelter, water, weed, and a good source of entertainment. What's the big deal? It's not like they're brainwashing us or anything. Life is pretty good. I'm not waving an american flag around displaying how proud I am of our troops, or our country, I don't give a shit, as long as my life is moderately good to fucking amazing. If you think about it, this country isn't the best, but at least it's not some 3rd world country, or a country that has had a war taken place in it. France seems nice, but I don't get how it bothers you that there are constant reminders of what country you're in.  <br><br>Exactly this....</br></br>  all these european countries where you cant display your own nations flag because its "racist" to some? are u fucking kidding me? that is pathetic  <br> look at all of these stereotypes I've accumulated during my time here on four chan <br><br>Where are you from, anon?</br></br></br>  Fun fact: when I was little, in school, we learned the national anthem.<br>Today children don't...<br>That's a shame.<br> I'm French </br></br></br>  <br>You didn't even read what I said.<br>I don't hate you guys, I have american friends too, and I have absolutely nothing against the people.<br><br>It's just that your government is manipulating you and are assholes.<br>And you guys eat everything and dance like puppets.<br><br>You just prove me again that you guys are dumb as fuck, you can't even understand a simple block of text. But I don't hate you, man. I'm cool, I could totally hang out with you, as people, american people are chill and cool. The problem is their government and the country itself.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>To be honest, I see more people complaining about people that love america than actually love america. They're alive, suck it up, buttercup. What purpose does brainwashing citizens serve? It's not like the government is plotting some conspiracy for global takeover. (or ARE THEY?)</br>  <br>Coz we are so stupid, we cant remember where we live, wihtout flags everywhere</br>  <br>this</br>    <br>KEK</br>  <br>JADE HELM 15</br>  Must suck being french. Great food, great wine, lovely scenery, good climate, yet all of that is totally outweighed by having to deal with french people.  <br>Is the thing about not being able to fly the French flag because some can consider it racist real?</br>  has anyone actually seen a christianity flag being flown anywhere in the bible belt? just learned that its actually a flag  <br>Welcome to the nation of compensation. Big flags. Big cars. Big guns. Doesn't take a psycologist to see what's going on.</br>  <br>hahah come on dude you can't really be this naive<br>the US government is deep into mind control/population control<br>don't be a dumbass</br></br></br>  <br> considered racist <br>No... Its Nationalist, Rassismus has nothing to do with... Nationalism lead us to wars with other countries in the past...</br></br>    <br>displaying the standard of your country is one way to show you are truly proud to live where you do, regardless of the faults it may have. we display the American flag because we like living in America. <br><br>If you like living in France, you should be allowed to display it's standard. the fact that you are not is kind of disgraceful. your gov't is kinda fucked.</br></br></br>  <br>Let's start dismantling your argument, shall we?<br> you guys eat everything <br>Stereotype. http://www.livestrong.com/article/3<wbr>40188-obesity-in-america-compared-t<wbr>o-europe/<br>Cliff notes:<br> Europe is competing for highest obesity rates with US.  <br>This disparity can be attributed more to technological advancement than individual stupidity. The United States just started bio-engineering food sooner than most of Europe. <br> Dance like puppets <br>Really? Are you 12? Jesus christ what a ridiculous argument. Have you BEEN to Amsterdam, or are you just spouting shit because the food argument was all you had?<br> you just PROVE me again that you guys are dumb as fuck, you can't understand -- <br>I understand enough to know that your grasp of my language is mediocre.<br> your people are cool though, your government just sucks  <br>This statement applies to most countries in the world.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br><br>welcome to the 21st century. you almost sound proud.<br><br>actually, if there was one word that sprung to mind when I hear someone talk about the USA, that it: PRIDE</br></br></br></br>  i love seeing the american flag being flown just about everywhere here in penn  <br>Also why the fuck are you going in to a Walmart</br>  <br>this guy knows whats up</br>  <br>Does the tin foil have to be against your scalp to work, or can it sit loose on the head?</br>  <br>Do you have any proof? It actually seems plausible, but it obviously failed, because there are people like me who don't outright hate this country, but don't love it. It's basically home. That's all it is. Not the "best country in the world" or some shit, just where I live, nothing special. I'm not starving, so who gives a shit? I'm not going to fight for the government. In what way am I contributing to global domination? Please explain this. THey're in ouR MindS, man. TheY VCan See us@. SuBlimiNal MEssaGes EverYwhERE! DISNEY MOVIES, MAN</br>  The irony of this thread....<br><br>Both France and United States of America are hated nations. <br>Actually France and USA are 2 of the most hated countries in the world.<br><br>But the main difference is that:<br> USA are hated for their government and the country itself. <br> France are hated for their PEOPLE. <br><br>This is sad but this is true. <br>Americans are not assholes, but their government is.<br>French government is not that bad and the country is cool, but the French people are terrible and obnoxious and make it unbearable.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>hurr durr jet fuel cant melt steel beams, hurr durr chemtrails and jade helm 15, hurr durr alex jones water filters are the only answer</br>  OP, you need to understand that there's a sense of pride in being American that the rest of you--the Protected--will never know.<br><br>Providing the Pax Americana, making most of the technological advances that have so transformed human experience, effortlessly achieving cultural influence the likes of which the world has never seen... We Americans do not take individual pride for what we have all accomplished, but we are immensely grateful for living in this time and place.</br></br>  <br> welcome to the 21st century <br>You do realize that the true reason gay marriage wasn't passed sooner in this country was the desire to adhere to the Constitution, not the gay-hating ignorant honkies that Sky News digs out of the Ozarks to interview for higher ratings? <br><br>You do realize this, correct?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Americans are not assholes <br>thanks anon, i needed a good laugh this morning</br></br>  GOD BLESS AMERICA!  it's funny to see a french man talking about the nationalism of another country (even if it's legitimate) when you wee how chauvinist french people are.<br><br>These people think they're above everyone else in the world.</br></br>  <br>Kek'd by truth.<br>Murica still needs a bit more of education though</br></br>  <br>France, suck my Aryan cock</br>  france is a fucking islamic shithole, along with sweden and germany.

Beware, my friend.</br>  my amerifag friend told me that you guys do a salute at the start of each school day to the flag<br><br>that's fucking nuts. you guys do know that, right? weirdest level of propaganda shit. no wonder you're all so hyper sensitive whenever anybody criticises the US</br></br>  <br> You do realize that the true reason gay marriage wasn't passed sooner in this country was the desire to adhere to the Constitution <br><br>I think it's the insurance companies who kept pressure on the lawmakers to not legalize it. <br><br>Man with health insurance marries a woman, she gets his health insurance. If gay marriage was legal, then those insurance companies would have to also insure the spouse. If gay marriage is illegal, they wouldn't have to cover the spouse. <br><br>Like all things, it all comes down to the money. <br><br>I fucking hate the modern era some times.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because its America faggot</br>  <br>Je me suis posé la même question la dernière fois que j'ai visité la Suède.

This is ignoring the fact that most European countries are significantly smaller, allowing for better organization and smaller class sizes for students. <br><br>Like comparing inner-city schools to smaller districts, comparing the US to, say, Finland (a country with 1/60th the population) is ridiculous.</br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br> This country have no story, <br> proceeds to list things from its story <br>Nigga you what?</br></br></br>   Vacation in France <br> Can't find any French flags <br> After 4 days notice that the local drunks have been tearing down the flags for use as toilet paper <br> No free public toilets in France </br></br></br>  <br>Most white country*</br>  <br> After 4 days notice that the local drunks have been tearing down the flags for use as toilet paper <br>kek</br></br>  <br>KEK</br>  <br>Stoners are fucking stupid, don't pair me with those dumbasses.</br>  <br>Yeah, fuck being patriotic. No one else does that.<br> hurry Europe, South America, China, and everyone else, hide Soccer somewhere! </br></br>  <br>This nobody gives a fuck about then anymore</br>  <br>Can't hear you over my freedom and loud ass weed. Fuck outta here</br>  <br>I'd believe this before believing that 100 million rednecks are afraid joe-bob might divorce louanne to marry steve.</br>    <br>The Chinese are patriotic as hell too, only their nationalism adds a nice helping of ethnic and racial pride along with a big dollop of xenophobia and a monstrous inferiority complex. It's a potent mix.</br>  <br>It's to keep American citizens brainwashed into loving and supporting their country despite how ever many atrocities they commit.</br>  <br>ya mon. Good times. One day, I'm going to the moon! nice bite, fish.</br>  <br>Seriously ? Man that's young nazi's level of fucked up.</br>  <br>I'm from the part that survived 6 years against 3 superpowers and that lost three times more soldiers on the east (Soviet) front then the west (US and British) front.<br>Also that shit happened 70 years ago and neither you or I where alive then, so fuck of with your bait, that you think of as actually valid.</br></br>  <br>I can hear you over your homosex legal marriage.</br>  <br>Because we're not hicks from the south.</br>  <br> I got wrecked because literally every country cries when the opposing team scores in soccer (oops, futbol) <br> i'll hurry and find an insulting American pic on Google! That'll show him! </br></br>  <br> You can also add to all of this that even their educational system is brainwashing: <br> in many other countries, you learn to be a critic, to question things, to have your own opinion, to make things better, etc... <br> In america, their educational system is like "it's like that, eat what we say and deal with it", it's more like force-opening skull of kids, putting things on it without letting them choice, pushing everything and closing it. <br><br>It's more that the average American is too dumb already to question things. Most Americans are descended from the dumbest Europeans who immigrated for material gain alone.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>HA HA HA HA!!!</br></br>  <br>Because we are not a bunch of "Cheese Eating, Surrender Monkeys" AKA French People</br>  <br>Which part of the U.S.? I'd wager the east coast. Come to California, specifically the Bay Area and you won't see any of that. We have public demonstrations supporting ISIS, I fucking hate where I live.</br>  <br> france <br><br>is that a new fries?</br></br></br>    <br> I'm making shit up on the internet mommy. <br>You right now.</br></br>  <br>What an argument...</br>  <br>Why do your people cry during soccer games?</br>  <br>Good for you man. Going to sleep.</br>  <br>tell me about it. make any academic or unbiased criticism though and they'll bite your fucking head off</br>  <br><br>Man the fuck up. It's okay to admit that someone is better. <br><br>In life, generally, there will be someone who's better than you in almost everything. <br><br>Just accept it, and move on,. It's a lot easier that way. <br><br>Faggot.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nobody but you did that. Congrats stoner</br>  <br>I'm American and I agree with you. The first sign of the government going insane and completely taking our liberties then I'm flying across seas, own property in Greece but since it stinks of socialism I'll have to find another place, any suggestions?</br>  <br>Faggot</br>  <br>soccer is a choice, dude. i fucking hate it and it's easy to stay away from it.<br><br>you're shoving propaganda down your kids throats, and if they don't turn up to school the police come round and force them to</br></br></br>  <br>Goodnight, son. Run along.</br>  <br>Because they are retarded.</br>  <br> Implying americunts are better in anything else than spending unnecessary amounts of money on their military and still need ten years to find a nigger hiding in the desert </br>  <br><br>No one would want to immigrate to that shit catholic Poland anyway.</br></br>  <br>No we don't. Immigrants protested that it's "racist", tucking bullshit. It's banned to do at public schools now.</br>  <br>Ive visited mainly the east coast but also Texas, AZ, and california. I was in L.A and i did see a good amount of american flags there even though it is in the west coast</br>  <br>This.</br>  <br> It's okay to admit that someone is better. <br><br>No it isn't. An American doesn't believe in his own faults. Patriotism to an American is the child-like sense that anything is possible. That's why America dominates world culture.</br></br></br>  <br>I think the only people who hate France for the french are americans. Most Europeans hate them because of history</br>  <br>This.... faggot</br>  <br>Best reply. (Top kek)</br>  <br> YOU WILL SEE A NEW FLAG VERY SOON <br> EVERYWHERE </br></br>  <br>Lets wait and see how Tyrone prime minister and Didier Drogba with Ooga Booga will rule countries as Sweden, France or Finland.</br>  <br>fuck outta her with that gay shit fag, ill peel your wig off clown</br>  <br>KEK</br>  <br> you're shoving propaganda... <br>A flag isn't propaganda, nor is pledging allegiance to it. It's done to instill pride in one's country. <br><br>Austria, Greece, Denmark, Norway, and Finland require compulsory military service. I could argue that's shoving something much stronger down the throats of the youths of those respective countries. <br><br> if they don't turn up to school the police come round and force them to <br>It's called truancy, and it's done to ensure that children have access to an education.

You got there and fucked up anyone who wasnt a paleface and you've spent almost 250 years doing literally nothing but fucking up anyone with more melanin than you. Dont pretend america is based on anything else, because it never was and it never will be.</br></br>  Because we dont have as many white flags as you Frenchies do  <br>I dont think he meant "eating" literally.</br>  <br>You southerner are retarded.<br><br>Don't get me wrong, as a socialist I am in favor of you having the right to sport any flag you want. I think this is stupid, but you have the right to be stupid and I'd like to see Obama's administration taken down a peg.<br><br>So i'll give you a little trick. That's from a friend, really.<br><br>Your flag is banned ? Tough shit. Print this flag or a flag like that, instead and sport it EVERYWHERE YOU CAN.<br><br>If that gets viral, you'll spread the right message : flags are just symbols and banning them is as stupid as banning words.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You do realize Europe utilized slavery of multiple cultures, including African Americans, as recently as WWII? <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=His<wbr>tory_of_slavery#Modern_era<br><br>Get off your goddamn high horse.</br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>Given the tendency for Eurofags to point out American obesity, can you blame me for making that assumption?</br>  <br><br>your logic is slightly flawed.<br><br> If you want to show your support for America, carry around an ISIS flag! </br></br></br></br>  <br>LA is full of mexicans. They at least try.<br>Bay area = hipsters and lazy niggers.</br></br>  <br>I have no support for america and YPG is doing the groundwork against ISIS. I'll show support for america against ISIS when they'll have boots on the ground.</br>  <br>You name me a country of any significances that has never exploited another country or underclass within for it's own selfish gains.</br>  I'm not a nationalist, but I wish the UK would fly it's flags more. When I holiday in Turkey or America I see their flags proudly displayed everywhere I go. It's nice to see a country that has pride in what it is.<br><br>Pic related. Our politicians think being proud is something to be laughed at.</br></br>  <br>Probably not.</br>  <br><br>what's your point? I never said Europe didn't. Europe at least fought each other though, they fought rich white people too. You had a civil war once over who was allowed to kill and enslave more brown people and when you realised you'd been killing white people you instantly decided as a culture that fighting an even war against an organized enemy with comparable equipment was for chumps and you've only ever attacked uneducated non-white people living in the iron age ever since.</br></br>  <br>Tell me about it pablo</br>  <br>Oh pls, the bay area is cluttered with american flags. At one point that thing flying from the top of SFs highest hill was the biggest in the country.</br>  <br><br>I never said america was special for doing that , I was making the point that america is NOT special. It isnt doing anything different and never has, it's just another evil empire with a big stick, like all the ones before it and all the ones that will come after it.</br></br>  <br>  50% of Latinos are white </br>  <br>You can only fly it in most european countries on holidays and such. One of the signs this continent is severely traumatized and burdened by WW2 and other historic events that fucked things like patriotism up.</br>  <br> Latinos <br> white </br></br>  <br> the gay area <br>say it right you fucking faggot.</br></br>  <br>Meh, you can fly a German flag here in Germany, if you feel the need to. Most people will think you are retarded, but as long ass you don't live in a shitskin infested neighbourhood, nobody will do anything about it</br>  <br>there are alot of latinos that closely resemble europeans</br>  <br>So Europeans never went down to Africa and raped and pillaged. They never used firearms against people just had primitive weapons? <br><br>Europeans didn't subjugate China, and India? They didn't colonize the Country's of the near east as well?</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, we've solely been responsible for attacking other countries. <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_<wbr>of_wars_involving_the_United_States<wbr>#21st_century_wars<br>Just look at how civilized Europe avoids conflict with those non-whites.</br></wbr></wbr></br></br>  seeing the american flag everywhere is cringe for me.  <br>Europe colonized everything. Otherwise there would be no America, so be thankful to the great white man</br>  <br>You miss why America is special, the reason is we don't hide our shame and make excuses for it. We actually have tried to make things right.<br><br>However flawed our efforts have been they are still there. America is the first country to ever rebuild other country after we had to go and straighten things up.<br><br>Also holding the mistakes of people or a government that happened decades if not centuries ago is just poor logic.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The reason is europe is forced by nato and uno to get involved.</br>  <br>So Canadians know when they are lost.</br>  <br> forced <br>A “NATO decision” is the expression of the collective will of all 28 member countries since all decisions are taken by consensus.<br>http://www.nato.int/nato-welcome/</br></br></br>  <br>france is fucked up :D <br><br>Don't like your boss? Just cut his head off</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Its a quality that every empire throughout history exhibited. The standards of that nation is displayed excessively throughout. France did this as well prior to the 20th century.</br></br></br>  <br> Also holding the mistakes of people or a government that happened decades if not centuries ago is just poor logic. <br>You tell me about it</br></br>  <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casus<wbr>_foederis</wbr></br>  <br>Germany?</br>  <br><br>how fucking dense are you? I said that europe did the same shit america does, but also fought each other and other advanced nations whilst america only beats up on the poor and uneducated</br></br>  <br>It's because America is such a large, spread out, ideologically diverse country that if we weren't reminded that we lived in it every 30 seconds our adhesive patriotism would dissolve and our empire would dissolve into shitty little well managed cohesive countries like that god awful Europe.</br>  <br>Americans need their flag on everything. I'd like to say its because they're all fucking imbeciles (which is true). The real truth is that its to re-enforce the every day American's personal confidence in their country, Like a sort of brain washing, this is what 'they' belong to, this flag is 'who they are', to question their flag is to betray their country.<br><br>They're retarded. Why do you think most Americans aren't even willing to question those 9/11 sand people blast points.</br></br></br>  <br> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casu<wbr>s_foederis</wbr> <br>This article has only been invoked once: on September 12, 2001, in response to the 9/11 attacks on the United States.<br><br>So we call on our allies once, and we're warmongering maniacs trying to destroy non-whites, with the rest of the modern world as our unwilling accomplices? <br><br>Give me a fucking break.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>topkek</br>  <br>That is the most ridiculous argument in this thread.</br>  <br>Pretty much this. America has it right.</br>  Oh wait, so let me put up the german flag real quick...<br><br>Damn! I can't. I would be considered a racist by everyone.<br><br>Inb4 americans saying we have nothing to be proud of:<br>  USA government spying on german engineering industry </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> spewing more stereotypes because he hasn't seen all his eurofriends dragged across the coals above him. </br>    <br> make people believe there's a strong and beautiful link between a country and its military <br> make people love being from that country <br> profit </br></br></br>  <br>Vietnam was lost on the political front because the public sentiment toward the war was negative and politicians wanted votes.

The chances of it being the same person is pretty low.</br>  Kristin. I think she visited in my dreams again...  <br>But, like, I have no game. I sincerely doubt I could ever find another woman, and I don't think I want to go back to dating men. I fell ass backward into this relationship based purely on sex and like, I love her? I'm pretty sure? I don't think I've ever been "in love" but basically I feel more connected to her than anyone.<br><br>I guess I just feel more and more like, 24 is too old to move in with my parents again. And what the fuck do I know? Maybe I'm just being a baby and our issues are normal and I'm blowing shit out of proportion, y'know?</br></br></br>  <br>I want to kill myself now thinking about her. Fuck. I love her.</br>  Lulu  <br>I know that feel too well bro. It's been almost 3 years since my last relationship ended. I loved her, But I broke contact with her and do not care about her anymore. Ever since then I met many girls but I never felt anything anymore for any of them. Don't get me wrong, I am sexually attracted to many of the girls I know or see in real life, but I cannot be bothered. I would like to fall in love again. Oh well.</br>  Meganne  Kristen. She is absolutely amazing in every way, but isn't ready for a relationship.

Allyson. A real bitch to the bones but I want to lick her asshole and have her peg me. It's how I get to sleep every night, masturbating to the thought.  <br>"I love her? I'm pretty sure"<br>I'll say it again. Grow a pair.<br>Dude. If you follow this path someday you will wake up and realize you haven't loved this woman in 15 years and now you have kids and you have to deal with them and do what's best for them with this person you don't love and everything is complicated and there's never enough money and you ALWAYS fap to other women and ALL of this can be stopped right now. Literally today if you just faced it. 24 is young man. So young you're lucky enough to not know you're young. No game? WHO CARES? No life because you're on /b/ looking for answers about the shitshow you created. I care. /b/rother. I'm signing off. Wake up and go fell the sun. It's beautiful out there if you want only to feel it.</br></br></br>  <br>Molly. I have a girlfriend now but I still think about her. God I need help</br>  <br>Edit. Feel. Not fell.
