Don't do it, unless you are a gay.</br>  <br><br>virgins<br><br>OP you're going to get shit on your dick, it's gonna smell and be awkward. it's not like how it is in porn.<br><br>just take that into consideration</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Soooo,we talkin pitching or catching?  <br>Pretty great if done properly.

Don’t let your dreams be dreams. Yesterday you said tomorrow. So just do it! Make your dreams come true. Just do it. Some people dream of success, while you’re going to wake up and work hard at it. Nothing is impossible… you should get to the point where anyone else would quit and you’re not going to stop there. NO! What are you waiting for?! DO IT! JUST DO IT! YES YOU CAN! JUST DO IT! If you’re tired of starting over, stop giving up.  OP here. For one time, OP is not a faggot. I'd be putting it in her ass, nothing is going near mine.  Just leave her now so she can get a boyfriend that isn't a giant faggot. Where's she from? I'll plug her fuckin pooper.  Make sure you have some form of lubrication and make sure she cleans internally, even so, your very likely to get shit on your dick. I've tried it and didn't really enjoy it.  Anal is pretty good. Just make sure she takes care of her shit beforehand.

Any ideas what to boost Emperor of Essos with?</br>  <br>imho just reduce the Free Cities' required number to 3. It will be a great boost.</br>  <br>Yeah. I did that to make the 4 requirement for Independent Kingdoms to make more sense. But I suppose a new kingdom needs more to legitimize it.</br>  <br>That's a decent thought. Makes it a bit easier to get, but so would it for competing empires.<br> That could lead to potentially three separate "Empires" going to war, which would be epic. <br> (OP) Lady Commander Jaeyme Snow </br></br></br>  <br>I agree with you. New kingdoms needs more power to "fix" themselves.<br><br><br>Yeah, I can imagine a Tyrosh Empire vs. a Bravos Empire, both claiming the famous throne.

Not picky, but I would like to hear one from a sister's PoV, not an often occurring thing.<br>Pic... semi related, I guess? I'm distantly related to him.</br>  Bump for potential?  <br>/b/ is void of femanons now.</br>  bump for stories and pics  Um...well. I have a large family. My brother David is really rather handsome, but that's not important. The very first thing I remember was a night when I couldn't sleep. I was very, very young, laying, lightly dressed, on a bunk-bed near my sister. Quietly, He would rub his cock on my chest, shoulders, armpits and eventually lips. Whispered to me to lick it. I didnt really know what I was doing but I licked and sucked as he told me, and I remember being a little annoyed &amp; scared...<br>He brought over his teenage friend, a tan, country guy who was my neighbor and relative of my babysitter. They Both took turns molesting me in the bathroom.<br>Licking me, asking how it felt. I was on the marble counter with my legs spread wide, my green shorts on the floor. I remember seeing wet drip on my shorts, thinking someone might tell what it was..<br>The main thing was David would repeatedly rub his cock on my pussy. Over and over and over and over. He must have been bi, looking back, as his friend was jacking off watching.<br>Next thing I remember was being in the upstairs, more private bathroom. He was forcing me to suck him off, I remember that because I felt strained and uncomfortable, his cock being an impressive 8 inches (he was an older teen). He sat on the toilet, I was inbetween his knees, scared. He talked about putting a toothbrush in my pussy. He warned me before he came...said it was going to be quite salty. I recall the taste and texture incredible well, as I swallowed it all. He apologized afterwards... And that was the last time for David.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I wish i could believe you.</br>  I wish I could supply proof. Honestly..  <br>Fascinating stuff. Your age range for all this?</br>  Sadly, 5 is when it started. I wish I had been older, because I am so. fucked. in the head.  <br>I'm really sorry that it had that effect on you. I'm really drawn to girls with histories like yours, but that makes me feel incredibly guilty too, because it's like I'm taking advantage of already deeply troubled folks. But I can't help my curiosities.</br>  <br>do you think it would have been more enjoyable at an older age or do you regret it all together?</br>  That's interesting to find someone who has a sense of sympathy on 4chan. <br>Really, I'm alright, I've progressed and haven't let it scar me after all this time (I'm 19 now)</br>  <br> be me <br> be young <br> (male) has younger sister <br> think incest is hot at a young age <br> hot cousin ~3 years younger <br> try to get with her <br> no good <br> sister is fugly piggy <br> sister remains fugly piggy untill like 22-24 <br> now to late </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks, but I'm still a pretty fucked up guy, having this kind of an interest and looking for women who don't mind (or get a thrill out of) sharing their stories. <br><br>I'm glad you managed to heal and grow beyond it.</br></br></br>  <br>Too bad you weren't more curios. Five is such a cute age when they are. It's when I started.</br>  Too lazy for a time stamp, deal with it  <br>Very pretty, femanon. Especially with your brother's name there.</br>  <br>Lets make daughters and molest them togeather.</br>  cant believe I even replied to this thread. I'm just pretty horny &amp; tired right now  You guys are soo mental I love it  <br>Horny and tired can lead to some unexpected actions. I wouldn't be responding to you either if I wasn't feeling the same.</br>  <br>Cute lil titties. I would have done more.</br>    <br>Sigh. Yeah, between your looks and your history, you're definitely the kind of girl I'd be very drawn to.</br>    <br>Lovely. Got any pics from when you were younger?</br>    <br>It's working.</br>  <br>See, now you're playing up the innocent little girl thing with that cute bunny. And it's getting me very turned on. Wish I could have seen what David got to see when you were little.</br>  <br>I truly wish I did! None have been scanned, at least. I was a bright dirty blonde little girl, very polite and creative.</br>  I have this crystal clear picture of my pussy I took when I was very young, when I had my first boyfriend (a year after puberty) <br>Dubs gets</br>  <br>I'm sure you were sweety. Who else had your tiny little body? Such a good girl didn't stop with just her brother.</br>  <br>que lindo conejito</br>  <br>Rolling</br>  <br>Until you choked down some cum.</br>  <br>get</br>  <br>Lies</br>  <br>You're making me blush. Well, my other brother, closer to my age, also used me. After that some guy molested me and I was super traumatized, as if I couldn't handle it unless it was my brother. Disgusting, right?</br>  <br>Reroll</br>  <br>Checkem</br>  I wouldn't lie to /b/  <br>Probably fake, but ill roll</br>  This is probably going to be 404'd now Lol..  <br>No, not disgusting. Seems like you just had a certain level of trust and safety with your brothers. Who says incest is always a bad thing?</br>  <br>I want to believe, but it looks like some razor burn.</br>  <br>Winrar</br>  <br>Not at all disgusting. I started at 5 with my girl cousins. Sneaking off to the bushes behind their house to watch each other pee. They used to hold my tiny dick while I did. It felt so good the little smooth non veiny cock would get hard. I'd have them spread their tiny bald lips so I could watch. Now I have a loli pee fetish.</br>  <br>Dubs confirm razorburn.<br>fake.</br></br>  <br>well you aren't wrong.
