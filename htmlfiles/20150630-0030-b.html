The resemblance isn't very extreme, and plenty of people have similar names.</br>  <br> Challenger accident was a hoax. <br>For what purpose?<br><br>I know for a fact that Sandy Hook as a complete farce. It was fucking staged.<br><br>I'm going to post some jpgs that made the rounds on /pol/ when Sandy Hook was trending. These are "fake;" their purpose is to make the conspiracy look utterly fucking retarded to people not in the know. Or maybe they're just a joke made by someone who doesn't give a damn.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's pretty hilarious.</br>  <br> Jews did 9/11 <br>Yep. Mossad and CIA<br> Hollywood is a child sex ring run by Jews  <br>yep<br> ISIS and al qaeda both American creations  <br>not even a "conspiracy theory" as such, but yes. True<br> We let Pearl Harbor happen for an excuse to enter into ww2 <br>Yes, but &gt;we.<br> Same with the Lusitania and ww1 <br>Yep<br> Feminism's rise to popularity was funded by the CIA through Gloria steinem to weaken the family unit and tax the female half of the population <br>Yep. They use the premise of equality to target and weaken the 'crabs' who are highest in the barrel (white middle class men)<br> CIA sold cocaine to Blacks and weapons to Iranians to fund the slaughter of peaceful socialists in South America <br>Yep<br> government created lsd to experiment with mind control and memory erasing, did experiments in McGill U in Montreal <br>Yep. Old news. The mind control game is out-of-this-fucking-world now. Manchurian candidate-tier. Look into Project Monarch, or, for an entry-level 101, watch Derren Brown's made-for-TV documentary The Assassin<br> MOnarch mind controlled slaves and all that secret satanic hand signal shit, none of it is based on anything but speculation by fritz springmeier (sp?) <br>Don't forget Roseanne Barr and Cathy O'Brien<br> ufos are real and the government is setting up a cashless society before they reveal their existence for fear of economic disaster spiraling out of their control <br>yep. The "tinfoil" meme was created in the 50's to marginalize and trivialize people who didn't disregard UFO stuff</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Hitler survived and escaped to Argentina where he died peacefully with his wife.    <br><br>You paranoid fuck.</br></br>  is this a stoner thread?  <br>Alien detected</br>  <br>do it</br>  <br>Because no celebrity in the history of ever has had surgery to change their nose and chin. Nope, that's never happened. The only explanation is that she's a robotic clone of Miley Cyrus created by Bill Gates and Steve Jobs in a Satanic Illuminati Microtosh facility that also produces batteries and ham.</br>  <br>The lsd one has been proven . German scientists created acid (lsd) to experiment with mind control and shit like that and after the war American scientists and nazi scientists started testing and shit again, since lsd can take so many forms including gas the cia set up brothels and they would get ppl in gas em with lsd and shit</br>  <br>Those tests were unsuccessful though.</br>  <br>bumping from intrest</br>    <br>gotta look into that one</br>  <br>lel... i agree...this miley redpill is bullshit..only summer belive it</br>  <br>ayo i tried googling it not finding shit</br>  <br>apparently alotta shit happened on that day..... not a missing miley though</br>  <br>seems legit actually</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=HQo<wbr>RXhS7vlU</wbr>  [ ]  bump  <br>kek</br>  <br>T, if youre reading this I wanna marry u</br>  <br>T, if you're reading this, enough with the boyfriend songs. Sing about literally anything else. In fact, I challenge you to write a hit single about cheeseburgers.</br>  <br>Would do well in America, at least.</br>  I've heard that Taylor Swift, Katie Perry, Lil Wayne and 50 cent were all gay.  <br>If she made a number 1 hit about cheeseburgers, I'd buy the album. I'd promote it for her for free.</br>  <br>This dude at work was telling me this stuff about a gay illuminati.

Keep looking into things. The purpose of the challenger hoax makes more sense when you realize that everything NASA has been doing in space is fake. There was no moon landing.<br><br>Also Aliens and UFOs are a psyop, they are not from another planet, at best they are from another dimension, at worst they don't exist at all.</br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=DAP<wbr>DbpkquOQ</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Also, Obama's probably going to have his hoax assassination on September 23</br></br>  <br/>  <br>Also:<br>_Every conspiracy theory that is ridiculously anti-Semitic and talks about aliens, Illuminati or reptile overlords is by itself a conspiracy, because they make a caricature of any alternative news and information source.<br>There is a conspiracy against human freedom, and it is called rule of elite capitalists.</br></br></br>  The moon landing never happened, so many scientists noticed oddities in the footage that didn't make any sense.<br><br>Honestly at this point I don't believe anything the government says. I think Obama is a good guy and knows all of this fucked up shit happened/is happening but can't do anything about it.</br></br>  <br>lol</br>  <br>cosmetic surgery is a lie, it doesnt exist<br><br>it's just a made up thing to make us accept dead celebrity replacements<br><br>fuckin idiot</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're home, bud.</br>  <br> September 23rd comes <br> no assassination 'attempt' <br> you come up with some lame excuse as to why it didnt happen <br> carry on being a conspiracy faggot <br><br>always the fucking same with you people</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're spot on about the moon landing. See:<br>http://www.aulis.com/stereoparallax<wbr>.htm<br><br>But Obama is not a good guy, believe me. The entire government is a charade, they're all actors.</br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br> go somewhere no human has ever gone before <br> see shit scientists dont recognise/cant explain <br> IT MUST BE A HOAX <br><br>idiot</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ahahahahahahaha you guys are so fucking lame. Please turn your computer off and go outside before you end up like that shithead in SC</br>  <br>I don't think the lies and corruption are as deep as you appear them to be. Obama was a complete nobody when he entered office, I truly believe he is a good guy. I mean EVERYBODY in Washington hates him because of it. He will be remembered as one of the greatest presidents of all time by the people in future generations believe me.</br>  <br> go somewhere no human has ever gone before <br> it looks exactly like it would look had it been done on a soundstage </br></br>  Brazil 7×1 was staged.  <br>but dude outside is where the conspiracies happen</br>  <br>You won't be able to keep the knowledgeable down any longer you shilling fuck</br>    <br>Ok. Remember this conversation when the newspaper tells you he's dead (he won't really be).</br>  Great, so you guys figured shit out. Whoop de doo, well done for you.<br><br>Now what are you gonna do with that information? Nothing?<br><br>Cool.</br></br></br></br>  How do you find out what you want to do in life? Does everyone just have some hobby or something they really enjoy to do?<br><br>I've never had passion for anything, I just do what I do to get by.<br>I'm 22, a plumber and make 60.000 a year.<br>But I don't "love" pluming, its more like I do it cause it gets me cash and i'm decent at it.<br><br>How do you do what you want and follow your dreams if you have none?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I was fascinated by computers from the age of 5, wanted to develop my own things and now I nearly finished studying business informatics, entering the job at between 40 and 45k € next year  <br>I actually feel sorry for that guy. So close to being a God and failing at the last minute. <br><br>He'll never forgive himself.</br></br></br>  <br>See this is what I want, I feel like pretty much everyone I know have this deep love for SOMETHING, being cars, computers / whatever.<br>I tried getting into cars, I do enjoy driveing them and looking at them but thats about it. Kinda like you enjoy playing on a computer but got no idea how they work.<br><br>I just dont have that spark for anything</br></br></br></br>  <br> But I don't "love" pluming, its more like I do it cause it gets me cash and i'm decent at it. <br><br>congratulations, faggot. that's the whole point.<br><br>the losers that say "oh you have to do what you love" have never given it a try. chefs eat like shit. mechanics drive vehicles that need work. a job is a MEANS TO AN END not an end, in and of itself. to do your passion for a living means you're turning something you love into the drudgery of just a fucking job.<br><br>you know what your passion SHOULD be? socking all that cash away so you can retire and draw your pension when you're first eligible to do so. then you can do what you WANT and by then, life will have put so many constraints upon your life, you'll know EXACTLY what you want to do when given the free time.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah well at that point I'm 65 years old with a bad back and bad knees, probably kids and grandkids aswell. Then you can't really go out there and "live life" You know...<br><br>I'm not saying I need to love my job, work is only 8-14 hours of my day, what about the rest?<br>You can't just sit around all day.</br></br></br></br>  Become an electrician. Or get a grant to work on aircraft. <br><br>I did both, it fucking sucks to work so damn much, but atleast my family's covered.</br></br>  <br>Spoken like a true brainwashed sheep.<br><br><br>Sorry OP, the truth is not all passions translate into great jobs. The dude who loves fucking his computer will end up hating his job because in the end, you are limited to how much money you can make from it. You either except that you won't be rich, pursue what you want, and hope people recognize your talent - or you give up the ghost, work your job that makes someone else rich, get married have kids and lie to yourself that you are happy until you die.<br><br>Or just say fuck the system, and spend your waking hours trying to topple it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> You either except that you won't be rich, pursue what you want, and hope people recognize your talent  <br> pursue what you want <br><br>This is exactly what I'm trying to say, I don't want anything, thats the problem. I have no passion for a single god damn thing in this world, nothing excites me</br></br></br></br>  <br>Goddamnit this, I have this exact same problem. I don't want to wait till i'm too fucking old to move....</br>  Loli thread, post your best.        So in Sweden a Political Party recently voted yes for returning ISIS volenteers to get healthcare, education, housing and therapy, for free.<br><br>I understand now why the world is laughing at us. We're becoming a sanctuary for muslims and other cultures. Sweden could have been a paradise, a fairy tale, but our corrupted, weak and liberal government is deliberately destroying this country.<br><br>Media is never publishing anything about immigration caused violence, because Aftonbladet (Biggest newspaper in Sweden) is a bunch of extreme leftist and antifa followers.<br><br>Where I live they are going to tear down a church in order to build a mosque for the crying muslims, a church I hear every wednesday and sunday, and the day I can't hear it anymore I know what has happened.<br><br>Sweden is a dying nation, a nation who fears the revolution is so desperetely needs, a nation of people afraid of the label "Racist" because they want their country back.<br><br>Sweden can now only serve as a warning to others about what happens when governments become afflicted with the mental disorder of extreme liberalism.<br><br>Poor Sweden.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  No one's laughing at you because no one gives a fuck.  moved from sweden 2010 to finland to escape the sandmonkeys. <br><br>i will never return to that broken place</br></br>  <br>Sorry /b/ro.<br>That sucks.<br>My 'Murica is right there behind you.<br><br>Also, what's a good libertarian country to emigrate to?</br></br></br></br></br>  you are retarded<br><br>NO BORDERS, NO NATION, STOP DEPORTATION!</br></br>  <br><br>5% of the population are Muslim, waaaah der taking ova</br></br>  <br>Kill them, dump them in neighbouring country</br>  Yeah sweden is fucked. You know there is a book called the swedish experiment which explains what has happened in sweden from the 70s and forth. Here you get to know what swedish politics is really about. Experimental liberalism or culture marxism o whatever.. all we swedish people are being experimented on by our authorities, it's time to fucking wake up! I am swedish and everyday I read about new fucked up shit our government is deciding for us, illogic in every sense. Now I know why everything is illogic. It's an experiment. Revolution now please!  <br>I know New Zealand and Switzerland are good places to live. I will probably move soon, it depends on the election 2018, if the party that will decrease immigration gets a good amount of influence, I might stay. But if shit hits the fan I will bolt</br>  <br>finland masterrace</br>  <br>Fuck off and join ghost hunters aswell you faggot</br>  <br>you really are brainwashed by the swedish lying piece of shit media?<br>you are stupid as fuck. Bet you read that on "friatider" or some other stupid newspaper who dont even have a source on their texts.</br></br>  <br>Aftonbladet is a tabloid, faggot. Read SvD or DN for news</br>  <br>It's not about how many there are.<br>It's about how few there are and how much legislation is being passed to accommodate their asinine "needs."</br></br>  <br>The only media I read is Aftonbladet and Expressen. I don't go on fria tider because they lie to get positive publicity. You can't argue with the facts.</br>  Sweden should learn from this  <br>The same on Aftonbladet and Expressen.<br>Read papers like SvD or DN for news that is correct and not using populism.</br></br>  Muslims in Sweden are trying to enforce their laws into our system.<br><br>For example;<br><br> Separate schools, only for muslims <br> Mosques are to be built everywhere <br> Swedish national anthem is now racist and is not allowed in schools anymore <br> Swimming pools only for muslims <br><br>I can go on all fucking day and yet you liberal fuckwits just sits there and embrace this multicultural cancer because you're scared of being called a racist.<br>All you do is trying to score "goodness" points among your friends.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>his gaze alone commands more respect than any modern western leader ive ever seen.</br>  <br>SvD and DN are conservative news.<br>The same shit will be in those papers.</br></br>  <br>Source?</br>  <br>Omg you are so fucking stupid</br>  <br> hurr durr friatider, aftonbladet and expressen </br>  <br>This is not all, but it sums up a fair bit.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=PkN<wbr>qyYH4KvI</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>If i'm so fucking stupid. Find me something that is not complete garbage compared to Aftonbladet.<br><br>If you can't, then I would advise you to fuck off.</br></br></br>  Ville bara påminna alla nazister här att den som gjort mest för er rörelse är afrikan.<br><br>Pic related.</br></br>  <br> This is not all, but it sums up a fair bit. <br>You can't make "fact" based statements if you cannot properly refer to sources.</br></br>  You people that are welcoming this disease will suffer further down the road.<br><br>You sit there, with your friends scoring points with eachother of how good you are as a person, and all the people who disagree with your opinion are racists, and you're automatically better than them.<br>People who has been living in Sweden all their life, paying tax for 50 years only to get a fraction of this when they retire, and returning ISIS members and muslims get everything served on a silver plate.<br><br>You're so fucking ignorant and narrow-minded, and I sincerely hope you kill yourselves.</br></br></br></br></br>  holy shit fuck this thread<br><br>leftist liberals are flooding it</br></br>  <br><br>SvD = conservative<br>DN = social liberal<br><br>Aftonbladet and expressen are a fucking disease</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Separate schools, only for muslims <br>Citation. I know of privately funded Catholic and Islamic schools. Some don't accept other faiths, some do. <br><br> Mosques are to be built everywhere <br>Unless they're asking government to build them, this is perfectly acceptable in any democracy. <br><br> Swedish national anthem is now racist and is not allowed in schools anymore <br>More info needed? Is this like a "confederate flag" situation<br><br> Swimming pools only for muslims <br>Again, unless it's publicly funded, private clubs have every right to reserve admission. This is YOUR law, not theirs.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Så du tycker att det går bra för Sverige just nu? Allt är frid och fröjd?

They're rebuilding themselves politically and it seems like anti-sandnigro feelings are flourishing among population</br></br>  <br>this<br>sweden what is that? some snowy country?</br></br>  The beginning of the universe started with the Big Bang. At least, all the evidence, found by people way smarter than anyone I've ever met, points to that.<br>Everything began with the universe being compressed into a single point in space. With an infinite amount of density and heat at that singularity, <br>absolutely all laws of physics go out the window. The basic laws of physics must be true in order for use to make any speculations about what is<br>going on. So what happened before the Big Bang? The answer is that we have no idea what happened before that point and there is no way we<br>can find out because the pre-universe universe doesn't follow the same laws as ours. Therefore, we cannot use our observation methods to observe it.<br>For all we know, the Big Bang could have been planned by a God. The evolving universe all carefully planned out so that it would interact in such a way<br>that we humans are alive today. And the only reason he did any of it was so that we could worship him and stone gay people or whatever. (Theist view)<br>Or rather, it just happened because it did and humans don't matter. They're just a cosmic anomaly that is rather insignificant. In the end though, we will<br>NEVER EVER know. We cannot say anything about what happened prior to the Big Bang. Thus, the probability of a God existing is exactly the same as<br>the lack thereof. So, to say that there is a God would be foolish. Theistic religions make this assertation. Yet, at the same time, atheists make the<br>assumption that there is NOT a God. To state the presence or absence of a God as FACT is foolish, because it is not BASED on facts. Instead, what you<br>are left with is belief. That is at the core of theistic religions and atheism. The acceptance of a completely unfounded statement as fact. <br>This is why I'm an apatheist. Either way, it doesn't bother me. And neither one is more true than the other.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dude, 4chan is not how you want to spend your acid trip.</br>  for there to be a "beginning" there had to be a cause <br>also conservation of energy, can't make something out of nothing, can't make nothing out of something<br>dispute this with your smart scientists if you disagree.</br></br>  <br> for there to be a "beginning" there had to be a cause <br>This is a human concept. we turn things nto cause and effect because the alternative is to see the whole universe as a single event, which arguably it is.<br><br> also conservation of energy <br>This is a rule within the universe, it may not pertain to the birth of the universe itself<br><br><br>But what do I know, I'm not one of your smart scientists</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;there is no way we can find out because the pre-universe universe doesn't follow the same laws as ours. </br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;624717288 <br> pre-universe <br>you believe in a pre-universe now?<br>and who told you that, the same people who wrote that book and who can't come up with anything other than non-experimental hypotheses? learn2theorize, experiments are your first step.

I mean, where was god when my relative died....answer that Christians. theres no proof so why arnt u smart like me.. sure I may be just basking in being apart of the ignorant majority and desperate to feel smarter, sure I picked Christians as a target to be smarter than.. that's not a low aim is it? anyways im right and why arnt u as correct as me.. logic and reason... not ghosts telling u the nature of reality..cant happen.. theres no way god is talking to people as a voice, if I don't hear it nobody dose.. end of story guys.. im smarter.. there. take that religious people.  I entertain the idea of the "Big Bounce Theory", in that (paraphrasing here) the creation of our universe (and infinite amounts of others) was caused by the death of another one. I'm also confident that there is a "mirror" universe to each "regular" universe, much like a planet has north and south poles... Perhaps the two ideas are connected as time is not linear. That's kinda bordering on quantum and theoretical physics and higher dimensions which I'm definitely not an authority on... But it's good to gather information and use imagination... Maybe a little assistance now and then can be a helpful tool as well.    <br> learn my shit <br>yeah this anon will never be a scientist let alone a good burger flipper</br></br>  religion, that old rag, how quaint. modern science has shown us that there is no God, if you still believe in God in 2015 you are a retard  haha good one. desperate atheists never engage the argument when u hit their sore spot..lmao scared insecure tryhard faggots..lol  <br>are u agreeing with me or did u miss the point and think I was serial?</br>  <br>Why can't everyone just stop giving a shit about whether god exists or not and move on with their lives because it literally has no influence whatsoever, apart from the influence you let it have on you.</br>  <br>lol someones desperate to be right about something that cant be proven..lol</br>  <br> modern science has shown us that there is no God <br>please tell us all that which science has failed to explain<br>show us what science has shown you, please</br></br></br>    <br>anon apparently has solved all the riddles of the universe and can unequivocally state that there is no god. I guess science can take the day off now.</br>  90% of the posts have missed OP's point.  <br>Rules don't create things, no. But they allow for prediction; extrapolation into the future or past.<br><br>Lets say that you show me a rock that moves by itself. It's been moving by itself for 25 years, and you've put markers up to gauge it's speed.

Get the fuck over it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I agree. that was my point.</br>  When will you people - on both sides of the invisible fence - that there is neither proof FOR god nor AGAINST it? To say for certain one way or another is both naive and selfrighteous simply because it is currently impossible to know for certain what we cannot yet comprehend. We're terrible data taking machines, we need to develop expensive machines just to see more than a twinkle in the sky at night or a simple cup of pond water. Whatever the truth, whether there's an active or passive god or whether the universe is an anomaly or a game of numbers or laws, the universal truth (pun intended) is that we are all one with the universe and therefore with each other.  <br>I know, it was supposed to be kind of a tl;dr thing, sorry.</br>  <br> where it meant to be <br>Oh, so now all of a sudden there's meaning in the Universe is there? And while I was reading your post I was under the assumption that you were actually trying to convince me you were an unbeliever. kek</br></br>  <br>None of us know if thats true. Stop mental masturbating on the internet and get a life pleb</br>  <br> ground my gears <br>not interested in your opinion c3po</br></br>  <br><br>yeap, that was the joke.. its funny that even tho I made it obviously a bate its still totally atheist talk..lmao</br></br>  <br>did u fuck that dude with tits too retard?lmao</br>  <br><br>3/10 you make yourself look stupid, this is your plan right?</br></br>  <br>Read the post again. The person in plain text is you, dipshit.</br>  <br><br> lmao <br><br>because you're a forever alone? how is virginity going for you?</br></br></br></br>  <br>no probs fair sir.</br>  <br> doesn't believe the fish has an afterlife <br>seriously, when was the last time anyone contemplated the fish contemplating its existence?<br>and your note about burning for trillions of years is absolutely false: first, it's for eternity knucklehead and second you are taking things way too literally. People know the difference between right and wrong and that is what Jesus preached. But go ahead and compare our knowledge of today and equate it to the symbolic meanings to yesterday, you do it very well.</br></br></br>  The simple fact that christians can pick and choose which parts of their bible to take literally and follow, even edit, change or outright delete, is an argument both for moral relativism and against the very belief system they rely on. Logically it just starts to crumble from there. Belief systems are not good moral, social or economic foundations. It makes as much sense as astrology, relying on thousands-old technology and information in this day in age is simply illogical. I don't understand arguing about it though, people like Dawkins and Krauss are starting to piss me off with their excessive political bullshit, they're just as bad as the religious zealots for picking fights and shoving shit down peoples' throats and treating them as inferiors.  <br>haha that means u fuck that gross lesbian ..lmao I bet u call her floppy teets big..lmao il ask my 9yo self how that's going. all existence is the projection of self. im sorry u had to be the dipshit portion of our mind.</br>  <br>wow so ur smarter than Christians u say? fuck man go call the news or something. someone needs to tell u how fucking special and gifted u are right away</br>  <br><br>Yeah this guy. The laws of physics are universal, no universe, no universal laws of physics.</br></br>  <br>yet science can edit all it desires as it evolves<br>why are the rules so different for religions<br>yesterday /b was antifaggot and antinigger but today the world and even fucking /b embraces these things<br>you're using a hypocritical argument to justify hypocrisy</br></br></br></br>  <br>nvm, I readed the end parts. ur fine..lol</br>  <br>It's not about level of intelligence, it's about self-awareness and critical thinking. If they really just stepped back and thought about it beyond simply what they've been told, if they seek answers instead of filling the void with the feel-good idea of "god," they might find the universe more appealing than they did before. I'm confident actually that there is a god, but I do not believe in any established religion as it's all dogma. Everyone has the potential to wake up, just as everyone grows up eventually and stops believing in santa claus and the boogeyman. As a self-loathing individual it's extremely difficult for me to accept the idea that I'm better than anyone else. Stay mad though.</br>  <br>One feels thread on mushrooms, you are here forever, my friend</br>  <br>atheists can bitch about societal downfalls of religion when they give a shit about any of the other downfalls, like the cars we all use that are destroying the planet..g, howmany atheists give a shit about that? that's right, none.. cus its not a pissing contest.</br>  <br><br>yesterday doesn't mean shit, people were stupid as fuck until we started utilizing science, that's the only reason you have a computer to type on and you aren't farming turnips and the West isn't dominated by the Vatican.<br><br>By the way, what I said was absolutely true, the Fish is just as much an animal as a Human. If the fish doesn't get an afterlife, you don't get an afterlife, because you're related to the fish, and if you go back far enough our ancestors didn't even look like us, so there's no clear generational divide between "Primates with souls" and "Primates without souls"<br><br>You lose your argument. Game over.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Science changes as we discover new things. Facts are facts no matter how we feel about them. The bible is a collection of fables, science relies on tried and tested facts, principles and procedures. Science still exists without us; God dies when we do. The bible is written, science is recorded.</br>  <br>I actually longboard to work brah, zero carbon footprint swag</br>  <br><br>Fuck you for hating on Lawrence Krauss, the man is a legend. Give me an example of him being wrong, on anything. Yes he's elitist, but he has every right to be. He's surrounded by idiots (the American populace)</br></br>  Stoning gay people is the shiznit  <br><br>I dislike the impact of fossil fuels on our environment, but I can't be this much of a faggot.</br></br>  <br>I enjoyed the ending. and I agree. I just like to put those are the shitty religious types, and not all of them. just like I talk down to shity atheists and not the decent ones. the amount of thought u have put into others religious framework is only how u felt about u believing in those things. its important to use that to grow and not pin it on others. everyone worships differently so to say why "they" are wrong is just silly. im not mad tho, totally calm while I defend everyones right to think anything they want as long as it isn't "im the one whos right" again tho. that's how u felt about u, is my opinion. good luck with the hating urself stuff.</br>  <br>You misunderstood me, friend. I'm simply a pacifist and his personality is a tad abraisive for me. I completely agree that he's a very intelligent individual indeed, and I can also tell he gets tired and frustrated with saying the same things over and over to people that don't listen. I get it, just my main point I guess is we should stop fighting.</br>  <br>zero?lol swag?lol I don't doubt it but please go on, and my point remains. and if longboarding is ur excuse to talk shit about religion ur fucking sad as shit braaahh XD lol nice tryhard tho.</br>  <br>Dad, I caught a big one, a five-footer! It was fuckin easy, fits right in the boat. Let's go home and cook it over the fire. I love fishin'.</br>    <br>WOW AND ANOTHER Can I make it a triple?</br>  <br>atheists are just desperate to feel right about something. that are scared and petty just like pushy religiousfags.</br>  <br>Also implying I've been talking shit at all in this thread</br>  <br> forgot pic <br> inb4 filename </br></br>  Honestly, I don't know. That's why I don't claim to KNOW there is or isn't a god. There being a god is illogical, but also logical. Its illogical for something to spawn out of nothing. "God created himself". The power to do that still would have to come from something. Its logically impossible, but it still happened. No one knows the answer as to how. And " because god it powerful and works wonders, etc..." Is not the answer, and is a cheap escape. It'd also depriving yourself of further learning and understanding. So since everything exists illogically, you have to question everything. I hope I'm making sense, lol.  <br>Pic is false. Without religion, science wouldn't have existed. Atheists up until the 20th century believed the earth was never created but always existed. Christians forced this idea to fall apart over hundreds of years. Atheists, on the other hand, just started murdering people through the 20th century and now you fags are claiming to be superior.<br><br>Christianity is the only thing moderating the Western world since its the only thing that keeps countries from becoming like Daesh in their brutality. This is proven by Game Theory which was created by men smarter than you could ever imagine.</br></br></br>  <br>congrats u tricked people into thinking ur a pretentious dipshit when we are here to argue with pretentious dipshits.. jee. what a clevar trollartist. post it on youtube so the other fedoras can reassure themselves from it.....lol</br>  <br>u said actualy. implying u were a contradiction to my statement. maybe u should post to someone els... :/</br>  <br>I realize I was being a tad agressive at first and I am making sweeping generalizations. I know most religious people are actually very nice people, it's really starting arguments about something as silly as subjective beliefs that gets me. I'm all for spirituality and the scientific process at the same time, I'm really not on either side of the fence.</br>  <br>The point of the post is god or no god, I don't really care, it's a useless argument; if they find out there is god it won't affect me, if they find out there isn't a god it won't affect me. Hence apatheism, not atheism.</br>  <br>Yeah man that wasn't me. I drive a minivan as I have a family of 4.</br>  <br>im there with u for the most part. I believe in god, but I don't want to change anyones mind. I don't like that its acceptable to bash on a religion. religious people shouldn't act better and atheists shouldn't act smarter.</br>  <br>I can't handle your butthurt I'm too high for this shit</br>  <br>Well said.</br>  <br>Actually this is largely untrue. Scientists go beyond the Big Bang with many theories that are sound. Such as that the matter from black holes being condensed to singularity causes a new universe to form. <br><br>So there's an infinite number of universes with black holes creating new universes! No beginning or end. Just an infinite expansion of creation. Also, string theory suggests a tenth dimensional quantum field that contains all possibilities for all universes! <br><br>So our universe is just an outcome of quantum conciousness (as demonstrated by the double slit experiment), among an infinite array of possibility! <br><br>And that, my friend, is how it works</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Whenever anyone asks me "Do you believe in God?"<br>I ask them "Do you believe in yourself?"</br></br>  <br>lol how would I have even gotten butthurt?lmao keep dreaming</br>  <br>i try to be a voice of reason in these threads and say silly stuff like "assuming there isn't is the same as assuming there is and just ass annoying when u push it on others..." and i get gang posted with " u cant contribute! u havnt even picked a side!" and im like "ok so that's what u say when someone dosnt agree...lol"</br>  <br>A few common misconceptions:<br> Time is anything more than our perception of things changing <br> Time actually exists as a thing and not a mere idea <br> Time is linear <br> Time is the fourth dimension <br><br>And a few things people need to know about:<br> Micro &amp; Macro <br> Fractals <br> Infinity <br> Relativity </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Also, to the people arguing stupid bullshit about God and religion in this thread: conciousness is the factor that brings the unmanifest energy into manifest creation as demonstrated by the double slit.<br><br>So conciousness is God. We're all sharing our conciousness with each other over the fucking internet on a site created by moot, some random dude, and we can share ideas with someone across the world in seconds!<br><br>So why use such a fucking cool tool to just endlessly bullshit about "you're a fag!" "No you're a fag!" Come on guys is that really the fucking best you have to contribute to humanity? What teh fuck</br></br></br></br></br>   God is a waste of an argument <br><br>Then stop fucking arguing about it bitchass nigger</br></br>  <br>Yeah the way I see it there's no real "Two sides" anyway, there's so many different angles and perspectives on the same thing depending on where you stand. Reminds me of a story about building houses on rock instead of sand...</br>  to me these arguments are always fueled by desperate religiousfags and desperate athiestfags. intelligent people could have and intelligent convo about it, but even the highest regarded atheists cant keep their upturned noses and condescending to themselves. they like most are desperate to feel smarter. and religious folks make underhanded comments but they tend to be a bit more classy about it. eitherway if ur telling someone they are wrong about spirituality, ur probly the asshole.  <br>i like what u have to say. a lot of it leads me to wonder if u are aware that us arguing is why :moot" has us here in this state of "conflict" nicely put until the end bit.</br>  <br>Yep. The fact that all the energy that is in the universe now has been around forever and was once in a concentrated point fits very well to the idea of collective conciousness. We are god and we are time. We're one with nature and the universe. It's pointless to fight.</br>  <br>exactly. its only the people at the far extremes that really bitch, they tend to assume everyone is in on this divide so they use the bible to bitch..and Christians be like " ur taking the bible seriously? try talking to ghosts sometime..lol"</br>  <br>Yeah spirituality is individual, but religion is dogma. Either way both sides just need to learn to take off the armor and put down the swords, I think everyone needs to go through an "ego death" at one point in their lives. The key is to not be afraid to be upset or proven wrong, and be open to new information and ideas, be critical and thoughtful, aware and observant.</br>  <br>Haha so moot is some demonic king bent on keeping us in the purgatory that is 4chan? Sounds like some delicious pasta to me!<br><br><br>Yeah exactly! Conflict is good, because it engenders change. But mindless bickering without logic and calm just leads to decay. We should work towards making the universe a better place, not try to undermine people's characters because it gives us an empty, temporal feeling of false superiority</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I like your words. For my own curiosity would you care to share some resources?</br></br>  <br>Dude I fucking cringed at your posts please die when you read this.</br>  <br>unitive consciousness wants us to figure some things out.... but sure. i meant 4chan..lol</br>  <br>Hmm, yes. Conflict is like dissonance or contrast, without it, ("in a perfect world," as they say) the universe would just blink out of existence. It's like how there is no light without darkness. It's all relative no matter where you cut the cake. You're absolutely right in that it should be from a good place. You said it better than I could.</br>  <br>Haha I've known about it for years. Just got reminded of it in another thread<br><br>So I thought I'd bring it up. Seems to me you get some feeling of superiority by suggesting that of me. Am I just the mirror you project your own sense of self onto?</br></br></br>  There's no evidence for a god and there's no evidence against it. To say for certain one way or another is both naive and selfrighteous simply because it is currently impossible to know for certain what we cannot yet comprehend. We're terrible data taking machines, we need to develop expensive instruments just to see anything more than a twinkle in the sky at night or a simple cup of pond water. Whatever the truth, whether there's an active or passive god or whether the universe is an anomaly or a game of numbers or laws, the universal truth (pun intended) is that we are all one with the universe and therefore with each other.  <br>ur point about the dogma thing? agreed on the armor and swards. it shouldn't be a fight and each side really shouldn't be mad that anynon disagrees... that's the key to me.. if people wernt such fucks we wouldn't need "tolerance" people could just not bitch about stupid shit..lol</br>  <br>I totally agree about the tolerance thing. If everyone was more honest to and aware of themselves they wouldn't be so quick to offend or be offended.<br>Also, Dogma being programs that should be questioned instead of just blindly accepted. Kinda like the idea of false until proven true. Things like authority, morals, and even truth itself. Question everything. If it checks out, then great. If it doesn't, leave it behind. Rinse and repeat.</br></br>  <br>So where's the evidence for your claim?<br><br><br>Start out by looking up the double slit experiment, and move on from there. Google is a goid tool bru<br><br><br>Yeah and light and dark is like hot and cold. Just degrees of the same thing</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Seriously man, consider writing a book. You're very articulate and insightful.</br></br></br>  <br>Conservation of energy is based on this universes physics.<br><br>Other universes do not need to obey that law.</br></br></br>  <br>Origin...</br>  <br>Half the fucking laws of our reality never even existed for a while till the universe cooled enough, you moron.<br><br>You can literally fucking regress the laws of physics by supercooling things. <br><br>Stop using this tired retarded reason.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>(I'm  )<br>Yeah totally. Also it's more of a "fader" than a "toggle", so to speak.</br></br></br>  <br>What would you suggest be the subject? Fiction or nonfiction? Basically if I wrote some shit, what would you wanna read?<br><br><br>Exactly! Darkness is just the absence of light, light the same way being absent of darkness. Different in observation, but the same in substance</br></br></br></br>  <br>yes, the problem is with people issues with themselves, and a lack of honesty and understanding of themselves and others(in various ways we need not count..lol) and my answer to the dogma thing is, yes idealy people should, but to me, some people are not meant to understand all of those thing. to those who god has given true food for thought, it can be much like a burdon, it truly is work and is not for everyone. some were meant to live simple lives.. i don't wish foranyone to HAVE to know god as i do. most who wish to know god would not want any of the versions of truth that that desire may bring. not all minds stretch as ours do. but these are just my opinions. good to find someone likeminded here pal.</br>  <br> what happened before time <br>This is a non sequitur.</br></br>  <br>Personally I'm down with the philosophical, sci/fi, and educational stuff. Stuff that makes me think and use my brain, imagine or ponder things.<br><br>&amp; yeah totally agree. I don't have anything to back up this idea, but I'm convinced that among all the possible universes out there it's only logical to assume that there's a "mirror" dimension, one where our light is their darkness, our hot is their cold, etc.</br></br></br>  <br>Right back at y'all, I'm surprised to find like-mindedness as well.<br>Having grown up in a religious household and personally experienced the honest-to-god good feelings that the social and spiritual aspects religious and other religious-like beliefs can bring to one's life, (much like music, art and a good movie can uplift me) I definitely understand your explaination here and agree.<br><br>It's kinda like like cat people arguing with dog people, instead of competing everyone should just focus their energy on loving what they love and realize that dogs and cats are both animals, and so forth.</br></br></br></br>  <br>naw fuck that shit i hate dogs..lol we cant be friends anymore faggot...lol jk</br>  <br>If there was a true religion there would only be one religion. The fact that there are multiple kinds means that either they're all wrong, or they're all right. Considering the parallels between each of the major religions it's logical to assume that they're all different interpretations of the same universal truth, filtered through subjectivity, culture and history.</br>  <br>LOL I actually relate more to cats, but love being with dogs.</br>  <br>Absolutely true, though it's not necessarily about "right and wrong" or even "us vs them", as I said before it's like a fader moreso than a toggle.</br>  <br>It's not necessarily binary, either. That's a tad two-dimensional.</br>  <br>yea i like both.</br>  <br> either they're all wrong, or they're all right <br><br>that is a logical dissonance. you cant have 'all right' when they are diametrically opposed on so many issues.<br><br>this points to only one valid option</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ur using human logic. god might not usethat. if hes a thing. i agree tho. kinda.</br>  <br>gods may disagree just like we do.</br>  <br>uneducated idiot detected</br>  <br>You do know that evolution was debunked right?</br>  <br>if only gods had some actual input on what men believe eh</br>  <br>I guess I was speaking pretty generally, there are definitely some ideas held by religions that are morally fucked up... but my point still stands - the second part of what I said is just as crucial as what you greentexted.<br><br>The 'system' works from the top down but we see it from the bottom up.</br></br></br>  <br>Congrats on your first step to being self-aware.</br>  <br>please cite</br>  <br>Gods have their own problems.</br>  <br>Google electric weak and then fuck off. <br><br>The laws of physics all merge together the closer you get to the big bang.</br></br></br>  <br>It's totally true, Satan planted all those skulls and fossils and trilobites and shit to test our faith. If you believe in science you're literally satan.</br>  <br>Educate yourself, then kill yourself on livestream and then send me the link</br>  <br>Yep. Just like the universe used to be made up of simpler atoms and compounds and even beings.</br>  <br>oh thats a cool stroy bro. how do you know this, were you there?</br>  <br>Satan is just the accuser, the voice of doubt when faced with reason. <br><br>Honestly the Christians are the ones being satanic when they shit like thst</br></br></br>  <br>Man honestly if you're not just trolling or baiting I don't think you can comprehend that EVERYTHING was simplified and compressed (relatively speaking) at the point of the big bang. Not just three dimensional space, but all its fundamental laws and even conciousness.</br>  <br>lolwho said they cant. u don't want none they input buddy..</br>  <br>see<br/></br>  <br>Yeah totally, we're living proof that the universe used to be simpler, the very fact that one can learn new things proves it... Though the fact that you can't is just a testament to your ignorance... Not to mention all the evidence that supports the big bang and quantum theories.</br>  <br>when faced with reason... g i wonder whos behind this post.. nice try.</br>  <br>All christians are satanists and all satanists are christians.</br>  <br>you just dont get it man</br>  <br>If you don't have anything real to contribute, kindly have a nice day.</br>  <br>i literally dont have the time for this. you atheists just want to be spoon fed all the answers. read the fucking bible and fuck off... its all in there</br>  <br><br>Yeah I let go of the bait already, thanks though</br></br>  <br>It took you this long to say that because there is no proof that god doesn't exist, he must be real?<br>Fuck off pleb</br></br>  <br>Just stop man. You're being very cringey</br>  <br>See<br/></br>  <br>i contribute that needing to feel right is for middleschool. ur middleschool. i was above that petty shit by the time i was in gradeschool.</br>  <br> read the fucking bible and fuck off... its all in there <br><br>i tried to do what the bible said, but the local council got angry at me because i started cutting down all the trees that dont bear good fruit.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah and sending all women on their periods into the wilderness and burning the clothes doesn't ho over to well either</br>  <br>u spent how much of this thread researching the bible, only to come up with that shitpost ass joke..nice try newfag. much love.</br>  <br>See<br><br><br>Also realize how purely hypocritical what you just said is. Doesn't even make sense. That's all I'm going to entertain you for. Have a nice day, for your own sake</br></br></br></br>  <br>the bible speaks in parables idiot. most of the stuff in there is metaphorical hence why atheists just dont get it</br>  <br>And you've read how much of the bible?<br>Sounds like he's done more research in general than you've even thought to put the energy towards.</br></br>  <br> parables <br>so fairy tales then?</br></br>  <br>just go back to worshipping your atheist God. im not even going to stoop to your level</br>  <br>so that's what it looks like when someone pretends they don't get it... iv seen this one before.</br>  <br><br>Yes, much like atheists have a hard time appreciating fables for what they are and instead simply dismiss them, religious fundamentalists have a hard time as well, but in the fact that they can be too accepting of it and take it too literally.</br></br>  <br> atheist God <br><br>zomg derp, do you even try to logic?</br></br></br>  <br>the problem lies in religious fundamentalists treating fables as instructions. which they do. regularly</br>  <br>someone is upset. and we are made of god. he is found within. i was just kidding tho. ease ur butthurt..</br>  <br>I think I prefer that bitch to the "atheists/agnostics" posts finally.</br>  <br>Too late for that shit, you tripped over the stoop and over a cliff. A valiant effort though, continue being a butthurt tryhard. I hope for your sake you're at least playing devil's advocate.</br>  <br>true, its also atheists desperate to feel right. and desperate to make everyone hear about it. and pretending it matters if people believe in god.</br>  <br>but it does matter if people believe in god. they enable fundamentalism</br>  <br>Nice cop-out bruh. Good try at projection too. Try harder next time. Have a good one</br>  <br>go to a new thread samefaggot.</br>  As a Catholic, one can believe in all accepted scientific theory (big bang, evolution etc) as long as one believes God is the "cause" behind it.<br><br>Fossils, extinction, adaptations etc prove evolution and as we learn more and more about the universe, itd be foolish to say it was all created in 6 days...</br></br>  <br>kek you msut be new here. you seem awfully self righteous for someone who is getting completely owned by trolls and Christians. still waiting for a half decent argument from you newfag</br>  <br>lol not samefag but ok, don't even see how that matters at all. See  plz.</br>  <br> catholic <br> itd be foolish to say it was all created in 6 days <br>then maybe its time to revise the instruction manual?<br><br>its getting a little out of date.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>and black people steal things and teach new generations that theyv been stolen from and that its justified to take what isn't theres. that dosnt make all black people the problem, and anyone who talks shit about blacks cus of the ones who steal is a racist fuck. same for anyone who bitches about religion. if u don't like fundamentalism, then fight that. i don't like that shit either but im not a bigot so im not gona blame a religion and be ignorant. we blame people not groups.</br>  <br>Steady state is coming back into vogue among physicists, actually.</br>  <br><br>Pot, meet kettle, kettle, meet pot.</br></br>  <br> implying 1 day is the same as one day in modern times </br>  <br>Religious truth is different to scientific truth.<br><br>First few chapters of Genesis are more or less "stories" to explain the way things are: sin, creation, language etc</br></br></br>  <br>i projected something? lmao wheres the cop out? u don't think hes within? u really need a book to talk to our father? sad. i bet u buy that gay shit that's in there to don't u faggot..lol</br>  <br>i am choosing to fight fundamentalism, by the most direct method possible - making the people with weak conviction (culturally religious) ditch the religion that enables the fundamentalism.<br><br>fundamentalism would not exist without the masses of people they claim to represent.<br><br>there is no other viable way to fight it to be honest. loonies will be loonies. the only way to break them down is to dismantle their platform.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>so take them out of the book?<br><br>to this day people read that shit literally.</br></br></br>  <br>In saying that, if someone doesnt believe in God (or a god for that matter) good on em, just dont try to enforce your beliefs on me.</br>  <br> implying I should give a fuck about the story in modern times </br>  <br>Yeah this. Just another example of why you should be taking that shit metaphorically instead of literally.</br>  <br>lol iv been contributing, just not being a butthurt religiousfag or butthurt atheistfag..lol have fun being butthurt. and that's not the way i meant samefag. and the stoop joke was retarded as fuck, plus u admitted u were at a lower level so ur a dipshit..lmao</br>  <br>All comes down to interpretation. At the end of the day theyre words but its up to the way you read into it/brought up.</br>  <br>See<br/></br>  <br>i will pay the same respects when sunday morning television isnt virtual begging. and people dont knock on my door every other day.<br><br>works both ways m8</br></br></br>  <br>said the guy who missed the point.</br>  <br>lots of people struggle with interpretation. the religious system is prone to serious abuse and needs to be repaired.</br>  You have 60 seconds to justify driving automobiles unnecessarily, using the metric system, and taking drugs.
