I'd like a chemistfag to explain that reaction.</br>  <br>I was hoping for acid like from (the original) Robocop.</br>  <br>wat</br>  <br>It's hyper-saturated salt water. The water is heated so that more than usual salt can be dissolved in the water, then it's cooled back down. When he sticks his hand in, the salt returns to crystal form by attaching to the salt being expelled by the skin's pores.<br>TL;DR: His hand grew salt from the water.</br></br>  <br>Is it hurting him at all?</br>  <br>imagine a bunch of dust being statically attracted to your hand at the same time, out of thin air.</br>  <br>Google that shit, nigga<br> https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=7H<wbr>DZI2rwyHg</wbr>  [ ] </br></br>    Op back again with more chemistfag shit:<br><br>Hand warmers work as good as they do because of all the chemicals within all have a certain job, For example: heating your shitty hands, Salt is the catalyst which buffs water to increase speed in their combined reaction, and Polypropylene sack keeps the moisture within the hand warmer.<br><br>Now enough about all this shit about compounds and shit. It's time to go deeper into this bitch.<br><br>Composition of ...<br><br> Air-activated Hand warmers are made of <br> Iron Fe<br> Cellulose C6H10O5<br> Activated carbon C<br> Water H2O<br> Polypropylene sack C3H6<br> Salt NaCl<br> Vermiculite (MgFeAl)3(AlSi)4O10(OH)24H2O<br><br>Ooooohhh mama, that's so hot... now back to reality bitches, <br> The heat given off by an air activated Hand warmer is caused by a chemical reaction . The iron within the hand warmer mixes with the oxygen in the air and oxides, because it gives off heat when it reacts the process is known as an exothermic oxidation.4Fe(s)+302(g)-&gt; 2Fe203(s). BAM. Insert dick into that jar and you have eternal heaven, in a burning agonizing lust.<br><br>Also, the disposable hand warmer was invented in 1981 by Japan’s MyCoal Corporation which was then passed to their associate MyCoal USA.

I have pretty much the same but the i7 and I didn't think they sold the 212 cooler I just put a 612 cooler the newer one in my rig. I got the pro not Evo Samsung drive and 2 other ssd's. Z97 Asus almost the same. So I'm good with mine thx. Try not to fuck up building yours  <br> le beast high end silent gaming rig <br>Have fun with that<br>I have a decent gaming rig too, but even if yours is a beat I'd rather have mine. What's the point in it being silent? If you can't hear what's happening in the game you're only getting half the experience.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>What's it like being poor?</br></br></br>  I have the same case and a better cpu cooler, not as silent as i wanted and was expecting it to be.

Why would I throw a 290 in with a 295x2? Clearly you don't know shit about monitors or TV's either as 4k TV's have too much input lag to be good for fps gaming (even with gaming mode on). At least do some research before you go dribbling shit from the mouth.</br>  <br>But maybe people don't just play and appreciate some overall performance too?</br>  <br>s-sorry</br>  <br>It's ok bb.

But alright.</br></br>  <br>What's Bloodborne? I only play Destiny. Best game ever made.</br>  <br/>  <br>It's a very slight whir sound. Pretty smooth. I have my rig next to my desk so it's pretty close. I imagine if you have it under, it should be even quieter. Honestly, I cannot hear it unless i'm really trying to.</br>  <br>dat gpu sag</br>  <br>That's really not much money though, why you still bragging about it?</br>  <br><br>I'd ask you to run the nightfalls right now, but XBO =/= PS4</br></br>  <br>In that case where are you from? So I can teach you how France helped/owned your country at some point?</br>  <br>We catch a lot of hate for no reason. I run the H100 and have never had an issue or my temp spike above 40C. Non-closed systems are just overly complicated and overly expensive. I know how to build and install them, but why bother?<br><br>Also, I love how OP thinks his tiddlywink pc is baller because he found out about newegg packaged PC deals.</br></br></br>  <br>go to bed son</br>  <br><br>I was just implying that a 70 USD water cooler isn't a big deal. Hardly constitutes bragging, if you want me to brag I could say something like this.<br><br>I have more money money than you have in your savings account and credit cards combined.</br></br></br></br>  <br>/thread</br>    <br>quite literally any country would be better than the land of surrender. your entire country has shared a single testicle since the revolution and time has not done it good</br>  <br>I doubt someone that's bragging about $3,500, has more money than me</br>  <br>Silent like a 747.</br>  <br>I guess you mean crossfire. My only advice with that is, make sure you have plenty of airflow. Crucial that you're cables are tidy. When I had my 290x (same one as you) in with my 295x2, the thing runs pretty warm. Two 290x's should run pretty damn hot. You got the PSU and Mobo for it, don't leave it too long or it might be worth forking out for a new series card.</br>  <br><br>france is the lowest of the low</br></br>  <br>My laptop has a 980, i7, 32gb of ram as well lol....<br>1TB of SSD and a 2TB HDD. Its a beauty.</br></br>  <br>Too bad, I got 3 34s, and haven't run them at all yet</br>  <br>Here you are uneducated faggot.<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battl<wbr>e_of_Camar%C3%B3n</wbr></br></br>  <br><br>I'd identify as upper middle class, I'm not a rich fag like you. My apologies.</br></br>  Not really cockfag  <br>Do not forget to put the butter in so your pc will work fast</br>  <br>I'm just trolling you man, I don't mean to bring the salt</br>  <br>How's that cooling? I've never had a laptop that didn't feel like it was going to burst into flames if taken off of a heat sink when gaming.</br>  <br>Beautiful but why not get SLI or Xfire cards for more performance for less? Or do you need the double precision floating point?</br>  <br> baiting this hard <br>I think that's enough time on 4chan for you today.</br></br>  It's sad people come here to brag about stuff, especially when they don't know what they are talking about. Enjoy your new rig. No one's impressed.  <br>not him but you save electrical power and heat.</br>  <br>  4k is not maxed out <br>  maxed out 1440p is superior </br></br>  <br> The French Foreign Legion is a military service wing of the French Army established in 1831, unique because it was exclusively created for foreign nationals willing to serve in the French Armed Forces <br> it was exclusively created for foreign nationals willing to serve in the French Armed Forces <br> for foreign nationals <br> exclusively <br> citing a battle in which foreigners defeated mexicans in 1836 as evidence of french prowess <br>typical frenchie</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> silent <br> <br>kek. You ain't gonna get silent with those parts and especially that case. It's gonna be a jet engine.</br></br></br>  <br> 980 Ti&gt; Titan X <br> 980 Ti literally beats Titan X in every benchmark <br><br>I'm sorry for your loss anon. Do you want a hug?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why would you be concerned with that if you're willing to fork out as much for a rig?</br>  <br><br> implying he didn't take this pic from google </br></br>  <br>Thanks for the input and yeah I did mean crossfire I've been out of the comp game too long. I guess I'll get some more fans before I do that cause I do find that my gpu will run slightly hot when playing intensive games</br>  <br>  two 1080p monitors <br><br>What's the matter? can't afford 4k?</br></br></br>  <br> being this butthurt <br>I'm sorry you were offended by his post.</br></br>    le beast high end silent gaming rig <br>  gets an intel processor <br><br>much laughs be had</br></br></br>  <br>How much did it cost all together?</br>  <br>gonna be like this</br>    HEY GOOD LUCK!!<br><br>You're using the same case I used to build my first gaming computer last year.<br>..build my first computer in fact, for first time.<br><br>ADVICE:<br>Be careful with the thermal paste!! It goes everywhere.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because I prefer silence. Less heat is leas fan rpm so more silent rig. Less power needed means the PSU generates less heat too.</br>  <br> Hyper 212 <br> No custom liquid cooling  <br>Pleb</br></br></br>  <br>the only quality thing here is fractal R4<br>best case ever</br></br>  <br>Whats wrong with the R5?</br>  <br>Unless you're re-applying after removing parts, it all comes preapplied and although, yes there are better ones for sale by 3rd parties, they don't make THAT much of a difference. How the fuck did it get everywhere?</br>  <br>If you mean the RoG board, it's MSI. That's the problem.<br><br>If you mean i5, it's already reaching the end of its usefulness. In 2 years, it'll be worth its weight in scrap.</br></br></br>  <br> High End <br>Sure mate. Not even close.</br></br>  <br> silent <br> uses fans <br><br>pick one</br></br></br></br>  <br>I meant the fractal R5</br>  <br>it's not impossible to have silent fans. Tho it's hard to find which fans are silent. Most murrican companies don't focus on silent shit.</br>  <br>I find this hysterical.. because I'm running 2 GTX550-TIs right now. Far from high end but they get the job done and I spent a grand total of $50 on the pair. Replacing both with a new high-end card in a few months. Waiting for a game worth it.</br>  <br> nd silent gaming <br>Lol apple!<br>Giving them 400 euro's extra for overpriced hardware in a new hipster formfactor.<br>Believing it's OS is better then GNI/LINUX.<br><br>KEK</br></br></br></br></br></br>  HANDS UP<br><br>This is a robbery! <br><br>Hand over your dubs now!
