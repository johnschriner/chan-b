[ So i remember hearing in the news that a girl got raped in one of these colleges parties.<br>You know, the kind of parties that are known for drugs, drunks, and sex.<br>She went all pretty(slutty) like all girls go and whatnot.<br>So do you guys think that, in some degree, it was the girl's fault?.<br>Now the act itself is of course bad. No one deserves it but i do think that one should be responsible for its acts and face the consecuences. <br>Discuss.</br></br></br></br></br>  You shouldnt put yourself in a bad situation or engage in destructive behaviour.<br><br>Your clothes and behaviour can draw attention to you or away from. Depending on your surroundings pick what kind of attention you want carefully. Criminals are criminals. Precautions can be taken. Its the real world. Not some perfect tumblr shit. That all being said though, rape is rape. But just like i said also. Criminals are criminals.</br></br>   You know, the kind of parties that are known for drugs, drunks, and sex. <br><br>No i don't know, what kind of parties are you talking about?</br></br>  <br><br>Only a virgin would blame her at all.</br></br>  <br>If you think it was her fault you should kill yourself as you lack the mental capacity to function in society.</br>  <br>This is my stance basically<br>Can you give arguments?</br></br>  <br><br>Rapists don't rape girls because they look hot.</br></br>  <br>Of course not<br>Now if she did it willingly and just dosen't remember now, that is a different story</br></br>  <br>Nice doubledubs!<br>And im not saying that "they are asking for it". But like the other anon said. They are drawing attention. If it wasnt enough by just going to these parties dressed like they do.<br><br>Oh no yea that is entiraly a different situation. Although not sure if there is a way to differentiate between rape and rough sex(cause again you are not making love here)</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>A girl looking hot at a party where everyone is hot isn't drawing attention. It's called fitting in.</br></br>  <br>No. But they rape.<br><br>So best stay out of their crosshairs if possible.</br></br></br>  <br><br>How is fitting in at a party getting in their crosshairs?</br></br>  <br>Yea i agree with that, but again she is putting herself in a possible dangerous situation. Same with getting drunk. You are conciously doing that knowing you will not be concious of your acts<br><br>Yea that anon didnt give a nice reply haha</br></br></br>  How do you feel about this;<br><br>If someone punches someone else in the face, does the puncher deserve to be murdered?</br></br>  <br><br>If you kill an emo, is it his fault?</br></br>  <br>I understand i dont have a strong argument. I dont see myself as a victim blamer. I just strongly believe the way you dress, act, activities you engage in and people you hang around with can influence your risk of getting in trouble or being put into a dangerous situation can be increased even though someone else is at serious blame.<br>Thats where I'll leave it. All im saying is alcohol and drug fueled nights attract dodgy crowds and always end in tears for someone somehow somewhere. Its all too common, alot of people would agree on that. Just be aware of your surroundings and never get too drunk or leave a drink unattended.</br></br>  <br>It depends<br>Did the punch had some severe consecuences to the point of leaving the other guy unable to be by himself?<br>What did the guy did in the first place to be punched?<br>Under what circunstances did it happen?</br></br></br></br>  <br>This isn't complicated. Rape is rape. Period.</br>  <br> fitting in <br>describe that.<br>thats a very interchangeable term</br></br></br>  <br><br>Getting drunk is what people do at parties. Again, it's fitting in.</br></br>  <br>This</br>  <br><br>Huh? Doing what everyone else does at parties. Have you never been to a party?</br></br>  <br>It was her fault.</br>  If a civilian walks across an open battlefield with live fire going off and gets hit, is it the soldiers fault for accidentally shooting him or her or the civilians for walking across the open battlefield?  <br>Im gona need a sauce on that</br>  <br> its what people do at parties <br><br>Risking your life by taking drugs and drinking for no social insecurities for a few hours...<br><br>Its just what people do<br><br>Top kek</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> inb4 shitstorm </br>  <br><br>Is this an invisible battlefield? You don't know what a rapist looks like. I mean, you could probably get a good idea from looking in a mirror.</br></br>  <br>Anyone know any porn stars with bodies like this?</br>  If a dump bitch decides to wear a Deer costume in the middle of the woods in a designated hunting area in the onset of hunting season and gets shot, is it the hunters fault for shooting her or the bitch's fault for wearing the costume?  <br> I dont see myself as a victim blamer. <br>Yea me neither. And i agree with you.<br>Some people would even say something like "you wouldnt say that to a victim". Well of course not, why would i want to do that? I have never been the one saying " told you".<br><br>I havent said the opposite. But dont you think both have some degree of responsability by their actions?.<br><br>Im gonna have to disagree with that. Even then, wouldnt you be responsible for the way you act while being drunk? And its consecuences?<br><br>Not the anon you reply but yea i have been and i have seen how much people put their lives at unnecesary risk.<br>Drugs and alcohol and not the only ways to have fun anon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>...College... Parties...?</br>  <br><br>Ok, it's what fun people do. Pussies like you stay home and jack off to internet porn while telling girls you're a nice guy.</br></br>  <br><br>But why are you assuming that the party is full of rapists? Lrn2analogy</br></br>  <br>Damn you got me good.<br><br>At least I havent been raped though :^)</br></br></br>  <br>woah woah fucking woah.... are you saying that rapists are soldiers fighting a secret war and their victims are just innocents caught in the crossfire? please, Anon. Elaborate for the class as to what the fuck you mean with that.</br>  <br> what fun people do <br>Uh fun is subjective. I wouldnt want to be with a girl that conciously put herself in an unecessary dangerous position.<br>Lets not start with fallacies</br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah man, you sound like a ton of fun. You're what everyone wants at parties...someone's old fat judgmental mom.</br></br>  You see what you do, OP! you see the kind of shit you started? This is why we can't have nice threads.  <br>You should always take precautions from known risks and not disregard the risks because of "teach yo wyatt bois not to rape"<br><br>But fact is the crime trumps the victims negligence... especially in this case.<br><br>And not everyone goes to a party to have sex... many go to just have fun. You don't simply assume every girl is DTF because they're at a wild party.<br>She has little to no fault in this.<br><br>Are you gonna tell her not to go to a college party if she's not DTF?<br>Are you gonna tell her to wear a niqab?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh god. Only nerds bring up fallacies. She's not endangering her life by having fun. You made your life danger proof by not having one.</br></br>  <br>See second Metaphor<br/></br>  <br>I have had my fair share of parties anon.<br>I was the guy that needed a lot of alcohol to get drunk so always had to throw my friends at its house in my way back lol</br></br>  <br><br>No kidding. There's a huge difference between taking precautions and being totally responsible for what happens. This chick didn't want to be raped, so she didn't go to a party in the middle east.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, she dressed up slutty and objectified herself to get the maximum male attention. The most attention a male can give to a sexual object like her is full-on rape. It is the pure and unrestrained fulfillment of the human natural sexual urge.<br><br>Only brainwashed idiots would argue otherwise.<br><br>The world is not your home, it is not and never was meant tobe a safe haven for anyone to try out whatever they wish without repercussion.<br><br>Ignoring the subjective nature of the human experience and the resulting unpredictability of the results of your actions is a very dumb thing to do and should not be promoted.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> the kind of parties known for drugs, drunks, and sex <br>boy are you in for a news flash when you get to college. <br>My high school health teacher used to say if a girl has had any alcohol at all, even just one drink, you should not have sex with her no matter what because that's rape. I got into arguments every year with her about this because it takes away all the responsibility away from the girl. There's no mention of the guy having any drinks and regardless he's still the one at fault. Bullshit. A girl was too drunk to know not to have sex and isn't responsible for her actions? Then if I'm too drunk to know not to get behind the wheel of a car, I shouldn't be held responsible for the family of 4 that I plow into. It's a horseshit idea.<br><br>And to answer your question, it's not the girls fault necessarily, but she should be cognizant of the people she's around. If you're in a house full of sleezy scumbags, that says alot about your character and it was only a matter of time before you got raped anyway</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You're making the game "spot the bitter fat virgin" way too easy, pal.</br></br>  <br> She's not endangering her life by having fun <br>It depends on what kind of fun she is having. Drinking/drugs? In a place full of horny drunk guys? Sure! No danger at all!</br></br>  <br><br>That's because guys are more powerful, and they're the ones sticking their dicks in girls.</br></br>  <br>Really? Where is he?</br>  <br>Too many variables. I dont like absolutes.</br>  <br><br>There isn't. Rape isn't super common.</br></br>  <br> if a girl has had any alcohol at all, even just one drink, you should not have sex with her <br><br>80% of all births are the result of rape, then. sounds legit.</br></br></br>  <br> there are only rapists in the middle east. </br>  <br><br>Well no, if she got drunk and fucked someone and then cried rape, no but if she suddenly gets raped at a party no that's not her fault.</br></br>  <br><br>Who said that?</br></br>  This subject is too broad to argue. You'll never know the full details of every case to argue it properly.<br><br>My sister was raped broad daylight. No parties or alchohol. Week night. Just on a walk. Didnt put herself in a dangerous situation.<br><br>I get way overly happy when im drunk. Not annoying. Just careless and friendly. When i start dancing i fall over everyone making a complete cock of myself and saying things like 'fucking relax' this and that. Which aggrivates people. When i do get knocked out ( which has a high chance of happening) the guy shouldnt have hit me but it still happened. <br><br>Thats why i try to travel in groups and not get ao drunk that i cant take myself home.<br><br>This argument will forever have different circumstances. If we are going off soley what OP said than i believe in this instance there are things i would have done MYSELF in that situation. (Pre ofc, not post...)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  It was definitely her fault for knowing the situation and purposely putting herself in it. Girls just love to take no responsibility for their actions.  <br>You're a fucking faggot, kill yourself thanks.</br>  <br><br>How does this relate to someone raping a girl?</br></br>  <br>Tell that to a modern feminist. <br> "the girl is the one encompassing the guys dick" <br> "girls are stronger than boys when they <br>re young"<br>I'm not talking about actual rape here. I'm talking about guys being accused of rape after a girl decides she was too drunk to know better and not say "let's *hick* have sex."<br><br>Yes means yes and no means no, but for some reason that's not understood by some people.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not sure about the statistics. But i thought rape was a seriois problem in fraternities and whatnot.<br>In any case the probabilities are higher so why put yourself in that situation?</br></br>  <br><br>But that would endanger me and offend your loser virgin sensibilities.</br></br>  <br><br>Did you not read it?</br></br>  <br> A criminal commiting an offence. <br> annon puts themselves in a stupid and dangerous situation. <br><br>Sounds like every party rape to me.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>In what situation? Going out and having fun like normal adults?</br></br>  <br>Well in your sister case. Of course wasnt her fault at all. The rapist just saw an opportunity and did it.</br>  <br> My sister was raped broad daylight. No parties or alchohol. Week night. Just on a walk. Didnt put herself in a dangerous situation. <br><br>I presume your sister finds these slutty girls and their drunk rape stories very distressing.<br><br>Theres a huge difference between being dragged off the street violently raped by a stranger and two people getting paralytic drunk and waking up the next day and regretting it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Girl chooses slutty clothes <br>No reason behind the punch<br><br> clothes do nothing but arouse (cause emotion) <br>Punch only makes you angry (perhaps bruise/small cut)</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You suck at drinking and do dumb shit, so girls should be careful they don't get raped.</br>  <br>Seriously, that fucking mattress girll in the news recently sent the dude texts telling him she wanted sex. He has sex with her and winds up doing anal during it and she backs out of the sex altogether. Later that week, she text him saying she wants him to fuck her in the ass and somewhere along the line, she's like.." you know what, I didn't like when he put that dick in my ass that one time, so that's rape" bull shit. By definition, that's not even rape to begin with, and secondly, you're just a crazy bitch who wants attention. Who the fuck pays a guy to have sex with her for "art project" that reenacts your fictitious rape after carrying around a mattress as a protest. These girls are just not mentally sound</br>  <br><br>You think the rapist tells everyone first?</br></br>  <br> Not sure about the statistics. But i thought rape was a seriois problem in fraternities and whatnot. <br><br>They use a definition where if either or both of the people having sex is drunk they count it as rape.<br><br>Obviously with all the drunk sex going on, it inflates the statistics from negligible to a serious problem.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br/>  this place really has become a liberal feminist redditard shithole lol  <br><br><br>poes law</br></br></br>  <br>I already replied to that autist</br>  <br>kinda seems like "fitting" in is the stupidest shit someone can do, maybe hang out in places that arnt infamously filled with rapists. Seriously this shit keeps happening at the same exact kind of parties</br>  <br>Okay you lost me i dont see the analogy</br>  <br><br>Uh, it rarely happens. They're having fun.</br></br>  <br> leaving a giant delicious cake around a homeless group of people <br> blaming the homeless for eating the cake <br><br> leaving a briefcase full of money around poor people <br> blame the poor people for taking it <br><br>The examples go on and on.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> She's not endangering her life by having fun.  <br>some fun is dangerous. how can you deny that?<br>inebriating yourself in public is probably more dangerous than basejumping. its certainly more deadly.<br><br> You made your life danger proof by not having one. <br>nice unrelated insult, there. if you can't argue without resorting to ad hominem attacks, you should not complain about other people pointing out fallacies.<br><br>i think you're trolling.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br>Do you not go outside because it's infamously filled with bears?</br></br>  <br>Will someone screenshot some pictures of her ass so I can hopefully fap to them if they're good enough. I can't view webms</br>  <br><br>Except you don't know there are rapists at the party. You need to learn about analogies.</br></br>  <br><br><br>If someone were to get robbed while walking down the street flashing a large amount of cash most would think they were partly at fault due to their lack of common sense in not flashing large amounts of cash while walking through a city.<br><br>I don't understand why the same logic can not be applied to rape victims without being viewed as mentally deficient. No people should not rape other people, and yes women should be safe from rape regardless of what they are wearing or where they are walking.<br>But if you're going to put yourself in a suspect situation and act in a fashion which puts yourself at risk (eg getting black out drunk), why is saying "well maybe you shouldn't have been there/done that?" such a bad thing?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>drugs, drunks and sex... ah you mean parties?</br>  <br>Yes i do but i prepare for the possible consecuences.<br>I dont go out dressed like a female bear rubbing my back against a tree nomsayin</br></br>  <br><br>Ad homenim doesn't mean making fun of you, dork.<br><br>You're overstating the danger to justify your loser life.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Just because shes wearing slutty clothing, doesn't mean she deserves to be raped, or had it coming to them<br>Same as if someone punches someone for no reason, still a stupid move, but they don't deserve to be shot or killed in retaliation</br></br>  <br>You expect the whole world to be pink?<br><br>If you're elusive enough to believe that all people (if not most) are with good intentions then you haven't been outside too much.<br><br>Even priest rape, even family members rape, don't expect anything nice from anyone.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thats right. But the chances are higher dont you agree?.<br>And im not even talking about rapists, but just guys that got too drunk to control themselves</br></br>  <br>Was she raped, or did she just get drunk so something she regretted the morning after and claim rape?<br><br>The latter is considerably more common at college parties than the former.</br></br></br>  <br>where did you go to college? I guess mine has shitty people because a rape happens atleast once a year usually to some drunk freshmen. To me thats enough for it to be a problem. Often times it goes unreported and only their close friends know. so i doubt you are aware how often it happens. And there are way better places to drink and have fun</br>  <br><br><br>Because its not the girls fault for getting raped. Have you ever seen a rape case where the motive was "she was drunk"? No, because that's not why people rape.</br></br></br>  <br>So i attended San Francisco State and live in the dorms. A chick showed at one of our drinking sessions dressed like a slut (pic related) she was there because she like one of our dorm mates and he liked her. So we all get drunk and stoned and she is all over broseph AND his friend, we though it was pretty cool for them both. Fast forward to about 2 a.m. and she is in the lounge on our floor getting spit roasted by these two guys, everybody is having a good time, the lights are on people are watching. Now some were saying "hey Jessica are you alright" and she kept waving them off. The next day one of the dudes is talking about taking her as his girlfriend the other dude not interested. Three days later apparently after HER dorm mates kept saying she was a slut, and others making fun of her because one of the guys was ugly/not cool she contacted student services to report she had been raped. Both our bros were arrested and expelled.</br>  <br> Just because shes wearing slutty clothing, doesn't mean she deserves to be raped, or had it coming to them <br>And i agree with you. Anyone is free to wear whatver they want. But at the same time be aware of what is it that they are wearing and where they are wearing it. Dont you think?</br></br>  The way someone dresses does not justify an aggressive act. Though, someone dressed like that is bound to attract a certain type of attention. I have no idea how someone can dress like that in public. Practically wearing lingerie. I'm not judging, because it's not my place. Just saying.  Damn y'all niggas gon' make me reply<br><br>In my honest opinion, it's totally fine to be fucked up at a party. But even then you should know when something shady is up &amp; get out of there if you feel something suspicious<br><br>If this bitch got raped because she popped a xannie &amp; drank mad alcohol and was attention whoring or whatever<br><br> it's just as much her fault for being raped </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah it does.<br><br>and i'm a third person commenting on your preschool argument with someone else.<br><br>could've noticed that, but then you don't seem particularly perceptive.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm betting you'd have to lose a lot of weight to pull off female bear.</br></br>  <br>sorry forgot pic</br>  <br>And the amount of rape, according to feminist, is insanely high.<br>So getting raped is a part of fitting in too.<br>I don't see what the big deal is.</br></br></br>  <br>She was held at knife point. Id never bring anything up ever. <br><br>But no. Quite the opposite of how i think.<br>It's an impossible thing to argue with her to given to circumstances so i leave that for here<br><br><br>Stay away from girls who engage in destructive behaviour. Being accused is something that will destroy your life. Because society tells us how to think.<br>Ive had friends who have been accused. Thankfully the story broke down though because i was with them the whole time the alleged rape was happening. With proof aswell even more thankfully.<br><br>My gf hardly drinks and sometimes that makes it boring for me sometimes. But then i remember what happens when she does. Not slutty behaviour. Just very attention attracting.<br><br>Im glad it only happens once im a blue moom at small gatherings with close friends.<br><br>She doesnt engage in destructive behaviour and stays safe on the off occassion im not with her while out in the city for night or something. And that makes me confident about her safety.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>So now you think everyone is a rapist? You're fucked.</br></br>  If I went into the ghetto wearing gold chains, flashing my money around, and playing country music I'm guranteed to get mugged and possibly killed, would it be my fault? Yes, if I were to drive through like a normal person then nothing would happen.  <br>No, Sorry OP, but its not , So stop trying to justify the thoughts of raping that one girl you can't get.<br>She was dumb, Yes, She could have avoided it, Yes, but no, it was completey the rapists fault.<br>Die in a hole plz.</br></br></br>  <br><br>So now you aren't even arguing rape?</br></br>  <br>Rape in the sense of waking up after blacking out and find out that you had rough sex with a wizard.<br>Not in the sense of being pulled over and forcefully raped.</br></br>  <br><br>Not him smart ass but congrats on rereading.</br></br>  <br><br>You're changing your life for something that happens once a year?</br></br>  <br><br>Big difference between: She's wearing something slutty and in a bad spot so she got raped. and: She was wearing something slutty and was in a bad spot (or good whatever) and she had consensual sex then cried rape.</br></br>  this is why i only drink to my limit of control in a mass crowded party amd i carry a gun. i dont hae time for dumb shit anymore. years ago i did thinking i can TRUST ALL THESE PEOOLE AROUND ME YAY!!… nah. fuck that.  <br>The main reason I compared it to the punch is because I don't agree with wearing it at all...<br>Its the whole "Girls get called sluts when guys get called legends" kind of thing that pisses me off, when girls are walking around with their ass hanging out and its rare to see a guy with tight shorts showing their bulge.<br><br>With this situation (Slutty clothing) I feel like it would drastically increase the amount of rapists, just like random punches would increase the amount of murderers, but It is still unacceptable, and unacceptable to use "she was wearing slutty clothing" as an excuse</br></br></br></br>  <br>If girls want full equality with men then yes she is equally responsible and deserves whatever punishment the man gets for putting herself in a position to be "raped" but if they don't want full equality then no she is not at fault and women are deemed to be too childish to be responsible for their own actions thus they do not deserve the same rights and priveledges as men. Simple as that.</br>  <br><br>No, an ad homenim is when you make fun of someone and say they're wrong because of it. I've had sex and I know this.</br></br>  <br><br>Huh?</br></br>  <br>If the girl says she has been raped the guy is fucked nonetheless</br>  <br>where's the problem? you can partly blame her for being reckless but still punish the rapist hard.<br>those are two different things.<br>the main point is that the punishment of hte perpetrator should never be mitigated by arguments like these.</br></br></br>  <br> She was dumb, Yes, She could have avoided it, Yes <br>Then why the fuck didnt she do that in the first place?</br></br>  <br>You're not really getting my point there.<br>Ultimately no victim of a crime is responsible for the crime. It's the perpetrator of the crime that ultimately broke the law.<br>That being said, there are many crimes/victims that we look at and say "well, why were they there, doing that?". And no that doesn't make the victim any less a victim, we just don't feel very badly for whatever crime was perpetrated against them due to their own foolishness.<br>This mentality doesn't exist with rape, if a person (because men get raped too, not just women) walks naked down a dark alley in a shit area of town and gets raped, there is no asking "well, why were they naked in a shit area of town down a dark alley?".<br>There is only "rape victim". Why is rape the only crime that has zero personally accountability for the actions of the victim?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>In other words: if you get drunk you're responsible for not only you actions (getting drunk) but others reactions (raping you while you're drunk).</br></br>  <br>This exactly. If they want equal rights they deserve equal blame.</br>  <br><br>That doesn't mean he's raped people.</br></br>  <br>My point was prior to any discussion we need to define rape. Going to a party with horny guys, dressed like a hooker, getting loaded on alcohol and drugs, then passing out in a bed after having sex with some dude is different than some nigger crawling in your window and holding a knife to your throat and dicking you. SJW's seem to think there is no difference.</br>  <br>So eloquently stated. You should be a politician.</br>  <br>OP is baiting hard here.<br><br>there are some universal facts to this whole scenario, which are often ignored:<br><br>A) parties are not all the same. safe parties have a high group coherence, everybody is friends with someone else, there's a protective effect. those are safe parties. those are also not your typical student parties, where group coherence is often very weak and outsiders can attend. outsiders can attend to steal stuff or take sexual advantage. it is an unsafe party. stick with your friends.<br><br>B) the implications of dressing in a sexy way are unpredictable, as soon as you leave your circle of trust. not everybody was raised to respect female self-expression. not everybody has enough self-restraint to control their sexual urges given the opportunity to take advantage. as soon as you leave your predictable circle of friends, expect the unpredictable. <br><br>C) alcohol and the connected alcohol cult in most universities does not bring out the best in people. drinking wildly at a party full of strangers poses inherently more risk than having a glass of wine with your friends at home.<br><br>the world is not your living room. it will never be. if you think it is, you're living a first-world illusion. it would be wise to adjust your world-view.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Rape thread </br>  Every time someone says women should be able to wear what they want or provocative clothing this and that is okay.<br><br>That second one especially....</br></br>  <br><br>Because rape is power thing, not a "she's so hot" thing. Duh.</br></br>  <br>whiteknight manjina detected</br>  <br>This<br>Teach me your ways senpai</br></br>  Girls drink for an excuse to do the things they want but are afraid to do because they'll be labeled a slut. When they get caught they say rape because they can't admit to liking the things they really want. Truth is, women want to be lusted for, used, fucked hard, treated like a sexual object. Drinking, drugs, parties, all just an excuse to do what they really want.  <br>damn, thats scary shit<br>thats why i don't fuck drunk chicks man.<br>I did a couple times while hammered but they were cool...but horror stories like that are why i don't hook up with them</br></br></br>  <br><br>You're not responsible for getting raped if you're drunk.</br></br>  <br> Why is rape the only crime that has zero personally accountability for the actions of the victim? <br>What makes you believe this? <br>I heard that argument pretty often.</br></br></br>  <br>But isn't this fun to watch?</br>  <br>For the same reason that women can beat on men and get no punishment (in fact when men call police to report domestic violence perpetrated on them they most often end up in jail as a victim) it is because women "are the weaker sex" and "women must be protected" the feminists have taken this to the point where women don't have to be accountable for their actions.</br>  <br>stale bait faggot</br>  <br><br>Sorry pal. Whiteknights are fags.</br></br>  I actually knew a guy real fun guy pretty cool and laid back he was at a small party with a couple girls doing ecstasy. Well there is one girl who is sort of passed out so he just goes and lays by her and puts his dick in her. She wakes up and gets into it and starts fucking him back. The next few days she's in love with him trying to get him to be her boyfriend but he doesn't want to so she starts claiming he raped her. Technically he did but she gave consent during.  <br><br>By distressing I meant that she dislikes the girls who want to broaden the definition of rape so that someone who gets drunk and regrets having sex the following day would be put in the same category as what happened to her.<br><br>I have a friend with a similar experience to your friends.<br><br>He fucked some girl from the local pub.<br><br>She dragged my friend in to it when her dad was wondering why his innocent underage daughter was preggers. Despite the fact that she was basically the village bike and most guys had fucked her.<br>The baby turned out half black so he was let off the hook.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Op here. Not sure what you mean with baiting?<br>And i agree completely with you</br></br>  <br>i don't see a scenario where i am drunk and a chick is drunk and coming on to me where i don't have sex with her</br>  <br>they just explained what makes them believe this. pay attention.</br>  <br> I heard that argument pretty often. <br><br><br>So you must have a counter argument? Right?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh I know that but a lot of people seem to think if you get drunk you're asking for it. I think a lot of people confuse getting drunk, consensually fucking and then crying rape, is the same as getting drunk and getting raped.</br></br>  <br>So is knocking someone out and stealing their shit.<br>But if someone gets robbed while flashing cash we don't say "Oh, that poor person, they should be able to walk around with hundred dollar bills taped to their heads without getting robbed!"<br>No, we say "Wow, that person was really dumb and shouldn't have been there doing that"</br></br></br>  <br>Alright lemme lay this down for you. <br><br>She can dress like a slut all she wants, and she probably led them on but mutha fuckers need to display this thing we learn about when we're fucking 6 called Self Control. It's actually not that hard an idea.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Huh? You don't rob people for power if you're stealing their money. Do you know how analogies are supposed to work?</br></br>  <br>Rapists that go after drunk sluts are v just taking their dick and <br> fitting in <br>Rape confirmed to be okay because they're just trying to fit in.</br></br></br>  <br> Self Control <br>Easily lost after getting drunk.<br>Everyone knows this.</br></br></br>  If you think about high class call girls, the value of a vagina can be up to ten grand. Depending on how good looking the woman is.<br><br>So walking around with your vagina on show is like walking around with a ten grand watch on show.<br><br>Nobody should be stealingn your ten grand watch. Its wrong to do that.<br><br>But I guarantee that if you put it on display for all to see whilst also being paralytic drunk it will get stolen and people will not have much sympathy for you because you were so reckless.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you go and try to teach a drunk 6 year old self control. i wanna see that.</br>  <br>Criminals? She wasn't in the wrong neighborhood, she was in a party. With common people.<br><br>You are basically saying that parties are frequented by criminals, hence the average male is a criminal.</br></br></br>  <br>that only explains, why he was chosen for a victim.<br>it does not blame him, however.<br>2 different things</br></br></br>  <br><br>haha well said</br></br>  A girl getting raped at a party that she's fucked up at is just as much to blame as a guy who gets his nice car broken into that he parked in the ghetto.<br> hurrdurrr my feminist rights will protect me, because rapists really care about how I feel! </br>  <br><br>Money is power anon.<br><br>You should have learned that by now if you are old enough to post on this website.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If you lose your entirety of moral right and wrong when you're drinking you shouldn't drink. <br><br>Also have you ever even been drunk before? You don't just lose control of your body and go raping people and starting fist fights. Most people are relatively lucid, inhibitions go down, not self control you fuckin child.</br></br></br>  <br> What makes you believe this? <br>Well, you can scroll through this thread and read the many comments to the effect of "rape is never the victims fault!"<br>Or you can watch the news for awhile...<br>Guess overall that view comes from my opinion of our society and it's treatment of victims based off my life experiences.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Laying there passed out <br> Get behind the wheel and run things over <br><br>Yeah, totally the same</br></br></br></br>  <br> With common drunk people. <br>Ftfy</br></br>  <br>You dont rape people for power you rape them because you want sex.<br><br>See where you went with that.<br><br>Annons argument works. Get over. Just because someone says you should be more careful doesn't mean the police wont do their job to catch a criminal...</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>doesnt matter how slutty you dress, if someone forces sex on you and you tell them to stop but they dont, its not the girls fault at all.<br>dressing slutty only makes people think theyre a slut. it doesnt mean people can just use them as a slut.</br></br>  <br> implying parties aren't frequented by criminals <br>Look everybody, it's a NEET! I'm sure all those people doing cocaine and other drugs at parties are really just outstanding citizens.</br></br>  <br>Yeah because that's my point.<br><br>Are you illiterate</br></br></br>  <br> parties are frequented by criminals <br><br>they are. open college parties are a major attraction for criminals.</br></br></br>  <br> If you lose your entirety of moral right and wrong when you're drinking you shouldn't drink. <br>Yet people still do?<br> Also have you ever even been drunk before?  <br>Yes. It takes a lot to get me drunk.<br>Inhibitions go down yea. Thats why they start to get all touchy</br></br></br></br></br>  I'm pleasantly surprised by the lack of white knights and tumblr sjw feminists defending women. You guys are alright.  <br><br> rape compared to care broken into <br><br>kek.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>have you ever even been blackout drunk before? tipsy doesn't count, man.</br></br>  I would go so far as to say she deserved it instead of it was her fault.<br><br>Respect yourself or else ladies.</br></br>  <br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Rape was natural and normal for thousands of years minimum. The vagina is designed to be raped. Women regularly get wet when raped.<br><br>Breaking in to cars has never been normal.<br>They design the cars to prevent being broken in to.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You can make many correlations here.<br>The criminal is taking what they believe they have a right to.<br>They are asserting their dominance over their victim.<br><br>You could really make the same argument for rape: they're not raping for power, their doing it just because they want to get off.<br><br>I think the analogy is valid. But ultimately I'm attempting to ask why rape almost has an honored status among crimes. It's one of the few that is almost unquestionable, irrefutable, undefendable, ect. I'm not trying to say that robbing and rape are the same thing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Yeah its her fault.If you ask any girl that dress like a whore,she will tell you she does it to turn people on.She has half of her buttcheeks out showing,probably tongue/nipple piercing.She is ok with drugs and drink like a freak cuz its "fun".The ideal girl to force and rape the shit out of her  <br> it doesnt mean people can just use them as a slut. <br>I agree with that. Yet its obvious that to drunk guys/rapist this dont really care about that. So why dress like that?</br></br>  <br><br>nah, but i think you're a bit dense.</br></br>  <br>Better stop dressing up as a cop and telling people to fuck off when they run to me for help. Damn</br>  <br>A more apt analogy would be "Thief sees guy pay with large bills at a store then mugs him when he leaves."<br><br>Women dress like sluts to attract a man's attention, they're not welcoming rapists and they're not oblivious to what they're wearing and how it affects others. A woman's attire isn't necessarily what attracts a rapist either.</br></br></br>  <br>I think Dave Chappelle said something like this about dressing as a cop and expecting people to not come ask you for help. Just because you're dressed like something doesn't mean that's what you are, FUCK YOU YOU RETARDED FUCK!</br>  <br>I like this guy</br>  <br>It wasn't rape back then. It was continuing our species. We're not wild fucking animals anymore. Not counting the blacks. We can go buy sex if we want to, do you really need to rape something?</br>  <br> A more apt analogy would be "Thief sees guy pay with large bills at a store then mugs him when he leaves." <br><br>It should be a clearly drunk guy too.<br>To perfect the analogy.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>there's still enough in here to cause this fight.<br>i think we're slowly winning.</br></br></br>  <br><br>My sides, please return them, common we both know you don't actually think this.</br></br>  <br> implying rape isn't just breaking into some bitche's pants </br>  <br> consent is like tea.youtube <br><br> if someone says yes to tea, and you start to make it, and then they decide they don't want it anymore, you can't force them to drink the tea <br> don't make people who are passed out drink tea </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>People don't rape because they want sex. Where did you get that retard idea?</br></br>  <br>Then dont dress as something you dont want to be perceived as. Simple.<br><br>Hur dur</br></br></br>  <br>THE ONLY REASON I WOULD RAPE A GIRL IS BECAUSE SHE'S HOT AND WON'T FUCK ME YOU DUMB TWAT</br>   years ago <br> buddy's birthday party, everyone is tanked <br> go upstairs to use the bathroom <br> girl is passed out kneeling over the tub <br> her ass is in the air <br> start thinking  <br> grope her ass, slap it around a bit <br> no response <br> starting to get a boner <br> up goes the skirt <br> no panties <br> finger her a bit <br> no response <br> stuff my dick in, fuck her frantically for a few minutes, cum inside.  <br> pull her dress down, go downstairs <br> steel-hard boner 20 minutes later, have to go up and do it again <br> I must have dumped at least a quart of cum in her over the course of the night.  <br> it's 5am <br> pick a bedroom to crash out in <br> some girl is passed out on the mattress face down <br> oh fuck  <br> fuck yes <br> balls deep <br> I'm cumming inside <br> roll her over to play with her titties <br> it's my buddy's sister <br> I have to fuck her again <br> start getting paranoid that I'm going to be found out <br> leave the party early, go home <br> nobody finds out <br> my buddy is pissed as fuck that someone raped his sister <br> tell him when we find the bastard we'll beat his ass together <br> bros forever. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Uh, you clearly have never been to a party.

This is the sad true story. So when they have an ego bust and fuck the wrong dude and realize it sober, they feel like shit and claim rape.<br><br>its a ego thing, i almost got in huge trouble because she wanted sex the night of and I told her the next morning about it and she freaked the fuck out.<br><br>fuck women basically</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> drug users <br> always criminals <br><br>How's Dare goin kiddo?</br></br></br></br></br>  ITT:Nobody has ever read a Camille Paglia  <br><br>Which is totally irrelevant to talk about rapists or if people are decent.</br></br>  <br><br>"Rape is a Battlefield" sounds like an awesome metal song.</br></br>  <br>No you're not you are making an artistic statement.

Thanks.</br>    <br> What system are you getting it on? <br>You mean like desktop or laptop?</br></br>  Can someone tell me if having 4gb of GRAM is really necessary?  <br> laptop <br> gaming <br><br>Choose one.</br></br></br></br>  Ps4. Why the fuck would I spend 700+ dollars on a PC when I'll run it just fine on my PS4? Its fucking Fallout, not really gonna factor in graphics and I don't care for mods, kinda ruins the game experience imo.  <br>Trust always a good investment. I wish steam didn't drop privitization of mod community. Like still allow free mods but give a market place to sell them too modder gotta eat. And they give them a good platfrom to sell on too I mean rents not free why not charge someone to promote and sell your mods for you...</br>  <br>yes. it's like the minimum now. my stock pc has 8gb and its a heap of shit.</br>  <br> mods ruin the game experience <br><br>Dunno if bait or giant pleb</br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm talking about gpu ram, not system ram. <br><br>16 gb is the only way to go.<br><br>But i want to know if a 4gb gpu is really necessary compared to a 2 or 3gb.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> things poor people say to feel better. </br></br>  I hope it isn't shit. Fallout 3 was terrible and I'm afraid that Bethesda didn't take any notes on what Obsidian did with New Vegas<br>Looks like 4 will be dumbed-down and have features stripped, just like 3<br>No skills and no traits confirmed so far.</br></br>  -60 Euro pre-order on steam<br>-150 Euro pipboy edition pre-order in gamestop<br>-Wait for better pre-order options<br>-Wait for cdkeys to have it for under 40 Euro<br><br>What would you do?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>From what im aware of alot of modders. not a huge amount but a lot make them as projects for college/uni and they're probably just sharing. But i do agree a alot of mods add more than most DLC's and people need to charge for top notch work. I don't associate with steam so i wouldnt really know.</br>  Why did you do this OP? You know all the PC fags come whenever you mention anything game realated.  <br>my bad mate. no clue.</br>  <br><br>If you're a fan, but you don't care about the pip-boy, just preorder on steam.<br><br>If you're less of a fan and don't mind waiting, wait. <br><br>I would steam pre-order, personally.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>One of my friends said he didn't like Fallout 3/NV Because it was too complicated and hard to follow, he prefers Skyrim because its straightforward and easy<br> this is the problem with most people who play games <br>Fucking disgusting</br></br></br>  <br>Nah man my rig old af, said to myself 2 years ago I'll get a new beastie for fallout 4</br>  Anyone else a little skeptical about the gameplay? The gameplay seemed oddly akin to Telltale's The walking Dead or something similar. Especially the part where they found some roodypoo in a fucking minuteman getup.  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> 2015 <br> not playing on a gaming laptop </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're friend is retarded. Especially if get thought 3 was too hard, that game was pathetically easy and held your hand like crazy. <br>Christ if he thinks those games are tough, I'd love to see his reaction to Fallout 1 and 2</br></br>  <br><br>You're friend is stupid considering all those games are equally complex, just in different ways.<br><br>He probably just didn't like/understand the interface.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Or checkers....</br>  <br>PC<br>i7 5930k, GTX 980</br></br>  <br><br>Looks like we both made the same ironic typo.<br><br><br>Wat</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Couldn't care less of what you fags say about me with your mom-and-dad funded PC's. you're welcome to keep trying tho, just know it aint gonna bother me in the slightest, dumb niggers</br></br>  Fuck me, i can't fucking wait.  Pirating on PC. <br>Also make a strawpoll for fucks sake.</br>  <br>Get a 970 or 980. The 980 is better in every way, but the 970 is perfect if you game at 1080p. I personally game at 1440p.</br>  <br>What kind of mods? My pc rig is a bit old and I'm not going to be able to upgrade by the release, so I was thinking of getting on the One</br>  <br><br> mad <br> poor </br></br></br>  <br><br>I would imagine the biggest and most popular will be on xbone.<br><br>There is likely gonna be some mods that are approved as being stable enough to run on xbone, and some that are not.<br><br>Naturally the ones on xbone will probably also be the ones most worth playing.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, it's probably only going to have mods that don't require the script extender. Which is a very small category. Mostly armor and weapons will be modded. I don't think they can handle some of the bigger and more demanding mods.</br>  <br>At best, console will only be able to get very simple mods that are only vanilla plugins. This means things made in the GECK that don't add any new assets or change scripting. <br>So you won't be getting any new textures or models, no mods that alter script, no UI changes, ect.<br><br>Just basic things like new buildings made with vanilla assets, or new NPC's.</br></br></br></br>  <br>whatever mods are deemed acceptable more than likely. Probably everything but nude/sex mods lol.</br>  <br><br>I doubt you will get big changes to graphics, meshes, etc. Since the xbone is only so powerful.<br><br>However new weapons, new missions, new areas to explore, new armors, etc. will be on xbone, assuming they were made with in the original script confines of the game.</br></br></br></br>  <br>PS4, have a life and get pussy. No time for PC bullshit like teeny PC faggots.</br>  <br><br>You will def get that one that changes everyone's voice to macho man randy savage.</br></br>  <br><br>But is there an ending for my polyamorus nonbinary pansexual foodkin? And will xi be referred to with propper pronouns?</br></br>  <br><br>Probably anything that involves new items, missions, places and nothing that involves improving the graphics. <br><br>So, some pretty awesome shit for sure.</br></br></br></br>  Xbone <br><br>I have a laptop that can't run cities skylines after I reach ~50k population, so I think the best option is to run it on a platform I can get close to max res.</br></br>  <br><br>Yes actually.</br></br>  If I can get a job before November to buy a new pc to play it on, if not, PS4. Quite excited, looks like its gonna be good  <br>Dont be poor fucks and buy 3 pipboy editions for each platform, you faggots. You can sell them later for wayy more. You pc fags always tight asses about your money and call us console peasants? Nice logic you dumb fucking poorfags. Im  btw, fucking <br>Bums<br><br> inb4 I trigger some faggot enough to try to argue with me <br><br>Dont even try</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, you can play as a someone who is on all levels but physical, a cheeseburger.</br>  <br><br><br>I seriously doubt it'll get anything that adds new textures or models. They're probably going to want to contain everything in a simple plugin file.</br></br></br>  <br><br> waits for others to be triggered <br> is already obviously triggered </br></br></br>  <br><br>What are some examples of mods that would be in that category, assuming that is the case?</br></br>  Reminder that there are no traits or skills in Fallout 4  <br>Fucking faggot triggered itself</br>  <br>What if they introduce pre-order offers like special access to weapons and forget to give it to people who already pre-ordered?<br><br>I know they are not EA but companies ike that are becoming more of the norm these days.</br></br></br>  <br>kek</br>  <br>Same here.<br>Also nice dubs</br></br>  <br> tfw no wacky wastelander perk </br>  <br> Pc player  <br> getting pussy <br>Pick one.</br></br></br>  <br>Already gave some examples:<br><br><br>If you've ever used the GECK, you'll know the extent of it's modding abilities.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You're still going to buy it and jerk off to the all the many hours of joy it will bring your otherwise pointless life. <br><br>So yeah.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If anything, I'll pirate it.</br>  <br>CS:GO neckbeard detected</br>  Sadly, Fallout 4 will be a Sega Game gear exclusive  <br><br>And you'll fucking enjoy it so shut your fat mouth.</br></br>  <br>If mods will be available for xbone, then the mods can't be much more than Call of duty weapons and armor skins or new guns and new parts for your pixel art house</br>  <br>Whatever you say Todd.</br>  <br>Underrated post</br>  <br> 2004 +11 <br> deliberately limiting your experience </br></br>  <br><br>You're god damn right.</br></br>  <br> then the mods can't be much more than Call of duty weapons and armor skins or new guns and new parts for your pixel art house <br>It won't even have that. Shit you niggers aren't listening.</br></br>  <br>Xbox 360</br>  ps4, i have a shitty pc  <br><br> citation needed <br><br>It seems everyone is speculating, and you're trying to make factual statements.<br><br>Pro tip: no one knows for sure yet.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm sure it's going to have hidden skills. Like as you increase intelligence, and use systems like weapons nodding or healing yourself, your science and medicine stats will increase. <br><br>It's just not something you put points in yourself manually.</br></br></br>  <br><br> ТяIGGЕяеD <br><br>Assblasted faggots who cant bear the thought of someone not giving a shit lmfao. Closing out of this tab to play some gta5 on my ps4 as soon as I send this. Have fun knowing I wont read any of your attempted comebacksand getting angry about it. GOODBYE YOU FUCKING FAGGOTS FUCKING LOSERS! <br><br>Closing tab, bitches</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Meanwhile I can just buy something else instead of buying the same thing multiple times in which I probably won't even use in the first place.<br><br>Also, you look pretty salty my friend.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I guarantee console mods won't be anymore complex than simple plugins, and you can't add stuff like textures or meshes in plugins.<br><br><br>Skills are perks now. So for example instead of having a Sneak skill, it's a Sneak perk.</br></br></br></br>  <br> It's just not something you put points in yourself manually <br><br>Which is good in my opinion.<br><br>There was zero depth to the way the old fallouts did skills. <br><br> spend 5 levels shooting things with a revolver <br> nice now i can just add numbers to my barter skill <br><br>Shit was whack and every character ended up the same, so long as you maxed intelligence at the start.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Morrowind was fucking cool so stfu</br></br>  PC. I want to play at 60+FPS and not be locked down to a cinematic 30fps. I can't believe people are defending and still buying consoles in 2015 that are over the age of 12. Consoles are toys. I'm in Canada and 80% of my friends have switched over to PC and are absolutely loving the performance and obvious savings and flexibility that PC brings. <br>I find so hilarious when peasants call us PC Peasants..It's like a fat person attempting a zinger and replying "YOU'RE a fatass!" to the beautiful/thin aggressor. You're all retarded children.</br>  <br>It doesn't make sense logically, but it makes sense from a gameplay perspective, and gameplay always comes first as top priority.</br>  <br><br>Yep, Fallout 4 will allow for characters that are actually different throughout the whole game.<br><br>Way better than the old shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It was dumb, dude. <br><br>It didn't enhance the gameplay at all, it was just a chore you had to do whenever you leveled up.<br><br>TES always did leveling the best. Fallout has always been wierd and pointless.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>What. If anything it's the opposite.<br>Old Fallout games gave you new unique dialogue for characters with low Intelligence. We already know 4 won't have this because the E3 demo was on low INT. 3 didn't do it either, only 1, 2, and New Vegas did.</br></br></br>  <br>But the problem with TES styled leveling is that it<br>1) Promotes grinding<br>and<br>2) Allows the player to max out any and all skills with no limits</br></br></br></br>  a really shitty pc  <br><br>The only Fallout game that didn't allow you to play different characters each playthrough was 3</br></br>  <br> We already know 4 won't have this <br>You don't know that faggot, you saw like 4 dialogue options out of the tens of thousands that will be in the final game.<br><br>And you can't even argue that a branching leveling system is less in-depth and varied than one where you can just stick your upgrade points anywhere you want without ever having to use that skill. <br><br>if you don't use big guns, guess what? you'll never be able to max them out. That's the way it should be.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>8GB is more than adequate for gaming at this point, I'd put that money towards a new GPU. I wish I had known that when I built my computer, I would have invested more in the vid card and less in unnecessary shit and avoided dropping 400 bucks yesterday on upgrading it, on top of my initial investment. First build though, so I'm learning as I go.</br>  <br><br>All RPGs promote grinding, lol.<br><br>And fallout has always had a hard level cap. TES had a soft one. Totally different.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Read the rest of my sentence dumbass. We've already seen low INT dialogue and it was regular dialogue.</br>  <br> All RPGs promote grinding, lol. <br>Good RPG's don't. Fallout never has.</br></br>  <br>Here is my theory:<br><br> Xbone kids are exposed to mods <br> Start Youtubing mods and are generally exposed to mods. <br> See PC mods (Texture mods, Mesh Improvement mods etc) <br> Brains explode because they can no longer defend their plastic box and are completely amazed by the mods that the PC community have made, and also the vast selection of mods that they cannot have access to. <br>-Sell Xbox.<br> Buy/Build a PC and have a soft landing into the arms of Bill Gates and Windows 10. All of their trophies/Achievements are still there due to Live integration on Win10. <br> Purchase Fallout 4 again on PC <br> Make fun of their peasant friends as they play cross-platform games - Massexodus.jpg <br> Bethesda wins. Microsoft wins. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You have no idea if any of that is true.</br></br>  D5400XS skulltrail system.<br><br>2 E5450 cpu's, (8 core in total)<br>8gb ddr2 ram<br>2 gtx 480's in sli<br><br>right now all my games run fine (far cry 4, dragon age inquisition etc) and i still use a mechanical hdd but my load times are still fast so i have to reason to upgrade to some shitty i5 or i7 for twice the cost of my system just so i can get 5 fps more.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>gonna day 1 pirate it on pc then wait for the inevitable bugs to be fixed on the steam version, then I might buy it</br>  <br>How so? We've SEEN low INT dialogue in action during gameplay, and it was just regular dialogue. What else do you need?</br>  <br><br>So fallout is a good RPG and TES is not?<br><br>Under your definition, i mean.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You have no idea if that was even the same character you fucking autist. <br><br>Jesus. lol.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think Fallout is a better RPG series than TES, yes. From what I've played at least.<br>Fallout allows for far more freedom in character role-playing and play-styles.</br></br>  Ps4, my pc is dead  <br> right now all m <br>I pre-ordered mine (I know, I know, fuck pre-orders amirite?) for PC and paid $25 less than retail from a promotion my friend linked me to that was on TekSyndicate. Needless to say it was pretty awesome and he's since sold his PS4 and is one of us.</br></br>  <br>Dude, do you even watch the Fallout 4 gameplay demonstration? It was the same character and everything, same appearance, even the same name. You can see his name later on in his Pipboy.</br>  Todd the toddler raped fallout. Fuck this game  <br> Fallout allows for far more freedom in character role-playing and play-styles. <br><br>Not in the slightest.<br><br>Aside from the different races, skyrim allows you to choose from a large variety play-styles and builds. All of which is dictated in large part by your actions in the world, not just your actions at the level up screen.<br><br>Both games offer at least the same character freedom, with TES (any and all of them) probably edging out fallout.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You're still gonna buy/download it and you're still gonna enjoy countless hours of playing it.</br></br>  <br>Not from what I played of Skyrim. That game railoraded you like fucking crazy, and quests are generic as shit, always forcing me to just clear out dungeons. They never had any alternate solutions.<br>Meanwhile in Fallout every quest has a variety of way to complete it based on skill checks, perks, moral alignment, and factions.<br>Hell, in every Fallout other than 3, it's entirely possible to beat the games without even killing a single humanoid NPC</br></br></br>  <br>No, you'll be fine, especially at 1080p. That was a common 2012 build..I had the exact same specs. You can still sell your GPU for a great price and maybe upgrade to a more energy efficient, much better performing and cooler running 970. Your processor is definitely still amazing, though you should maybe consider OC'ing it if you have a Z series motherboard.</br>  <br><br>You can run a pacifist in skyrim as well. <br><br>There are skill checks in skyrim too.<br><br>There are multiple ways to complete quests in skyrim too.<br><br>Maybe you're just a boring person who plays awesome games boringly?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I have a I5 dual 750M 4G 6G Ramm <br>could i run it or should I kill</br>  <br> plug in a controller  <br> profit </br></br>  i7 4.2ghz<br>32 GB RAM<br>GTX 960<br><br>fuck you console faggots<br>PC MASTER RACE</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you have any fucking idea how hard it is to role-play any character other than generic good guy in Skyrim? I tried playing a Necromancer and it was impossible because of how limited the spells are. There's pretty much only one raise dead spell and it's weak as shit. Even worse is how none of the quests had any sort of evil route, I always had to help everyone cheerfully.</br>  <br><br>Just because the game is more difficult than you'd like it to be, doesn't mean you can't do it.</br></br>  PC. My laptop is good enough to probably run it on ultra (i7-4900mq &amp; GTX 780m).<br><br>I'm going to make my own mods and also install all the inevitable 4k tits that people are going to make.</br></br>  <br>The only real system. PS4 of course</br>  <br> GTX 960 <br>Weak as piss with only 2GB of VRAM. You need to upgrade.<br><br><br>What? Difficulty had nothing to do with it. If anything, Skyrim was far too easy. As a spell-caster, I wasn't even pressured into that role. I was a Necromancer who was mostly casting generic damage spells because the only Necromancer-styled spell it had involved me summing a temporary weak zombie.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>PC and Xbone. I enjoy playing these types of games for the first few playthroughs on console. Once I've beat them a few times I go on PC and mod them.</br>    <br><br>Why do you like wasting money so much, anon?</br></br>  <br>I have 4GB of VRAM</br>  <br>$60 isnt really that much.</br>  <br>Then you mustn't have a GTX 960, because those typically only have 2GB VRAM<br>Unless you have two of them or something.</br></br>  <br><br> said no rich jew ever </br></br>  I'm gonna cum so hard in November.

You can get, without exploiting, easily 2000 heavy armor. What this means is as far as protection goes light and heavy armor is essentially the same, but light armor gives bonus stamina regen + other offensive perks in its tree. <br><br>The devs looked at this and thought, "Yep. That looks good."<br><br><br>When you upgrade armor, its a flat amount. Not based on the base armor values. What that means is with smithing 80+% of your total armor comes from smithing. Which makes heavy armor and high level armors obsolete, save for aesthetics. <br><br><br>The devs looked at this and thought, "Yep. That looks good."<br><br><br>There are three weapon types. Blunt, mix (such as an axe) and bladed. Blunt is 30% slower, but does more base damage. When upgrading a weapon it is a flat rate. 90+% of your damage comes from smithing. As a result everything but blades are very weak by comparison and thus obsolete. <br><br>The devs looked at this and thought, "Yep. That looks good."<br><br><br>Critical damage is based on the weapons base DPS. So for a sword that does 22 base damage it will do 11 crit damage. Now the crit damage is excluded from any damage formulas and does not benefit from smithing. So when you are doing 1200 damage a hit, your crits will still do a flat 11 damage. Making many perks useless. <br><br>The devs looked at this and thought, "Yep. That looks good."<br><br>When sneaking using just the basic perk tree and the only real gear for it you get from the DB you can, realistically, one shot a dragon.<br><br><br>The devs looked at this and thought, "Yep. That looks good."<br><br><br>Also when sneaking, you can effectively sneak up to a person in broad daylight and from their front with out invisibility. <br><br>The devs looked at this and thought, "Yep. That looks good."<br><br><br>So when fallout 4 comes out I am sure the devs will look at it and think, "Yep. That looks good."<br><br>So forgive me for not being excited.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  PS4<br><br>I don't care about better graphics and I prefer playing games like Fallout on consol.</br></br>  <br>I love how CyberPower tries to get you to add shit that has nothing to do with what you're buying. <br><br>"would you like ab Nvidia shield to go along with that? Only an extra 300 dollars!"<br><br>"want a huge 4k monitor? Add $1000!"</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ok</br>  <br>..its a Bethesda game. They always come out crap. Play the PC version. Besides its best to wait 6 months - year after release anyway. Since its the age of the internet most games (esp. theirs) get released half done. So even if you do get a mod you like when the game updates, which it will often, you effectively can't play 'till all your mods update to the latest version.</br>  <br><br>Shut up you fat neckbeard.<br><br>Just play the game and have fun. You're not missing out on anything.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Apparently bethesda is actually going to try harder this time.<br><br>http://www.gamespot.com/articles/ho<wbr>w-fallout-4-will-be-better-because-<wbr>of-skyrims-te/1100-6428659/</wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't need it, but I don't really want a bulky pc either. I just really prefer being able to carry around an xbox controller and a laptop, and be able to play whenever wherever.</br>  <br>Without many mods I am missing out on quality, meaningful, and challenging gameplay. That's a pretty big deal.</br>  I5 440q <br>16gb ram<br>Gtx 970 ftw+</br></br>  SPOILER ALERT: Fallout 4 is set in a wasteland and at somepoint there will be Nuclear Fallout.<br>Game ruined for everyone.</br>  <br><br>Then download some mods or stop buying the games.<br><br>Idiot.</br></br></br></br>  PC<br>gaming laptop, i7-4700mq, 16gb, 2x 2gb GT 750M<br>hoping for good framerate</br></br>  AMD FX-8350 4.0GHz (4.2 OC)<br>Gigabyte GeForce GTX 760 2GB WindForce 3X<br>Gigabyte 990-FX UD3<br>G.SKILL Ripjaws X Series 8GB (2 x 4GB)<br><br>Pretty nice system, although I do need to upgrade my GPU sometime soon.</br></br></br></br></br>  core 2 quad q6600 @ 3.00GHz<br>4GB DDR3 RAM @ 1600MHz<br>r7 260x oc<br><br>how fucked am i?</br></br></br></br>  <br>PS4<br><br>though I wish I had good enough PC to play games like this so I can get the mods and everything</br></br></br>  <br>I hope so. Though it was balance that I had an issue with more than the bugs. Fallout was a buggy mess though. And I hated that 20% into the game you could have easily killed 80% of everything so the game quickly devolved into go to A, pick up quest, walk to B. Repeat. The world was empty and boring. Never mind that you were locking into one build. Say you use fist weapons, but you want to try guns. Well fuck you make a whole new character. You head is full, you can't learn something new. Same issue skyrim had at first. Don't get me wrong a year or so after release I am going to pirate the hell out of it and, if its good, buy fallout 4.</br>  <br><br>It'll run, but it won't be pretty.</br></br>  <br><br>Bethesda is very serious about getting mods on PS4 as well.<br><br>They're already confirmed on XBONE.<br><br>At least, some of the simpler mods, anyway.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The issue is that you need mods to fix obvious and amateurish mistakes that even after 6+ years of development time they have not gotten to. It says that if you want a good game you have to wait for the initial wave of fixes/patched the inevitably follow its release, then wait for the mods, then at long last you can enjoy it.</br>  <br>The ram alone will fuck you. It will probably run, but you are better off waiting.</br>  <br><br>So vote with your wallet and quit complaining about it.<br><br>They don't make games just for you, they make games for a huge audience. <br><br>If they made games just for you, they would all go hungry.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>none, i dont buy shit games from half assed devs</br>  <br> 629542▶ <br> core 2 quad q6600 @ 3.00GHz <br>aHAHAHAHAaa</br></br></br>  <br>Just wait. You only get one first play through. and, assuming you don't play games dozens of times, you don't want to waste them on a PS4. If it follows trend it will be at least 6 months till the game + mods are up and running. Plenty of time to save up. In addition the parts will get cheaper.</br>  <br> So vote with your wallet and quit complaining about it. <br><br>I will. I just don't see why other people should be duped just because of the hype train.</br></br></br>  <br>I feel you</br>  rate my friend. trips gets facefuck video. quads gets her fb.  <br>bump</br>  <br>weird tits</br>  <br>how so?</br>  <br>huge nipples and strechmarks</br>  <br>but big nipples are my thing..</br>  <br>bump</br>  <br>gross</br>  bump  <br>bump</br>  <br> bj with a condom on </br>  <br>whats wrong with that</br>  <br>this</br>  <br>Is she in jail?</br>  <br>yes</br>  <br>Nice trips</br>  <br>top kek. i kno her</br>  <br>would play with boobies/10</br>  Post her facebook  <br>niiceee<br><br><br>sure u do bud</br></br></br></br>  <br>read the title, its quads for her fb</br>  if she smiled and wore make up she would be prettier  <br>what do u think of her huge nips?</br>  <br>Yes.. that was a failed attempt at getting quads</br>  <br>you were close lol</br>  <br>agreed</br>  <br>whats right with that?</br>  <br>OP still hasn't posted video</br>  <br><br>OP must deliver</br></br>  <br>OP is a faggot<br>This is now a trips thread</br></br>  <br>if she wore make up while sucking dick things might get messy</br>  Mugshot  <br> pornstars don't wear make up </br>  <br><br><br><br>this is now a get thread</br></br></br></br>  <br>needs more cum on face</br>  <br>trips</br>  <br>OP is now officially a faggot</br>  <br><br><br><br>i uploaded it to mless a while back. lemme find it</br></br></br></br>  <br>http://www.redtube.com/pornstar/ale<wbr>xis+texas<br><br>I could be wrong about this but I think shes wearing makeup</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>moar trips<br><br>also OP is always a faggot</br></br></br>  <br>JUST DO IT</br>  wtf op  <br>I hope you don't have to search for her facebook because quads are incoming</br>  <br>i love nipples in general. could be little pink ones or big brown ones. i like boobs...</br>  post it you fag  <br> H <br> File: ash.jpg (630 KB, 2178x1566) <br> 630 KB <br> Anonymous 07/08/15(Wed)10:23:00 No.626622722 [Reply]▶        <br>  rate my friend. trips gets facefuck video. quads gets her fb. <br> + <br><br>0.3/10</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  check'em  <br>yet another.</br>  <br><br>lmao your sex lives must be like your actual life.

Keep going please</br>  <br>anybody else wanna contriboot</br>  I like the artstyle, its nice    now some anasheya  <br>Contributing is overrated. But I'll give it a shot.</br>        <br>I like this</br>              I've been drugging my girlfriend so I can get sole custody of my son &amp; move back to Ireland with him.<br><br>Like many Irish I was lured to the States by money, which worked well enough but grew boring fast. There's only so much one can do with money.<br><br>So pussy was a must. Fast forward to now, a few stupid decisions later, am now stuck (for now) with a pseudo-junkie completely worthless in every way a woman should be useful. I've had to quit my employment to ensure my son is taken care of. She abused a few minor drugs throughout her pregnancy while bored alone while in was working. <br><br>Where we live in the USA hospitals are obligated by law to submit a child's first bowel movements after birth for drug testing, which she failed. My son was born with marijuana and opiates in his system. Without me, the CPS officials would have taken him. The one condition to him coming home with us, was that I maintain a presence in the home at all times. Essentially, his mother has to be watched like a child.<br><br>I see no use for her, so even though she doesnt really abuse drugs on a consistent basis, I've been crushing up pills, grinding marijuana and putting it into everything she eats/drinks.<br><br>The caseworker assigned to her (us) drug tests her every time she comes, which is twice a month. Tomorrow is when she comes back. Today is when i make a phone call to this worker stating that I cannot take the "abuse" and "neglect" any longer...about how her drug abuse is a hindrance to his safety.<br><br>Once she is violated on her terms &amp; subsoquently arrested i will obtain temporary sole custody, get a restraining order then board a plane with my son, fly back home &amp; take a taxi to the farm where we'll live out our days together in rural cork.<br><br>Women= incubators for men's progeny...nothing more.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  sounds like a plan, godspeed  <br>Sounds like a good plan Mc. Sorry you had to learn about our women the hard way. The rest aren't that much better, but murican women are the worst.</br>  <br><br>Thanks anon.</br></br>  <br><br>All women are shite, this one is just exceptionally terrible.</br></br>  <br>Sounds like descent plan but you legit made me laugh when you said you've been grinding up weed all you did was give her high fiber</br>  <br><br>Also the psychoactive chemicals that she is forbidden by law to ingest and will be tested for.<br><br>I've put a fair amount of thought into this process.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Not enough. It has to be heated to a certain temperature to activate the chemicals. Why butter works but you can't just eat weed. God Irish people are dumb as fuck.</br>  <br><br>Thanks for your insight Mr.Botanist. I've done my research, she will fail.</br></br>  <br>He's right you know. THC needs to be heated to a certain temp.</br>  <br>I had a run in with them they tried to do something similar to the "babysitting" thing but my wife just had a temporary break down and went to get help. Ended with me cusing the cps workers boss out over the phone and letting them know i was getting a lawyer because they wanted me to quit my job to stay home which would have led to conditions to where they could have taken my kids cps pushes to take kids not help</br>  <br>Not a botanist lol. Google it potato farmer besides welcome to the USA men don't get the kids. Especially not ones with fucked up teeth and greasy hair. Go shave that pube mustache and fix your under bite then come back and talk to us.</br>  <br><br><br>Weeb bro here thc has to be activated through heat</br></br></br>  <br><br>She doesn't need to get high, she needs to fail the fucking test. If she got high she'd know something was up Einstein.<br><br>Dude's method is sound, she will fail.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> all that projecting <br><br>Topkek</br></br></br></br>  <br>Haha I love people who didn't go to college. If it doesn't get in your bloodstream you won't test positive. She is literally just ingesting plant matter and nothing else. Dude is fucked and better get to liking it.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Stoners. Listen. You're missing the point entirely.<br><br>I'm not getting her high, I'm poisoning her blood when illicit chemicals.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Please god post tomorrow when you're stuck with her. And post some tits too or gtfo.</br>  <br><br>Tits or gtfo cumdumpster.<br><br>But really though, you're an idiot.<br><br>What does University studies have to do with illegal substances in your country? Not there is a major for marijuana cultivation. <br><br>Why are all Americans retarded?<br><br>Those chemicals are absorbed though the pores in your skin if you are a trimmer at a dispensary. Hence why they wear gloves. Also as to not taint the product because it's "medicine".</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> when illicit chemicals <br><br>Topkek dirty Irish trying to sound smart.</br></br></br>  <br>good luck op. sounds like a solid plan and sounds like the kid's going to benefit a lot more being raised properly on a farm.</br>  <br><br>ya actually can you post a time stamp with like the bottom half of your face or something so we if you make a thread tomorrow we can see what happens</br></br>  <br>we can see if you make* sry i are fucked up</br>  <br><br>Not stuck with her, been crushing up enough random opiates to ensure she will fail. <br><br>I understand Stoners don't have the capacity to pay attention to anything, simply reading the original post would support my actions...but..you know...that doesn't fit into your junkie mentality so you won't accept it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>DO NOT DO THIS. SOMEHOW THE FAGGOTS ON HERE WILL JUST DOX AND RUIN YOUR PLAN. FUCK THEM! YOU DONT NEED TO PROVE SHIT. HOME STRETCH MAN. TAKE THE KID AND RAISE HIM WELL</br>  <br>It's called drugs and alcohol the study of addiction. It was a psychology course, my minor.</br>  <br><br>Drug addict.<br><br>:^)</br></br></br></br>  You shitstain motherfucker. I will HUNT YOU DOWN you subhuman fetus fucker! America or Ireland, I don't care. YOUR ASS IS MINE!  <br><br>Psuedo-science engineered by a coke head are of no consequence to me.</br></br>  <br><br>Lol moron.</br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=QMV<wbr>2tfk3PXQ</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br> psychology <br> my minor <br>top kek</br></br></br>  <br>Good job man.</br>  <br>thats why I said half face, nothing we can use you find his house or anything but I really wanna know if this plan works tomorrow</br>  <br><br>Yea it suited me well enough. I'm vastly more resourceful than the average yank. I cannot imagine raising him here. <br><br>It's too ignorant, money obsessed, lazy and stupid to be a beneficial environment to raise him. We're close enough to major cities back home where we'll still be able to have loads of fun, while maintaining a humble life.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Kek, made me lol.<br><br>Pikey scum.<br><br>Irish gypsies squat on our farm all the time, thank God for guns.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The FBI uses lips &amp; ears to identify people through the NCIC you know...as no two sets are the same. That's also how the facial recognition technology built into Google images works, by measuring the distance between certain body part, size of the lips too...shape etc etc etc.<br><br>Just stfu, tits or gtfo cumdumpster</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, in which they discussed the detailed methods required to get high from taking marijuana orally. As opposed to just mentioning that it's one of the ways to take it, they got into the specifics of how to prepare it and why to prepare it in that way, and not in another way. Because that's super important to know when you're studying the science of addiction 101 for a throwaway minor.<br><br>Sure pal, sure.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Tits or gtfo.<br><br>Only women study art.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Who said I wanted her to get high? Quite the contrary, I don't want her to know that's why I've been feeding it to her. Will still show up in the blood though.<br><br>Wasted quads.<br><br>Paragraph= mad af.<br><br>Why so salty friend?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Listen it must be hard to understand but here in Oregon where I went to college we learn about everything in depth. It's really not that hard to figure this stuff out it's called Google.</br>  <br>That's why it was my minor. Easy classes and TONS of poon.</br>  <br><br>No you won't.<br><br>Keyboard cowboy.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Nothing that's ever worth doing is easy.<br><br>Overly saturated field, average pay is pathetic. Good thing it's your minor...</br></br></br></br>  You know a town called glanmire? I'm from Dublin but I work there on a farm and it is lovely down there. I think it's not much of a moral grey zone in terms of what you should do.  <br>If the FBI is involved he is already fucked without my help.</br>  <br>Haha dirty gypsy fucker doesn't even know who is on his side. Man I've been to your dirty country before (Bileek to be exact and Dublin) and I knew you guys were dumb but fucking shit man wake up Hahaha!!</br>  <br>Exactly. pretty useful information I use in sales all the time.</br>  <br><br>No. That's how images are searched. I'm not incriminating myself beyond this post.<br><br>One would have to be stupid to jump at the beckon call of teenagers, especially American teenagers.<br><br><br><br>Thanks for the tourism, don't come back.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How does she not smell and taste the weed?</br>  <br>well shit bitch you better do something so if you make a thread tomorrow wel know its you</br>  <br> where I went to college we learn about everything in depth. It's really not that hard to figure this stuff out it's called Google. <br><br>Ah yes, the College of Google, no wonder you Amerifats are so smrt.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Sales is 90% personality. People wall into a business because they're shopping for something specific, it's your job to make them feel comfortable enough to buy from you...not the next guy.<br><br>I used to sell furniture easiest job I've ever had.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Not going to happen.</br></br>  <br><br>You had my vote until the end bit - yeah sorry you happened to knock up a cunt, shit happens, doesn't mean you have to judge every woman for it.</br></br>  <br>is that cause you know you wont be making another thread tomorrow after your wife railroads your ass in court?</br>  <br>Well I purchase and negotiate land rights for natural gas pipelines so I wouldn't know about furniture sales.</br>  <br><br> wife <br><br>No I wasn't that stupid. Her caseworker said one more violation for narcotics and she would be arrested. She was already arrested after the baby was born for child abuse. Apparently doing drugs while pregnant is construed as abuse, who knew!?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You must have been to Pennsylvania &amp; Ohio. I know fracking is big out there.</br></br>  <br>hmm, why weren't you granted full custody at that moment?</br>  <br><br>That's not how it works.</br></br>  <br><br>It's not a judgement. Women do carry a man's progeny.<br><br>That's a simple concept to understand...unless human males are also capable of carrying a baby throughout its gestational period.</br></br></br></br>  <br>so weed and opiates in the babys system is enough? weed the drug the feds still demonize to this day?</br>  <br>isn't* jesus</br>  <br>Doesn't mean she won't still be able to figure out and prove in court what you've been doing.<br><br>Say hi to Bubba for me.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Any illegal substances in the babies blood. Alcohol is legal, but if that's found at birth it's also considered abuse.<br><br>There are lots of reasons a child would be taken from its mother in cases of substance abuse.<br><br>It makes this process of taking him effortless really.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> ...nothing more <br><br>Sounds like a judgement to me, stick by what you say don't back pedal because someone called you on it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>to be honest with you /b/ro even though she'd be an unfit mother...you still MAY lose custody. the justice system today is for women ESPECIALLY when kids are concerned. At least you have a plan though, and i clap for you.</br>  <br>Ya i'm aware, thats what i'm saying one illegal drug and probably legal one in the babys system isn't enough to have the child removed assuming there is a suitable guardian available?</br>  <br><br>What I've been doing? I'm straight edge, she on the other hand is a dangerous junkie according to "the law" so it'll be effortless.<br><br>I'm a model citizen in their eyes, I can do no wrong, I can also pass a substance abuse test.

Hell some women are and some men are nothing more than sperm donors. <br><br>I actually support your plan, the law tends to favor the mother over the father, even if the mother is exactly like your child's mother but with that being said don't judge all women by a few.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This dude is in for a world of hurt. I'm starting to feel bad at how clueless he is. Seriously OP you are going to end up in prison over this.</br>  i had surgery a few weeks ago and didn't take any of my hydrocodone.<br>i figured id crush up a pill or two in my wifes drink and then take advantage of her.<br><br>will 2 pills be too much?</br></br></br>  <br>Why does this sound suspiciously like it was ripped from the plot of Sons of Anarchy. Seriously son, you've changed some shit up, but it's still a recognizable plotline.</br>  <br>So why didn't he/you get custody?</br>  <br>This happened is SOA?</br>  <br><br>Who said court? I'll get default custody because she's in jail, then I will file a restraining order, then go home. <br><br>Ireland is non-extradition. I cannot be convicted of kidnapping my own blood, not in Ireland. <br><br>As far as thea is concerned as soon as I touch soil in Ireland I don't have to respond to anything I get in the mail from yankeeland.<br><br>She's a useless stoner anyway, she won't miss him, she doesn't even feed him, change him, bathe him, play with him...she's useless. Hence why we're better off without her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hydros *will* get you high but it's not a knockout pill. The knockout pills are highly illegal (not even prescribed) and hard to get.<br><br>And honestly, hydros make me feel good, but they make my sex drive nonexistent.... so not a good play, and if you got caught doing it, probably a relationship ruiner (possibly with jail time on top of it).<br><br>If it's your wife, why would you need to "take advantage of her"? If your wife ain't helpin you out sexually it's time for a devorce, mate.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>congrats op. treacherous and scheming like a woman</br>  <br>Well, the drugging of the mother to get custody happened.... then the abduction of the son to go to Ireland happened.... not quite in the same way but so close it seems like that post is strongly based on it.</br>  <br><br>Nice trips and I meant as in due to why at birth you didn't get full custody. <br><br>You weren't in Ireland when you committed the crime, you can be deported and charged (common you should know this already).<br><br>That's fine but ignorance isn't always bliss unless you go into hiding/change your and his name etc they can find you.<br><br>Do I have to spell it out for the third time that I agree with you in regards to why you are doing this?<br><br>Did you respond to the wrong comment since I essentially asked none of this?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I've never watched that hillbilly program.<br><br>Only a butthurt woman would try to discredit me at this point.<br><br>Typical.<br><br><br><br>I dont want resistance or pushback, if she's deemed useless by the state it makes this 1000x easier for me to ghost with no consequences.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Now he's talking about kidnapping and trust me buddy you won't just leave that easy.</br>  <br>See<br><br><br>[Citation needed]<br><br>Tits or gtfo while you're doing that.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's not kidnapping.<br><br>:^)<br><br>It's legally leaving with my own child.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, if your gf ain't retarded she realizes at this point that someone's been slipping her drugs so she reads positive on the tests (and if she's of at least average intelligence, she knows it's you). <br><br>Just wait til she presents some of the drug laced food/drink you've been slipping her to investigators.... that's a pretty serious crime, dude. She'll probably play along with you, while she actually is probably cognizant something strange has been happening, and gather evidence til she can put you away for it.</br></br></br>  <br>YOUR THE KING OF DOG SHITE<br> My sides </br></br>  <br><br>It's not kidnapping is the point.<br><br>A court will give me custody bc she's useless and if she tries to subpoena me for any reason, by law I don't have to respond as I'm in sole custody of him.<br><br>Not hard to understand ya know.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>She's a drug addict, she has no voice or choice.<br><br>She is well fooked. I will get what I want.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ohh is that around the time when Jaks bitch faked a miscarriage and blamed it on his mom?</br>  <br><br>I didn't say it was kidnapping? <br><br>You can also be arrested for having someone falsely arrested...</br></br></br></br>   you have to light it to even have a chemical reaction to get into blood stream. I'm not a stoner and I know that  <br>Nice blog, cunt.</br>  Yeah weed isn't going to work. Put ecstacy in there.  Also if u have all these drugs you don't deserve your child fucking scum.  <br><br> falsely  <br><br>No I'm 100% certain she'll reoffend by testing positive for drugs.<br><br><br><br>Thanks for your opinion random American teenager.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yea that's not how digestion works.</br></br>  <br>Your welcome deadbeat dad.</br>  <br><br>Stop trying.</br></br>  <br><br> your <br><br>Thank Christ I'm getting him out of this ignorant shithole</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Depends on if you get caught which is still a possibility. It's not going to take brain surgery that you've been fucking with her especially when suddenly you ditch with the child so no doubt they or at least she will look into it. <br><br>Then again you might not be found, hell I don't care with way since for the fourth time I have no problem with your method or why you're doing it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>more about lowering her inhibitions.<br>more about letting me do what i want so i figure giving her some hydro would make her more relaxed and not care</br></br>  <br>I'm getting you out of your shithole life</br>  <br><br> if I get caught <br><br>Is she going to produce feces as evidence?<br><br>Topkek. Not like I'd eat that shit I give her or that they'd take the word of a junkie over mine to waste resources conducting an investigation.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You are about to get fucked hard by the system. <br><br>I am going through the same shit, except they didn't give my kids back. Because I was still with the wife when they started the case.<br><br>Looks like you will learn another lesson about the US, its a police state. <br><br>Good luck you fucking moron who trusts CPS. The wife would have been a cake walk compared to them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You could just stage an overdose</br>  <br><br>Liar <br><br>They are itching to put her back in prison where she belongs. Multiple felon ya see.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Confirmed OP never been to America. In fact drug addicts seem to have more rights here.</br>  <br><br>Nope. I want her alive &amp; to suffer ad a consequence of shitty actions.</br></br>  <br><br>Meh overall I don't really care, she might look into it enough to find you out, ask around find out who sold you the weed but like I said I overall don't care. You came here to boast and have insulted essentially anyone who disagreed or hell even agreed with you. Plus I doubt any of this is even real.</br></br>  <br>I thought it was just me but this is defiantly SOA</br>  <br><br>Weak bait.<br><br>Junkies see prison as a revolving door friend.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Samefag, stop <br><br>No one watched that shite program that I associate with</br></br></br></br>  <br>Haha OP has been typing like a retard this entire time and is going to criticize someone else's.</br>  <br>Whatever faggot.<br>I have court on the 14th after not having either of my kids for a year. Hopefully I get them back, they might just place them with other families forever and never let me see them again. <br>And not because I drugged my wife like the bitch you are, but because she was a legit user. <br>I have had to go to mental health evaluations, drug screenings myself, pay the state child support, a TON of bullshit which has cost me thousands. And on no fault of my own because the CPS 'did not feel comfortable until it was proven I was a good father'. Bases solely on that.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>She won't she's too stupid.</br></br>  <br><br>Uh huh, whatever you say.</br></br>  <br><br> I dont know the difference between your/you're but I'm still speaking as if mu opinion matters <br><br>TopMotherFuckingKek</br></br></br></br>  <br>I so want this this to be real and for there to be an update to this. OP once your son is ripped from your arms and you are imprisoned and your wife is fucking Deangelo for crack while your son is licking on a crack pipe can you send me a vial of the tears. I would literally cum everytime a drop hit my tongue with that sweet nectar.</br>  <br><br>It's alright, this is all just in OP's mind.</br></br>  <br><br>It's not my fault you're also a useless junkie with past criminal offenses the CPS deemed unsuitable for fatherhood.<br><br>Swan dive off the nearest roof m8.</br></br></br></br>  <br>this sounds like somehting a bitch would do. you could go to jail for a long time for doing something like this.</br>  <br><br>Nice imagination you have, get into writing.</br></br>  <br><br>inb4 <br><br> I won't get caught <br> she's too stupid <br> I'm too smart </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dude, you are so fucking retarded. <br>I don't have past offenses. and I am not a junkie. I am middle class and white. <br>The state claimed I 'let' my wife do this shit. When I had no idea. This is not your euro fag country where the rule of law might still apply, this is the US where they do what the fuck they want based on nothing. You will see. Your master plan is going to cost you more than you bargained for.</br></br></br>  <br>being a good salesman is also not trying to push bullshit you want to sell or trying to offload the floor model on everyone that comes in I've walked right out of a place because at the last minute he goes your ok with the floor model right?</br>  <br><br>I didn't get caught the initial time when she swore up and down she didn't use during her pregnancy. That was easy to make a pregnant woman wat drug laced foods.<br><br>This time around was been significantly easier because of her post pardum depression, all she does is eat &amp; sleep. She wakes up to hoover down whatever I give her and waddled back to bed.<br><br>Idc about the actions, the ends justify the means.<br><br>Haters gonna hate.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> let <br><br>You could have stopped it, you're a weak enabler.<br><br>Your kids are better off in foster care you raging pussy.<br><br>Cry more.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Floor model furniture is for fratboys.<br><br>Great demographic to offload shite onto.<br><br>They appreciate the fuck out of it.<br><br>25%comish, plus protection plans, can't be beat friend.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>     all these people arguing over OP putting grind weed in saying she'll pass when in the same sentence he said crushed pills   <br>Well I am done with this bait ass thread. <br>My kids will be coming home next Wednesday since I complied with all their ridiculous demands. That or I will start suing people and taking it to higher courts. I have had every aspect of my personal life looked at so any bullshit you try to sling to me ain't ruffling any jimmies. And it is not like I haven't been told this by numerous people by now. Short of killing the bitch I could not have stopped shit, and since she was pregnant with my child that would have killed her too. Either OP is a faggot trying to bait people or he is really that retarded and is about to be buttfucked by the state hard.</br></br>  Op even if this "true" why go do all this song and dance? Just leave in the dead of night and fly back to Ireland you fuck.  <br><br> I'm a weak enabler that cries too much and projects how terrible I am at defending my manhood onto other men. I also troll /fit/and troll able bodied people because secretly I'm a gigantic fat faggot that cries too much instead of getting swoll  <br><br>Dyel bruh?</br></br></br></br>  <br>You drugged your pregnant wife? Dude... Your son is fucked</br>  <br><br>Not legal, not doing it that way.</br></br>  <br><br>He's fine.</br></br>  <br>Holy shit op you are the reason due process exists. How do you think you're going to get away with this? Do you honestly think that no one is going to look into this case for more than five seconds?</br>  Ireland is like a fat girl, okay for a quick visit but you don't spend your life with it.  <br> not legal <br> drugging wife </br></br>  <br>I would consult a lawyer because what you're doing is definitely completely illegal as fuck. From the drugging to the kidnapping. And yes it is kidnapping to immediately leave the country.</br>  <br>why would they appreciate a floor model?</br>  <br> He's fine </br>  <br><br>I can and will because she's a multiple offender &amp; I'm an upstanding citizen.</br></br>  <br>Look idiot it doesnt need to be heated.<br><br>When i cut down my various plants that i grow, i take a blob of butter and rub it on my fingers to get rid of the build up of resin on my fingers because fat renders THC. <br><br>No heating involved just normal room temperature butter. <br><br>If the heat friction from my hands is enough to have the effect you are talking about, then the heat inside a stomach will be more than enough should your false hypothesis be correct.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thought you said you were from Ireland fucking lying shit face</br>  <br><br>The ends justify the means.</br></br>  <br>That can only be said if the ends are justifiable. These ends aren't justifiable at all, whatsoever.</br>  <br><br>I will be granted sole custody by default &amp; be able to go where ever I want with my boy.<br><br>Do you understand how custody works? I do...that's why I'm going to box his mother out of his law with restraining orders. More than likely I will sue her for child support as well at some point in his life even though I won't need it. <br><br>Just knowing she has to live with less, is gratifying to me.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Holy fuck dude. Makes me feel lucky to have a girlfriend that takes good care of both me and my daughter...<br><br>Hope everything turns out ok for you Anon.</br></br>  <br>Not a hypothesis it's a fact look it up bitch boy.</br>  <br><br>It's disposable like their lifestyles.<br><br>They don't have to worry about puking on an $800 sofa as opposed to a $2500 sofa <br><br>Ya know. 99% of the time they leave all their belongings besides electronics &amp; clothing in their frat houses when they leave for the year &amp; start over fresh in September with new stuff.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Read my original post retard.</br></br>  <br><br>Moralfag.<br><br>Kill yourself.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Don't wish him hope, he's not the underdog you think you're wishing luck he's just a guy who's down on his luck but going out of his way to act like a cunt.</br></br>  <br>Just cause you live in the states doesn't mean your a citizen</br>  <br>See<br><br><br>Why are men raised by single mothers ALWAYS pussies like this?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> your </br></br>  <br><br>I can assure you friend you can get really high from just eating weed</br></br>  <br><br>Oh I agree with your morals, you just are going out of your way to act like a cunt.</br></br>  <br>Stop correcting me dumb shit</br>  <br>By that logic you should be ok with leaving today.
