No other threads seem to inspire so much rabid vitriol.  Because there is an evolutionary reason to detest it. Hopefully you cucks will be weeded out of the gene pool as your women are impregnated by other men.  <br><br>Insecure teenagers who think everyone should be exactly like them.</br></br>  <br>Wow...this is exactly what I fantasize happening to my sisters</br>  <br>not here.......... Cuck porn rules.... but only the legit amateur ones though</br>  <br>To be clear - I'm not a cuck. I just noticed that cuck porn seems to be becoming more popular for some reason, and some people on this are violently opposing it. I'm just curious to see if anyone can explain why. I'm pretty much indifferent as far as porn goes. I just like watching chicks getting fucked. I don't really care who the chicks are or who's doing the fucking when it comes to porn.</br>  <br>PLEASE GUYS post amateur cuck picks! This is sooooo Hot! If you dont agree then dont look at them</br>  <br>That's the theory I was leaning towards.</br>  <br>That's not a bad idea. Maybe we can draw the trolls out to conduct a case study.</br>  <br>Regardless of whether or not you're a cuck, my point is that there is a deep-seated reason to find cuckoldry repulsive. If somebody is attracted to it, my instinct is that there is something wrong with them psychologically.</br>  <br>From an evolutionary standpoint, there is no reason for a non-cuck to detest a cuck. Having a cuck around gives the non-cuck a better chance of passing on his seed.</br>      <br>I don't detest cucks. I detest the idea of cuckoldry.

The natural state of man is to be cuckolded. This is what caused the black man to have larger dicks. Women are natural cheaters.<br><br>http://www.abc.net.au/science/artic<wbr>les/2005/06/08/1386177.htm<br><br> Psychological studies also show that when men look at pornography depicting more than one person they prefer to see at least one more man.  <br> To test the theory, 52 heterosexual men aged 18 to 35 were shown two images over two separate days. One showed three women, the other a woman with two men. <br> "We found men viewing images containing both men and women had higher sperm motility in masturbatory ejaculate compared to men who were viewing images of just women alone." </br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>I explained it already. Why do you think unfaithful women are scorned in almost every culture, even more so than unfaithful men? It's because if a man invests in taking care of a woman and raising her offspring than he better be damn sure that those offspring are his. <br><br>I've got no problem with penises in proximity. Now you're talking out of your ass.</br></br></br>    <br>The black bull genre is just a subset of the cuckold genre.

And how it arouses men.<br><br>http://www.mensfitness.com/women/se<wbr>x-tips/can-jealousy-give-your-sex-l<wbr>ife-boost<br><br> Men have more sex—and better sex—when their girlfriend is a guy’s girl, not a girly girl. Best of both worlds, right? Eh, this is kind of a catch 22. The reason you’re having more sex is because of all her guy friends. You feel you’re competing for her attention and affection, according to a study published in the Journal of Comparative Psychology. <br><br> You want to remain the man on top, literally, and no one can blame you for that. In fact, this may be a good thing. Your lady enjoys more romantic attention, and you enjoy more sex, but there is a caveat. Though you’re in between the sheets more, you’re also fighting the sneaking suspicion that she’s being unfaithful.  <br><br> Researchers questioned 400 men in relationships, asking them to report on how attractive they found their partner, how many male friends they believed their partner has, and how attractive they believed these friends find her. The study found that the more guy friends you think she has, the most sex you’ll have as a couple.  <br><br> "We need to be reminded that our partner is valuable to us and desirable to others," Pham told Fusion. "This makes us keep working at maintaining relationship satisfaction." </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'll be honest i do it alot but i or any of the girls we are with Let black guys in .<br>Just mexicans and whites</br></br>  <br><br><br> http://www.seduction.com/blog/handl<wbr>e-jealousy/<br><br> Let me explain, or remind you, jealousy is a biological function. <br><br> When it’s the kind of jealousy that emerges when your woman shows interest toward another man, or another dude hits on your chick, jealousy boosts your sexual arousal so you become more, shall we say, competitive in nature’s own formula for propagating the human species. <br><br> This is why you might feel “anger” in these scenarios – your biological reactions are all amped up. It’s why jealousy can be all-consuming and make you unable to focus. This also explains why some guys get excited when their woman messes around with other guys. </br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>https://askthepsych.com/atp/2013/09<wbr>/09/psychology-of-arousal/<br><br> From this model, it makes sense that physiological arousal from jealousy sometimes fuels sexual passion, provided there is the context for experiencing sexual arousal during or immediately after the arousal from the jealousy. Indeed, many couples report having passionate “make-up sex” after a fight (and some fights include feelings of jealousy). The explanation is that the arousal from the anger and upset is attributed to sexual arousal, once the couple decides to move from fighting to having sex <br><br> One explanation for why sexual passion seems to run highest at the start of a relationship is that the newness and uncertainty associated with a budding relationship creates physiological arousal, which then gets attributed to sexual arousal due to the attraction and frequent sexual activity. As the relationship matures, however, the novelty and uncertainty decline, which may contribute to the common experience of less wind in the sexual sails. So, when there is a flare up of arousal, from jealousy or other sources, and it occurs in the context of sexual activity, the excitement can become something deemed desirable and worth repeating. <br><br> If there is no chance of resuming your relationship, you’re likely best off shifting your sexual attentions away from your ex-girlfriend. That may seem impossible now, but will become easier with a bit of committed effort. In the bigger picture, now that you know how exciting a dose of jealousy can be, you may want to date women who are at least somewhat open to alternative sexual lifestyles. <br><br> you may want to date women who are at least somewhat open to alternative sexual lifestyles. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>  Men really do get very aroused at the thought of a woman cheating on them. Most men are in denial about it.<br><br>https://www.psychologytoday.com/blo<wbr>g/women-who-stray/201006/kinky-cuck<wbr>olding-fetish-goes-mainstream<br><br> Wives having sex with other men, with their husbands' permission? When I first encountered this phenomenon, around three years ago, I thought this was a rare fetish, a fascinating one, but unlikely to ever be widely practiced or acknowledged. The social and evolutionary programming just seems too strong, suppressing female sexuality and encouraging jealous mate-guarding by males. I was surprised when I started to dig, that wife-sharing actually had a very long history, though it was never mainstream - when it occurred, it was in unique economic and social circumstances.In fact, a number of the men and couples who practice this lifestyle told me that they find the rarity of it, and the taboo nature behind it, a big part of the thrill. <br><br> Believe it or not, one of the unplumbed depths (sorry, no pun intended) of the Tiger Woods controversy contained a piece of this story. In an alleged email to one of his mistresses (link is external), Tiger wrote to her that he dreamed of being married to her, and coming home finding her sandwiched between actor David Boreanaz and athlete Derek Jeter. Tiger described to her that he thought she would love it, if this actually happened. This piece of the story got little attention, but I think it is fascinating, as who would ever look at successful, rich Tiger Woods and think that he would explore a cuckolding fetish? Just goes to show the depths of this phenomenon, still to be understood. </br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br><br><br>YOu are a sad fucker posting these everyday. It's already been explained to you that primitive evolutionary mechanisms do not justify such behavior today. It also does not mean it is healthy behavior.</br></br></br>  <br> http://www.sciencedaily.com/release<wbr>s/2007/02/070210170428.htm<br><br> For a monogamous species, sperm competition may seem unlikely. But according to the authors, extra pair copulations (i.e. affairs) appear to be a significant part of our ancestral history and could, evolutionarily speaking, spell disaster. Ultimately, a male whose female partner engages in extra-pair copulation is at risk of unwittingly investing his resources into a genetically unrelated offspring.  <br><br> Competition may also affect sperm count, say the authors. When men spend more time away from their partners (time that their partners could have spent with other males), the number of sperm in their ejaculate increases upon their next copulation. In one study, the authors note, simulated phalluses that most closely resembled the human penis removed an ejaculate-like substance from an artificial vagina. This could potentially signify that that the penis developed its shape to act as an anatomical squeegee.  <br><br> But sperm competition does not solely take place in the realm of our biological makeup. According to the authors, many sexual behaviors such as deep copulatory thrusting may function to remove rival sperm. Accordingly, sexual partners report that men thrust more deeply and quickly into the vagina following allegations of infidelity. The same periods of separation that increase sperm number in male ejaculates may also help to explain the increasingly lustful feelings human males develop after long periods of time apart from their mate. That is, the human male may want to copulate as soon as possible as insurance against possible extra-pair copulation. </br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br>  <br><br>That might explain you not wanting other guys fucking your girl. That's fine; if your girl goes for that, then there's no problem.<br><br>It doesn't explain why you give a fuck if other guys are fucking other girls. If it doesn't affect you, then what the fuck is your problem?</br></br></br></br>  <br> tldr <br><br>cuckolding is the redpilled mans fetish</br></br></br>  <br><br>Really, you used ancient societal norms to defend your case then say "that primitive evolutionary mechanisms do not justify such behavior today. It also does not mean it is healthy behavior." in the very next post?</br></br>  <br>You also never reply directly to responses. Some guy wrote a massive post trying to start a debate with you and you didn't even acknowledge him.</br>  <br>cuckolding is as bluepilled as you can possibly get</br>  <br>That's not the same person you absolute idiot. Both posts are still right.</br>  <br><br>As a male whether you like it or not, you are biologically programmed through your hormones to get rock hard erections from seeing women with other men. There is nothing that strikes up this jealousy more than a white woman fucking black men. Make it a white woman gangbanged by black men and your dick becomes extremely aroused from the imagery you see of your women getting blacked.<br><br>You basically should jerk off to this. Your dick is basically begging you to masturbate to this. It even increases the potency of your sperm. Deny it all you want white's.

This post is literally copypasta. If there are people who still deny shills on 4chan they need to wake up.</br>  <br>What can't you understand about primitive evolutionary mechanisms not AUTOMATICALLY justifying behavior in the modern world? How is that hard to understand? It doesn't mean there aren't some that are still applicable to today's conditions. You must have low intelligence, cuck.</br>              Got an idea. Shouldn't we just fight cancer with cancer?      <br>To clarify - that is not the OP posting all that greentext. I don't know where that guy came from. Not that I am disagreeing with him, but that's not where I intended the thread to go. To get back on topic, I was just curious why some people get so worked up about cuck porn. If I see a thread that doesn't interest me, I move along. I don't understand why so many people feel the need to troll the cuck threads so viciously. For me, it's just porn. We all love porn stars and we know for a fact that they fuck tons of men. Many of them are even married. But we still love to watch them. Yet with cuck porn, some people start foaming at the mouth and go into attack mode. I don't understand why.</br>  <br>A. Only in self reported studies do black men have bigger dicks.<br><br>B the human penis has grown due to a woman's desire for large penises and tall men. The idea that the one penis is longer than the other to better put sperm in a birth canal is idiotic and based in beta cuck wishful thinking. The cum fills a pussy up no matter how long the dick is and a small % get past the cervix to finish the job.<br><br>C. Even if niggers did the longer dicks and your long dick fantasy was rooted in truth that would mean they are the ultimate cucks. According to your retarded view: natural selection actually had to make the dick longer to keep up with the whoreness of nigger women...</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, my intelligence is not low at all. I understand fully agree with you on that point of evolutionary mechanism not automatically justifying behavior in the modern world. My point was that this point does not jive with the other point (which I disagree with). The way women were treated in ancient cultures was largely based on male primal instincts and superstition. "Because they did way back when" is not a valid argument for why something should or should not be acceptable in modern culture.</br>  New r34 thread because old one reached image limit<br><br>Requesting lesbian pokemon trainer gifs</br></br>        bump    Any Pokemon fucking girls?        <br><br>I dont get it, where are the 2nd dicks coming from?</br></br>    <br>Haven't you heard of Invisodick? <br><br>Its the newest and greatest pokemon!</br></br></br>    <br>What type is it?</br>  <br>see<br><br>I know their positions and close are different but thats whats happening</br></br></br>    <br>*clothes</br>  <br><br>Rock/ghost</br></br>  <br>Cool.

Is it not a waste of time, which they could use to do something better than stand around waiting for people to figure out how to not put onions in a burger.</br>  i live about 500 meters from a mcdonalds, but i've never eaten there. i've often been curious to try it, but... don't.<br><br>do you or does anyone recommend the food?</br></br>  <br>go threw drive threw order a few burgers <br>Drive straight back around with docket but put a burger under the car seat <br>or if the manager gives u food wait a minute because they check the orders if they serve them to ya</br></br></br>  <br>That last sentence was meant to be a question.</br>  <br>use the McDonalds app, depending on where you live you can get a lot of food for free, but also you could just order something special like<br> hamburger <br> no mustard <br> come back in 5 minutes <br> say it had mustard and you need a new one <br>90% of the time if you tell me your order is fucked up i dont need to physically inspect it and make sure your not lying, its not a huge deal.<br><br> ...burger has onions on it <br> suck it up and eat it anyways <br><br>its not like the guy was allergic he just doesnt like the taste, idk if its just me but i hardly taste the shit anyways...<br><br>if youre going to a McDonalds just ask them to make your order fresh, not like the food is old and rotten or anything, but if some items dont sell well then they could sit in those warming trays for over 2 hours, just ask for it to be fresh and it tastes 10000000 times better.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hey OP why do people eat McDonalds? What is your opinion on the decline of our society as a whole that would lead the masses to eat something they know to be horrible in every way possible. The food tastes like shit, its full of shit, and it makes you feel like shit after you eat that shit. Its also just as expensive as going to a restaurant, and even more expensive than making your own food. So why do people eat it?</br>  fuck this, im out, i was gonna get drunk but its too late for this shit.  <br>how does one easily get a job there? im desperate atm need rent money and burgers</br>  What makes the food so disgusting? The grease? It's not meat? It tastes good but why is it disgusting?  <br>It is meat. atleast i hope it is, it comes in a frozen patty form.</br>  Been working at the one I work at for the past 3.5 years. Not out of necessity, I just like the people I work with. Honestly if your order is messed up more than once after bringing it back then it's the initiator's fault. Usually tired or not paying attention. I've done every position in my store so far. There really isn't any reason for someone to have bad food other than poor staffing.  <br>Get arrested go through jail get some kind of parole or something and then get into a halfway home. they hire so many fucking people on work release its disgusting i feel like half my coworkers are on work release and about 3 of my managers are too</br>  How to get cheaper food?<br><br>I don't care how shit it is at this point it's just financial responsibility so do tell.</br></br>  <br>Now the question is, is it from cows.</br>  <br>nigger i dont know that shit, all i do is make it and give it to you. if you dont like it then eat the chicken</br>  <br>Most of the time I do eat the onion laden burger, just on occasion I actually want my onion free burger.</br>  <br>The fish fillet actually tastes pretty good even if its not real fish. really a surprise. or yaknow you could try the salads too they arent too bad</br>  <br>Do people ever really yell at you when there is a mistake on their order? What city/state/country do you work in?</br>  Actual McDonalds worker here, ask me anything related to your food being cooked or prepared, will timestamp with proof if anyone cares  <br>Why do I feel awful when eating a burger from Mcdonalds?</br>  Are the pattys grey before u cook them?  <br><br>What if I ask you to hold the pickles, hold the lettuce, would my special order upset you?</br></br>  <br>kinda reddish grey. they bleed</br>  <br>Well anon depends, typically could be some old 10:1 patties( the Patty used for mcdoubles, cheeseburger, etc) or old 4:1(quarter pounders,) or 3:1( sirloin steakhouse etc), heck anon maybe it's just you, but sometimes old meats the culprit, pickes onions lettuce etc are all fresh and properly stored soo nothing bad going on their</br>  <br>Nooo, should be pink/ red, normal burger color</br>  <br>USDA Grade A, says so on the side of the box</br>  <br>wow you actually call them that instead of reg quarter and sirloin?</br>    about to go to mcdonalds for breakfast tomorrow to get that bacon egg and cheese bagel, got anything to say or suggest?  How is the pay-to-work ratio? Also, can you get a non-cooking position? I ask because I might apply at one, but I'm afraid if I'm responsible for food, I might fuck someone's order up unintentionally.  <br>Don't go, but hey it's cheap.</br>  <br> ▲  <br>▲ ▲</br></br>  <br>Faggot's probably just trying to look smart to impress anons. Everyone who's not autistic calls them reg, quarter, and sirloin.</br>  <br>most people who eat the fish are black / old / or a combination of the two.<br><br>not literally, but i have seen a lady get upset over an icecream cone that had a tiny piece off the edge taken off (just because these fuckers rub against each other in the box)</br></br></br>  <br>I would suggest getting the steak and cheese bagel that thing is godly, but go ahead and get your thing</br>  <br>That's what there labeled as back in the kitchen if your curious, on all boxes of meat its 10:1 or 4:1, most of us usually just call it that, with the exception of the 10:1 patties, those are just 10's. If you don't know what 10:1 is, basically 10 patties=1 pound</br>  <br>"Yeah I wan a fish sammich and a large orange Hi-C, and two Bacon McDoubles"<br> every nigger ever </br></br>  <br>go into service they usually only handle drinks and fries, or see if you can be maintenance those people dont handle the food generally, or work in the office buildings</br>  <br>see </br>  <br><br>I suppose that makes sense. The apparent lack of diligence amongst fast food workers makes me support the proposed $15 minimum wage in the U.S. You guys should be replaced by machines that don't fuck up simple alterations to a customer's order. <br>Plus, it could incentivize "section 8s" to actually try to get a job and stop living off government benefits. <br>Nothing personal against you, I don't know you.</br></br></br></br>    <br>we can tell when we're handing out old fries, but if we try to make new ones and tell the customer to wait, the manager will scoff and give the old fries.</br>  <br>Idk about you anon but if you know jackshit about working in a McDonalds kitchen then you'll realize yes, we call them by quarters sirloin etc, but that's what there LABELED as, if I call out a 10 tray I'm not saying regular tray out, kinda shit is that?</br>  <br>im an employee i know. but the line people call out reg quarter and sirloin, even the boxes label them as such only the warmer trays and grill say the numbers</br>  <br> THIS, FUCKING THIS <br><br>i swear to god, its this, its similar with white girls 90% of the time every fucking time someone orders a hi-c or a sprite its a nigger, and every fucking time someone orders a diet coke its usually some fat white bitch with 10 double cheeseburgers with their order<br><br> implying im a lazy fuck who doesnt care about his job <br> implying i would lobby for $15/hr when %50 of the people who work at my store could be easily replaced by machines <br> implying i live off of government benefits because i cant afford to live <br> implying i fuck up on tons of orders <br> implying its SOOOO FUCKING HARD to just say "hey, my order is messed up, can you fix it?" </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ok thanks anon</br>  <br>The fries have a 7-minute holding time once they come out of the fryer, but they're only really good-tasting for the first two, and it takes 30sec to get them from the fryer to the box to the bag, so even if you get them fresh they'll taste like shit if you don't eat them right away.<br><br><br>Yup. And the beaners with "can i get 10 macCHEEkans"</br></br></br></br>  <br>Thank you anon you know, I use to be a grill guy so I had alot of time changing grills over to either ,10:1 or 4:1 setting to cook so its kinda how I see the meat, but now Im always working on line</br>  If I'm too lazy to make breakfast I'll usually order a southern style chicken biscuit from McDonalds. Is that type of chicken prepared differently than the other kinds? Can't fucking stand the nuggets, but I find the chicken that they put on biscuits to be good for what I pay  <br>orange hi-c: official nigger substitute grape drank</br>  <br><br><br>Hi-C, sprite, and fucking sweet tea. Basically anything that is liquid sugar is nigger drank.</br></br></br>  <br> "MAC-CHEEKANS" <br>this and fucking people who do the "MAC" shit<br> "CAN I GET A MAC DOUBLE" <br> "CAN I GET A 10 PIECE MAC NUGGET" </br></br></br></br>  <br>Not op here and I don't work at McDonald's. <br>A lot of people don't have the time or energy during the day to go to a real restaurant or make their own food. Also, a lot of people don't even know how to use a stove or oven. <br>It's typically ready within five minutes and tastes fine to most Americans that are accustomed to eating shitty, fatty food.</br></br></br>  <br>where i live its usually white people drinking the sweet tea</br>  What's the healthiest most natural thing yallve got?  <br>i hope some day we get grape drank just to watch them sweat with anticipation. purple, grapey sweat.</br>  <br>I've gone in to order and just slapped "Mc" in front of everything just to fuck with the employees. <br> "Let me get a McChicken, a McSweetTea, and a medium McFry with McBarbecue sauce" <br>If you can keep a straight face while saying that shit, their reactions are priceless</br></br></br>  <br>i wouldnt have a problem with that its just the people who say "MAC" it gets annoying</br>  <br>that chicken is the only thing we fry in the mornings literally nothing else is fryed except hashbrowns and they are a different kind of chicken from the others</br>  <br>Beautifully written, i applaud this post and whoever wrote it. Cheers mate, to you. May your days be prosperous and plentiful</br>  <br>They usually don't get annoyed, they just laugh because I look so serious while saying an order that sounds like it came from an 80 year old.</br>  Why did my MAC break when I shoved a Big Mac in it? Isn't that how you download more RAM?  <br>White people running beat-up Chevy trucks will drink most of it, but nigger bitches seem to like it too.<br><br><br>Grilled chicken, and lettuce. The chicken looks exactly like the shit you'd buy at the store (before we cook it), and lettuce is fucking lettuce.<br>If you're in the mood for beef, quarter meat is 80/20, so it's better for you than the reg meat.<br><br>Don't eat the nuggets.<br><br><br>I'd actually appreciate that. 8 hour shifts of non-stop movement always benefit from a little humor.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>those people make hundreds of those damn burgers a day. muscle memory probly plays a big part in your burger always having those shitty onions. what makes the onions taste so bad is that they are ALL unloaded in one blob on the burger. I hate those onions too.</br>  <br> this <br><br>Seriously though most people who work at a fast food place are &lt;25 and are looking for $$ because we don't want to twiddle our dicks all day. Or because parents made them get a job. Plus if we didn't work these retarded ass jobs you wouldn't get to get a McFlurry at 3 in the fucking morning.</br></br></br>  <br>Probably our salads. those seem pretty legit</br>  <br>whats wrong with the nuggets?</br>  <br>Not a McDonalds employee, but I'm pretty sure that the chicken they use for the nuggets is different from the chicken they put on biscuits or on the sandwiches.</br>  <br>but with grilled chicken, not the "crispy" or fried chicken</br>  Fellow McEmployee here. Niggers are the absolute worst customers. I'm a beaner myself, and beaners are bad, but nothing beats a nigger customer.<br><br> AH WANT TWO MACDUBBUHS WIT NO PEEKLES O UHN-IONS MAKE DEM FREYUSHSH <br> A SMAH FRAH FREYUSH <br> AND A LOARGE DOLLA HI-C WIT NO ICE <br> A TWENTY PIECE MAC NUGGETS FREYUSH WIT SWEET AN SOUR <br> AN THREE CHOCOLA CHEEUP COOKIES FREYUSH <br> "That'll be $11.75 at the first window, please."  <br><br>(Yes, I did the math.
