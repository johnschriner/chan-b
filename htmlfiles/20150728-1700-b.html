We miss him so, That you should know, And we honor him this day. He was an hero, to take that shot, to leave us all behind. God do we wish we could take it back, And now he's on our minds. Brad was an hero, to leave us feeling like this, Our minds are rubber, our joints don't work, Our tears fall into abyss. He was an hero, to take that shot, In life it wasn't his task, He shouldn't have had to go that way, before a decade'd past. Now he sits there in my heart, this hero of mine, Always there to make me smile, Make me feel just fine. He had courage,that boy did, courage in his heart. To take that shot, To end his pain, To tear us all apart. But in the end, he died in courage. Lacking, nevermore, He died a hero, Brad did, And we'll love him forevermore. We love you like a brother. We miss you so much. We will always love you, kid. Rest In Peace Brad.  <br>Thanks for the pics!</br>  I wanna see this fuckers face on the news.

Estimate 15% or something else?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yet another butt frustrated anon from the pizza pasta thread.</br></br>  <br>Not sure. I heard Bill Cosby got in a lot of trouble when he did the tip in</br>  It's expected but a good server won't flip out. Most of the time they just bitch to their co-workers.  15% for adequate service. Go up and down from there.  <br>This, the way i look at it if you dont want to tip tell your server that you dont so you get the service youre willing to pay for<br><br>15% ok service<br>20%+ good/excellent service<br>10%-bad/terrible service</br></br></br></br></br>  Do USA restaurants charge a service fee (about 15%) and you tip on top of that? Or no service fee and the entire tip is up to your discretion?  why would you tip someone for doing their job?<br>usa is a weird country</br>  <br>No service fee, you the customer decide how much money we make based on our service</br>  <br>No service fees.</br>  <br>When you go to a mechanic do you have to pay labor?</br>  <br>10% is standard for not awful service.<br>I personally start at 15% and for every minute my drink is empty I subtract 1% (i don't drink fast, and empty cups on a table show that they just don't give a fuck about customer service).<br>The worst service I ever had, all of the orders were wrong (she didn't write anything down), everything she did took forever, I had to ask for refills 3 times (she was just standing talking with 2 other waitresses). The total bill was about $50, I dropped $40 on the table and left. Negative tip for the stupid bitch who can't perform the simplest job</br></br></br>  <br>sure<br>but if the guy working for me is not the owner why would i pay him extra?</br></br>  <br>I pay labor to the business owner, not the mechanic. the business owner pays the mechanic a wage and he does not receive tips. try again you shithead</br>  <br><br><br>ok thanks. yea where i'm from we have 15% service fee, and usually leave a little extra (so the server can get it direct).<br><br>other question, when you order delivery (pizza, other fast food), is there a delivery fee? or just the cost of the food (and you tip the driver at your discretion)?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Think of it as paying for labor but you decide how much you pay based on the job done. Im not sure if its true but ive been told that food in the US is cheaper because employers not having to pay their employees as much</br>  <br><br>eh. don't know what you're referring to. asking an actual question because tipping and service fees don't work the same around the world, and it can be confusing and awkward when traveling to different places.</br></br>  <br>They don't make minimum wage. They make less, and everything that they make on top of that is tips based on their service</br>  <br>you know who's problem that sounds like? the person who accepted the job that didn't pay minimum wage. I'm already paying 250% more than I should be for a piece of steak with shitty vegetables and $6 beers.</br>  <br>Gonna get out the way for everyone else: <br><br>Tipping is a fucking retarded system that only works on guilt. Maybe the law should force workers to be paid a fair wage rather than relying on handouts. <br><br>With that being said, the idea of paying someone extra for carrying plates and writing down orders well doesn't sit well with me anyway. It's almost retard level tier of difficulty. <br><br><br>You're welcome</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>so it's basically something that the restaurant and service business owners came and everyone simply accepted it?<br><br><br>how come they don't make minimum wage? it's called minimum for a reason...</br></br></br></br>  <br>oh apparently minimum wage doesn't actually mean that. it means 'minimum wage unless we decide otherwise'</br>  <br>I dont know why the concept of tipping is so hard for you ducking morons to understand.. The mechanic situation you are correct you pay a huge mark up on labor and the owner pays the worker.. In the restuarant no one pays the server but you.. They get paid like 2 bucks an hour in most states.. I know its not you fault they have a shitty job.. But if you dont like it cook you own damn food.. Also the reason you are all such idiots if you want the deal like when you go to a mechanic than you will pay for the servers labor thru the price of the food.. This way its up to you how much you play based on service otherwise food prices would just be more.</br>  <br>I'd happily pay the chef directly if the food was great.<br>But why pay the greasy kid who carried it literally 15ft to me? <br><br>One job takes a bit of talent and effort. The other could be done by a well trained monkey.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Employers can only be pay tipped workers less than the minimum wage if that that employee makes at least the minimum wage in tips. Even if you didn't tip, they would be required by law to be payed the minimum wage.</br>  I understand 20% can break you if it's an expensive meal, but please everyone throw percentages out the window of you are getting a $4.25 breakfast. If you are waited on, you can give them 100% and its still under $10. Overtip the people at shitty restaurants, undertip at the fancy ones. Everyone's working  <br>I wasn't defending them, just explaining the situation. A good server can make plenty to live on (unless they serve niggers, they never tip) shitty servers have a below minimum wage job for a reason and deserve what they get</br>  <br>so why don't they just pay the waiters accordingly?<br>you're not saving money on food if you're paying on tips<br><br>it makes no sense to place this duty on the costumer rather than the employer</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>This.</br></br>  <br>that would be way too sensible!</br>  <br>It varies by state.<br><br>Here in Washington the minimum wage for all workers, tipped nor non-tipped is. $9.47/hour. Some cities here also have higher. Seatac is 15/ hour for service industry and depending on employer size here in Seattle its 11/ hour.</br></br></br>  <br>Why do people get health insurance through their jobs?<br><br>Why do people have "low taxes" in exchange for a Byzantine 401k/ira configuration instead of decent social security?<br><br>Why do people forget to fill out mail-in rebates?<br><br>People are very easily tricked by low numbers</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ha I actually live in Lynnwood. It's just that I'm an Australian, so I don't tip anyone.</br>  <br>Incentive based job, so that people get decent service. I'd much rather have it that way. And if people bitch about being waiters, maybe they ought get off their lazy, cock sucking asses, and get an education, or a better job.</br>  <br>Some places put an auto tip on there if your party size is really large</br>  <br>It depends on the restuarant and the situation.. Obviously you have never served..servers in certain restuarants can really add to the experience.. If you were to argue in good faith i am sure youve been to a restuarant that the server has earned every penny.. I will admit that the trip to applebees does not get vastly enhanced by a server... But they also do side work.. Clean the restaurant crap like that.. If you eat a 15 dollar meal at a place like this were are talking about 2 dollars extra. Its a way of keeping labor down and food cost down and relying on your generosity.. However its volentary.. If you cant handle it than dont tip and then you get all of the benefits and non of the agrevation</br>  <br>I never pay those. I demand that they take it off the check and I pay according to service. It takes no skill to write down what someone says and carry a handful of plates to a table while checking drink levels</br>  <br>This guy gets it</br>  <br>but if everyone has to pay a 15% tip, where's the incentive?<br>i have nothing against tipping if you feel like doing so, but don't make it mandatory</br></br>  <br>Auto tips are sneaky and underhanded. They slip it in there and hope that the people tip anyway, and many do because they don't see it</br>  <br>It's not mandatory</br>  <br>I would rather have a voluntary tip system than get overcharged for labor... You know what happens when you pay for labor.. The owner uses it as an opportunity to make even more money ie the mechanic.. If you dont like it dont tip.. Wtf are all you idiots complaining about... Its fucking voluntary... You realize you shitheads who hate tipping but want to pay the restuarant more can actually go in to said restuarant and eat and not tip shit... Best of both worlds.. Have some balls and do it nut why fucking complain cause you are too cowardly to live by your convictions</br>  <br>i live in a country where people get paid for their jobs, i'm just pointing out how ridiculous your system works</br>  <br>And mostly only niggers get that. I fight over who has to serve a table of black "people" because they literally never tip.</br>  <br><br>Never had anyone flip out over tips, but I'm not one of the cunt holes that so proud about not tipping.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>They don't make less. The employer makes up the remaining amount if tips don't get them enough money to be minimum wage. Either way, they always get at least minimum wage.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i agree from the outside looking in its ridiculous but in us we tip everyone for whatever reason... We tip fucking stippers... All you need to be a striper is tits and ass and dont eat too much..its the way it is in this country and if someone from the us doesnt like it why complain.. Just dont tip.. I exclude people whose countries do things differently as you have your customs and we have ares right or wrong</br>  Doesnt matter whether people 'flip their shit'. Tips are supposed to match the service you get, with a general guideline being 10-15% of total bill.<br><br>I have tipped €30 on a €50 bill for exeptional service. <br>I have tipped €15 on a €250 bill.<br><br>Its aaallll based on how good the service is, and servers know that.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>which shitty european country is making you tip in euros?</br>  <br>I pay for my product and service in the bill shown. <br>Basic capitalism.<br><br>Fuck generosity, earn that shit nigger.</br></br></br></br>  <br>i only tip if the service is actually good<br> be me <br> go to bar <br> a little busy but not insane <br> order whiskey sour <br> 10 minutes later get my drink <br> no tip <br> this happens 3 more times <br> bitch says to me "if you want another drink you're going to tip me" <br> "good thing i don't want another drink" <br> throw empty glass at bar tender and walk out <br> security saw and heard the whole thing <br> caught up to me as i was leaving <br> were really cool and just said "we understand why that happened, just come back next weekend she probably won't be here" <br><br>that's the only time a server or bar tender has ever gone off on me and sure as shit, that cunt got fired for being too slow and being a bitch</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Than dont tip moron no one is making you</br>  <br>Delivery fees are applied, but ti doesn't go to the driver. It goes towards napkins and other stupid shit.</br>  15% if I liked my service<br>0% and a fuck you on the receipt if I didn't</br>  Tipping should be illegal.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=q_v<wbr>ivC7c_1k</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br><br>wow, good discussion here, as well as total batshit insane replies.</br></br>  <br>I don't because I don't live in a country that adheres to this idiocy</br>  <br>Wait... You tip at BARS? <br><br>The fuck man.</br></br></br>  <br> paying someone what you feel they earn <br> idiocy <br>fuck me you're stupid</br></br></br>  I do 20% every time. Unless it was bad service. I'm not a cheap bastard like all these other douches. My girlfriend is a waitress so I know how it goes.  <br><br> get done with a round of golf <br> worker asks how my game was <br> wipes off the club heads for me <br> takes bag off the cart <br> Have a good night, Anon. <br> hand the kid 10$ <br><br>Life is good for me and I want to share what I have.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yes. i didnt realize thatd be such a shock...</br>  <br><br>Is that really something new for you? It adds up, sooner or later after x amount of tips they give you "free" drinks.. that's how those type of things work m8.. not sure what backward ass country you live in.</br></br>  <br> system of law that forces workers to rely on handouts from customers that are already paying. <br> social stigma that outs you as "cheap" if you don't tip some scabby teen for carrying you some fucking mozzarella sticks. <br> having to pay extra on top of the price of a meal, that's likely way overpriced anyway <br><br>totally not idiotic at all m8</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>From my experience:<br>No tip for shit service(i'll leave a note or tell them how they fucked up most of the time)<br>10-15% for good service<br>20% for outstanding service<br>Anything more is if i'm feeling nice<br>And no one flips shit that i've seen, but most people are expecting a tip and will look disappointed when they don't get one.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I don't tip unless the server has done an above average job. This includes discretion and non-harassing behavior, which most servers seem to fail at pretty hard.<br><br>When I do tip, though, I tip handsomely. Very few things make me happier than dropping 50-100$ on a small family-run diner because they kept things simple but awesome.<br>They sure need it more than the "finer" places I go to with, sadly often, worse servers.. which I gladly don't tip. <br>Only got called on not tipping once and after a proper conversation about the server's lackluster service for such a high-end place I was apologized to and had drinks removed from the bill as a gesture of good faith.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I try to avoid tipping restaurants when I get takeout<br><br>delivery i usually do a flat rate of 2-3 bucks, regardless of order size, as it makes no difference to them<br><br>in restaurant i start at 10%, and can go up to 20iish%, depending on quality of service, size of bill/order, and how long i am there<br><br>for drinks, i try to tip 50 cents per beer, and a dollar-2 for pitchers<br><br>tipping is fucking overrated though, and while i do it, i don't necessarily feel they deserve it<br><br>when i was a dish pig in my teens, and later worked pizza/salad and prep, i would see servers the same age walk out with 200+ in tips, totally dry, leaving shortly after the front end closes, laughing and happy, while the guys and girls working their asses off in the kitchen, sweating, burned, cut, and covered in all sorts of smelly crap walk out with maybe 50 bucks a week in tip out<br><br>the whole system is fucking retarded, and the front end of a restaurant makes makes an extremely disproportionate amount when it comes to the work/$ scale<br><br>fuck those cunts making 50k+ a year doing the work of a fucking pleb</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It really is<br><br>Yes it is. <br><br>I live in the UK. We don't do bars as much as pubs but I assume it's very similar. <br><br>I understand tipping at restaurants (don't agree with it but it's the "done" thing I suppose, least in 'Murica"<br>But no, never in my life have I heard of or witnessed someone tip for being poured a drink. That's fucking crazy man. <br>Like why is that even a thing?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> rely on handouts <br>i think you mean<br> doing their fucking job <br><br>stop being an overly emotional faggot. also, if your goal in life is to wait tables, that's fine, but you shouldn't be rewarded with large sums of money you dumb faggot</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why not just have a service charge that pays all servers equal and standard amounts like every other civilised country? <br><br>America being so backwards it thinks it's right as usual</br></br></br>  <br><br> being serviced <br> atmosphere <br><br>it's known they get shit wages and yes, that is of their own choosing but fuck. Hand a dollar over if your ordering some kind of crazy concoction hand over a couple bucks, If you don't have the money..why are you out when you could be drinking a fifth with your m8s in a flat?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>As much as i agree the people in back deserve more than they get, the front end is where people should get paid the most. The back is just preparing and cooking, the front is what brings in customers. Front end employees must look good, treat customers well, take accurate orders, be sociable, friendly, deal with shit customers, and what not. Anyone can put a pizza together, it's a pre made recipe, like a puzzle. Both front and back are important, but the front, to me, has more importance, unless of course it's shitty food.</br>  <br>because not all servers do a good fucking job you stupid fuck. you can shove your egalitarian bullshit up your "progressive" ass. we are trying to stop rewarding poor life choices, not encourage them, dumbfuck</br>  <br>Let's say server 1 messes up your order, and you get a little mad, but they fix it, however it may not be in a timely manner.<br>Server 2 brings out to the table next to you the correct order, on time, and is polite. Who deserves the better pay?</br></br>  <br>Neither deserves a tip. They only carry shit from one place to another. The one who messed up the order deserves less if you feel guilted into tipping</br>  I work at a small little independently owned bakery as a server, pays 4.25, with tax tho my checks are always void, but i do walk out with 100-200 bucks for six hours of easy work, can't complain really, that being said i personally always tip 20% unless said server is terrible then its 15% but i supose thats just because im a server.  <br>this way employees get paid better for better customer service</br>  <br>Yeah I never understood the percentage thing. I mean, is it harder to carry plates of more expensive food or something?</br>  <br>so if neither of them deserves anything in your opinion, then why even go through the trouble of paying them a flat rate? unless that wasn't you who said that...</br>  <br>The tip is to promote good service. Anyone can carry out an order to a table, but to have a smile, be nice, and go beyond just carrying an order to a table is what the tip is for.</br>  <br>So? <br><br>Give people extra money for doing their job correctly? <br><br>Why would I just give away money just because I have it? The fuck lmao<br><br>I still don't know what a fifth is to this day. Other than a fraction ofc. <br><br><br>Then don't hire them if they suck.<br>Or if they start sucking fire them.<br>Just like literally any other job.<br><br>I just think it's more fair, it's not "progressive". It's more, "Not being retarded with paying employees" <br><br><br>Server 1 gets a warning/disciplinary depending on the level of fuck up by the manger. <br>Also depending on the level of fuck up I get money off my order.<br>Server 1 gets paid as usual, but is obviously on edge to not fuck up again. This doesn't bother me because I'm not directly paying his wages.<br><br>Server 2 gets paid his/her wage as usual for doing their job. <br><br>Just treat it like any other line of work. Why is this so hard to grasp?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I agree with ya on this one</br>  <br> 10%-bad/terrible service <br>TIPPING IS SUPPOSED TO BE A REWARD</br></br>  <br>Are you a jew or just an asshole?</br>  <br><br> i still don't know what a fifth is to this day <br><br>underage b&amp;</br></br></br></br>  <br> Then don't hire them if they suck. <br>people don't always have perfect days, this helps them to better their service<br><br> Or if they start sucking fire them. <br>again, everyone has shitty days. no need to fire them over it<br><br> I just think it's more fair, it's not "progressive". It's more, "Not being retarded with paying employees"  <br>no... no it's retarded.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Only tip if you feel the service was worth more than the price you paid for the food and drinks. It is NOT a mandatory charge, don't give in to the corporate jew.<br><br>And the "they don't make minimum wage" argument is flawed. If no one tipped, they would make minimum wage, the owner is just being a jew and making you pay his staff.</br></br>  good/excellent service: 10% <br>ok service: 0%<br>bad/terrible service: complain to manager, ask for refund, demand that the server be fired, post negative review on yelp, twitter, facebook, youtube, 4chan, and kazaa</br></br>  <br>The system is fucked up. Protesting by not tipping only serves to fuck over the waitstaff.</br>  Nobody's going to flip out on you for not tipping, but if you continue to return to a particular establishment and consistently don't tip, the staff will take note and give you subpar service on purpose because you are clearly someone who has no consideration for the waitstaff and people in restaurants tend to talk a lot. So enjoy eating that cold spit-drenched food that took an hour and a half to get to your table. You earned it.  mfw i make 40k a year working 6 hours a day at an easy job, but hey no one can complain, your more then welcomed to start waiting tables, but thats none of my buisness...  <br>It's not hard to grasp, i can see exactly what you are trying to say, but it's to help promote customer service, those who are nicer get better pay. If the employees want money, they gotta work for it, the better they work, the better the company looks and the more they pocket. It's also a culture thing too for us to run this way in the states, just like how not tipping might be common in other countries.</br>  <br><br>go back to twitter you faggot.</br></br>  <br>doing what if you don't mind me asking? genuinely curious, not trying to troll</br>  <br>Its cool, well at the bakery i work at, we take out waters, answer questions about our cakes and sweets, they can order wines and other drinks, and then deserts, and thats pretty much it besides bussing tables.</br>  <br>I'm 22..<br><br><br><br>This should be done through disciplinery systems. Not by the public.<br><br>So it's not okay to fire someone for fucking up? <br>But it's cool not to pay them and have them continue sucking? <br><br>Gotcha.<br><br><br><br>It's just so fake and horrible to me. Maybe it's just my inner Brit coming out but I can't stand that overly-jolly, smiley, fake interest in my day kind of shit.<br><br>Like, you're being nice for money. I'd like a level of professionalism, but being all nice to squeeze money out of someone isn't right in my eyes.<br><br>I also think it creates a unfair work environment. The pretty blonde that bats lashes at every guy she serves is gonna get triple tips of a chubby teen guy who'll take triple the orders.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>is that in the states or somewhere else?</br>  I the US companies are allowed to pay their employees less than minimum wage if they work for tips. The reason why if you go out to eat or stay in a hotel and get room service and so on is the people doing those jobs might be getting paid as little as $2.13/hr. It depends on the state you're in but in my opinion you should tip people in service positions at least 15%.  <br>naw, people won't usually flip out. Just sorta quietly accept it. Usually 10% or lower means shit service or you're just poor as fuck, 15% is okay service, 18% is standard, 20% is great, and anywhere above is exceptional. At least that's how learned it. 0 just means either you forgot or you're an asshole.</br>  <br> This should be done through disciplinery systems. Not by the public. <br>lol why? that's fucking stupid, the manager has a lot of other shit to worry about than getting rid of someone for having a shitty day<br><br> So it's not okay to fire someone for fucking up?  <br>because that's what i said...<br><br> But it's cool not to pay them and have them continue sucking?  <br>lolwut?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Im in indiana, as a matter of fact,</br>  <br>Kek you actually give them a reward for bad service</br>  <br>Some places are starting to include service charges in the regular price of the bill, especially if its a unique event, but a lot of places still do tipping only.</br>  <br>ok, so then you make 40k a year through tips. that means that the place you're at is probably pretty fuckin good and you do your job well. good on ya, seriously</br>   During ordering she answered her phone and talked for a couple minutes before I asked wtf she was doing and she hung up. <br> Waitress was rude, I mean not just a little rude, but making angry faces, taking plates before we were done, and then disappearing for prolonged amounts of time.  <br> I'm usually a fairly generous tipper, but this time I decided no dice.  <br> As my gf and I are walking out the door I see the waitress stomping angrily back into the kitchen <br> We're halfway down the sidewalk when some short little manlet guido-type in a silk shirt and slacks and sunglasses calls to us from behind the restaurant behind: "Hey! HEY! I'm the restaurant manager and you're gonna tip my girl. Now." <br> The dude is half my size. I decide to take the high. I simply smile and say "Her service was appalling. If you expect your waitresses to be tipped, please advise them not to answer the phone while taking orders. At this my gf and I turn and continue on down the side walk. <br> This little sleazebag comes around and get in front of me and actually grabs my wrist. "You're gonna fucking pay up now or I'm calling the cops!" <br> Still I take the high road. I pull my wrist away and say "You touch me again, I'm going to defend myself. Now get out of our way <br> Here is where the dude REALLY fucked up. He turned then to my gf and grabbed her wrist and said something like "Then you're going to pay up!" <br> I didn't even think about what happened next. In a split second little manager-manlet was asleep on the concrete. My gf pulls me back and we leave. <br> It all happened so fast I wasn't sure WHAT had happened. Gf told me as soon as I touched her I came around with a vicious hook that connect solidly to his dome and sent his sunglasses flying a good hundred feet or so. <br> She is thanking me up and down for protecting her <br> Hot sex follows that night. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So glad I don't live in a tipping society, fedoras aside  Actually at my work if you have a table of 6 or more it automatically puts in a 21% gerituity fee on the tab, dunno if this is normal other places,  <br>That's true, sometimes it is just bs interest and cute girls making more, but sometimes the people actually do care, especially at local joints. I work for a drug store chain, so i don't get paid tips or anything extra, but i actually listen and take time with the customers just to be nice, learn a little, and kill time. But the kids who work hard and don't get as much tips will sometimes get a raise to help even the field, the wages in waiting aren't based on tips alone.</br>  <br>like every manager anywhere else? <br>Like what the fuck man? You never worked?<br><br>You've gone full tard and can't even understand my points<br><br><br>Eh, just seems like it'd be easier for everyone if it was a standard wage. But whatever</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tyrone is that you??</br>  I once walked into a sleazy little dive bar and ordered a beer. The bartender (little blonde, ditzy type) doesn't speak a word but pops the top on the bottle but just stand there staring at me expectantly. I stare back at her like "ugh....wut?" Finally she set the beer behind the bar and tells me to leave. Apparently I didn't tip fast enough before even getting my first beer. There were 1 or 2 other patrons in the place at the time.  <br>Thanks, i do take pride in what i do, granted its not glamorous but i do actually like talking to customers so its not bad.</br>  <br>Because as a mechanic you've got a solid trade that nets you a fair sized check every two weeks or so. No one WANTS to be a server save for the ones in the super swanky restaurants that can walk out of those places with $800+ a night in tips. Also, a mechanic just has to fix your car. Where as a server is virtually a servant for however long they are at their job. Having to put up with your horse shit because your water doesn't have enough ice in it. Or your burger has a uneven amount of pickles on it. Then comp your meal and get in trouble with management all because you decided to be a faggot. Faggot.</br>  <br> stories that never happened for $500 alex </br>  No people won't flip mostly complain about not getting a tip alsobuve worked as a bellman , waiter and other jobs were tips are regular and it usually is 5 dollars  <br>Some bars i know of expect you to slam the 3(or whatever per bottle) down when you get your beer as well. I prefer running a tab/bill, but some places expect the money right away. Not sure if she was a cunt expecting the tip or just wanting the money owed, but just thought i'd share.</br>  <br>So why is it that only servers get better pay for better work? The helpful old lady that works at Walmart earns the same wage as the asshole teenager who stocks the shelves at the same Walmart.</br>  <br>As a server i find humor and truth in this</br>  <br>Many mechanics these days work for minimum wage or per vehicle. If they only get 2 vehicles in a day, they are still there for 8 hours, but only get paid for those 2 vehicles. It's a shitty system making for less and less mechanics. It's becoming harder and harder to make an honest living these days.</br>  WHY<br>DO<br>YOU<br>ALL<br>CARE<br><br>Why do people get so worked up in these threads? Does everyone on /b/ work as a waiter or something?<br><br>I tip generously because I can and especially at our local bar because I get served before everyone else. <br><br>You don't HAVE to tip anyone and I see a lot of people who don't. Also, the argument of "don't go out" is stupid. The business owners do not care as long as you can afford their service/drinks/food. <br><br>These threads aren't going to persuade people who don't tip into tipping. Besides, it's not even always broke people who never tip.<br><br>Good God man, why you all bicker over this shit is stupid. If you are in one of those positions and you hate your job and pay, find another job. Believe it or not, you're not "trapped".</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Right, because nothing like that could possibly ever happen. Check your fedora.</br>  <br><br> WHY <br> DO <br> YOU <br> ALL <br> CARE <br><br> Posts in thread. <br><br>Faggot.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She was a cunt. I had a 10 in my hand waiting to hand it to her and she told me I need to "tip faster" if I want a drink in that establishment. Fuck her. I prefer to tip after a couple drinks or so.</br>  <br>Expecting a tip for opening a bottle.<br>Didn't even have to pour it.<br><br>Would've told her to die in a fire</br></br></br></br>  <br> still trying to pass off the shit story as truth </br>  Bartender here. I don't really care when I don't make enough tips, I don't plan on being a lifelong bartender. What I hate is niggers that come in. <br><br>Our bar has a $2 cover fee on weekends. Black people will hang outside the bar and wait until 1 am when the cover fee is void.<br><br>They'll all come in, sit at the bar, not buy any drinks, demand free pretzels and popcorn and bother all of the paying patrons, so they start leaving. <br><br>I honestly have no idea why they come in at all. I doubt our free popcorn and pretzels is that good.<br><br> inb4 white women bbc shit <br><br>I've never once seen a woman from the bar go home with one. Never. They smell like cheap weed, they're loud, they're rude as shit and demanding.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah people shouldn't expect to be tipped, granted most do, you should always see tips as a reward and not expect to be tipped.</br>  <br>I wasn't aware of that. If I'm the one keeping someone's hella expensive machine running after it ate shit because working on motor vehicles is not a skill the day-to-day person is competent in... I should be paid in accordance with the value of my skill. You figure that's why minimum wage is a thing. Minimum wage for minimum skill required. That's some bull shit.</br>  <br>Hire a doorman</br>  <br> Be me, be Ausfag 22yo m  <br> Visiting hollywood for a few days <br> go to hard rock cafe on last night in town <br> I'm alone so I get whatever that mega burger I think its called the oz or sumthin <br> drink <br> drink more <br> america has cheap ass drinks <br> drink more <br> Walk out to register and pay for dinner <br> Stumbling down hollywood boulivard <br> hear somebody running up from behind me <br> hey you! hey! <br> turn around to see waitress running after me <br> What?! <br> You didnt pay you tip! <br> REally drunk "Oh I'll give you a tip" <br> Drags me back to hard rock  <br> pay tip <br> bitch huffs and walks off <br> what a bitch" I say to the cash register guy <br> turn around <br> grab hardrock tshirt <br> bolt out the door <br>mrw I'm wearing my free t shirt right now.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because when the old lady signed up, she signed for the same wage. She just has to do what she's told, she can be as grumpy or as nice as she wants, she has a more specific task of cleaning, facing, and stocking. Waiters have to deal with orders, customer complaints, and move fast, it's never a specific to do list, it's always a hustle, and they are servants. They're both jobs, but they're different atmospheres, if you get what i'm saying</br>  <br>Also. Fun fact. If your tips, combined with your very small hourly wage does not equal to your state's minimum wage law per shift, your employer is legally obligated to make up the difference. Lots of employers, especially in smaller restaurants don't do this, mostly due to younger people who takes these jobs not knowing.</br>  <br>if a small amount is orderd or they dont really do much ill tip 10% and up to 20% for larger orders and excilent service. if they only take the order and bring the food and my drinks are empty for extended periods i always leave 0%</br>  <br>Maybe you should wait tables and make 40k a year instead, not that i dont fully agree with you.

Each delivery pays about 1.85 to the driver, but the customer gets charged about 2$. One place it was 2.15. I never reported tips unless it was on a credit card, and each night the manager would have to make up the difference to pay me minimum wage.</br>  <br>Private property, tell them to leave or have the feds escort them. Not 100% sure how the law works, but if the problem persists, they might get a citation or even a possible arrest for trespassing.</br>  Also something id like to know others thoughts on, people tend to tip shit if they didnt like the food or if something is messed up with it, do you all think this is rational? Personally if the food is bad i still tip well, because i dont think its the servers fault the kitchen fuck up something.  <br>Hire a team of big rednecks to kick out any niggers that get shitty or start fights. Eventually the nigs will stop coming in. Or give the bar a redneck, southern theme with rebel flags and rename the bar 'Lynch's" to scare them away. Or a gay theme. Either one.</br>  <br> not buy any drinks <br><br>Is the bar not for paying customers only?<br>That seems legit. If someone comes in and sits around for an hour without buying anything, can't you get booted out?<br>Or at least provide pretzels and popcorn only after someone buys something.</br></br></br></br></br>  I hate the entitlement attitude that comes with some of those people.<br><br> Walk into bar, new girl there <br> Girl with her arm on her face bored is serving the bar <br> She has bitchy resting face <br> I sit down and she says "What...?" <br> Comes back, brings the wrong beer back  <br> Gives me the wrong price (I've been to this bar a lot) <br> Try to ignore it, pay it and just pay no attention to her <br> She turns her back to me and watches TV <br> So I bought everyone 2 rounds, paid with exact change and left <br> Owner texts asking why I left (he saw me on camera) <br> Tell him I'm not going there when she's working <br> She's gone the next day <br><br>I tip $2 per beer. When your livelihood depends on tips, don't be a snobby cunt.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Everyone should be required to wait tables for 1 year of their life.<br>When I'm running around sweating and then bring your food 5 minutes late because the kitchen was ducking around and then you tip under 15% I rage my fucking face off. If you treat your server like a servant than you are a cunt. I never tip under 20% after working as a server.<br><br>Fuck you all<br>I'm triggered</br></br></br></br>  <br> Their ancestors have already paid a lifetime of tips of their successors during the slave era. <br>That is what I call investment, faking slavery in the cheaper world (old times) to benefit in nowadays costly world.</br></br>  <br><br><br>It's hard to boot out a group of nignogs without police presence. They start getting rowdy and want to fight.<br><br>There's a bar across the street that tried kicking them out. I guess one random patron said a racist coming when they were fusing to leave, something along the lines of "you niggers ruined our town" and they started a brawl with the bar and cost thousands in damages.<br><br>Now, everyone's afraid to kick them out.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>so after month of jennifer lawrence spamming, we now get inter-board spamming... ?</br>   be me, 23 m <br> at ihop with bros and GF <br> everyone orders and i get the corizo omlet <br> dissatisfied because the sauce had too much lime <br> decide not to be an asshole and just eat it <br>  waiter is ontop of everything, refills drinks and even gives me a discount on the whole ticket because of my omlet <br>  go up with bro to help him pay <br>bro covers tab and i cover the tip<br> bill came to $50-$60 but with discount it went to about $45 <br>  hand the guy a $20 and leave <br>bro and i are piling into my vehicle and i see the guy walk up with a small note<br> friend who did not pay is chuckling <br> the guy asks "who wrote this" <br> i read the note it said "Pro tip: git gud" <br> the guy looks at chuckling friend and throws the note in his face and says " no buddy you need to 'Git Gud'" </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeeeaaah. Not specifically serving, but ANYTHING in customer service.<br><br>If everyone worked a customer service job for even just a few months, going out would be a lot more pleasant.</br></br></br>  <br>Extend the cover charge until closing. If they ain't buying drinks they sure as fuck can't afford to get past the front door.</br>  <br>This is something i haven't considered, but a valid point. I usually tip for service, but if the food is bad, i'll try to let them know so they can fix it. Food quality isn't something i usually consider in a tip unless it's ridiculously bad, but i'll try to remember this next time so i don't bash the waiter on the chef's mistake.</br>  <br>I can agree with this</br>  <br>Poor b8 m8</br>  <br>If it was my bar, I would. He's just trying to avoid having his shit broken. When there's live bands, there's a $5 cover charge all night and none of them come around.</br>  <br>Dubs speaking truth, this is more or less how it goes. Look, if your server sucked ass (server, not kitchen) then yeah go ahead and leave a bad tip. If you know it was the server's fault then pay what they deserve. The problem is when people say "I don't believe in tipping" because that should also mean you don't believe in eating at restaurants that don't have a value meal and a drive-thru, simple as that. Another problem is people tipping poorly because of something the kitchen did, they some how think "I know, I'll show this place who's boss and stiff the waiter on this $140 check. That'll show em" but in reality chances are the server is busting their god damn ass doing whatever they can with the piss poor provisions their restaurant is supplying them with and on top of all the stress of trying to keep everyone happy, you just made them pay to wait on YOU. <br>Keep that in mind. Your server pays bussers, food runners, and bartenders from their tips at the end of the night based on their sales. Your check was $100 and you left them nothing? They just paid $3 for you to waste their time and be an asshole.</br></br>  <br>No one asks for tips it's like begging and poor form. Don't believe shit on /b/. Some restaurants (usually nicer ones) have a % already worked into the bill. Since it's a heavy service industry the company often pays them next to nothing. I have seen waitresses get checks that say "void" on them after if hours were low and taxes were taken. So largely if you get a few tables a night and they all tip around five bucks you can survive. If it's slow you need a new job. Most places if it's not worked in already I look at the total. If there were three people and it was thirty bucks or near that, I just add the first number into itself. 30 = 6 dollar tip. 50= 10. It usually works out alright. Delivery drivers I give less. They do more work, more often, get more tips, and I also know for a fact the store delivery comes from is like two miles from my house. I only give them a couple bucks and they seem happy to get it. I never hear of drivers getting more than five.</br>  <br>I'd be willing to call the feds, it's more professional than having a fight, and i'd rather see police at a bar than a stool flying out a window, makes the idea of safety to customers. Security is another option, but that's usually too costly to anything that isn't high end.</br>  Well i have no clue about local law but im pretty sure if you dont buy anything you can call police for loitering, but i have no clue  <br>Ugh I can't stand bitchy little girls who think they can be bartenders yet just sit there looking at their phones or the TV when not serving drinks. They are also the same type who ask you how even a basic drink like a G&amp;T are made. Barmaid used to be an art. She knew every fucking cocktail up and down, inside and out. And she also walked up and down that bar making conversation and flirting with patrons. Working those tips. Showing as much cleavage as possible was also a plus. That's how it was back in the day.</br>  In south africa tipping is the same as usa. 10-15% of ur bill. Or 1-3 rand for car guards, parking wordons official and unofficial etc. 1-3 rand 10cents or so  <br><br>i dont understand how people continue to think waiters will get less than minimum wage when it is clearly not true<br>it shows up in every single tipping thread and these fucking idiots cant figure it out despite it being explained to them</br></br></br>  <br>The best bartenders I've met were males. They made it fun, they were entertaining and they were always great to talk to drunk. They seemed to know everything you needed advice for. Plus, they make the best shots.</br>  <br>Makes sense. Sounds to me like your boss needs to invest in some cameras and extra muscle. Not sure what state you live in... but maybe someone licensed to carry a fire arm?</br>  <br>Here's how it works...<br><br> I bartend <br> I work about ~24 hours a week <br> I make roughly $20/hr after averaging <br> You tip me 10%, the guy next to you tips me 30% <br> You get jiggered pours, he gets heavy free-pours because he's a regular and he gets it <br> My manager, my MANAGER told me the bar philosophy: Take care of the people that take care of you, service everyone else. Meaning: heavy pours for regs and cool people, standard for unknowns and shitty people. <br> You can tip, you can not tip, I'm still gonna average it out and make good money for an undergrad student. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> car guards <br><br>Cant wait until we are culturally enriched enough that we need those here too</br></br></br>  <br>This. I tip all the bartenders at my main bar $2 per beer and then there's this Keno gambling game and I tip 10% of everything I win (unless I win so much that I have to go to the bank).<br><br>I always get shots filled up to the brim, free drinks and I can get served before anyone else if I walk in and there's a busy line.</br></br></br>  <br>negative tip topkek!</br>  <br>That keno thing is actually really cool, I've known some guys who did that and it stuck with me.<br><br>Had a good run at roulette and ended up winning almost a grand in like fifteen minutes. Kicked the dealer (?) like $100 and felt pretty damn good drinking for free the rest of the night.</br></br></br>  <br>do you have any idea how a restaurant works? do yu have any idea how fucking hard it is to manage one and make it successful? if i can aleviate some of the stress, im gonna do it</br>  <br>Also, because niggers don't typically care for bands, they want to see DJs and rappers.</br>  <br>lol nigerians normally that or dealing bud</br>  <br>Keno is ass. It's the worst odds of any gambling game out there. I lose my ass every single time. I usually do $5 or $10 bets and I play all night. <br><br>I'll win $50, $50, $110 and a bunch of other $50s but on average, I spend $80 per each $50. It's such an addicting game. <br><br>Idk how your state's Keno works but ours is 1-80 and 20 random numbers come up.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I just meant tipping from your winnings!<br><br>That's what's cool.<br><br>Keno is for old people...</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tipping is something you are supposed to do when a waiter gives you excellent service and you feel they deserve a little extra. Tipping is not hurr gib me monies for doing my job. If you simply bring my food to my table you will nit be tipped if you simply deliver my pizza you well not be tipped. Tips are a reward for excellent service and your employer is required to give you minimum wage at least. Don't like it get a better job or a second one.</br>  <br>Cops are about as poisonous to bars as niggers like these are. People see cops in or near a bar them immediately think "DUI" which scares away paying customers, too. That's why so many bars are hesitant to call the police even if there is a fight. Not to mention you call the cops too many times your shit could get shut down.</br>  <br>Our game is a bit more modern in Ohio. It's done on a monitor and it looks like a computer game. It's a $300 million+ a year business for Ohio.<br><br>Yeah, but if I win $50 to $500, I usually tip 10% of what I win. I've hit the $500 a few times and tipped $50 from it. <br><br>I'm not tipping $500 if I win $5,000 though. You can only cash tickets up to $600. You have to go to a regional office center, get taxes taken out and get a check from them.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, that's not true. Waiters are expected to be tipped for their service, that is why it is legal to pay them less than minimum wage. Tips are supposed to make up for that.<br><br>Yes, it's a stupid fucking system. No, you do not get to feel okay about not tipping because of that. When you don't tip, you are denying them minimum wage pay.<br><br>inb4 why don't they get a better job. Sometimes they can't.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I have to disagree with you. The best I've met have all been female. Just like you described, except women. But then again the shittiest I've met have been female as well.</br>  sooo sh0ta thread? I think so  <br>Goddammit. I JUST got done playing that game like 30 minutes ago.</br>  <br>weirdo!</br>  <br>One can hope. We really need it, along with them. And if anything i would say it's one of the best times to do it.</br>  im moving to chicago in a few weeks where can i start looking for jobs? i tried only craiglist  <br>craigslist--&gt;personals--&gt;casual encounters--&gt;m4t</br>  <br> 456▶ <br>  (OP) <br>no</br></br></br>  I would try grocery stores, you obviously can't be a piece of shit ofc.
