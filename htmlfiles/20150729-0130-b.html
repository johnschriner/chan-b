I love the Japhics Interchange Format!  <br>G is for graphic.<br><br>So no fuck you its GIF</br></br></br>    <br>3/10 bait, made me wince.</br>  If its pronounced JIF it would have been called JIF  <br>deh op, <br>.jif is pronun jif and .gif pronoun like gift with no t. fuckin idiot lols<br> deh um 2015 <br> deh um never hear Joint Photographic Experts Group LOL .jif </br></br></br></br>  If it was pronounced jig it would be fucking spelt that way.  <br>I love getting jifts on my birthday</br>  <br>graphical image format<br><br>it's pronounced gif.</br></br></br>  <br>OP is a faggot</br>  Even though it is supposed to be pronounced jif.<br><br>I and everyone I know personally say gif.<br><br>If who ever made it wanted it to be pronounced jif , they should have spelled it with a J.<br><br>We all know what a G and what a J sound like.<br><br>Go sound it out.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    The creator apparently said it was pronounced 'jif' but the creator was obviously a complete fucking moron, if you make a word you have to spell a word differently in order to convey its pronunciation then you're a stuck up wanker.<br><br>Its pronounced gif and anyone who disagrees should kill them self and make a gif of it.</br></br>  <br>literally no one cares.</br>    G followed by a noun is sometimes pronounced as J i.e. George. Gif follows that rule as well.<br><br>Also, the creator of Gifs said it's pronounced jif so fuck you nonbelievers</br></br>  <br>Exactly. It's not spelled jraphical image format. Ain't no dinosaurs in this shit.<br>giff as in gift. Get it right faggot OP</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>So you pronounce scuba as "scubba"? <br><br>didnt think so</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Your not suppose to pronounce extensions as words dumb shuts. Initialisms. Gifs are dead. all hail w e b m  <br>So you pronounce gift as jift... Fuck off pleb</br>  <br>Doesn't matter what the creator wants or and rules of grammar don't apply, it's public opinion that decides at this point, and it's GIF, faggot</br>  <br>Negro, any word that begins with "gif" ends with a "t," meaning the pronunciation of the subset "gif" isn't jif.<br><br> mfw 2015 <br> mfw have to explain English </br></br></br></br>  <br>Like student?<br>Your example Sucks.</br></br>  <br>I think you're trying to make a point. But to make a point, you need to make some kind of logical sense...</br>  <br>Giro, Giles, there are plenty of examples of g sounding like j. You morons just can't get past the words you're most used to</br>  <br>The fuck you on about? Do you always put the emPHAsis on the secon sylLAble?</br>  <br>Then why isnt george spelled as Jeorge? kekky kek kek</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>I guess you all say J-FEG too instead of J-PEG? Because the p stands for photographic. No? <br><br> b-b-but mah reasons <br><br>Shut the fuck up and admit you're wrong. You can't prove me wrong.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This. Its pronounced jif, keep trying to prove otherwise but you're simply wrong.</br>  Considering it's a proper noun it should be pronounced however the inventor says it should be. It's "Jif"  <br>P only makes f sound with ph. Its just a p in jpeg so I souldnt make the f sound. You're just looking for some point to make and making no sense while doing so. Sad really</br>  <br>because the g isnt followed by an i. bad example</br>  <br>That's the attitude niggers take when naming their children, and it's not an attitude that should be encouraged.</br>  <br>Never thought of that one. I always called it "jipidjii".<br><br>But yeah, GIF is GIF, not JIF.</br></br></br>  <br> Giles <br> giro </br></br>  <br>Giraffe not spelled jiraffe<br><br>BTFO</br></br></br>  <br>Oh yeah I forgot that one. Thanks</br>   thinking language rules apply to abbrevations. <br><br>GUH-raphics interchange format. ghif, not jif.</br></br>    <br>If that's the case, the G can also be pronounced as a soft G if we are all of a sudden forgetting the words those letters represent, thus making the pronunciation "GIF" with a soft G just as plausible. Please know what you're talking about next time.</br>  <br>This fag gets it</br>    It's arbitrary. Steve Wilhite created the format and he pronounces it JIF. I do as well.  G as in gin and gem.  <br><br><br>Shut the fuck up.</br></br></br>  https://translate.google.com/#en/en<wbr>/gif<br>Click the speaker to listen how its pronounced and get BTFO</br></wbr>  <br/>  thats so fucking true op man!<br>because gift is also pronounced jift!</br>  <br>*acronym not abbreviation.<br>This wouldn't apply if we said G-I-F but we make it a word, it's jif</br></br>  Doesn't the dictionary say both are acceptable?  <br>gif master race reporting in</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>so now we have overwhelming evidence it's pronounced GIF with a soft G, along with support from its creator. <br><br>... but of course some faggots here have to have obviously wrong opinions.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck the dictionary</br>  <br>I feel bad for how stupid you are</br>  why the fuck not just spell it gif, not jif. if someone says to you .gif, you know straight away how to spell it. if someone said .jif and you didn't know how to spell it you'd have to ask them. what's the point in complicating it? none. there is no reason to fuss over this shit, and gif is objectively better.  <br>Graphics Interchange Format<br>Graphics<br>Graph<br>Gra<br>Guhraphics<br> Jihraphics <br><br>Go fuck yourself.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kill yourself</br>  <br>English is a foolish language, thats why.</br>  <br>Initialisms*<br>You pronounce every letter when you're talking about file extensions</br></br>  <br>nice b8</br>  <br> can't spell gem without asking <br> can't spell George without asking <br> can't spell gin without asking  <br> can't spell giraffe without asking <br> can't spell generous without asking <br> can't spell without asking </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br/>  <br> we make it a word  <br> we <br>ok Oxford</br></br></br>  Don't know about you but this is some seriously old bait.  <br>those are normal words that everyone know show to spell. tell an old woman to save it as a jif and she won't know what's going on.</br>  <br>its a bloody good thing that the regular rules of spelling and pronunciation go out the window regarding acronyms, then.</br>  <br>tell an old woman to save anything as any kind of file format and she won't know what's going on you dumb shit she's an old woman</br>  An acronym does not need to use any of the sounds of the underlying words for its pronunciation, that is an odd justification and a rule that has never applied. Many people like to use the example of gift but when determining a pronunciation the whole word must be considered. gif is different than gift because of the last letter. Words that end in T almost always used a hard G such as graft. However if we just look at the letters "gi" in the abundance of cases a hard G is not used. Ginger, gist, giraffe. When gi is used inside of words it is almost universally a soft g; Allergic, longitude, gigantic, digit, etc.. pronouncing any of these words with a hard G would be difficult and uncomfortable, digit would become dig-it. Pronouncing GIF with a hard G is just not as obvious as pronouncing it with a soft G and when determining how to pronounce an acronym the most obvious pronunciation is the right one.  I've only met one person who pronounces it gif. I convinced him to do it correctly. Next person I met who does it is gettin they ass kicked  <br>fajjot</br>  <br>Slavic language masterrace</br>    Jpg is now pronounced Gaypeg.

Lol, JPEG, webm</br>  <br>Jesus, calm down kid</br>  I feel like the creator of the gif only came out in 2013 to publicly declare that he pronounced it as jif simply to give attention to his dying file format due to webm. He may have always called it that, but he brought attention to it then  <br>Try harder, I heard repeating some thing only makes it funnier every fucking time.</br>  <br>Nice reason. The creator of the format and the FUCKING PERSON WHO NAMED IT PRONOUNCES IT JIF, SO YOU MUST CALL IT JIF REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOU THINK MAKES SENSE TO FUCKING YOU</br>  <br>So all words that imply a certain pronunciation should be pronounced as such. I dont even want to list examples because it won't help your autism</br>  <br> kid  <br><br>Yeah kill yourself.</br></br></br>    <br> Also, the creator of Gifs said it's pronounced jif <br><br>He's also an engineer and not an English major, so he can fuck off.</br></br></br>  It's pronounced<br>G<br>I<br>F<br>Not gif not jif.

Sure it might be funny to see them fall assuming you're a bit of a cunt with an asshole sense of humour, like most human beings, but to actually go and do it for your own amusement is something else entirely</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>MORE SO if the kid is not just crippled but a few cards short of a full deck</br>  <br>Lets be serious, the cripple probably had it coming</br>  <br>you could say that</br>    <br><br>I'm gonna have to say I ironically agree with you, those sort of people are often assholes cause they're allowed to get away with it, but pushing a disabled down stairs is a sick way of getting back at them for it, like pathological targeting.

KARB KARB KARB KARB KARB KARB KARB KARB KARB KARB KARB KARB KARB KARB KARB KARB KARB KARB KARB KARB  This guy was in my homosexual equality group in school. He's actually really nice. Pls sign the petition. hehe  OP on a Friday night  Tipping your waiter is retarded. Prove me wrong. He already receives paycheck and he wants your extra money.  bad bait is bad  <br><br>or op is tard</br></br>  <br>Im not trying to bait</br>  /bread  <br><br>then you are tard <br><br>waiters make half on minimum wage because tips are factored in and even reported as income to government for taxes <br><br>people who don't tip are cheap and usually black</br></br></br></br></br></br>  All waiters are happy to take change, think of it like a homeless man on the street. But in disguise.  <br>You ever been in the service industry?<br>In America a restaurant legally only has to pay you the difference between minimum wage and your tip. And the federal minimum sucks.</br></br>  <br>Out of the last 4 times iv eaten at resturants I only tipped at 2 of the places. Guess why.<br><br>Tipping is not mandatory its expected yeah, but then so is my fucking steak being hot or even warm when i get it.</br></br></br>  <br>blaming the waiter/waitress for the chef's bad work is retarded, you're retarded</br>  <br>so your saying if everyone stops tipping then restaurants will have to pay their waiting staff full minimum wage? great, lets all stop tipping.</br>  <br>Why should a waiter get tipped over chef in the first place.</br>  <br>The entire industry is built on the fact tipping exists, if it didn't the price of your food would rise in relation to the difference (since servers would still have to be paid at least minimum).<br><br>We could do it the other way if literally the entire country changed, but it won't. <br>So don't look for excuses to be cheap.</br></br></br></br>  <br>that is just stupid<br>another reason why usa is shit-tier country</br></br>  <br>Chefs are usually either salaried or make more hourly.</br>  <br>yes becuase the dumb bitchs that wait on us standing at the bar talking while the restaurant is atleast half full so i know they shit they could be doing makes me retarded, solid logic there man. If the steak is cooked all the way through but is not even warm anymore, it kind of means they didnt get it to me in time, and considering it was all i ordered i find it hard to believe the chef just let it sit there without telling the bitch to take it.<br><br> Try to keep making yourself feel smart in conversations tocconversations where you actually have a point.</br></br></br>  <br>Then you'll only get minimum wage type servers. Think about the people who would do this job for minimum wage (read: highschoolers). If you go to a 5 star restaurant do you want them to handle everything?<br><br>No. They get tipped more for their knowledge and service. (not percentage but total since the check total is higher).<br><br>Let me put it this way, how much would it take for you to agree the be a waiter at a restaurant?<br>$10/hr or whatever? I don't think so.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>how is it the customers fault your boss pays you shit?<br><br>Get a better job.</br></br></br>  <br>Not disagreeing.</br>  Tipping is retarded, because it forces the costumer to pay the waiter what the resturant owner should be paying the waiter in the first place.  <br>exactly</br>  <br>I wouldnt be a waiter ever, Id get a real job.</br>  <br>Yeah I was a cook in hs and college. Fuck waitresses that Jill off talking for 15 minutes, bring someone's shit out that's been under a lamp for 20 minutes and then have the gall to blame it on the cook to preserve their tips.. Feel ya /b/ro</br>  <br>This is kind of an assumption.<br>True it could be bad service, that definitely happens.<br>But if it's busy the cook could just be trying to get food out and it could be undercooked.<br><br>I have no idea what your experiences were like though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> anon mentions steak cooked all the way through <br> other anon assumes its undercooked <br><br>Reading comprehension. You need it cause you dont have it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kek</br>  <br>Just buy dust for Riki</br>  <br>That's my point though, you're paying someone to do a job that you expect to be done, without wanting to do it. That's pretty hypocritical.<br><br>Also some of these people can't get "real" jobs, or they aren't available. Others use it to supplement their living situation so they can pursue what they actually want to do. <br><br>Heading of the part you're going to argue (can't get "real" jobs). It's not just poor people you don't care about, even though that's a huge social/political issue that greatly affects the majority anyway. But some people are still students in college, or looking for a job still, or what have you.</br></br></br></br></br>  Tipping is customary. Like saying "hello" to people when you meet them. <br><br>We can argue that saying hello is stupid. But if you didn't you'd be perceived as a complete moron. Just tip. It's a time you get to show you appreciate someone's work. It's only a few dollars you poor faggot</br></br>  <br>Hes not getting tipped for the chefs work dipshit, hes getrinf tipped for the service he provided you</br>  <br>All he did is walked with a food few meters, thats it. I could pick up my own food from the chef.</br>  <br>So let me get this straight, these people cant get better jobs for x reason. This is why I should open a charity and throw my hard earned money (which I got for my real job) which I acquired by having the x reason servers dont posses. <br><br>Im not tipping you jack. <br><br>Life lesson; you wont get anything in life just from expecting you deserve it, work for it and maybe Ill think about it.<br><br><br>Dont lie to me that factory jobs dont exist. Be a road worker idc. If thats too hard for you, then tough luck. Go full welfare.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's my bad, I skimmed that's on me.<br><br>Unrelated:<br> &gt;Cooked all the way through <br>Who the hell orders well done steak? That makes me judge you a bit as a person.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't you have something better to worry about than tipping? Are you really that selfish?</br>  <br>I wasnt aware you were the only one in the restaurants you attend. I agree that restaurants should pay them their full wage, i dont see the logic in not doing so, but you have shit arguments</br>  <br>Tipping is customary you retard. <br>Not tipping is really poor form. You know it in advance that you are expected to tip. Yet you pretend like you aren't??? Don't eat at restaurants if you don't want to tip</br></br>  <br>Why the hell do you care, youre a server, you shouldnt think, you should bring the food.<br><br>Stop pretending youre some bigshot.</br></br></br>  <br>so much this</br>  <br>This</br>  I live in the UK and so don't tip ever but I did when I visited America because its expected, but what I don't get is why do I tip a percentage of the meal cost? Just because I ordered more expensive food it doesn't mean the waiter had to work any harder.  <br>/thread<br><br>You are a fucking dumb piece of shit, I've met cats and dogs that are smarter than you.</br></br></br>  <br>Ill eat wherever I want, there is no law that I have to tip you.<br><br>Thus I wont. I mean why, put yourself in my shoes, why the fuck would I throw away my money?<br><br>would you throw away your tips? No, so I wont throw away my salary.<br><br>Case closed.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Your not being a charity.<br>Your exchanging money for goods and services, pretty much Capitalism 101.<br><br>If you think only desk jobs are real jobs you have a seriously closed off view of the world.<br><br>So you sit at a desk all day and say "Wow I'm working so hard!" and make 70k. And now the person running back and forth all day making 40k is suddenly not working as hard?<br><br>Don't be such a cheap fuck anon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Poorfag. Case closed</br>  <br>Didn't say I'm a server friend.<br><br>I'm just saying that it's weird you'll pay $30 to ruin a good piece of meat.</br></br></br>  <br>You are very selfish<br>You sound like a child</br></br>  <br>You are not thrwoing it away anus. You are giving it to someone who needs it. Granted some waiters are shitty, but most of them really need the money and are very good ones</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=q_v<wbr>ivC7c_1k</wbr>  [ ]  <br> Tipping is customary <br>Maybe in your shit tier country <br>In my country you get actually paid appropriately by your boss if you are a waiter.</br></br></br>  <br><br>This is why I hate Americans, no sense of self responsibility.<br><br>"I know my country has a custom so ingrained there's a space for it on my w2, but since no one's making me do it I won't!"<br><br>Don't be such a cheap shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Then what are you doing in this thread?</br>  <br>Great argument. Treating waiters like shit but then say your country is great because someone other than you gives them money. You're a hypocrite.</br>  <br> you're* <br> Uneducated server detected <br> says desk jobs aarent real jobs <br> works as a server  <br> keksimus maximus <br><br>I think you should move away because you dont understand that my work is more valuable than yours, thus i get paid more<br><br><br>No one got rich by opening a charity brah</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So much ego in this post<br>Are you still in kindergarten?</br></br>  <br>A custom started because business owners didn't want to pay a livable wage in the early 1900s. And considering all congress and elected officials went with the federal reserve... it's our custom. Rather than demand your freedom and rights, eh, just do what you gotta do. Beg business for your livelihood</br>  <br>Why do you care, its my money.<br><br>I can have the chef mix it up, gurgle it and make it into a milkshake if I can pay for it.<br><br>Stop being a know it all.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Before I even get into this with you OP.<br>You gotta tell me your age, job, and vicinity in the US, (Or wherever.)</br></br>  <br><br>Woman detected</br></br>  <br>You mean like all those rich people who dont buy into pity?<br><br>Exactly.</br></br></br>  i never tip , indeed its retarded , why do i have to tips somebody that has an easy job? Does anybody tip the hardworking men in factories , or builders?  <br>You giving them two dollars is too much for you but a restaurant owner who averages only 30k a year in profit should give them a huge salary. You're beyond hypocritical you're insane</br>  <br><br>I'm not poor and stupid, so tipping isn't a problem for me.</br></br>  <br> someone who needs it <br><br>I dont care about you, youre not my relative, youre just some guy.<br><br>From my point of view youll spend those 10 bucks on schwag.<br><br> need it </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>They aren't serving you.</br></br>  <br>Its just like women asking for more money for doing same/less work as men</br>  <br> leftist waiter faggot detected  <br>Maybe you should also tip the cashier in the supermarket, I think he runs a little low on cash. Seriously you should become an hero.</br></br>  <br>Autism detected</br>  <br>Being socially retarded is real. Seek help</br>  <br>No one got rich by giving their money to others.<br><br>You live in a capitalist country.</br></br></br>  Non American here, and when I go to America I do tip, but if you're a waiter and a customer didn't tip you, should you be angry at the customer, or at your boss who refuses to pay you enough money to live on to begin with, forcing you to rely on the charity of strangers?<br><br>In my opinion it shouldn't be the customer's responsibility to ensure waiters are paid a fair wage. As a customer it should simply be a matter of paying the menu price for food and expecting other matters like employee wages to be taken care of by the business. Why should I be directly responsible for paying an employee's wage and made to feel bad if I don't? I'm just there for the food! It makes no sense to me.</br></br>  <br>So servers are going to earn at least minimum wage. Can't make it off of that, then get a real job. Swing a fucking hammer, carry some heavy shit once in a while, get dirty. get a sunburn and bring home a good paycheck. 5 hour shifts at 4 to 6 shifts a week in the shade and the controlled climate gets you minimum wage because it's easy and comfortable. Want more? Do more.</br>  <br>I actually passed kindergarden, unlike yourself.<br><br>You keep crying when not getting your way instead of working for it.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Internettoughguy.mp4 <br><br>Calm down, you're starting to sound like an idiot.</br></br></br></br>  <br> You're a hypocrite. <br>How?<br>Do you even know what it means, because it seems you don't. I never said anything about treating waiters as shit. Just that you live in a shit country.</br></br></br>  <br> Why this? Why that? Why me? Why? Why? <br>You sound like a fucking toddler<br>Just do it. Is it so fucking hard</br></br></br>  <br> aren't* <br> uneducated asshole detected <br> doesn't tips thinks their edgy <br> keksimus maximus <br><br>I think you're at best a middle manager trying to feel better about making money than servers. <br><br><br>Rich people totally have charities.<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_<wbr>of_wealthiest_charitable_foundation<wbr>s<br>Also betcha got excited when you saw me use the wrong they're up there.</br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Better restaurants can pay their servers better wages.<br><br>A 5-star restaurant won't hire minimum wage workers if they want to keep their 5 stars. It's almost like the impetus is on the restaurant to adequately compensate their staff, isn't it?</br></br></br>  <br>Tell us more about your job and how amazing you are. We cant wait.</br>  <br><br>There's nothing wrong with the idea of tipping in the abstract.<br><br>The problem is when employers exploit the practice as a substitute for paying their employees.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Then why should I pay to keep your place on life support, let it crumble.</br>  <br>It's literally capitalism, you're exchanging money for goods and services...</br>  <br>Very eloquent rebuttal, I'm glad we can have robust debates here on 4chan like adults.</br>  <br>It's not charity, you fool. It's payment for services rendered. Bad service, little or no tip. Obviously.<br><br>And I'm sick of hearing foreigners whining about this. You fuckers demand "tips" (read: bribes) all the time to do your jobs at ALL. Guides, waiters, maitre de, chartered vehicles, basically anyone dealing with foreigners, all over Europe and the Middle East. Lazy, greedy fucks.</br></br></br>  <br> doesn't want to pay waiters more for an "easy" job by tipping them  <br> says American employers suck because they doesn't pay them more <br>Hypocritical. <br>Your money. You're a twat. Other people's money, you want everyone to have it.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>If a business can't afford to stay open without fucking over employees and customers, then it should die off and be replaced by someone with a better business model.</br></br>  <br>Yes on tipping $2. Let's get eloquent. It's such a pressing issue</br>  <br>No thats just you brah.<br>Listen to yourself.<br><br> someone paid for a meal that was prepared in a way that I dont like <br> I will get angry about this </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is exactly it.</br>  <br>If tipping is customary then your not showing appreciation of anything you dumb fuck. The whole point of tipping is that they've showed you the kind of service that makes them stand out from others so you give them a little extra for their extra.<br><br>If a tip is given to everyone then it becomes redundant</br></br></br>  <br> Being this mad <br> not posting one topic relevant sentence <br>Kek<br>If you really think it is a good habit that you have to tip, you should seek help.<br>Tip should just be included in the prices of the actual things you can order.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tipping is customary you fucking little shit<br>Customary<br>Custom<br>Ary<br>Customary. Look it up</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Moon runes mixed with English  <br>What the fuck kind of shit hole do you live in<br>Tipping is fuckin dumb and anyone who thinks otherwise is fuckin dumb<br>Great job you managed to get my food to me just in time before it's completely cold <br>Now if it's fuckin smoking hot so hot i can't even touch it or look at it then you get my tip<br>A tip of my fedora</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>woah, youre this upset that you had to correct a typo?<br><br> upset/10 <br><br>I make more than you working a respectable job that doesnt include begging, thus I am better than you because I have a better living standard than you.<br><br>Rich people have charities, but they made those after they got rich.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Waiters make 40K a year?</br>  <br>If the tip is payment for services rendered then why isn't it enforced by law? If I eat at a restaurant and don't pay for food it's considered stealing, even if I hated it. What's the difference?</br>  <br>Why should I? Youre not qualified for it.</br>  <br>ive always found the concept of tipping strange. you want extra money for doing your job? thankfully in sweden nobody tips and nobody expects tips.</br>  <br>NEET detected</br>  <br>Id say pretty much whole europe is like that, and should stay like that.</br>  <br>Sure, but as long its not mandatory I wont give you money for something I could do by myself.<br><br>You dont have to come up to my table, I can carry my plate to my table by myself.</br></br></br>  <br>Bullshit.<br><br>When you first get into being a server, you should be about 18 (at the youngest) and ideally no older than 20. It's a college job that is meant to sustain your lifestyle until you've finished an apprenticeship somewhere or finished college (hopefully with a degree in something more lucrative than Philosophy), or finished some trade school. <br>However, many waiters and waitresses get lazy because they're making so much money in tips and the next thing they know, they've squandered their educational opportunities, popped out a few fuck trophies, and now they're in their late 20s, bitching about how they should get tips because they depend on them, and minimum wage isn't enough to live off of.<br><br>Too...Fucking...Bad.<br><br>You threw away your opportunities and now you want me to fork over extra cash? How does that make you different than a panhandler?<br><br>And another thing, fuck this "I work 3 jobs" shit. Working a 5-hour shift 4 times a week at 3 different places may technically count as having 3 jobs, but it's not like it's 3 full-time jobs.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tipping has nothing to do with right of wrong or physics. Yet you turn it over in your head because you are too dense to realize it. It's customary. As in tipping your barber or wishing someone farewell. <br><br>You are such a social dufus that you think it's something to be argued over. "Why do you say farewell???""</br></br></br>  <br>Well, it's actually a good example of a symptom of a systemic problem in America.<br> e.g. <br> Labor compensation and the responsibility of the individual or the whole. <br> Just compensation for services rendered (going both ways, do CEOs deserve that much?) <br> The fact that people working at minimum wage are only a half step above indentured servants <br> If they have a responsibility to go on welfare (using your tax dollars), why didn't you tip instead <br> "It's only two dollars" The responsibility of the individual the play their part as part of a whole (Same type of person doesn't vote) <br><br>It's actually a pretty good place to start a debate and try for eloquence.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're so macho. Over a $2 tip. Shows how retarded you are.</br>  <br>This.<br>I used to work at a Dominos near my place. I was on register 90% of the time and almost every single time a customer was upset was because the dipshit cutting the pizza wouldnt tell me that such and such an order is ready. So id have to run back and go through every order to see what is ready.</br></br>  <br>Never said anything about america.<br>Never said I don't want waiters to get paid appropriately. Tipping system is just retarded, just like you.</br></br>  <br>also no image in the whole thread? here's one</br>  <br>Actually it isn't. Tipping started long before you were born. It's a custom not a political statement.</br>  <br>But you don't do it by yourself. You also don't cook the food or grow it. Specialized jobs man, it's part of a civilization.</br>  <br>If thats true why do you always feel like you deserve a tip?<br><br>Even the shittiest of waiters expect a tip.<br><br>then I can just dislike you in general and wont tip you because I dont like your face.</br></br></br></br></br>  I don't get tips, why should wait staff? <br><br>Maybe if you did more than the bare minimum of your job description I would toss you a few bucks, but until then you can blow me.</br></br>  <br>then why do you get upset when you dont get a tip?</br>  Bait I know, but since I earn my living off tips I'll tell OP to fuck himself. Fortunately I'm a bartender and not a waiter, so I have a lot more recourse to deal with non tippers.  <br>Why do you have a hard time in social situations?</br>  I'm a programmer and I want you to tip me for doing my job. How can we do this guys?  <br>In europe it isn't customary, if you can't possibly realise this, there is no point in arguing with you, narrow minded fuck.</br>  <br> You also don't cook the food or grow it. <br>neither does the waiter...<br><br>never hear cooks complaining about getting tips, it's always the shitty liberal arts majors with shitty attitudes who just bring you a plate and pour a drink or two</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're really retarded.</br>  <br>If you earn minimum wage from your employer then I'll start tipping you. But since you're a techy that's probably making high five or low six figures, you can go fuck yourself.</br>  <br> being this upset <br><br>I'm a programmer/website designer on demand.<br>Ok, now that you know, how will this aid your discussion on tips?</br></br></br></br>  Tipping culture in America is dumb. Here we tip if it's exceptional service, not because we're obliged to.  <br>You must be like 17 or a troll noones this fucking stupid</br>   ITT mad poor waiters   <br>Thats because the pay is totally different are you this stupid???</br>   ITT autists wondering why people get angry over no tip   <br>That's fine. You don't have to tip where you live, just in America. It's ok to think something in a culture is stupid but still observe the customs when you're in that country.</br>  <br>Honestly I'm with you op. Waiters do make 2.13 an hour but they choose to work that shitty job. <br> inb4 that's the only job they can get <br>Bullshit, I served once and hated it so I had them move me to the kitchen.</br></br></br>  <br>It won't. I'm just throwing around words I've seen on the Internet a few times because it infuriates people.</br>  <br>I work in retail and make minimum wage, can I get tips, too?</br>  UK anon here<br><br>Let's just establish the minimum wage in America is $7.25. Until recently the minimum wage here was £6.50, and I think that's going up to £6.70 or something, maybe £7.20, and that's only for people over 25. <br><br>We aren't expected to tip. Why? Because a tip is something you earn by going above and beyond your job. If you are pleasant, stand out, have a nice personality and give good service then you deserve a reward. You don't get the Victoria Cross for doing a tour.<br><br>Not only that, but if you have a job, do your fucking job. If you need motivation to do it then you really shouldn't have been hired in the first place. The point of tipping is nullified if you HAVE to do it, and not only that, if someone EXPECTED a tip off me they'd be a cheeky fucker and would deserve the complete opposite.<br><br>Sort your shit, America</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>WARNING FOR NEW PEOPLE ENTERING THIS THREAD:<br><br>Issue resolved, OP was explained why the tipping system exists and is the way it is.<br>OP is an extremely cheap, hypocritical fuck who was just looking for others the validate his being terrible.<br><br>Pic unrelated.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>so why dont you tip your chef by allowing you to have a job?<br><br>The chef tips the butcher, the butcher tips the farmer, the farmer tips the cow, the cow tips the grass, the grass tips the soil, etc etc<br><br>Because its a dumb system. And if I can choose not to be a part of it, then I wont.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kek nice argument.<br>Keep working as a waiter, it suits you. Its not like you are capable of doing a more difficult job.</br></br>  <br>Not tipping based on bad service is one thing. Not tipping based on principle is retarted.</br>  Tfw I'm an Australian waiter earning $24.56/h  <br>I dont, oen of the reasons is that I feel no shame in telling you I wont tip you after the check is delivered to me.<br><br>Opposing to the cucks who would feel awkward if they didnt give you an allowance.</br></br></br>  The general intelligence level of the typical self-entitled wait staff that posts here that demands tips for doing the bare minimum of their job just confirms that they're where they belong in the work force.<br><br>Just the basic concept of what you're demanding boggles my mind. You want an industries customers to directly pay the employees instead of the industries employers. I can't even begin to formulate an argument because you can't grasp the base concept. It's like trying to explain to someone what clouds are and how they work yet they just keep screaming that clouds are made of dreams.</br></br>  <br>Since you're in the UK our minimum wage is not anything you can effect. But given that apartments in major cities are upwards of four thousand dollars a month, there is no way to survive on minimum wage and still do that job. I've served a million fucking cheap Brits like you over the years. I just add the tip in because I know you don't tip. I still get my money. And if you're not tipping you're getting served last. Nothing you can do about it.</br>  <br>$2 tips getting you angry??? Getting you down??? Is life unfair?? Tipping is so unjust isn't it, anon.</br>  <br> Implying Philosophy isn't in the second most sought after degree by employers (after Maths) </br>  <br>If nobody would tip, waiters will eventually quit there jobs or get paid more. It's not rocket science. Then you can say goodbye to your semi obligated retarded tipping culture.</br>  <br>You're so autistic it's unbelievable. Good for you for being an asshole. Bravo. So brave.</br>  <br>Do you expect to get tipped for that too?</br>  <br><br>his arguement is its not his responsibility to pay for the services provided by an employee of an establishment<br><br>your argue is literally nothing more than <br><br>  yes it is  <br><br>don't shit talk his argument when yours is garbage tier.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Remeber, all waiters are hobos in disguise. Just give them there change</br>  <br>You've obviously never worked behind a bar. It's not as easy or unskilled as minimum wage work. Without tips the employer would have to pay us 40 dollars an hour. Guess how much your drinks would cost then.</br>  <br>Stay mad american friend<br>Stay mad, because your boss treats you like shit.</br></br>  <br>Not at all, it was explained why tipping shouldnt be allowed.<br><br>Youre just super butthurt.</br></br></br>  <br>You are deeply insecure to insult people over a custom they didn't invent</br>  <br> Are you really that selfish <br> Coming from the guy who defends waiters expecting more money from a customer who already paid for his/her own meal just because taking a plate of food from one table to another is apparently such a momentous task that requires it <br><br>Should I tip the chef? Should I tip construction workers for fixing roads? Should I tip teachers/trainers? <br><br>Tipping is fucking stupid.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's fine. But if you don't tip in a bar you're not getting a second drink. So it's up to you.</br>  <br>I can promise you waiters at actual 5 star restaurants don't make fucking 2.15 an hour plus tips<br><br>we're not talking about professional wait staff at high end places demanding tips, we're talking about some stupid bitchy cunt at dennys demanding a tip for bringing you a plate and pouring you a drink</br></br></br>  <br>Youre so mad you had to call me autistic.<br><br>At the end of the day you wont get a tip no matter how hard you cry.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't always feel like a deserve a tip. I'm not American.<br><br>That's my point.<br><br>That's true, but I would try and make up for it with my charming personality</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What person opens a restaurant to 30k a year? <br><br>And yes, Fuck them for asking me to pay their wage when all I wanna do is pay for food. It's retarded. Our currency is fiat and yet we bitch about the failed system. We must all be retarded. <br><br>Not tipping your gay children</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Opening doors for other people is stupid too. They can open their own fucking door. I don't owe them shit</br>  <br>The average restaurant makes about $30,000 a year. Learning is fun.</br>  Sometimes I tip half the bill.<br>Sometimes I tip more than the bill.<br>The freedom of wealth.<br>Bitch</br></br></br>  <br>I dont care about hobos. Rule it out with your boss.<br><br>Id gladly pay overall more for drinks instead of being lied to when at the end of the mean Ill have to pay the same amount.</br></br></br>  <br>Good luck living a life based on anger hatred and selfishness. $2 tip is too much for you shows how poor you are mentally</br>  <br>Foreigners have an excuse for not tipping. It's their culture.<br><br>Not tipping is basically a "fuck the poor" mentality, that truthfully people only get when they're not poor and don't have any danger of becoming poor.<br><br>The only others that don't tip are niggers and young fags that have never had to work a shitty job. Once a person works a hard and shitty job, they know the struggle and, at the very least, tip well.<br><br>You can argue all you want that it's a broken system and that employers should pay a living wage (which I agree with). But they don't.<br><br>Have you ever seen food prices at sit down restaurants in the rest of the world? They're 2 to 3 times higher for the most part... and you get less food. The cost of the food at the restaurant is cheap because servers are paid almost nothing on the hour. Even with the tip, you're paying considerably less than Europe.<br><br>And don't think, "I'm so fucking great I'll never have a shit job like server, fast food, retail, etc"... chances are, unless you have parents supporting you all your life, you'll work a shit job during college. And these days the struggle is so common chances are, you'll work a shit job even after you get your degree because the job market is shit. Then you'll know about the struggle and pay servers appropriately.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>then its fine, Id tip a guy if he was cool, but the majority of waiters are piss factor lil brats.<br><br>Id tip your good will because my fav actor was a waiter once and youd remind me of him.<br><br>But do your job right.<br><br>Ill tip you if I like you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well that's fine but that's not how it works in America. So you're either going to tip or you're not getting a second drink. Bartenders have the booze, not you. If you don't want to tip you can always drink at home or in the park. In a bar you have to tip.</br>  <br>Then don't live in a major city you moron. Besides, I'd check the bill, you're knocking off that tip whether you like it or not. That's for being a cunt. I'm not cheap, I tip more often than I don't, but that's because I get good service. You being a twat and giving shitty service is the opposite way to being going about getting what you want you dumb fuck</br>  <br><br>but muh disabilities!<br><br>equal rights!<br><br>won't pick up a brick, but might slather some of the mortar on my chest to look sexy, I should get the same amount of money as any other brickie</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why are you speaking about yourself, Im perfectly calm because Im the one with money, youre upset cause you wont see this money.<br><br>If 2 bucks isnt much why do you throw a tantrum when you dont get them?</br></br></br>  <br>You tip after an individual drink? Bitch, tip at the end of your night</br>  <br> Not tipping is basically a "fuck the poor" mentality <br>Actually no. You see, most cultures that don't tip also pay waiters reasonable living wages.<br><br>Tipping culture is "fuck the poor" mentality, because faggots like you are brainwashed into believing that it's perfectly OK to not pay employees proper wages because they're supposed to expect the customers to foot the payroll bill.</br></br></br></br>  <br>depends on the bar<br><br>a fancy high end bar where the bartenders are required to have degrees pays the bartenders well to begin with so they don't really care if they get huge tips, and I can't afford to go to those places anyway and pay 9 dollars for a drink I can make myself at home for a fraction of that<br><br>the bars where they pay them like shit don't require degrees, so they literally just poor shit in cups and give it to you, I'm not tipping those fucking people, they're standing there handing people drinks and opening beer bottles, labor doesn't get much more unskilled than that</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Then its not my problem, you rule it out with your boss.</br>  <br>Studies have shown that the difference between good and bad service in the amount of tips is next to nothing, so "work for that money" is bullshit argument.<br><br>The whole concept of tips in general was introduced to help the people running the establishments, not the service people themselves. Whole fucking slew of the world manages just fine without it, but they also do without the Imperial system, so, you know...<br><br> inb4 some bullshit </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>but what if they made the same as everyone else?<br>because tipping stopped?<br>that's the idea you slack-jawed mongrol. Amerikkka is the only place on the planet where tipping is a thing</br></br></br>  <br>You're broke mentally. How much money you have is irrelevant. You defending your ego is irrelevant. All you ever worry about is how you look. How about thinking about how someone else feels. You're in a world of suffering.</br>  <br>Hard physical labor <br> swing a fucking hammer, carry some heavy shit, get dirty, and get a good paycheck <br>is the male equivalent of stripping. Sure, you can make good money at it FOR A WHILE, but not for long. Some guys can't work a fully physical job based 30, some 40 is there limit, you sure as shit won't be doing it a 50....<br><br>by then you'll have to find something else, and chances are you don't have any training/schooling to do anything outside of hard physical labor. If you get lucky, you'll be in some type of foreman position by then.... if not you'll be in retail or some other shit job paying you a quarter of what you once earned.<br><br>It's the exact same story as a stripper not realizing they can't do it all their life.... It's a job good for a couple of decades, at best. Then enjoy your ruined back and rotator cuff injuries....</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're a jackass dude. The reason restaurants are able to keep their food so cheap is because over half of their total staff doesn't receive a full paycheck. Have fun with your $30 minimum for a steak because the restaurant has to pay all the waitresses minimum wage. Tipping is a system that works for both parties. Waitresses prefer tips because they generally make more, which makes waiting an attractive job despite the shitty work. Most people who aren't completely Jewish or selfish don't mind tipping because it's engraved in our culture. We factor in the tip before we even sit down to eat.</br>  <br>That's bollocks, I can sympathise because I'm poor but I'm not tipping EVERYONE because not everyone deserves a tip. There's a reason for a tip, and doing your job PROPERLY is not one. Doing a job is properly AND THEN SOME is tip worthy</br>  <br>You don't seem to understand that in order to have people doing those jobs in those cities, they have to live in those cities. So unless there is a housing subsidy for low income workers, the workers have to make more money or there will be no one to fill those jobs in those places. No one is going to commute 40 miles for a minimum wage serving job without tips. Well maybe an illegal alien but then that's the level of service you're going to get. And if you've ever had a drink in a bar in a major city, the bartenders are not illegal aliens. They're usually fairly smart, conversational, educated people who can entertain and have extensive product knowledge. A good bartender is a concierge, a therapist, a dj, a referee, and on and on. It's a job with a lot of responsibilities that not just anyone can do...I work in a cash bar. There is no bill. You pay what I tell you to pay or you fuck right off.</br>  <br>if I went to a bar and the bartender refused service because someone didn't tip then I promise you that bartender wouldn't be employed at the end of the night<br><br>any bar owner that will allow his employees to lower his level of business because they're not getting tips won't have a bar for very long</br></br></br>    <br>I don't have to prove shit and I'm going to tip my waiter anyway and there's nothing you can do about it.</br>  <br>Macho macho man. Going to get someone fired. You are such a bad ass. A REAL man. <br><br>You sound like carton but you actually think you're doing right</br></br></br>  <br> broke mentally <br><br>Whatever that means<br><br> how much mon ey you have is irrelevant <br><br>No its not, having more money is always better. Same reasoning why youd enjoy a good tip rather than a bad tip.<br><br> you defending your ego <br> <br>So just because I dont care about every poor fuck I suddenly have an ego, well lets see if Id end up giving money to everyone, Id be as broke as you. <br><br> all you ever worry about is how you look <br>Exactly, there are too many poor people to worry about them all, Ill center my life upon myself.<br><br> someone else feels <br>I think Id feel worse for those poor fucks getting their asses bombed in Afghanistan.<br><br>So next time is it ok if I tell you that instead of tipping you Ill donate it to the poor?<br><br>Would that make you happy as youre so considerate?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I just add the tip in because I know you don't tip. I still get my money. <br><br>so you're admitting to committing felonies? the first time someone pays attention, you're losing your job and going to jail for identity theft, have fun</br></br></br>   ITT amerifats arguing over tipping system. <br>Life sure is good in based Britain</br>  <br>Only your problem if you want to drink in an American bar.</br>  <br>You talk so much about yourself. Do you see a trend?</br>  <br>yes we do. in chicago it is 5.45 an hour as of july 1st. When i was in SC it was 2.13/hr.<br><br>Server/somm at god-tier restaurant in chicago, ask me anything if you want.</br></br></br>  <br>In my country tipping does not exist, you pay a 13% tax (attached to the actual food price) for services.</br>  <br>That may be the case, but YOU don't understand you have to live somewhere you can afford. It's a harsh fact of life.<br>If what you say is true about bartenders showing those personalities, they DESERVE a tip because they are going above and beyond their job. If I got that service I would tip because they deserve it. But you? I would take the latter option, because you're obviously a twat. I tip at the end of the night when I've had my fill and if the guy or girl has been good enough I usually give anywhere up to a fiver, and usually at least two quid. Not a lot because any more would be silly, but any less would be an insult to your service. But if you're gonna charge me a tip on my FIRST DRINK because I'm English I will fuck right off and you just lost business because you have a chip on your shoulder</br></br>  <br>good argument, fuckwit</br>  <br>Answer my question<br><br> So next time is it ok if I tell you that instead of tipping you Ill donate it to the poor? <br><br> Would that make you happy as youre so considerate? </br></br></br></br></br>  Tipping isn't retard. Paychecks based on the fact that tipping is expected is retarded.  <br>Haha I used to do this shit all the time. Or I'd eat your food in the back or on my way to delivery. Stay mad I took your money and you ate my sloppy seconds with most of the time my spit on it.</br>  <br>Kek, he just B You TFO</br>  <br>Not really, its yours, since you have to serve me and I dont have to tip you.</br>  <br>This</br>  <br>Hey. Don't disrespect me. I'll get you fired. Show you who is boss. That's not how to run an establishment. <br><br>*crys about it to management*</br></br></br>  <br>your boss lets you lower his sales for the night because you didn't get a tip from someone?<br><br>is he your dad or something? any real bartender would fire you on the spot if they caught you doing that</br></br></br>  <br>You must be retarded. Usually north Americans "factor the tip in" during their stay at a dining establishment. If you keep the water topped up and are present, you get a nice tip. I'm you're a server and spend your time behind the bar taking to your friends/co workers and throw my food around, you ain't getting shit.</br>  <br>You don't know what you're talking about. A bar owner doesn't want to pay their employees more, therefore they need customers to tip their bartenders to keep them happy. A good bartender who puts cash in the till night in night out who remains sober and responsible, working nights, holidays, weeks on end without breaks, is very hard to find. Compared to the 1% of customers who don't tip. A good bar owner is happy to lose those shitty customers. I've been operating that way in the bars where I work for 12 years and there's nothing you could do to get me fired. Anyway, I don't refuse service when people don't tip, I just tell them they're too drunk and I won't serve them anymore. That's my job and the law. Of course I never tell people it's because they're not tipping. When a bartender cuts you off, you're cut off. No bar owner is going to take your word over a reliable bartender.</br>  <br>what restaurant?</br>  <br>How about you stop talking about yourself and stop trying to make other people's lives miserable</br>  <br>If you act angry, I can "cut you off" because you appear to be drunk. Send your ass home and my manager can't do anything about it because his judgement is as good as mine when determining someone has had enough.</br>  <br> Restaurants raise price of food <br> Pay waiters decent wages <br> At the end you're paying the same amount since waiters expect a tip anyway <br> No more shitty tip culture <br> One more of Americas shitty problems are solved <br><br>Is it that hard?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But you already do that</br>  <br>so if I get a beer and don't tip you're going to tell me I'm too drunk for a second beer?</br>  <br>How do I know if you drank before you came in?</br>  <br> implying people get mad at you <br><br>Ill happly stroll to the manager and portray him the problem.<br><br>I can always take my business somewhere else. I doubt your boss wants to lose money. Neither do you, because hell pay you even less.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>what if I don't act angry and just ask to talk to a manager? one bad yelp review can shut a bar down overnight, especially in a major city where the competition is so high</br>  <br>I serve English people all the time, some tip and some don't. We don't take credit cards, you don't tip at the end of the night, you tip as you go. If you're not tipping you're going to get served last. It's fine to observe your own customs in your country, but in American bars you'll have a better time if you follow our customs. If you don't you're just not going to have as good of a time. American bartenders are not like bartenders in other countries. We have all the power in the situation because we're dispensing a controlled substance. We generally get backed up by the employer because we're dealing with drunks. You don't have to like it but that's how it is. As for a five dollar tip after a night of drinking, that's an insult in America.I regularly have people tip me 20 to 50 dollars. Especially other service workers.</br>  <br>Haha cyber muscle man. "I'm gonna leave a bad yelp review". What a faggot. <br><br>Get over yourself you breathe smells like shit and nobody at work likes you</br></br></br>  <br>It's funny that you think I have to serve you. A bartender doesn't have to serve anyone they don't want to. I decline to serve people everyday if I think they're too drunk or acting in a way I don't like.</br>  <br>you act like you work at some high end exclusive bar where the clientele are so high profile you can pick and choose who you serve<br><br>I guarantee where you work is just like every other bar where refusing service to paying customers will bite you in the ass in the end, good luck with that</br></br></br>  <br> Armchair bar owner and guru </br>  <br>i dont know if you realize this. But with your attitude youre actually losing customers. Thus its your own fault you dont get paid enough.<br><br>If you dont come to my table in a reasnoble amount of time, Ill simply go somewhere else, your boss will lose profit and hell pay you less for it.</br></br></br>  Why is tipping a thing?<br>I'm not American, so i don't really get it.<br>You already paid for the food right?<br>If it's a problem with how much they earn from the job alone, then shouldn't that be their problem for choosing a job where they don't earn what they want?</br></br></br>  <br>Ex-waiter here (I worked <br>The highest I ever received was $100 when some rich Russian fucks came here (and they rarely ever tip which is funny). <br>But in my 1 year "carrier" I never expected to be tipped (mainly because I was paid fairly), but the point is mandatory tipping is fucking retarded; work elsewhere or fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br>you're a really bad troll, bro, sorry<br><br>go watch that yelp documentary on netflix<br>thousands of small businesses across the US live and die by yelp reviews, it's a lot more major than you want to admit</br></br></br></br>  <br>tipping originating during prohibition so restaurants could pay their employees shit wages and still make bank.<br>Numerous studies confirm that most ppl are going to tip what they are going to tip regardless of the quality of service. Any waitor/waitress /b/s here, remember that. Google it if you doubt me.</br></br>  <br>Suit yourself, Ill go somewhere else and youll lose a customer and get a bad review. Im sure your boss will be thrilled.<br><br>Ill just stroll in with an alcometer next time and youll have to serve me if you like it or not.<br><br>I enjoy know it all assholes.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because most people tip, most people get served, over and over again. I don't have a manager. I am the manager. The bar owner knows that I put the bar's financial interest first by stuffing cash in the till night after night, year after year. But 1% of our customers are not served anymore for all kinds of reasons. Not tipping is just one of them. Being too drunk or obnoxious is another. We want to take people's money. But my boss certainly understands that if I have problem customers then it's my discretion to get rid of them so I can better take care of the good customers. Every bar owner knows this. They don't let their staff get abused or they won't have good people for very long. I should mention, this is a real bar, not a corporate bar where what you say is probably true.</br>  <br>hows sophomore year of high school? getting picked on still?</br>  <br>That's funny you're telling me this because I own restaurants. Tell me when you open yours, expert.</br>  <br>You'll be paying that difference with higher food and drink prices.</br>  <br>you really expect me to believe only 1% of people that go into your bar don't tip? where the fuck do you work? that bar in hollywood where all the celebs go?</br>  <br>How do I know you weren't too drunk when you came in and fooled me the first time? Or that you took some drugs in the bathroom? There are all kinds of ways to get rid of someone. Usually I won't stop serving a non tipper. I just serve them last. If they have to ask why I'll tell them. Then it's up to them. They can tip or they can keep getting served after I've served the strippers and bouncers and bartenders that are tipping me crazy good all night.</br>  <br>if yelp doesn't effect you then you own a bunch of franchises, in which case your argument is invalid anyway</br>  <br>whats the difference if you have to pay extra at the end of the meal anyway.</br>  <br>Some americans can't follow this</br>  <br>A bad YELP review is a badge of honor for a good bartender. Because YELPERS are generally the worst most entitled millennial scumbags. No one wants those fucking extortionists in their bar trying to get people fired. You have to be a real low motherfucker to try to take away someone's livelihood who is busting their ass for a living. Fuck YELP. Our bar has an average of 4 stars out of probably a thousands reviews anyway. We know what the fuck we're doing. A couple of one star reviews is meaningless.</br>  <br>The argument is you're a faggot for writing yelp reviews like a pussy. You write that review because you want validation and to get back at someone for something. Like a pussy. Reddit and yelp go hand in hand</br>  <br> strippers <br><br>where the fuck do you work that they let the strippers drink on the job? I wouldn't be caught dead in a shithole like that<br>how many rapes do you have a night? how many stabbings?</br></br></br></br>  <br>It gives you an incentive to work hard, get the order correct and provide decent customer service without tips every restaurant would be just like fast-food chains where you're lucky to have your order come out correctly and it's a miracle if they don't have a decent attitude.</br>  <br>why are you this upset?</br>  <br>They make Minimum Wage, dumbass. If they do not get tips, their employer makes up the fucking difference.<br>Stop thinking like a fucking idiot.<br><br>Get a fucking better job, then.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Table? I'm a bartender not a server. I don't go to any tables. And my attitude is fucking tits because I love what I do. Most people tip and we all have a good time. The only people that are left out are the 1 to 5% people who don't tip. I don't need their fucking money.</br>  Sexy pics of Family a members...
