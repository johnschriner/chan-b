She left me a few months ago, said she stopped loving me. It's been almost a year and I can't get over it, I rejected a 9/10 because I still had hope we could get back together, I sent her a message a few weeks ago, and well, her response made me lose that tiny amount of hope I had.  Celeste<br>please smile again at me like you used to do</br>  <br>Prove to yourself that your better than her. <br>Go back to school.<br>Apply yourself to find a job, change appearance, haircut etc..<br>Go on Craigslist to find work if need be, go on welfare for now if need be.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I wonder if she's online.<br><br>Caitlyn. &lt;3</br></br></br>  <br>This used to be mfw pretty much every time I heard her name/surname. I've kinda gotten over it but in the last thread I found out she unblocked me and the feelgates opened. I don't know what to do now.<br><br><br>I assumed "Steve" was involved in your story. I'm typing out mine now, but it's on my phone since my PC is out, so it'll be shitty anyway.<br><br>Plot twist: we're all talking about the same Erika.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I fucked an Erin once.

It was more of a suicide tank. Still a dumb idea, but you know.<br><br>But seriously, Megan's a 10/10 who had just turned 18. And I was always there when she needed me once we got out of the hospital.<br><br>And then she dumps me with a single fucking text, and now still expects me to be there for her. I care too much to just up and leave though.<br>And I just really need somebody right now anyways. My mother is having a lot of health problems. She has no memory of her childhood and she can't reliably make new memories. And now she's going blind. She told me a few days ago that she was going to the hospital and hasn't spoken with me since. Her husband hasn't answered texts, either.<br>And remember that thing about the psych ward? Well I get the results of my psych exam tomorrow. My therapist says that she "definitely can't rule out schizophrenia"<br>Obviously I'm nervous.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  vallerie. you were the biggest slut i fucked. you told me to use olive oil as luve the first time we fucked. your pussy smelled like lobster every single time we fucked after that. dont blame me. you have a gorgeous face but your tits look like the hunchback of notre dame's. i think your first true love in this world was dick. you had good lung strength and could probably suck a golfball through my urethra. lets try it.  <br>Trade school. You're never getting anywhere else without a highschool diploma. Don't go military unless you want to be bored and pussy-less for years.</br>  Jess. I want to slash her tires  <br>I'm gonna try when September rolls around<br><br>did a three-week course on welding, it was mildly interesting. I feel like a weakling/scrub when I compare myself to other tradesman though<br><br>I'll try all of these things, thanks. the hardest part for me is finding the motivation</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you go, girl</br>  <br>i made out with a caitlyn she had weird lips. nice blonde hair.</br>  <br>You anons gotta see that they might want you back, if they didn't want you, they weren't the ones. <br>I'll offer some advice, two things to make yourself feel a lot bette are, fitness and appearance.<br>Fitness, join a gym, go jogging or buy some stuff for home. Cut sugar out of your diet. <br>12 weeks, 12 weeks of dedication and you'll see a difference. You'll feel it. <br>Appearance. First and most important, get a haircut, a style, it'll look a lot better. Then comes clothes, you don't need brand names, just some nice attire that goes together. <br>Then one day, you'll look in the mirror, and tell yourself, <br>"I came all this way, I look and feel better. I deserve better than her."<br>"I made it."</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, bro. But she's called Bump, lives in a swamp and wears muddy pajamas. Would you fuck that?</br>  <br> pull off at a rest top 40 mins out of town <br> plug my phone into some random ass , brush my teeth, shave, change clothes smoke cigs drink more red bull, tired as fuck <br> text her my situation, let her know ima be a bit late and am gonna have to improvise if my phone dies <br> sun is going down, i have shitty eyesight and im driving down i84, windy sketch ass highway <br> go 85 the rest of the way cuz dwindling phone life <br> get into town, phone dead again, no gps <br> get kinda lost, end up at random ass plaid pantry in a neighborhood ive never been in <br> people are cool as fuck there, let me plug in my phone, go out to have a smoke with them <br> across the street, fuckin gook mart named K&amp;T deli <br> those are our initials <br> fuck me. <br> she texts me after my phone turns back on, says shes gonna drive her friends car over there so i can follow her, theyre all drunk <br> wait there, cathartic moment <br> real life catfish reveal <br> she pulls up smiling like crazy, she gets out <br> greatesthugofalltime.webm <br> hold her hand, meet her friends <br> fuck shes so cute <br> leggings on 10, booty poppin <br> everything is so fucking natural like we never left, just like every other time, except shes here. <br><br>this girl is fucking perfect. she's so fucking smart and kind, generous, funny as fuck, just overall an eye opening person. we spent 2 nights together and didnt even fuck, pretty lame but i was on some mad emotional in love type shit. turns out she felt the same way.<br><br>i feel like, totally rewired as a person. i've never felt this kind of fire in my chest, never more motivated and driven and just overall happy. leaving her was hard as fuck cuz i figured it would all go back to the same shit, but we've been texting and snapping constantly and skyped every once in a while. <br><br>it's now to the point where it's doable and feasible for me to move to Denver to be with her. we're adults and the situation is right and we both feel the same. she's the other half of me and now it's gonna be for real.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is her hair naturally wavy...?<br>Is she young...?</br></br>  <br>I guess we'll never know how it ends</br>  <br>First kiss was with a caitlyn right after vomiting lel<br>But she also had weird lips, braces, and blonde hair</br></br>  <br>12 weeks is like 3 months bro<br>ehhh</br></br>  <br><br>well fuck me then</br></br>  Cant say her name as its so one of a kind that if someone who knew her saw it they would immediatly know who I am, destroying my anonymity. With that said, dont trust anyone anon. Man or woman doesnt matter, ANYONE can betray, leave, lie to, or whatever else people complain about. The people that end up with significant others are the ones that either ignore this or understand it and hold onto it as a potential justification for grabbing what they can when shit starts to burn. Everyhing without exception is temporary, so dont take shit so seriously or so hard. Quite being a whiney faggot and go seek whatever it is you want in life. The worst thing that happens is you dont get it, in which you csn always come back to /b/ and be OP. But if you succeed youll have what you wanted. If someone breaks your heart, realize your but 1 in infinity. Its not a big deal and treating it like it is is how weakness is bred in yourself. Pain comes amd goes, so dont be a little bitch when it hurts and youll find ypurself stronger. So when the next bitch comes youll be twice as strong, and in all probability, in absolute control. I speak from experience. Also fuck anyone annoyed by my spelling  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;62913973 <br>oh no... how young?</br>  <br>Colton?</br>  <br>damn. why cant i ever feel this way? this is fucking depressing</br>  <br>Did this for almost two years.<br>It changed nothing.<br>I felt better, sure. But I still wasn't happy. Because even after that, even after the women started approaching me at parties, even after I became the alpha of my gym, I still couldn't be happy. Because there are only a handful of people I've ever given a fuck about, and I drove them all away. Such is the way when you have a psychotic disorder.<br>Everyone is annoying, expendable. Until you meet somebody that isn't. But under all the acting that you're oh so good at, there isn't a person. At least not a well developed one. And when they see that, they run.<br>I'm charming, I'm attractive, I'm good for one night stands. But that's all I'm good for.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>YUP AND YUP. WHAT LANGUAGES DOES SHE SPEAK</br>  Kristin (German name, so pronounced chris-teen)<br><br>gg anonymity if someone whom I know reads this</br></br>  <br>4 weeks for yourself to notice <br>8 weeks for your friends to notice <br>12 weeks for the world to notice.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah man sorry</br>  <br>Just English...?<br>Lives on Cape?</br></br>  Sharon... <br>I'm sorry. I am only human and tried my best making you happy but I failed.</br>  <br>nope my slutty caitlyn speaks french</br>  <br>Oh thank god you scared the living shit out of me.</br>  <br>i feel lucky as fuck, anon. she fell outta nowhere and she's just me. i was a lethargic cockhead til i moved out here, stuck in a shitty relationship that i was too much of a puss to get out of. i decided to make a change, get on my grind and stop being a bitch, and it all fell into my lap. i'm so fucking hyped to get up at 5 am tomorrow and work toward getting to her.</br>  <br>Dubs don't lie...</br>  <br>The motivation should be that you can get better than your ex, that you don't deserve to be dumped.</br>  larissa  <br>michael?</br>  <br>larissa?</br>  <br>michael?</br>  <br>yea my comment wasnt meant like that. anyway, l wish you all of luck anon</br>  <br>lori?</br>  <br>no this is patrick</br>  <br>thanks, lori</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>heheheheheheehehehh</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who said that's all your good for? You won't find "the one" at a club, drunk. Try different places, go out during the day. <br>No one is good for only one thing.</br></br>  <br>machiavelli?</br>  Moira<br> Lived in Canada all life <br> Moved to England after High School <br> Neverseenagain </br></br></br>  <br> never fucked </br>  <br>Bill?</br>  <br>If you say so, anon. But in my experience, you will find more than one, 'the one''s. If that can make any sense to you.<br><br>Either way, you have a girlfriend? You should focus on her. And if you can't, you should dump her. Don't be dishonest like that, you aren't some kind of woman-man.</br></br></br>  <br>Jessica.<br><br>I think she's friend-zoning me, I don't even know if I want to be with her, I just want someone. Not for sex or just to have a girlfriend, but just to have somebody that I can talk to and relate to, someone I can share life with. Depression is getting worse and I have literally nobody to turn to, don't want to see a therapist because money and I don't want to use anti-depressants because I don't want to rely on drugs to feel happy. Just don't know what to do anymore.</br></br></br>  <br>Not even once<br> Feelsbadman.jpeg </br></br>  The perfect qts always have boyfriends when you are at my age (22)<br><br>so ends that</br></br>  <br>I dont do therapists because they do not give even a quarter of a fuck about you, just the money they make.</br>  <br>Erica? Samantha maybe? or was it Alex? Eh I don't fucking know anymore they don't even incite the faintest fucking interest anymore. Probably the porn is starting to kick in, I can't see them as anything other then walking flesh bags with nice faces.</br>  <br>Lily</br>  <br>smoke weed</br>  <br>"The One" is a flase idea. There is no "the One". There are many. There are manyt that you will connect and feel a deep connection with throughout life. you cannot commit yourself to one person and call them "The One" All people are untrustpowhrty and under the influence of alcohol will attarct themselves to the most reasonable reagewnt in the room. you cannot let this happen. good luck on your futurt endeavours.</br>  <br>I don't think you understand, man. Psychologically, I shouldn't be able to make those connections. The ones that I have made have been forced. Neither me, nor my therapist are even sure what illness I even have.<br><br><br>I have to disagree with that. My therapist is great. When I need it, she meets for free. She's even come to my house when I couldn't make it to the office.<br>No, there's nothing sexual.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Eh, well I dont know if you can say that about everyone.<br><br>I believe i truly did meet "the one" back when I was in high school and ever since she moved across the atlantic 4 and a half years ago, I still cant lose my feelings for her. <br>I still feel as if Im cheating on her by finding other girls attractive or thinking about them as a gf; I went through 4 years of college and never had one gf or even got laid, hell even never got a hug since she left may 31, 2011. <br><br>I truly feel that I will never marry because I cant marry her</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I agree with this guy. I've thought that I found "the one" three times now. I loved them all equally, and they all fucked me over equally. gg, heart. 3broken5me</br>  Júlia.<br><br>I'd do everything to ser her smile again.</br></br>    <br> Not for sex or just to have a girlfriend, but just to have somebody that I can talk to and relate to, someone I can share life with. <br><br>To me it sounds like you just need to hang out with your friends more and go to some social gatherings like clubs or concerts. Maybe go by yourself and make friends there.</br></br></br>  Becky, managed to get the balls to talk to her a couple times but she wasn't interested and she was in my homeroom  My mother. What the fuck did she do to deserve brain cancer?  Trinity.

I'm a loser and can get but can't maintain a girl's interest.  <br>you managed to get the balls to talk to one girl and you love her. clear her out of your head and grow the balls for other women. it takes time. women are nothing but humans. they are not intimidating unless you let yourself be intimidated by them. you can intimidate them too.</br>  <br>we dated for half a year and it was literally a perfect relationship.<br>We never argued, never had any misunderstandings or anything.<br>She was literally the girl I had dreamed of since I was young and when she came into my life, I knew something was up immediately. <br>She is the only girl to have ever even loved me either, and she the only girl I have ever loved.<br><br>We were eachothers first everything when it came to anything sexual as well. <br>fuck</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Ceri  Lindsey.<br>Cheated on shitty ex-wife with her friend<br>Left now ex-wife for her best friend (Lindsey)<br>Move in with her for a month until I got my own place<br>Fuck a lot<br>Work together so spend a lot of time smoking weed and playing videogames<br>Find apartment and still continue to hang out and whatnot<br>Talk about getting together but she wants to get over ex<br>Things continue<br>People question if we are together but divorce isn't finalized<br>Talk about dating and getting place together <br>Have to move out of state<br>Remain in contact daily talks otp <br>Tells me 3 weeks ago that her ex got mugged (they split because he wole.up one morning and decided he didn't love her and moved out.

I'm on your side, Anon.</br></br>  <br>For fuck sake anon, she's a keeper</br>  taytay  Valerie, havent spoken in over a year, nothing will ever happen between us  <br>Nah. She's perfect. But aromantic. Never been into someone before. Therefore, even if I were a fucking adonis, a genius, and socially perfect, I still couldn't be good enough. It kills me.</br>  <br> they are not intimidating unless you let yourself be intimidated by them. you can intimidate them too <br> you can intimidate them to <br> tfw that the first thing that happens when they lay eyes on me. <br>well its nice in its own way because I don't bothered as much. So thats a plus</br></br></br></br>  <br>ive dated a girl for three years and it was shit. time means nothing to the unreal man. define yourself as the person who wants to be wanted. swag. a lack of misunderstanding means a lack of excitement, a lack or arguments means a lack of caring. you do not need this bucked headed whore in your life any more than you need me, an anonymous strnger on the internet</br>  Micaela(Yeah I'm a spanishfag)<br>gonna tell my story with her because I'm really confused and I don't really know what should I do. Sorry for my bad english and greentexting.<br><br> be me <br> 17 (yeah, underaged faggot) <br> have known Mica for 5 years now <br> never cared about her until 1 year after I met her for the first time I saw her again <br> she changed and was my type of girl so I was attracted to her and I started to talk to her. A lot(I was always into tomboys) <br> fast forward 2 years <br> I'm her best friend <br> her friends tell me that she's into me <br> I just tell them they're just imagining things even though I do feel there's something going on but I don't pay attention because I think that I won't "feel" that if I didn't like her <br> we kinda started to slowly stop talking to each other <br> fast forward 6 months <br> we start to talk again and we stop talking again  <br> this thing happens over and over and I keep noticing her more distant and different <br> now june 2015 <br> she uploaded a photo where she had an open shirt and no bra to her instagram(so no nipples, basically, you couldn't see anything) <br> i freaked out and i realized that she changed. a lot. <br> i texted her "what the fuck" <br> she wanted to know why I even cared <br> I sayed that I really cared about her, and it was maybe some "parental" love or shite <br> I asked why she uploaded that photo <br> she didn't say shite until I asked her a bunch of times <br> she confessed to me that she didn¡'t knew why she uploaded that photo (at this point, she already deleted the photo) <br> she said she did it for attention <br> I know she did <br> she asks again why am I even asking this <br> I tell her my real feelings <br> basically tell her that I liked her when I started to hang out with her and shite but know I think is love <br> she is really emotional now (we're sending audio notes on whatsapp) <br> she says that it's really nice to have someone like me <br>1/2</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>checked</br>    <br>Nice roll motherfucker.<br>But that's really shitty. I feel kinda bad for asking, but what's the difference between asexual and aromantic?</br></br>  2/2<br> no real answer to my feelings <br> she never talked to me after that thing that was 2 weeks ago <br> I sent her 2 messages and she never answered <br> I know she's using her phone because she changed her profile pic <br> Next saturday is her bithday and she invited me to come over to someplace to hang out <br><br>shit, /b/ I don't know what to do or what she feels.<br>btw I have a lot of stories to tell about Mica if you guys are interested I can tell the story on how I cockblocked myself when she had an argument with her bf</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>holy shit, that thing broke me. i remember reading it 2 months ago. my poor heart can't take that</br>  <br>It's basically the same, she is also asexial, but one can be asexual and not a romantic and vice versa. Basically a romantic thinks relationships and anything that goes along with them are gross and asexuals think sex is gross</br>  <br>i like the way you talk huiman</br>  <br>Then I guess I have to read it then. I guess the tldr gif of a nigger dancing with fried chicken will have to wait a while longer.</br>  Cali  Daisy  Yasmin... Shit, how much I still love her... Even after 5 years...  <br>The fuck you on about? I was under the impression that asexuals simply lacked a sex drive entirely, meaning that they don't feel anything about it one way or the other. And I thought aromantic just meant that they couldn't love.<br>So asexual = no lust<br>aromantic = no love<br>right?</br></br></br></br>  <br>kek</br>  Haley<br>Sorry for party rocking :/</br>  Vivian. You're a fucking slut and I'm going to be more famous than you. I've always been a better artist and I made the mistake of helping you get into college. You're a piece of shit liar to everyone and if you get more famous than me I'm leaking all our sex tapes and leaving the country. Also you're a privileged fuck that hates on other privileged people. You're fucking blind to how fucking crazy you are. Everyone was right about you. You deserve to be 2nd choice to every man you ever meet. You deserve 2nd and 2nd only. I should have never left that other girl for you. Cause she was an actual good girl.  <br>oh im still friends with her and i enjoy talking to her now in her language rather than english and we have no hard feelings. <br>I have no reason to drop her out of my life; whether I talk to her or not I still think and dream of her. <br><br>Really, im a nutjob when it comes to emotions and a well adjusted mental state so i dont plan on ever finding anyone new anyways. <br><br>Ill just live off the memories i guess.<br>That and I am joining the air force in january and no girl will love me enough to move away with me and hardly see me for god knows how long once i go to basic and then am deployed/moved elsewhere.<br><br>Im gonna die alone for sure. I am coming to terms with it though</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Carmen<br><br>Why the fuck did you become an apeshit crazy psychosis patient from one day to the other? You scared me shitless, Just get better.</br></br></br>  Julie, the perfect girl who's flaws only make me love her even more it's been a year and a half since I last spoke to her and nearly a few months since I last saw her. She's the one I always avoid thinking about, the smallest thought of her kills me.  <br>Tell the story, i'd read it</br>  <br>keep crying bitch nigger</br>  Melinda.<br><br>I'm sorry I am no longer worthy of your attention, that our relationship has grown so cold, and that you will never feel the same way about me that I feel about you.<br><br>I'm not even sure if I feel that way anymore.</br></br></br></br>    basically I guess  Edith<br><br><br>she seemed to be extremely flirty and into me, but the past 2 days have went south, no flirty-ness, and a general disinterest in talking to me. Feel like shit because she might be disinterested in me now</br></br></br>  <br>HOLY fuck get OVER YOUR EX ALREADY`</br>  <br>I'm not crying. I did all that already. But she's the first one to cheat on me. I'm gonna make her regret it. So fuck off you faggot.</br>  FUCKING NORMIES<br><br>GET OUT GET OUT GET OUT</br></br>    Loved each other without a word, she left for another place, see her once and awhile around, only girl i lose confidence around, wat do?   high school me <br> bestfriend and I together for almost 5 years <br> at the last year he gets a GF <br> I support him but spend less time with me cuz of her <br> he gives up on our friendship <br> they get married <br> I guess it's ok, we never talk again <br> in college, no friends <br> make this one friend <br> we become the best friends around <br> always together  <br> he enlists into the AF <br> goes to base in UK <br> we talk about me moving with him when get can get an apartment  <br> he gets a Bf <br> doesn't talk to me that often, only every week to let me know he is ok <br> He gives up on our friendship <br> I feel lonely as fuck <br> everyone gives up on me <br> get a bf  <br> I try to be the best bf ever <br> he cheats on me <br> forgive him, and try to rebuild relationship <br> someone is flirting with me <br> I don't care, but he thinks I am cheating <br> breaks up with me, cus he thinks I am cheating  <br> He gives up on me <br> I make a friend at work <br> fantasize with being his friend and how nice could it be if we were closer <br> I can't even know if we are friends <br> I can't know anymore if someone is actually my friend cuz every one just gives up <br><br> The only thing I would never do to them, they do it without hesitating to me <br><br>I wish I could find someone that would support me, I am always the one that is backing up the other person and would do anything just to make them smile, but even tho I am always laughing... I feel empty all the time <br>and I am not a needy guy, I am the kind of guy that if you need help you can come to me and I'll help, and if I have an issue, I will try to solve it by myself, I don't like bothering others for personal problems, but...<br>I end up fixing everyone while I am still broken<br><br>TL;DR<br>everyone gives up on me, and I feel lonely as fuck, I just want to feel like I have a real friend out there...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>IF YOU WERE TALKING TO HER LESS THAN A WEEK DONT BEAT YOURSELF Up OVER IT BECAUSE NORMAL PEOPLE WOULD MOVE ON</br>  <br>Man, loving an aromantic must suck insane balls, man. I can understand being in love and just no having sex, but know that she's actually incapable of feeling anything for you... I can't fucking imagine.<br>The closest I've ever come to that was falling in love with a lesbian. That shit sucked when I found out about it. She loved me, but was basically disgusted by me because I have a penis and no tits.</br></br>  Edith.<br><br><br>We've seem to hit it off pretty well, extreme flirt and being all mushy. But the past 2 days went south, completely disinterested in talking to me now and she doesn't flirt. wat do?</br></br></br>  <br>well thats what you get for being a fucking cuck, maybe you should try harder and last longer next time.</br>  <br>Taryn. <br>Maybe one day she'll feel the same way.</br></br>  <br>And were great friends too. We have similar interests and she's cool as hell. Just doesn't feel anything for me. And I've been like head over heels for her since December. It's killing me.</br>  <br>no-one</br>  <br>Literally same with me and the lesbian. But I'm sure you're in a worse boat than I am. I am well and truly sorry for you, Anon. If I could help, I would. The best I can do is pray for a miracle, I suppose.</br>  Lib.<br><br>One of greatest and kindest persons I have ever met.</br></br>  <br>I was into a lesbian for the longest time a year before her too.

Well, she said she wanted something serious too, so why don't just start from scratch and be serious about your relationship?" <br> he was really happy but Mica just looked at me like she wanted to kill me <br> she said she had to go and they'll discuss it later <br> on the way to get on the bus stop that was like 10 blocks away she was really mad and said I should have said that <br> I said that she should have been more sincere of what she wanted <br> I said that I could talk to him if she wanted and say that I misunderstood everything <br> she said that it was ok <br><br>after that, we just had some casual conversations until we got to the bus stop and it arrived. that was the last time I really talked to her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Broke up with her about two months ago and felt like it was the right thing to do. We stayed friends and talk regularly.She got a new boyfriend and now every time we talk I get a pit in my stomach wanting to ask for her back but I know she wont go for it. Her New boyfriend is beta as fuck. Should I try and scare him off?  <br>Don't fuck with her shit, Anon. I know it hurts. But guess what? You're a man and you have to act like one. You can take the pain, she can't. She's fragile, precious. It's your job to protect her, and a lot of the time, that means stepping back and watching her be happy without you. You can't put her through all this shit because you're jealous.</br>  <br>Y'all probably got more feels to feel.<br><br>But yeah Micayla's her name. And like, from what I gather we're on good terms and got the whole 'love you' thing going on but I feel like she tries to avoid me and btw she lives on the other side of the continent.<br><br>I'm still in school and working and all so soonest I could see her is 3ish years and I'm not sure we'll last but I'm fucking hoping man. <br><br>Like I think her and I will last but I'm so fucking terrified that we won't and every single day is just another fucking shiver down my spine.<br><br>Sorry, anons, I'm a faggot; lmao.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>wow, I'm genuinly surprised no one has attacked you guys yet</br></br>  <br>yeah my ex kinda did something like that, less hard tho.<br>he asked me to come back after 2 months of breaking up<br> said he missed me <br> he wanted me on his life <br> he can't see the future without me <br> I say I will try, cuz I am used to be alone by now <br> I fucking try the hardest I've done anything in my life <br> make him feel the most loved I can <br> a week later he tells me it's better to be friends <br> he was talking to someone else, but the other guy had a boyfriend <br> they broke up <br> he wanted to take a chance with the guy <br> so broke up with me again... <br> the other guy was still too much into his ex <br> my ex got his ass kicked <br>well at least karma repay it a bit there</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   birthday today <br> no one gives a fuck <br> this post will probably be ignored or shitposted to oblivion </br></br>  <br>That is my exact situation. Guess that makes me a faggot too.</br>  <br>Has she said the 'love' word to you yet? Btw what's her name, just curious; I want to relish in faggotry with you.</br>  <br>I'm on the same boat as you my friend, hopefully time will mend the both of us</br>  <br>Happy birthday anon! I know your feels.. We'll pull through it I hope</br>  <br>Happy birthday anon</br>  <br>Of course man we've been together for 5 years. She still says it sometimes to me though. But I haven't heard from her tonight. So idk. Her name is Alexus. I'm the anon that posted a little above this.</br>  <br>happy birthday!</br>  <br><br>Happy Birthday, anon. I hope things get better.</br></br>  <br>happy birthday man</br>  <br><br>thanks guys</br></br>  Camille  <br>I have no name anymore. I'm finally over it. And life is going great.</br>  <br>Anon! Let me tell you, I don't know who you are, nor I know where you come from... But I love you bro, I hope you have the best birthday ever, and if you don't, don't worry, the next one will be better I promise, please smile cuz you look awesome when you smile</br>  <br>Didn't find it whatever. But wait so you've been like internet together for 5 years or like you were together and she moved away (or vice versa).</br>  <br>happy birthday, mate!</br>  <br>Oh my fuck I am so broken.<br> why did you make me do that?<br>This is the closest I've been to crying in five years.</br></br></br>  Rachel. <br>Fuck you for leaving me for a toothless manchild</br>  <br><br><br>thank you<br><br>i-i'll try</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck Rachel. Bitchy name anyways.</br>  Holly Ann<br><br>She used me for 3 years. I was a security blanket that she called her boyfriend.</br></br>  Brooke or olivia, she goes by both.  Bre <br>Highschool fuck buddy <br>Moved away. Had 3 miscarriages with some fuck head<br>comes back. Leaves again. <br>Finaly have my second chance. Fuuck. <br>Someone's getting the best the best the best of you.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Happy birthday anon!</br>  <br>Happy birthday, and godspeed you magnificent bastard. I don't know you, and if we run into each other we'll never know, but you're my brother, and for that I love you. It seems like whenever I go into feels threads, everybody goes from /b/ro to brother, and that's what keeps me coming back. Anon, I don't know you're psychological state, but you had better keep coming back. Life is worth the effort, no matter how much you think no one gives a fuck about you.</br>  <br>because i'm a faggot that cryed to that while he was showering... 2 days after I read it</br>  <br>In person. I met her in high school and I've been with her ever since. I was honestly going to propose to her right when I finished college at the end of the year. When I say 5 years, some of that time we were in fights or just didn't know what we were doing, but we always pulled through together. She moved from here (Texas) to move in with some friends in Massachusetts. I know I can expect the worst but I just don't like thinking about it. I haven't heard from her today and we've been talking everyday that she moved. So I'm sure this talking will eventually fade and I will most likely have to move on. Do I hold firm or just move on from the greatest person I've ever met?</br>  <br>look man, im sure in the moment the hints werent super obvious. however, its her fault for not being upfront about her interests and instead tiptoeing around her goal hoping it'll just magically happen. if she really wanted you, she wouldve dropped alpha man and skipped the whole play thing all together. dont tread on it bro, see how the birthday goes, and PLEASE be open and discuss this whole charade with her.</br>  i love you jemma  <br>thank you<br><br>thanks for the kind words</br></br></br>  <br>What makes it worse is that I had a Nicole once. I still dream about her. But I hurt her too bad to be forgiven. Even if she forgave me, like that Nicole did for Anon, I wouldn't go back to her. I don't deserve forgiveness.</br>  <br>OP here. Finally posting what I can of this. It's all typed out. I will ask for advice and post a bit more info at the very end. Thank you to anybody who cares to read it all.<br><br> entering new school sophomore year, I hate the place and most of the people in it <br> meet girl online when we were both Facebook page admins <br> randomly talk to her and find her on one of her omegle sessions <br> we hit it off and she gives me her number before she has to leave <br> we proceed to talk almost all day and night, every day <br> she tells me her problems with school, boys, family, etc. <br> she said I help her a lot and that we're very close <br> I tell her the same, we look forward to talking to each other every night to solve all our problems with each other <br> she eventually moves past her irl boy with my help <br> says she would never like me though <br> funny, cause we've pretty much already confessed to each other <br> I never do anything about it because 2 years difference makes her young, 14, it was long distance, and I had never really felt so close to anybody <br> weeks turn into months of us talking, helping, flirting, staying up all night and being late in the morning, etc. <br> It's only online but it feels simple and nice <br> we've introduced some of our other online and irl friends to each other <br> we all get along well too for the most part <br> she has this online friend from Sweden who apparently likes her too <br> kid wont leave her alone and he messages me with bullshit <br> around this time I'm going threw my own shit irl and become a bit distant <br> she talks to this guy and gets flirty with him to make me jealous <br><br>Cont?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuckin go to hang out. Maybe somethin will happen</br>  <br>You can always come to feels threads for kind words. I'm sure you'll get more from me eventually, though neither of us will know it. We're not always a hate machine.</br>  <br>Jade?</br>  <br>Shit, yeah no mine is way more faggy.<br><br>I've only known my lady through the internet. But I've known her for like 4 years and I always had feelings for her (if that makes any sense, it's the fucking internet) but yeah my friend introduced me to her and we got along because vidya games but then I stopped playing with her and I tried bringing up feelings but it never worked out. Until about 6 months ago where she finally said 'I love you' back and now we're on this autistic internet love emotional roller coaster and we'll only get to meet in 3 years if lucky (I've dated chicks irl since I met her btw, but only because she never had any feelings and was always going out with some fuckboy).<br><br>But yeah same boat of she would move on from the our fucking dream girls, and I really don't know, anon.

See if you can find a way to see her sooner if you can. I sometimes I think about just going up to where my girl is at and just bring her back down with me. I would totally do that 28 hour drive or how ever long it is. She was more than just a girlfriend, she is my best friend.</br>    <br>thanks bro, I don't desire this feeling to anyone, let me care for you bro, you have a friend on me!</br>    <br> she blocks Andrew one day after she's fed up with him treating both of us like shit <br> he messages me out of anger asking me what the fuck I did and what he did to make me take Jane from her <br> I tell him it's all his fault for all the shit he put her through even before this episode <br> I talk to Jane later and she's pissed Andrew had the audacity to get angry at me after treating me like shit and cheating on her <br> he messages me that night out of nowhere giving me some bullshit apology I know Jane forced him to give <br> nothing but hatred and negative emotions swirl inside of me but I let him off easy just telling him he's a bad friend and I'd try to forgive him, just in the meantime he needs to stop being such an asshole to everybody he supposedly cares about <br> literally nothing  <br><br> around the start of junior year, her birthday rolls around <br> Andrew and I talk, vaguely, she put him threw her bipolar rage hell like with me and pretty much stopped talking to him for now reason, they message each other every once in a blue moon <br> I still never found out what made her hate me so much and that's what had been tearing me apart in the last few months <br> I accepted that she hated me and didn't want me, I just couldn't understand why <br><br><br>Contd.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    Damn Gabby, I know that if I didn't have to work tonight we would've ended up fucking in the back of your boyfriend's car. Guess it'll have to wait til Wednesday when when I see you at work.    <br>All aboard the feels train Choo choo</br>  <br>tl;dr<br> tfw didn't get to see my fuck buddy tonight </br></br>    This just happened a little while ago.<br> Meet a girl named Megan <br> Hit it off pretty well <br> Both dealing with breakups and sort of using each other to compensate <br> Just friends for a while <br> One night we're hanging out <br> I put on ASAP Rocky's new album <br>inb4 bad taste in music<br> Things start getting flirty <br> We have (looking back on it) a really hilarious conversation about how great her ass is <br>I cannot exaggerate how great her ass is, btw<br> The ASAP Rocky song "Fine Whine" comes on <br>For those of you that have good taste in music, unlike me, and haven't heard the song, it's basically Rocky talking from the ex-boyfriend's perspective about a breakup. He dumped a girl, and is basically saying "I know your heart is broken, and I know I'm a complete dick, but we both knew this wasn't going to last forever. Besides, you're young and have a great ass, and the night is still young so just go back to sippin wine and feelin fine." Obviously that was not a quote.<br> Anyways, we start talking about how her heart is still kinda broken <br> Things start getting heavy again, both emotionally and sexually.  <br> Finally I just kiss her and we just cuddle up together.  <br> At this point the wine has stopped flowing significantly. <br> She's a little buzzed, but not drunk by any stretch of the imagination. <br>cont.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> I never did anything to harm her or mistreat her, aside from a few early arguments, everything was good until the webcam incident (which I apologized for even though none of it was my fault) <br> I ask Andrew to say happy birthday for me and ask the question I've wanted to know the answer to for so long, at least to have some closure <br> I expect either no response or another shitstorm <br> lo and beholdq she responds <br> It's some bullshit about how she is docile and gets attached to easily and had to let me go <br> none of it explains why she had to go berserk and still talks to Andrew but not me, why she did everything in her power to blame me and make me feel like shit <br> but it's an attempt to grant my final wish so I suck it up and accept it <br><br><br>I haven't heard from her since, which was about two years ago.<br><br>Now for advice, I guess. I had an alternate account I messaged her from like twice, she saw the messages but never responded. The last one I sent was many months ago. Now I find I'm unblocked on my main account. Should I even bother to message her? What would I even say?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   im a smart motherfucker <br> im handsome <br> im kind <br> im considerate <br> basically i got everything needed in me to live a good life and progress far.  <br> all i do is play wow  <br> i go to parties <br> at parties all i do is reject attractive people <br> never feel good enough <br> hate myself <br> smoke weed everytime high 24/7  <br> if not high drunk </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Man I'm fuckin' trying my hardest to make it sooner or at least make it bearable. I'm sending her this hella detailed birthday gift in the mail with all her favourite shit (and some stuff you can only get up here in Canadaland like kinder eggs 'n' shit because she's always been curious), I also wrote her a song which odds are I won't play for her but hey if I get just high enough I might.<br><br>Also I'm saving up money like mad right now so I can go down to meet her for like 2 nights just so I can be her prom date (she's still a senior in high school).<br><br>But yeah like I said; the feelsy pain is the worry that what weirdly nice thing we have won't last at all. And its like she'll go on for several days on end without responding or sending anything, and maybe I'm just an attention-seeking fucktard but it freaks me out tbh.<br><br>idk man, life is just a whole worry because of my sitch.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Zoë.   23 <br> virgin <br> shit job <br> shut in <br> shit apartment <br> beta af <br> depressed af <br>what do?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>are you me?</br>  <br>Are you working full time?</br>    <br>FUCk</br>  Yeah her name it Cunt oh and she's a bitch.

Just a guy who loves nothing more than seeing his woman with others.</br>  <br>Sure thing, buddy</br>  are you the guy in the pic?<br><br>what kind of relationship you maintain with your woman?</br></br>  <br>No, the pic is just stolen off google images :P<br><br>I was cuckolded once with a girlfriend when I was 23, then fully cuckolded during a 6.5 year relationship and now have found the absolute perfect cuckoldress, who I've been with for three months so far. All three were loving committed relationships (committed on my part) with woman who fuck other guys. Basically sluts who are happy to have one guy who sticks around, loves them and treats them well.</br></br></br>    Real cuckolds are pathetic, but you my friend, are the shit of this world. Cheers.  <br>basically ur a fucking beta faggot lmfao.<br><br>go die</br></br></br>  <br>so do women really like to have a guy around who does shit? lol<br><br>do you have a pic of a guy who got cucked by a girl with glasses they exchanged text and pics she sent him pics of cocks with her face next to it saying they smelled like rotten cheese, etc</br></br></br>  <br>I love black cock</br>  <br>That's a hot webm, thanks :)<br><br>I've already sucked dick for my new girlfriend once. She totally loved it and wants to see a guy fuck my ass so maybe this video isn't far off ;)</br></br></br>  <br>why do you post pixels? <br>kike</br></br>  <br>How do you get into the lifestyle</br>  <br>so that guy came or what?</br>  <br>I knew it was something I needed, so after I ended a relationship with a girl who let me know she wasn't into it, I was looking only to meet a woman who would. The first woman who was into cuckolding me I met quite randomly. My new girlfriend I met on purpose, looking on fetlife :)</br>  <br>This isnt true<br><br>You are just a jew<br><br>0/10 for you</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>My first girlfriend was Jewish. I wanted her to cuckold me so bad but she wouldn't do it :(</br>  Who does your wife fuck? Friends? Randoms? <br><br>Are you in the room during this? What do you do, jerk off? Clean up? Be specific.</br></br>  <br> mfw guy gets all insecure calling people jew thinking someone is trying to convince him of going cuck <br><br>stfu virgin porn addict guy is just telling his fucked up sex life stories</br></br></br>  Dudes don't need to be black you know...  <br>I want to get pounded by a big black guy.</br>  <br>so are you ugly? fat? small dick?<br><br>does it matter to your gfs or are they just into this fetish and get off to the thought?</br></br></br>  <br>The first time I was cuckolded, my girlfriend at the time fucked an old fuck buddy of hers. The second relationship I was cuckolded in, she was a massage therapist and fucked a lot of her clients. My current girlfriend has fuck buddies but also loves fucking random strangers. I prefer to watch but don't alway get to. I've never had the chance to clean up but my new girlfriend wants to make that happen :)</br>  <br>ok thats disgusting af</br>  <br>I'm probably less than average in looks but not a troll. I'm fairly fit and have lots of friends. My dick is 5" long and 4.5" around, so kind of small. <br><br>I've never been with a girl who enjoyed it but my new girlfriend LOVES having a boyfriend and fucking other guys as well.</br></br></br>  <br>I love having my dick pummeled by a big black dick, like he's hitting a speed bag.</br>  <br>so do you jerk off to porn, have sex, what you do sexually really<br><br>also dont you derive pleasure of approaching, flerting, kissing and fucking girls? do you like girls and vagina? you may consider yourself as homosexual?</br></br></br>  <br>We both love porn. I've always jerked off to porn a lot and she loves watching too so we watch together sometimes. I'm not the kind of extreme cuckold who doesn't get sex, we fuck all the time. <br><br>The most pleasurable thing for me is being committed to one girl who is slut who fucks lots of other guys. I can't stand dating, one night stands, etc. I'm bisexual but only interested in a relationship with slutty women who fuck other guys. I wouldn't ever have a boyfriend, not that there's anything wrong with that.</br></br></br>  http://www.xvideos.com/video8398422<wbr>/interracial_creampie_compilation</wbr>  You should all kill yourselves tbh<br>t. Grill</br>  <br><br><br> I'm bisexual <br><br>that explains see you mate</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>srs question OP how do you find women who are into that fetish but also don't leave you? very curious for umm reasons.</br>    <br>Lol, I know there are tons of guys into this who never get the chance. I had been single for a bit in January and decided I had enough of pretending I could have a normal relationship. I posted a few times on craigslist, a well-written, honest ad looking for a girl who wanted the same thing I did. Met a couple girls that way. I found my current girl through fetlife, which is an awesome place to find people who won't judge you for being a sexual deviant :)</br>  <br>Sure, maybe it does. I like dicks.</br>  why do you work for JIDF?  <br>specifically OP I'd like to have a GF who would get fucked by bulls while I watch but I'd not want to feel inadequate or be a bottom otherwise...is that possible or is my fantasy too hard to make happen?</br>  <br>are you like most cucks who would rather watch her take bbc? or no difference whether white black azn etc?</br>  <br>We're both white and both prefer that she fucks black guys. She only started trying white guys a year and a half ago and had only fucked black guys before that. The contrast in skin color is really hot...</br>  <br>best cuck experience thus far?</br>  <br>Bottoming for her bulls is pretty extreme as far as cuckolding goes. Typically the guy is just watching and jerking off. Not feeling inadequate...that would depend on how endowed you are and how endowed her bulls are.</br>  <br>There have been lots of amazing experiences but so far watching my new girlfriend suck six guys at a gangbang was by far the hottest. The only reason she wasn't fucking them is because she was on her period :(</br>  <br>biggest dick you've watched a girl take? Suck? Described to you by her?</br>  <br>Never been cucked... but I've made a few.</br>  Do you ever feel regret when it's done? GF and I have been talking about trying for a while and I jerk off to cuck and threesome porn thinking about my GF but as soon as I cum I have second thoughts.  <br>My first girlfriend's first boyfriend had 9.5", measured by her (wasn't guessing). My current girlfriend, looking at a tape measure, estimated the longest guy she had been with to be around 9". <br><br>I've never seen one big like that in person. The biggest I've seen fucking a girl I was with was probably about 8" and thick. 8" is really big, a true 9" would be huge :o</br></br></br>  <br><br>The first couple times might be confusing but you need to be honest with yourself. If 99% of the time you find it incredibly hot and 1%, the five minutes after cumming, you think it's a bad idea...which is going to be more pleasurable? Giving in to the 99% or being scared of the 1%? <br><br>I'm cool with it 100% of the time now but know what you're saying. The first few times were confusing...</br></br></br></br>  <br>were the guys black or white? Have you ever watched a girl take multiple creampies?</br>  itt  <br><br>Guys I've been cuckolded by have been almost all white. I've seen my current girlfriend suck one black guy and fuck another though...so hot. <br><br>We haven't done it yet but my current girlfriend is really into the idea of getting creampied. I'm really looking forward to it :)</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>How do you think these guys felt? Would this turn you on?</br></br>  bump      <br>Violence doesn't turn us on. My girlfriend doesn't need to be threatened to fuck four black guys at a gangbang, she'll do it willingly!</br>  made webm for you cuckfags, just pretend she is your wife  <br>Bump</br>            contribootin  <br>What's this of?</br>  <br>Yup, bunch of pictures of big black cocks so Ill just post an example of the fact that not everyone of one general group is exactly the same. Wow. I really did something today. I did it. I saved my race and my self esteem. I can finally die.<br><br>Please do. Kill yourself.</br></br></br>  <br> this butthurt </br>          Trap thread?

Trust me, I want nothing more than a feminine little trap to fuck senseless while I fondle their cocks, and I acknowledge how incredibly gay that is, and that I'm undeniably bisexual.    <br>Tell me what i am if i find traps very attractive, but men literally zero attractive.</br>  <br>lel it's not my fantasy. "she" is a well known trap from my parts, believe it or not..</br>  <br><br>are these the same person?</br></br>  <br>congratulations, you're healthy and comfortable with your sexuality.<br><br>people born in the south or inland in the US grow up in an environment where homosexuality is persecuted and disgusting, so naturally when /b/ starts turning them into a bit of a faggot they are in denial about it. It makes sense why it happens, it's depressing. It's much better to accept you're bisexual, that way you can pursue the fetish and enjoy sex with traps and shemales without feeling like you're doing something wrong because of christian cultural influence.</br></br></br>  <br>couldn't have said it better myself</br>  <br>who is this?</br>  <br>shemale &gt; trap<br><br>It's also less gay.</br></br></br>  <br>I wouldn't call you bisexual. I think there should be a term for someone who is attracted to shemales but not men. In fact, consider someone who is only attracted to shemales, what is that person?</br>  <br>because you're probably bisexual specifically with a fetish for traps. you're definitely not straight.<br><br><br>I don't care who's face that is, I'm telling you,  is a woman's ass. The anatomy is clear, I've been fapping to female and trap porn for like ten years.<br><br><br>nope. The first one is a buddy of mine, no idea who the second one is.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>whats the dif</br>  <br>Tell girls you like traps, nuff said.</br>  <br>I have considered this as well but I don't want the AIDS. Condoms, I know, I still just don't trust it.</br>  <br>prolly got sucked into that black hole</br>  <br>This is me as well... She'd have to be crazy convincing though.</br>  <br>yeah it is a little bit less gay, not much. I disagree though, traps are fucking cute. shemales are monstrous. HP Lovecraft shit. raaarghbargle muh faketits fakeass surgery'd face what am I...<br><br><br>gynesexual. it's a little bit pretentious though, bisexual makes you not sound like tumblr.<br><br><br>another pic of that first person</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>i would eat until diamond, cum down your throat / pulling out onto your face same release, and with out hesitation shove it into your ass doggy until I finish, smoke a cig, and pass out.</br></br>    you will never suck off a tarp <br><br>sadness</br></br>  <br>Shemales are on the hormones and have tits and shit.</br>  <br>shemales = surgery + HRT, transgendered<br>trap = no surgery, either HRT or particularly effeminate crossdressers, different mentality and sexuality<br><br>they meant the same thing in like 2006<br><br><br>condoms really do work, I promise</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The thing is im not attracted to masculine men, but i am attracted to women and and traps. I guess I am bisexual, but i feel like that means im attratcted to both masculine men and women. idk</br></br>  <br>wouldn't you like to know :P</br>  <br>what's keeping you, anon?</br>  <br>dat face tho</br>  Where are some good free tranny videos?  <br>bisexual is an umbrella term. gynesexual means someone who's attracted to femininity, just sounds pretentious.</br>  <br>sauce?</br>  <br>please sauce who is this?</br>  <br>don't hold out on me anon</br>  <br>all over the internet. findtubes or something.</br>  <br>what is this? im seeing it everywhere</br>  <br>the second one's name is Jess. I haven't seen her post here in a while but is the hottest trap I've seen and the main reason why I ever visit these threads. I sound creepy af tho. This is her</br>  <br>last one, cba posting more</br>  <br>Never had the chance. Saw a pretty transgirl with pigtails and short-shorts today but there's never an opportunity to talk, let alone get busy.</br>  <br>Bonr and raised in SC brochacho</br>  <br>i've been needing to know her name for awhile.<br><br>the rest of that set with her in her panties is fucking sexy</br></br></br>    <br>most of the traps get chased off of /b/ by the shemale fags with the "i'm straight" complexes, some of them are very aggressive and rude. it's really sad, I've watched a lot of great traps come and go.</br>    <br>Moar!!</br>  <br>sounds like i fit there then</br>  <br>Pretty hot, got moar?</br>  <br>hook up on the internet.<br><br>and yeah, a trans girl hit on me while I was hitchhiking through Tennessee, busking on a street corner. Didn't jump on the opportunity and learned my lesson. Might've been housed up that night too lol.</br></br></br>    <br> shemale fags with the "i'm straight" complexes <br><br>wut</br></br></br>  <br>Jacqueline Woods ese...</br>    <br><br>Damn, that's hot.</br></br>  <br> "i'm straight" complexes <br>I just like pretty girls. A pretty girl with a penis is fine too. Too much silicone is a turnoff though if that's what you mean. Big boobs are lovely, flat chests are lovely. Plastic funbags are hideous.</br></br>  <br>No nudes? She's really hot</br>  <br> are you me? <br><br>No really, but who the fuck cares man. Fuck who you want, fap to who you want. I don't get why it even matters.</br></br></br>  <br>seen this pic b4... who's that? :3</br>  <br>the people who post only professional shemales with surgery and shit, and say terrible things to the crossdressers and people only on HRT posting their pics here, making them feel bad about themselves. Same kind of people who insist they are straight when posting shemale porn. Naomitrap and Sierratrap stopped posting recently because some guy was obsessively targeting their pics with shitloads of insults and degradation. It was pretty sad.</br>  <br>Yeah, pretty much all trap threads I've visteded recently have been completely derailed by spammers posting scat/shit pics. a Feature allowing you to block a given IP would be useful. although they could still kill the thread quickly.</br>  <br>got nudes. promised her I'd not share though :/</br>  <br>dunno, one of my many pics that have been lost to time. I know some of the traps I'm posting, but a lot of them are just random pics I picked up here or there.</br>  <br>Damn, :(</br>  <br>more of this</br>    <br>Oh okay, I'm , I thought you were referring to people targeting trap threads out of homophobia.<br><br>In this case, I can sort of see both sides. The purpose of most of these threads is to jerk off, so the most attractive traps are wanted. IMO traps that look masculine should stick to the /soc/ trap threads if they want to avoid that shit, it's more of a community I'd say while this is just for people to get their rocks off.</br></br></br>    <br>well those guys aren't the problem, it's the people who are calling someone who's rageposting at their pics calling them disgusting and telling them to stop posting. It's why Ren left, it's why Footie left, and i'm guessing it's why Naomi and Sierra aren't posting any more. This is a really hostile environment.</br>  <br>forgot to include a pic</br>    just go to tranchan and actually talk to some traps, you stupid faggots  <br>how do i find a real transexual who wants to keep her dick and has fake tits... do these exist?</br>    <br>I guess I also want to meet a girl I really like and not to feel like a tourist just having an "experience" I can walk away from. Like... OK tgirls will say if you're really interested and not a chaser then you will take her to meet your parents. My parents are dead but I'd like to meet a tgirl and take her to meet my brothers who would be very confused but say something like "hey bro as long as he makes you happy, err... I mean she". Something like that.</br>  what would you call the girl version of a trap? like instead of a boy who appears to be a girl, a girl who appears to be a boy?  so many fuckable traps :3  <br>well, just so you know, the person in what you just posted is someone I used to talk to from the PNW who stopped posting here because of the aggression. A good portion of /b/'s trap material comes from camwhoring in trap threads.</br>  <br>yes they exist, more common than you think</br>  <br>kill it with fire</br>  <br><br>What's this from?</br></br>  <br>yes lol they exist. Try backpage.<br><br><br>if you're looking to date one, go to internet communities with tgs and make friends, or go to gay bars and LGBTQ community stuff.<br><br><br>reverse trap, or just "weird and gross" lol</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>how do i find, trannydates etc is 99% disgusting crossdressers. i need a ts that will make me feel like a man and not someone who is fucking a dude.</br>  <br>feet &amp; trap all in one PIC!<br>great! anymore like this?</br></br>  <br>drop 300 bucks on a good looking tranny from backpage or something similar. some asian massage parlors have good looking trannies.<br><br>I recommend coming to terms with your sexuality though so you can enjoy cds who will worship your cock for free.</br></br></br>  <br>I never saw anything but compliments towards her so I don't think the aggression you previously described towards non-pornstars would apply to her. Maybe sexual aggression or trap hate.</br>  <br>not much, looking through my folders right now</br>  <br>The issue with this is either they're fugly, or adrogenous. And, if they're adrogenous, they're usually decently attractive.</br>  <br>i have had sex with danika dreams through backpage. i<br><br>i want a relationship, i want to see what it is like dating a ts, but like i said from my experiences most cut their cock off..<br><br>and im not sexually attracted to cds, if i can tell its a man without the cock showing i am not turned on at all. I dont like dudes, i like women, but i have a kink for sexy ts... i mean maybe if she is a rly hot cd then ya, but looking through 3 tranny date sites i dont see any that are attractive enough TO ME.</br></br></br></br></br>      <br>FTM or female to male. Some of the best sex I ever had. He loved getting fucked in the ass and also we could reverse positions, I'd spread my legs and he would grind his pelvis against my taint like there was an invisible cock penetrating my invisible pussy. It wasn't a dominance thing at all, I really felt like a girl getting plowed in those moments and both of us would cum from it.</br>  <br>he personally talked to me about it, he had a lot of insecurity, especially with his jaw line and people saying rude things to him on 4chan was wrecking his confidence. Ren talked about it too, it's also why I stopped posting my stuff here. this is a gnarly place.</br>  <br>Is that the son from breaking bad?</br>    <br>well, are you hot and good enough for a qt woman? if not, the same applies to a qt transgender, keep that in mind. If you want to meet them and hit on the, LGBTQ community and gay bars and stuff like that is the way to go.</br>   how a real /b/ fag if he got what he wished for   <br>that's a photoshopped picture</br>  <br>yes.<br><br>i guess i gotta go to gay bars.... i dont wanan get hit on by dudes tho lmao</br></br></br>  /r/ing a webm of a cute asian trap wearing a surgical mask masturbating with a bottle  <br>with that homophobic attitude, it's unlikely shemales are going to be interested in you at all, you might want to work on that if you're serious about dating one. 90%+ of transgenders are SJW.</br>  mfw no horse hung traps :(  <br>got screenshots? because  still applies from my perspective</br>  <br>it's not a trap if it's obviously a dude. how could one be trapped by this?</br>  <br><br>eee I love getting posted</br></br>  <br> Implying a /b/ fag doesn't already have a dildo they fuck themselves with <br> Implying not everyone on be is a fag <br> Implying you, yourself, are not a fag <br>Faggot.</br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah, as if that's you!</br>  <br>that isnt homophobic just because i dont want to get hit on by dudes.<br><br>seriously do people know what homophobic means?</br></br></br>    For the longest time I've been trying to find this one vid of a trap bringing a guy back to their house and they start making out and when the guy goes to reach down and feels cock he nopes out until he get's convinced otherwise. Anyone know the video I'm thinking of?  <br>why the hell would I take screenshots of people insulting traps? I'm telling you what these people have told me, and of my own personal experiences on this board as well. remain in denial if you like, I don't really see why you think it's unrealistic that traps don't like to post here because of aggression.</br>    <br>it's me :x</br>  <br>I meant screenshots of the convo you had with Jess. You said you were talking personally so I'd assume it was on skype or something that isn't 4chan, getting deleted after a certain amount a time.</br>  <br><br>I think they were talking about screenshots of your conversations with the other person.</br></br>   no tits  <br> no ass <br>no thanks</br></br>  <br>name?</br>  Where's the banana now, that fucking cocksucker.  <br>it's more of the <br> "and im not sexually attracted to cds, if i can tell its a man without the cock showing i am not turned on at all. I dont like dudes, i like women, but i have a kink for sexy ts... i mean maybe if she is a rly hot cd then ya, but looking through 3 tranny date sites i dont see any that are attractive enough TO ME." <br>it's not really homophobia, but that's how an SJW will see it. Transgenders don't like to hear people talking like this, and if you have this mindset, you're likely to offend them or make them uncomfortable. Transgenders usually like to date people who are very open with sexuality and are comfortable with bisexuality.</br></br></br>  <br>hnnnnggg... got any contact info? :o</br>  How the hell do I find traps. I'm tired of just fapping to them.  <br>mario?</br>  <br>1. Live in a very liberal area<br>2. go on craigslist<br>3. ???<br>4. Profit</br></br></br></br>    <br>what's the point of sharing screenshots of personal e-mails? they could be from anybody really, and I'm not going to do that anyway because they're personal. I also don't care if you don't believe something obvious such as traps not liking to post here because of aggression. It's a silly thing to pretend doesn't happen.</br>    <br>so cute, me so ronery &lt;/3</br>  <br>Who is it supposed to be</br>  <br>here you are... its finally out for free<br>your welcome /b/ros and /b/roettes<br><br>http://www.ashemaletube.com/videos/<wbr>200960/the-tranny-bunch.html</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>das a shoop</br>  <br>people have been harrassing me lately.

Just admit it's a little gay, you don't have to come out of the closet or anything, but come on. We're fucking anonymous.</br>  any 860 traps?  <br>i live in new zealand, ive tried a couple sites and still havent found anyone, we need more like you ;)</br>      <br>saaaauceeeee?</br>    <br>I love her!

Its complicated i know</br>  Men, don't fall for the mind control operation.<br>Be men. <br>Ever wonder why the rapid rise in transsexuals occurred just this past decade?<br>These men were feminized through government remote mind control techniques perfected through MKULTRA and MONARCH.<br><br>Take back control of your mind.

A trap is any person that looks like a girl but has a penis, aka, ITS A TRAP. This includes, passable cross dressers, trans girls, and shemale porn stars.</br>  <br>Not him, but I don't reckon it's gay, but it's not "straight" though. I find feminine bodies attractive, boobs, curvaceous body, nice round big arse, cute feminine face, but with a dick. I don't find the male body attractive in a sexual way. I can easily admit if a male is good looking, but I don't find it sexual at all. I hope that makes sense.</br>    I'm into traps. I've gotten the urge to buy a plaid schoolgirl skirt for myself. Advice? I'm kinda freaking out that I had this thought  <br>fucking trips</br>  <br>Suits me that there's less competition for reproduction. And the fact that there's feminine fuck toys that can't get pregnant makes it even better.</br>  <br>WOAH, WUT</br>  <br>Dammmmmn girl looks like Alison Brie</br>  <br>God, she's easily one of my favourite porn stars.</br>  <br>checkd</br>  <br>go for it, what's the worst that could happen?</br>  <br>I had the same worries. Start off slow, buy some tights or knee high socks or something see how you feel then</br>  <br>what is this, 2006?</br>  <br>Omg I actually do have striped knee socks</br>  any australian's in here?  someone please post that robin one, shes so hot  <br>yeah like, ten years ago. now we use language to differentiate specific things, old man.</br>  <br>what are you waiting for?</br>  <br>Anyone else think Lexi's eyes are gorgeous? She's even incredible without makeup.</br>  <br>Nah mate, I'm not going to kill myself because of a fetish, sorry to disappoint. You do realise that the term trap is arbitrary as fuck and came from the chan sites. For the most part they've been called lady-boys like the Thai ones, very feminine looking, tits and a dick. Traps don't have tits unless the classification changed.</br>  <br> from the chan sites <br>This guy is right. No one really knows what a "trap" is outside of 4chan, or any other image board based site.</br></br>  <br> new thread<br><br/></br></br>  <br>I'm not trying to tell you that you're attracted to big burly men, but if you want to look at dicks don't start your post with 'oh I'm 100% straight btw'. You aren't fooling anyone.</br>  <br>new thread</br>  <br>:) I just slipped them on. Their striped n make me hard as a rock</br>  <br> implying the competition is not to make yourself more suitable to the female population <br>Spoken like a true beta.</br></br>  <br> You aren't fooling anyone <br>Never said I was, but I'd never fuck a dude though. If I could separate the cock from the male body, then I would.</br></br>  <br><br>Was it 2 black people?</br></br>  <br>I understand exactly what you're saying. I'm the one who posted this: <br><br>Recognizing beauty in women or men doesn't imply sexuality. Sex implies sexuality.
