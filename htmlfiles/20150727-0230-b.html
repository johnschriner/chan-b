He's either going to come out of this a complete vegetable or not at all.<br><br>Me and my brother use to wrestle with him when we were kids, he'd always win since he was 10 years older than us, we'd always say "One day when we're strong enough we'll beat you!" and stuff like that. He's now 28 and we're 18. He's dying and I barely even spent any time with him over the past few years, He just had a kid too, he was really keen on being a dad. Today was probably the last time I'm ever going to see him too, I didn't think I would feel at all but as soon as I saw him I just wept. As it was time to say bye I could barely say anything, I kissed him on the head and just said "I'll see you later man" could barely look at him, just choking on my tears I just walked out of the room. He was a good guy.

All I know is that they're fucking retarded</br>  <br>The Hartley Hooligans</br>  <br>lmao</br>  <br>And still, they are a lot smarter that the PC fucks that ramble on the internet about how they are "beautiful" and "angels" and shit.</br>    <br><br> Parents carry some recessive gene which means their kids have a chance of being born with most of their brain missing <br> For whatever reason they somehow dont abort the kid. Maybe they are christtards or maybe they just didnt know until it was quite late. <br> Kids born. In extreme agony for its whole life <br> Parents take loads of pictures of themselves smiling while the poor kid just wants to be allowed to die in peace. <br> Based on this success, they have another spastic kid thats even more fucked up than the last one as if thats even possible. <br><br><br>In their defense at least they arent attention whoring the kids for money like Adalia roses parents.<br><br>But they do act like assholes to the doctors who were advising them that the baby wouldnt live very long.<br>Its almost like they are perpetuating the kids agony and ensuring they are technically alive just to prove the doctors wrong.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    The boy looks fairly normal.  <br> down an optic nerve that empties directly out into a sewer <br>Lost it.</br></br>  <br>But like, were the kids ever given a chance to die? Its not like the parents can euthanize them. It would still technically be murder to neglect the thing to the point where its life ends.</br>  <br> at least they aren't attention whoring their kids <br>What do you think they're taking all these pic/videos for?<br>They're trying to get a reality show m8</br></br></br>  <br>I rarely post on this website (especially about these people) but as it turns out I actually know them in real life, sometimes it's hard to ignore the stuff said here but I take it in my stride, brushing it off my shoulder etc..<br><br>These girls have, what's known as "microephaly". It's a condition that results in the small brain and head size you guys tend to make fun of all the time. <br><br>I hate saying this but regarding the truth of the matter, these little girls live in a constant world of hell. They can BARELY breathe on their own, they cannot walk or crawl. Atleast 70% of what they take in via their eyes/ears assumably goes nowhere except for a pit of darkness which is the large open area where their brain would be. In essence their brains are about the size of an orange.<br><br>It sucks because this family is a loving family, and I feel so sorry for the father and the mother. But silently though, I disagree with how the mother parades her disabled children around, almost making fun of them. <br><br>Shit is fucked up, they have a (very short) life full of pain and misery until they eventually(and inevitably) die a horrible death, possibly a heart attack while choking on their vomit, maybe worse.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are they responsive to external stimuli? Will they track objects with their eyes? React to noise or touch? Do they have any means of expressing themselves beyond displeasure/crying?</br>  <br>id watch every episode. I hate those little bastards</br>  <br><br>You cut my quote off part way through.<br><br>I said at least they arent attention whoring their kids for money.<br>People contacted them and tried to send them money. They refused to accept it.<br><br>I have no idea about the reality show. I hope they put it on late at night so people of a weak disposition dont watch it and get nightmares.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Lola has such a sexy little body. Would look much better covered in my cum, though.  <br>kek</br>  If /b/ made a reality show about them, we could call it The Gnocchi Twins.  <br><br>I would presume that they knew about the second kid being all messed up.<br><br>The first one was probably a surprise and perhaps they didnt know right away.</br></br></br></br>  <br> In essence their brains are about the size of an orange. <br>Let's not be too generous here.</br></br>    <br>That should be the shirt the mom wears.</br>  <br>THESE threads are fucking hilarious</br>  <br>From their website "We were told that we had a 25% chance for recurrence, but the risk was worth it to us to have another baby."</br>  <br>Holy shit, Lola looks ready to fuck someone up.</br>  <br>A small orange*<br><br><br>Happy?</br></br></br></br>  <br> their brains are about the size of an orange. <br>What the fuck are you talkin about ? That's like the average brain of a /b/tar.. oh well, sounds about right.</br></br>  <br>Can put that surprise in the same category as the poor people who were starting their day at the office, looked out into the early morning sky and saw a plane heading straight for them.</br>  <br>Yep.<br><br>And the kicker on that one is Claire's sister is even MORE fucked up then she herself is. That 25% recurrence rate can suck a dick.</br></br></br>  <br>Yet they got a pretty spiffy hot tub from Make-A-Wish. Presents only, no cash, I guess is their philosophy.</br>    <br>Just like all the rekt, YLYL, mexican housemaid, trap, dubs get and dick rate threads that pop up every 45 minutes. Faggot.</br>  <br><br>Hmm definitely sounds like christfags.<br><br>They were prepared to take the 25% risk that a kid would be all fucked up and live a short life of pain and misery.<br>Rather than have the fetus checked and abort if it comes out all fucked up.<br><br>Fucking selfish cunts.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm fucking dead dude</br>  <br>It's stale Gnocchi to be sure.</br>  Years ago 4chan wasn't the eternal wasteland for faggots and pedo's to wander around like it is today.<br><br>Laughing at severely disabled children purely because it's funny to you that they are suffering will eventually turn karma against you.<br><br>Planning on having a kid one day?

But expressing horror that a parent would torture a kid like this for OVER A DECADE without just letting it die.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is like the scene in Robocop 2 when the scientists at OCP are parading the 2nd Gen prototypes and one becomes aware of its own horrific state.</br>    <br><br>Everything has gone a bit quiet on that front.<br><br>Maybe a ship came to take her back to her home planet.</br></br></br></br>  "Hey look at all the whacky laughs i can have with my fucked up kid"<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=U_j<wbr>NFEnjxaY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Most people here seem to have sympathy for the kids and disdain for the attention whoring parents.

I don't take joy in the fact that these girls suffer every day in ways that we could not even begin to imagine.<br><br>And you do. So ask yourself why you think it's funny. And why their pain amuses you. Physically they're fucked up, but atleast they aren't completely immoral cunts.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not a christian-american.<br>In my country you can abort a fetus without having to go to Jesus camp.</br></br>    <br>Even though I know these people in real life, if the had the chance to know before hand that their children would be this way, they had the obligation as parents to abort them before they are forced to live a life only to die well before their time in horrendous fashion.</br>  <br>FUCKING KEK</br>      <br><br>I already said I didnt find it amusing. I find it terrifying that parents would keep a kid like that alive when its clearly experiencing pain and nothing else.<br><br>Its like watching a slow motion train crash. And we are all on the side lines screaming at the horror of the situation. And the delusional parents are smiling all the way as if nothing bad is happening.<br><br><br>There isnt a guiding force that is able to change my genetic code on the fly. <br>Scientists would have measured that.<br>So I think its fine to laugh if you want to anon. You wont have a microcephaly baby if you do.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Look you guys, they're totally sentient.

It won't get you a girlfriend, a job or friends and at the end of the day it probably comes down to jealousy.<br><br>Yes, you're jealous that even though these two little girls are horrendously fucked up, they have family and friends that love and support them. <br><br>How's it feel being completely normal and having less than they do?<br><br>You say it's not amusing but the only reason you would laugh is out of amusement.<br><br>You may not have a kid with the same fucked up problems, but you will have some shit go down in your life, you'll have stress and guilt weighing on your conscience.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>looks like the cave troll in LoTR</br>  Moralfags ITT<br> gif related </br>    <br>You are on the wrong site my friend.</br>    <br>I'm aware of where I am.

It won't get you a girlfriend, a job or friends and at the end of the day it probably comes down to jealousy. <br><br>It makes absolutely no difference to anyone.<br>Even if you went up to these freaks, pointed at them and laughed in their faces they wouldnt even be insulted because they arent aware of their surroundings.<br><br> How's it feel being completely normal and having less than they do? <br><br>Im not a materialistic person. So for me, being healthy and aware of whats going on around me is more important than any material goods or being rich which you clearly think is the most important thing.<br><br> You say it's not amusing but the only reason you would laugh is out of amusement. <br><br>I have said a few times now that I didnt laugh. I find their situation horrific. Seeing a parent torture their own child like this is gut wrenching.<br>But if someone does laugh, then all power to them. Making someone laugh might be the biggest contribution these spastic kids make to the world.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You clearly can't read.

Thats exactly what it was. Its how 4chan got its reputation which brought in fucking normies like you and ruined this place</br></br>  Few people consider the well being of other children who are forced to share space with the retarded. To most children who have not been conditioned into an illogical PC response, they would recoil in horror at seeing such creatures; but many have suffered the fate of being forced to or even worse, play with, such flesh clusters despite knowing instinctively they should have been put down.  <br>And out of curiosity, if/when you have a child that is also fucked up beyond belief, what happens when some pre-teen faggot wants to make your life harder then it already is (two dying children) and starts to harass and make fun of you? <br><br>Fuck all of ya'll. You can try to justify being horrible people, harassing and making fun of the girls and their family, at the end of the day you wouldn't be doing any of that shit had you not had your anonymous shield protecting you.<br><br>Everyone is tough online.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ok, now I know you're trolling. Is this your first time?</br>  <br>and the other half are perfect "wrong hole" faces</br>  <br> And out of curiosity, if/when you have a child that is also fucked up beyond belief <br><br>I would abort it.</br></br></br>  <br>she's just copying like a fucking trained seal. she's not happy at all</br>  <br>Can't abort what's legally already living, dumbfuck. That's called murder.</br>  <br><br>Be honest with yourself, what these kids have is not really living.</br></br>  <br> if/when you have a child that is also fucked up beyond belief <br>I won't because we'll immediately abort it at the first hint of trouble (also what my sibling had wasn't genetic so there's no real risk outside the ones everyone faces).<br><br>And honestly coming from someone who's gone through it very few people "make fun" of the disabled to their faces. It's obvious when someone is sick and eventually dying and everyone just kind of moves out of the way.<br><br>If you're going to whore your golems out on the internet be prepared for people to manipulate your images and laugh behind your back</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's not up to us. If it was up to us my stance would be, sure, end it's life, it's living a miserable existance. <br><br>However when something is 'legally' alive, it's too late. You're stuck with it.

I never said life was fair, i'm just saying how it is you lonley, self-hating, fat loser.<br><br>Making fun of these girls and this family doesn't change your life.

Would they drown without any noticeable change in behavior, or would they show some rudimentary awareness of their impending deaths?</br>  <br> damage control </br>    <br>They would probably have random muscle spasms as they drown. Wouldn't be much of a fight and any thing that does happen wouldn't be voluntary.</br>  <br> Don't hate on them because someone actually loves them. <br>I don't hate the girls because their parents love them.<br><br>I hate the parents because they're dumb enough to think the girls love them back</br></br></br></br>  <br>Doubtful. Hell in that hot tub video that gets posted Lola somehow floats.</br>  <br><br><br>If your loved one becomes a vegetable, you do eventually have the option to turn off their life support rather than prolong their agony forever.<br><br>There should be a similar legal process for if you end up with a kid like this.<br><br><br>Adoption is also a possibility.<br>But my primary concern is the child and ending its misery. Nobody should keep this thing in agony for any longer than necessary.<br><br><br>And yeah its even more fucked up that they had 2 kids like this.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It must be hell living right next door to these people.</br>  <br>That may be true, and a valid point.<br><br>But hating on their irresponsible parents doesn't give ya'll the right to hate on the girls, who ofcourse have done nothing wrong to anyone what-so-ever. Except for being born.</br></br></br>    <br>Wood floats, why not Lola?</br>  <br>I've always believed that at a certain point, euthanasia should be considered. I would feel so guilty if i brought in a little girl like that into this world.</br>  <br> ya'll <br>welp I'm done</br></br>  <br> But hating on their irresponsible parents doesn't give ya'll the right to hate on the girls, who ofcourse have done nothing wrong to anyone what-so-ever. Except for being born. <br><br>They have original sin according to their Christfag parents.</br></br></br>  <br>this is what happens when you go into a nuclear reactor, add in some nitrates into the core and have a blast of high intensity radiation blast your entire body unprotected.</br>  <br>The girls is like 50% lungs and the only things she can do on her own is shit and breath<br><br>of course she's going to float</br></br></br>  <br>Oh i'm sorry. Just incase that went over your head. Ya'll means You all. <br><br>Good day and godbless.</br></br></br>    <br>No one is saying anything about your kids mrs. Hartley.</br>  <br>baited hard</br>  <br>Fake smiles, fake smiles everyday. All the while thinking, "Oh great here comes the nuts and taters crew again."</br>  oh shit they have a website <br>http://www.thehartleyhooligans.com/<wbr></wbr></br>  <br>This was my first comment you prick, I never made fun of them, I was just lurking. If I was making fun of anything it was your ridiculous fucking idea of karma, bad things happen to bad people? Wake up you fucking moron</br>  <br>They can't even shit on their own its involuntary.</br>  <br>Don't you have a cousin to fuck, Leroy?</br>  <br>Implying I am Ms Hartley.<br><br>As I said way up before, I know them in real life, i disagree with how they parade the children but I can't understand why these girls are so very hated, they literally do nothing to anyone. They can't even if it was in their personality to.</br></br></br>  <br>Everything they do is involuntary they only fully developed part of their brain is the brain stem</br>  <br><br>But the parents are in quite a difficult situation too.<br><br>They cant abort the kid. As mentioned that would be murder.<br>But you know its got no potential. Its never going to have any of those development milestones that a child should have.<br><br>Thats why both parents have both snapped mentally and become delusional.<br>They smile but behind the eyes you can see they are dead inside.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>there's no way he's alive<br>and if he's alive <br>why?</br></br></br>  quick someone photoshop this  Can we have a nice softcore hentai thread?<br>Not neccesarely loli,everything is welcome,but only softcore.</br>  <br>main girl of the anime Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko also known as Hentai Prince and the Stony Cat</br>    <br>thank of my the many you have</br>  Dubs decide  <br>the n00ds bitch</br>  Just some boobs, you know im lonely.  <br>Don't try to hide that you're using a GBA emulator on your phone.
