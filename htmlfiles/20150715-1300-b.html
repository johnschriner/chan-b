[ This shit is cringy.<br><br>Their other games were generally okay, and the Borderlands one pushed it, but it worked out pretty well... but this Minecraft shit...<br><br>Seriously, who thought this was an okay thing to do? Is it just me?<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Sb7<wbr>D8APneOA</wbr>  [ ] &lt;-- The trailer</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Hey /b/<br><br>You know the drill - send your girlfriend's Kik name, and I'll test to see if they're faithful.<br><br>Send their Kiks to mine (name: rulesapply) and I'll update you privately (or I can post updates in this thread if you ask me to). I won't be testing any names left in the thread due to whiteknights and spammers.<br><br> I've done this quite a few times and people have asked me questions, so I thought I'd take the time out here to give you a brief FAQ. <br><br> "What is your success rate?" <br> Between 60% &amp; 70% on average. <br><br> "Does it have to be my girlfriend?" <br> Nope, friends are fine, or maybe your friend has a girlfriend you think might cheat. <br><br> "What is your method?" <br> It varies from girl to girl, some like beta-as-fuck-sweet-talk, some like hardcore sexting. <br><br> "How big is your dick?" <br> 7.5 - 8 inches when fully hard. It's not the biggest dick in the world, but it's big enough to get unfaithful girls wanting more. <br><br> "Do you always get tits?" <br> No. Some girls simply just don't like sending tits. Once they've started "cheating" though, about 90% of girls WILL. <br><br> "Why won't you take names from the thread, fag?" <br> Well, as I've already said, whiteknights and spammers. WhiteKnights tell the girl that she's on /b/, and spammers will, you guessed it, spam her - meaning that she'll get a massive influx of dicks and sexts, which will mean no results, as she'll just block them all. <br><br> "You haven't responded to me in ages, what gives, asshole?" <br> Either your girlfriend hasn't yet responded/seen the message I sent her yet, or I'm informing others of their girlfriend's loyalty or lack thereof. <br><br> "Why don't you bump the thread more often?" <br> It can be tricky to hold up a thread, talk to 20 different girls AND the guys who requested me to check them, all at once. I do try my best to keep the thread alive, but it can be tricky when I get a large influx of chat messages. If you want to keep it going longer, please bump, it helps. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  bump  bump  fucking loved your last thread, op<br><br>bumping for justice</br></br>  katais Norwegian. hot. some asian in here. do ur best.  <br><br> "I won't be testing names left in this thread" <br><br><br><br> obviously didnt read the fucking op </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Cxyber <br>Do it op</br></br>  How do I get started getting nudes on kik or whatever you use?
