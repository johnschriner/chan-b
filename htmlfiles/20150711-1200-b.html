Lina Inverse could beat him, since he's vulnerable to magic.<br><br>Even more to the point, Sailor Moon in her Cosmos form is able to destroy an entire galaxy just by looking at it, and the characters from the last leg of Gurren Lagann threw around galaxies as if they were weapons. So...yeah...</br></br>  <br> measuring supe's powers with goku's standards. <br>kek</br></br>  <br> not canon <br>Fuck you, DC. That's why Superman is like that ONE KID who always makes up new rules whenever he's losing.</br></br>  <br>kek</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=oyl<wbr>97TG8jbA</wbr>  [ ]<br>proof why superman would win</br>  <br><br><br>And there we have it.</br></br></br>  <br>this</br>  <br> Superman speaks his lift at around 100 tons </br>   inb4 the lions   <br>superman would win only because DC makes ridiculous claims about super heroes based on science without understanding science or the implications of said claim,such as saying a hero can move faster than the speed of light for example</br>  <br>yes he did</br>  <br>Healing Coma</br>  <br> can lift 100 tons <br> still get beat by Batman <br>Or is that the New 52, "totally new canon/always wins" version of Superman? Either way....pic. Might also help if he could fight as quickly as he can move.</br></br></br>  <br>They're making a new version of this.</br>   Can destroy an entire galaxy just by looking at it.   <br>The only reason Batman ever beats Superman is because Superman doesn't want to hurt Batman, if he did Superman would beat him before the light reached Batman's eyes to tell him Superman is there, anytime Superman actually goes all out it is made very obvious Goku really doesn't stand much of a chance</br>  <br> Supes has no limits <br><br>Neither does Goku.<br><br><br>No?<br><br>Isnt Ki magic? So wouldnt that be able to affect Superman? Besides, Saiyan saga Goku is much stronger than anyone Superman fights.<br><br>Goku near BotGs and Revival of F is more powerful than anything Marvel or DC has.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The problem with those guys is that they're extremely biased and feel every single fight between a foreign character and an American one (it's not limited to America VS Japan) is a fucking contest to prove why the American one is better. In my mind? Superman still wins, but the amount of math those fuckers screw up, make up, and shit they ignore or simply slap together as facts to further the advantage of Superman is fucking painful.<br><br>There's weeabos, which are bad enough. Then you have these comic fanboys. I really don't know which is worse.<br><br>In any case, taking that video seriously is like using a video made by "UchihaDKakarot97" as evidence Goku would win.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>super saiyan god goku, my man.</br>  <br>Bear in mind that Superman can't fight as quickly as he can move, AND he's vulnerable to chi attacks. <br><br><br>Ki/Chi isn't magic, but Superman is still vulnerable to it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Superman moves faster then light <br> Superman has super intellect <br> Superman has infinite strength <br><br>What a fucking boring character.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Superman lift 100tons <br><br>Is this a joke? Superman can move planets, but you know, okay. Congratulations on your dumb shit.</br></br></br>  <br>And he just keeps getting stronger.<br><br><br> implying enemies since the Vegeta Saga couldn't also move planets. </br></br></br></br>  Superman couldn't hit Goku because of instant transmission. Also, superman doesn't kill. So no matter what Goku wins.    <br>"an average human can lift around 40% of his bodyweight max" <br>Superman is a fucking Kryptonian, not an alien you nigger</br></br>  <br>Ki is NOT magic, Superman is not vulnerable to it.</br>  <br>Ki (気) means quite literally "energy", and the only way the dub keeps calling it Ki is because it's fucking painful to make a word that's used like 100 times every episode 3 syllables from 1.<br><br><br>I highly doubt Superman is invulnerable to energy.</br></br></br></br>  <br>*human</br>  <br>SSJGSSJ3 Goku</br>  <br>Didn't they grow to the size where that dudes fucking drill tip was as big as the universe or some shit, and they just kept growing or something?</br>  <br> Kryptonian <br> on Earth <br> not an alien </br></br></br>  <br>Honestly, haven't made it that far yet, but I found it interesting to use entire galaxies as weapons.</br>  Superman is mostly invincible. I'm not super into the DC lore, so I honestly wouldn't know if there are other things that can actually hurt him, but I doubt Goku has any kryptonite just laying around. However, Goku is infinitely stronger than the supes. I couldn't tell you either way whether I know if supes is vunerable to ki, but I know he is outmatched by Goku when it comes to fighting. If Goku can't beat him by just purely killing him I think the fact that Goku is stronger would allow him something else, he could restrain superman in some way, beat him mercilessly until he gave up, I dunno. I vote Goku, but I don't know of a clear and defined way he would win.  <br><br>you're not a dbz fan</br></br>  <br>Proof Superman is vulnerable to Ki? And again, Superman constantly holds back, his fighting speed is very easily just as fast as Goku, and his travel speed is much faster.</br>  <br>Proof of how retarded you are.<br><br>https://m.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=JrvEW<wbr>WYLDHM</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>You just said it: Goku's skill in fighting. Superman's good for one-hit megaton punches, but as we've seen, it takes more than just one hit to finish off an enemy capable of destroying an entire planet with one finger.</br>  <br>I thought Ki was life energy. I dunno, doesnt matter, Goku still wins in nearly every scenario.<br><br>Anyone on Supermans side (even Golden Superman would lose btw) is obviously ignoring the gap in each characters power levels.</br></br></br>  <br>meant to say "not a human"</br>  <br>Gib me da pusi b0ss, pls. I have a the cancer.</br>  <br>I can't pinpoint exactly where it has been said, but it's a widely held 'norm' that he is. He's also weak to TK.<br><br>http://www.screwattack.com/news/sup<wbr>ermans-one-disadvantage-against-gok<wbr>utelekinesis</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>I couldn't say Goku would straight up kill him, but exactly. Goku is stronger. He's not invincible but that's compared to the enemies of his universe, which always get exponentially more powerful. Superman couldn't win, but he might not necessarily lose, it's just pitting one invincible character against someone so much stronger they're technically invincible too.</br>  <br>Also assuming that its a superman from a universe where he's vowed to not kill in fights, that would mean that in the event superman did bring goku to near death, Goku's Zenkai regeneration would just beef him up over and over till he beats superman. At least that's how i see it going. I don't know who would win to be perfectly honest, but i do like Goku more, so i'll just say him.</br>  <br>And even if/when Goku comes back after death, he's 10x stronger than before.</br>  <br>That's not the point, the point is how fucking retarded the premise he was working off of was.</br>  <br>Unfortunately for Superman, Sailor Moon doesn't take this same position. In her Sailor Cosmos form, she could and more than likely would kill Superman effortlessly.</br>   People arguing about a fight between fictitious characters   <br>Yeah, we're nerds....</br>  <br>The only people of the DB universe I can think of that Supes could beat is like the freezer family, and all that squad. Then like, most of the Z-Fighters, but that's just cause, I mean let's be honest, the Z-Fighters mostly kinda suck lol<br><br>Also,<br><br>go poop on someone else you dingleshit, fuck maw.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yt.cum/watch?v=oyl97TG8jbA<br><br>For all you weebs who say that Goku wins, meet real math and science.</br></br></br>  <br>Ki in the DC universe is different from Ki from DBZ. In DC, it's a Mystical form of energy (inspired by Anime, no less) which by the way, Superman happens to be resistant towards.<br>In DBZ, it's plain energy. Martial arts in DBZ universe seem to be centered about manipulating it, it can allow flight; empower attacks, immunity to attacks that can't pass a threshold, launch energy (ki) beams, telekinesis (first used by Chiaotsu, later barely used at all), and pretty much every single thing Toriyama could think of.</br></br>  <br>I have never seen a reference to Superman being weak to Ki with evidence, so I don't think that is true, but as far telekinesis goes it generally has to has a magical origin when it affects him and he can generally over power it, plus he has his mental defenses. In a fight moving as quickly as Goku vs Superman would I doubt Goku would have much time to stop and try to hold Superman telekinetically without being hit before he can stop him.</br>  <br> Dragon Ball: where if you're not at least half-saiyan, you're pretty much useless beyond the Saiyan Saga. </br>  <br><br>ok who would win, a silverback gorilla or a grizzly bear?</br></br>  <br>The bear, claws and teeth with brute strength beat just plain brute strength every time.</br>  <br>ok</br>  <br>King Kong vs Godzilla<br><br>Look it up.</br></br></br>  <br>Fucking goku will make maggotman kiss the ground so fast you will need 3 cranes to take it out and therefore be the next king Arthur.</br>  Fucking Babadi can kill Supershits.  <br>Unfortunately i only remember very slight tidbits of sailor moon from when i watched it as a kid, but i do remember that sailor moon was badass.</br>  <br>I've seen it, complete bullshit inventing new powers and weaknesses to make King Kong win, Godzilla would never lose to King Kong under normal circumstances.</br>  <br>But, I mean, hey, at least they were all such lovable and memorable characters! Like, Chiaotzu, Krillen, and the fan favorite and my personal, of course, Yamcha.</br>  <br>She can destroy an entire galaxy just by glancing at it.</br>  <br>Oh, well fuck. I don't think i really spoiled anything, but I know that it bothers me at least to have things pointed out that are obvious but havent been shown yet in the shows, so my bad.</br>  <br>She could destroy my entire galaxy just by glancing at it if you catch my drift...</br>  <br>Sailor Mercury for me, and then Jupiter afterwards.</br>  Listen dbz fags, u have not seen goku show feats of physical strength on par or halfway equal to supes  <br>thats pretty ridiculous. The only scene i can recall that can rival something that ridiculous is from the Broly movie where Broly just flicks a tiny looking ki ball into space where he destroys the home planet of some alien race. I hate broly.</br>  If anyone can provide something that puts Goku anywhere near this level of strength <br><br>I will consede that Superman loses.<br>but you can't, so I won't.</br></br></br>  <br> implying the Z fighters didn't win against Cell and Buu only because of Mr.Satan </br>  <br>goku can destroy planets.</br>  Frieza can blow up a planet with one finger. Goku is much stronger than Frieza. Therefore Goku can blow up earth and leave superman no one to protect leaving him metaphorically defeated. <br><br>Or Goku can just whipe out superman with that much power.</br></br>  <br> wtf did you just fucking say about me you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class from Saiyan School and have over 300 confirmed planetary destructions, and... <br><br><br>I guess against Buu....and that little dog.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Bears and gorillas both have dense bone structures and thick hides. A bear's slashing and biting won't do as much (although gorillas have powerful jaws too) because of these things as the more direct force of a gorilla's blow. the bear can certainly tear flesh, but that won't compromise the gorilla's mechanical capacity as quickly and easily as the broken ribs or limbs caused by a gorilla's swing.</br></br>  <br>Broly's power is maximum. <br><br>And Goku defeats him...</br></br></br>  <br>And so can Superman, but Goku can't lift them, so what's your point?</br>  <br>wipe*<br>no clue why i said "whipe"</br></br>  <br>Goku can instant transmission as well. So he is faster than faster than the speed of light.</br>  Superman lifted a book of infinite pages lol<br>http://media.animevice.com/uploads/<wbr>0/5948/288189-smcm_super.jpg<br><br>Pretty sure that's infinite strength which trumps any strength feat goku has, or most fictional characters for that matter</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>A grizzly can be up to 1,700 pounds, a silverback is only 500 pounds, the grizzly fucking rapes the gorilla.</br>  <br/>  Well after dbz gt shenron makes goku the immortal protector of the planet. Supes is not immortal so do the math.  Since he has limitless strength he could probably kill goku in a single punch  <br>How can it be a 'book' if it has 'infinite pages?'</br>  <br> after gt <br><br>Aaaaand shit opinion discarded, have a pleasant day.</br></br></br>  <br> gt is not canon </br>  <br>Superman.<br>He's better.</br></br>  <br>Idk that's comic logic for ya. But it wouldn't be the first "limitless" feat supes had. He also lifted the spectre, who weighs an eternity.</br>  <br><br>Caped Baldy all day. God literally resides inside him.</br></br>  <br>Here's somone who lifted a book of infinite pages with relative ease.</br>  <br> using a measurement of time as one of weight <br> 'Murica <br>That's why I don't even read DC comics anymore.</br></br></br>  It really does depend on the version of Superman in play here.<br><br>Golden Age Superman loses hard<br><br>Silver Age Superman effortlessly curbstomps<br><br>Early Post-Crisis Superman loses<br><br>Late Post-Crisis Superman wins easily<br><br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/627123879#p627134019">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Police in England and Wales have only fired TWO fatal bullets between them in the last four years.<br>This is how it's done Amerifags.

Also attempting to down yourself you might get scared and realize that killing yourself is a permanent solution to temporary problems.  <br>Hey John Cusack</br>  I don't know anything about your life experiences or situation, and it seems like you're pretty determined, but I've been there. I tried to hang myself about 6 weeks ago, and obvs I survived. Maybe it was just my natural survival instinct, but the rush of gratitude I felt for life and surviving when I woke up on the floor of my closet was the most intense feeling I have ever experienced. It was incredible, but I wish I hadn't needed it to open my eyes. Life is still hard, but I'm more able to take pleasure in the small things and I have hope that one day things will get better. Please reconsider.  <br>Nice</br>  Yeah, get a better drink (Smirnoff... Pepsi... Really?!)<br><br>And don't use bungee cord, you'll rebound and crack your head on the ceiling.</br></br>  eat ur own cum befor u do it xD  People that actually commit suicide do not tell anyone. You're just looking for attention.  Should have bought something really expensive, you'll be dead when the bills come in.  <br>Stewie? Why is your face vertical?</br>   smirnoff and pepsi <br><br>no wonder youre killing yourself</br></br>  <br>This</br>  <br><br> smirnoff and pepsi <br><br>jesus why? hang yourself first, no need for even more suffering</br></br></br></br>    obvious troll. everyone knows that david cameron only drinks children's tears  <br>I'm an alcohol. Can't die sober</br>  <br>This will not play out like you think, op. You will not die, at least not from your perspective, but you could end up brain damaged or worse.</br>  <br>You're a smart guy OP, I can tell by your big head. Trust me, science doesn't lie. But killing yourself isn't a very smart thing to do.<br><br>You could be the next Bill Gates or Steve Jobs, why are you going to throw that into the toilet? How can you not feel the need to greet the world with your intelligence? We need more people like you, and you want to leave? That's pretty selfish man.</br></br></br>  <br/>  This is what humans have become. We have lost the way.  If you haven't tried DMT don't do it. That will explain everything.  Why not just chug the whole bottle and wonder around and see what happens? Could be fun and change your view point, or you'll die from alacahol poison  <br>Man, keep going strong buddy.</br>  eggman? is that you?  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;57216709 <br>Get fucked OP</br>  <br>You look like Porky Pig.<br>Don't do it.</br></br>  <br>Don't be boring. Dead people are boring.</br>  Read the first chapter of the Kindle version of Atlas Shrugged.  Don't dew yourself in yet, kid  <br>Ikr. Still too much of a puss to try it myself. The near death experience possibility scares me shitless.</br>  <br>Makes me cum every time</br>  Can /b/ count to 10 to save this man's life? If we do it, OP can't kill himself.  <br> implying that attention seeking isn't a cry for help <br> implying that threatening suicide isn't an indicator of psychological distress <br> actually believing that people who suicide don't make suicide threats <br> being this wrong </br></br></br></br>  Ro-Ro-Roll, my /b/ros..

What is your opinion on her /b/?  <br>She looks like she may have a low IQ, but I'm not sure.</br>  <br>It's a nigger of course it does.</br>  I want her to wipe her ass with my face  <br>it is a shit flag</br>  <br><br>She'll probably just get a fuck load of hate mail, nothing special</br></br>  <br> lives in the US <br> hates the US <br>I bet she wont leave</br></br></br>  "Noctumas"<br><br>Niggers. What's with the Klingon names?<br><br>Comical.</br></br></br></br>  Im not sure about this. Burning the flag was labeled constitutional in times of protest. They should make a revision when it comes to wiping your ass with it. Can it even be constitutional? I just dont see a law being made that declaring freedom to wipe your ass with the nations flag  <br>robin roberts hates america</br>  Listen up black people! <br>You may be here and we may have brought you here for slavery but I bet we fucking regret it now. Look how you fucking animals live. In the ghetto talking like a fucking uneducated retard. You already ruin so much so don't even dare to bring up how we slaved you because trust me, we regret bringing monkeys out of there natural habitat. <br>So If you're to complain about America at all please just get the fuck out and live life with your people back in Africa or south America or whatever shit hole you came out of.<br>Any white person who does this obviously isn't well educated and this is the best they can do to get at America.</br></br></br>  <br>Tell'em</br>  lol  <br>Good for her, exercising her First Amendment rights.</br>  <br>That's Obama ex girlfriend. She's salty</br>  I've got her IP, name, and address if anyone wants to dox the cunt.  <br>not my flag, dgaf</br>  Post her ip don't be fag  <br>What?</br>  <br>Now that's a classy broad!</br>  Bold.  This is Nocturna from ghetto gaggers. Nearly certain.  <br>you tasted her?</br>  <br> of course it does <br> it does <br> it <br>Kek</br></br></br></br>  I never understood this, if you don't like america why not just leave? We already have enough problems here &amp; you're making things worst.  <br>Needs to get the fuck out. Take shit brained heard of idget faggots with her.</br>  <br>someone should<br><br>It's her First Amendment right to do this but it makes her look like a dumb fucking nigger. Niggers always complain about the hate they receive and "the man" bringing them down but the dumb shit like this that they do makes the rest of them look bad and they really don't realize it because they think what they are doing is justified due to the years of persecution and slavery in days of old.</br></br></br>    <br>They are on food stamps. We're paying them back so this is no excuse</br>  <br>top kek, these niggers are retarded, pls send package back to africa</br>  <br><br>Why not just renounce her US citizenship?<br><br>What does this do?</br></br></br></br>  but shell bitch if her welfare check isnt on time.  <br> NotMyFlag <br>then gtfo, its that easy</br></br>  <br>False flag event from a good troll.</br>  <br>Spill the beans, Anon</br>  <br>Wiping the shit from her ass with shit ain't gonna work. She's just gonna make a more of a mess. Not that it matters, because she herself is shit.<br>Fucking niggers man.</br></br>  i don't really give a shit m8  <br><br>Okay, yes she's a dumb bitch. But I absolutely hate the "if you hate America so much, leave" argument. Firstly, that's practical for a very small percentage of people. Seriously, how many people have the resources to just pack up and leave the fucking country? Second, and more importantly, I would argue that if you think your country is doing something wrong, it's actually more patriotic to stay and do whatever you can to make your country do the right thing.</br></br>  <br>She's African black. Not American.</br>  I'd be impress if this nigger wiped her ass with her EBT card  <br>She looks like you already have</br>  <br>This AFRICAN AMERICAN even as hispanic I always call them &gt;AFRICAN AMERICAN&lt; yes even in surveys.</br>  <br>The flag of an army which ended slavery in America</br>  <br>Not only that, it's a wonder we haven't had some Southern extremist group try and exterminate them all already. I'm not trying to say that we're allowing them to live here out of our own grace but what's their alternative? Go back to the jungle and live in huts made of straw and shit? The ones who live here now might not have known a different life but they better be damn grateful for the one they have here now</br>  Wait, niggers can type?  <br>Sadly yes</br>  <br>You authoritative, statist, hypernationalist fuck.</br>  ............/´¯/)..................<wbr>(\¯`\<br>.........../...//..................<wbr>..\\...\<br>........../...//...................<wbr>...\\...\<br>...../´¯/..../´¯\................/¯<wbr>` \....\¯`\<br>.././.../..../..../.|_........._|.\<wbr>....\....\...\.\<br>(.(....(.卐(..../..)..)…..(...(.\...<wbr>..)卐.)...).)<br>.\................\/.../......\...\<wbr>/................/<br>..\.................. /.........\................../.<br> ███╗░░░██╗██╗░██████╗░░██████╗░███<wbr>████╗██████╗░███████╗</wbr> <br> ████╗░░██║██║██╔════╝░██╔════╝░██╔<wbr>════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝</wbr> <br> ██╔██╗░██║██║██║░░███╗██║░░███╗███<wbr>██╗░░██████╔╝███████╗</wbr> <br> ██║╚██╗██║██║██║░░░██║██║░░░██║██╔<wbr>══╝░░██╔══██╗╚════██║</wbr> <br> ██║░╚████║██║╚██████╔╝╚██████╔╝███<wbr>████╗██║░░██║███████║</wbr> <br> ╚═╝░░╚═══╝╚═╝░╚═════╝░░╚═════╝░╚══<wbr>════╝╚═╝░░╚═╝╚══════╝</wbr> </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr>  <br>More white people on foodstamps nigga</br>    <br>how is posting yourself on social media wiping your asshole with a flag making a difference and making it do tha right thang?</br>  <br>It's mostly just entitled little kiddies that think they deserve the world doing stupid shit like this. I'm an american I deserve a free paycheck and shouldn't contribute to society at all mentality.</br>  <br>K</br>  Hahahah I needed a good laugh today. That being at the expense of stupid niggers and faggots with reverence for a piece of clothe makes it all that much better.  <br>sauce</br>  <br>nice grammar whitey</br>  <br>fresh summer breeze</br>  <br>sauce</br>  <br>Salsa please</br>  <br>Because there are more white people. There are a larger percentage of niggers on stamps tho. Also, nigger detected.</br>  <br> if you think your country is doing something wrong, it's actually more patriotic to stay and do whatever you can to make your country do the right thing. <br><br>Ding ding ding... we have a winner.</br></br></br>        Whahaha muricans giving a shit about people burning/desecrating a piece of cloth.<br><br>You people are just as ridiculous as those muslims getting all mad over koran burnings.</br></br>  drawthread  <br> taking the bait </br>  <br>Its probably the hairstyle, i believe hers is straighter at the bottom and 'cos im drawing quicker than usual its a sort of similar "style" i suppose<br>Hopefully it shouldnt be an issue</br></br>   hurr let's try to use an anonymous imageboard to not be anonymous <br> Even though there's other boards where you can use a namefield. <br> This is the perfect place for us to chat with our facebook buddies </br></br>  Bought this badboy today.
