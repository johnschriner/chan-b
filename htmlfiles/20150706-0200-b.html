I mean, it all looks so natural and shit. When I try, my lines look like absolute shit. <br><br>I've been practicing with my tablet for about 3 weeks and I just don't seem to be improving at all.</br></br>  <br>Keep practicing, use reference and tutorial videos. Never give up</br>  <br>Months turn to years to get to even where some of us are<br>some are naturals with it but its all hard work to get anywhere</br></br>  Any red line guys here that wanna help me with my shit legs and that right arm?<br>(And I now see the OP picture....fuck)</br>  https://<span>youtu.be/WibmcsEGLKo  [ ]<br> apply this to drawthreads </br>  <br><br>This is the best I can do..</br></br>  <br>Another way to practice is to trace a picture multiple times. I mean dont post it or save, but its a sort of faster way</br>  <br>when the acid good as fuck</br>  <br>I suppose that would be good practice, but making the jump from traced to free-hand after a few weeks of that would surely be more difficult?</br>  Anyone taking requests?<br><br>Personally dude I prefer your art style to hers</br></br>  <br>You got a while to go, I've only drawn seriously for a year and 6 months on a tabler but before that I had always doodled and tried things for 10 years on paper<br>Just takes a drive to continue if you want to get serious with it, but other then that you should see it as something fun to do, a hobby, and despite what people will say about you just have fun with it and seek to improve when you can</br></br>  <br>tad longer torso maybe<br>many her chubbier fit or pregnant, either of those 3</br></br>  <br>Hmm? I know my art is bad but i'd rather come here for advice rather than /ic/. Something just doesn't rub me right when I go there....</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>yes this lol<br>practice makes perfect also it maybe your tablet isnt pressure sensitive<br><br><br>i could try my hands on this one si vous plait?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'll try. Thanks for the help dog.<br><br>Have a go,while you do that i'll practice more poses or try to fix this one.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Also by no stretch of reason should you try and improve here. <br>Its better to have a non toxic environment if you want to improve and 4chan is a cyst of teen angst waiting to pop over and over again<br>Read up the /ic/ sticky to see what things you can try to get a understanding of how shit works<br>Draw in your own time and ask a friend if something looks good, You can also ask here but the response will normally be rude and unforgiving to any progress you make</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You just need to learn how to make the form and such, dont worry about style and such this will be a good start</br>  <br><br>And follow a lot of artists you personally enjoy <br>Get inspired from them, have some serious cock envy about how they do things <br>whatever gives you the drive to draw and try new things<br><br>Never finish something then delete it, You wil definitely want to see what progress you make</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dude I LIKE your art I think it's good</br>  <br>Haha,thanks man,I appreciate it.</br>  <br>when the drawing shitty as fuck</br>  <br>Everytime I lurk all the draw fags are always bros to newcomers and aspiring draw fags alike I always feel a little re assured in the human race when I see these types of posts, so thank you for making me feel a little bit better about staying in 4chan.<br>Also any draw pad you can reccomend it takes up way too much room doing little sketches on notepads so I wanted to switch to digital stuff</br></br>  <br><br>;-;</br></br>  <br>Haha, well, heads up stay too long and you end up like avy and raznick....you know im not even sure why they get crap, hell even raz is getting better</br>  <br>He's not a draw fag he's just a regular /b/ anon so I don't expect anything</br>  mousey and possum having fun.  <br>Its a guilty pleasure of mine to help people out when I was in the same spot <br>Everything's really your pick, I personally use a Wacom intuos 3 graphics tablet, Its a large fucking tablet but it was on the cheap on ebay</br></br>  <br>This is what happens when you don't sketch. At all.</br>  <br>So really it's just personal preference and they all are basically the same?</br>  <br>Thanks for the corrections,and I did sketch. I think I honestly don't look at body proportions right. I see where I fucked up. The hips should be alot wider and I can see the hand positioning better. Thank you.</br>  <br>damm that looks better, still the other one wasn't that bad</br>  <br><br>I kind of like it, though.<br>It looks like an album cover or something.</br></br></br>  <br>I didn't.</br>  <br>This makes me see how much MORE improvement I need. I like chubby chicks like this and i'd like to get better at capturing that figure. If you have any references I could use that'd be handy.</br>  <br>I don't have references.</br>  <br>to be honest I really don't know. Thats why its your choice on that</br>  <br>It's cool,but I think I can see a better perspective on the body from how you drew it.</br>  <br><br>this is true!<br>but it was also a very good attempt, like mine lol</br></br></br>  <br>Oh...<br><br>Hmmm well thanks for the advice and again I'm a little glad there are still people like you on 4chan as much as I love the immature antics of 4chan it can get a little bit dull and annoying as I see it over and over again becoming less of a interesting place and more of a shit fest of one liners being regurgitated over and over again</br></br></br>  made a squishy version ^^  <br>I try to be better, I fall into ruts here and there but 11 years of this place will do that to you from time to time<br><br>11 years sure explains a lot about me now that I think about it</br></br></br>  <br> 11 years <br>I smell something...</br></br>  <br>but how many of those eleven years have you been drawfagging?</br>  <br>I was about to ask this, along with the question "for how many years did you stop browsing this site then came back".</br>  I wanted to draw a cute chubby girl, then i found out i cant.<br><br>Sup thread</br></br>  <br> 11 years  <br>top kek<br> stop</br></br></br>  Draw me a picture of Jasmine from Aladdin looking sexy  <br>You should clean that room then bud<br><br>one year and six months<br>Basically when i decided I wanted to get good<br><br>I was, and still am pretty autistic <br>but all together I should shave off a year and 8 months from that, the time I moved to Florida and didnt have a computer <br><br>I wish I could</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>what the fuck you are talking about?<br>she is chubby cute AND sexy!<br>more please, and maybe take pic second time with 10x more light</br></br></br>  <br>For the love of god more.</br>  <br> teaching others with one year and six months of experience <br>dem 11 years. also autism isn't something that's contagious, it's something you innately have.</br></br>  <br><br>11 years doodling?<br>or actually supported by your parents to grow your artistic talent?<br><br><br>lol you modest show off</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Meerkay? going traditional lately?</br>  <br>how would you survive in space?</br>  <br>Here we go<br><br>11 of doodling on class assignments and spare paper <br>Never was anything else then something to pass the time, but I realized i enjoyed doing it and drew more and more</br></br></br></br>    <br>Ya bump for more that's actually really good imo</br>  <br>my super defensive magic bubble!<br> allows underwater and spacial breathing!<br><br><br>ah i see, well if you liked it so much why not pursue it?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> how would you survive in space? <br>How would you NOT?

Your maths is primary school level.<br><br>That goes without saying, I was simply saying you can't drop the 0 at the end and imply the 44k can "hilariously" translate into 44 dollaps because that's bad maths and stops being funny because its wrong.</br></br></br>  <br>its only small places, and I was sleepy and since I zoomed in to atom level, i couldnt see other areas, so...</br>  <br>see <br><br>This was literally the entire joke, and it's 100% mathematically correct when you convert it to currency.</br></br></br>  <br>Sailor kai, did somethingthinner this time : 3</br>  <br>Mmmm thank you!</br>  <br>Hey Kai, would you like to draw chubby Arcana trying to fly? nude or partially nude?</br>  <br>Yeah but he's wrong to say that you don't use a comma for seperating every thousand. Thats how it was taught years ago and is still being taught where I study.<br>44,150 becomes 44,000 and 150, there is no decimal point in place so you don't throw it in wherever you like.

Did pin ever finish the ghibli pic?  Amerifriends, hear me! For the sake of your country and for the good of the free world it leads, please vote for presidential candidate Bernie Sanders in 2016! I've never felt so passionately about a 73 year old Jewish man from Brooklyn, let alone anyone in American politics. As a Dutchman, I am confident this man will restore your country to it's former glory, with true, fundamental reforms. Universal healthcare, fair taxes for both the rich AND the poor, the revival of the middle class, curtailing of the power of lobbyists and the mega corporations they serve (no more super PAC's; voters should decide an election, not the amount of money pumped into a campaign, powerful friends or media bias), free college tuition, a raise of the minimum wage to 15 dollars an hour at the very least, a renaissance of American infrastructure creating good roads and bridges and millions of jobs in the process.<br><br>Sanders finances his campaign solely through small public donations from ten of thousands of ordinary supporters. The man is brave, honest and true. Please, look into him at the very least:<br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/UsWf0TuM6AA  [ ]<br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/sKpMB_kW35I  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Bump for the good of America and all of humanity.  <br>This man can save America #feelthebern</br>  <br>He won't just save it, he'll make it greater than it ever was. He won't just revive America, he'll bring a renaissance.<br><br>I know that sounds stupid and vapidly idealistic, but I truly believe it.</br></br></br>  <br>omg that makes him look like the Crypt Keeper</br>  Anyone in this thread is kidding themselves  <br>You've let the recession choke your idealism. This man has a track record of integrity, independence and sweet juicy righteousness. Just listen to him, it's all I'm asking, please.</br>  Aussiefag here. Seriously fucking vote for this guy.  No one in America will vote for a socialist. Especially a socialist who seeks to raise taxes, nullify NAFTA and TPP, and who gets their support from foreigners.  Rand PauP 2016!  <br>Have you ever asked yourself what socialism is? and he's a democratic socialist, mind you. What about socialism do you hate specifically? I think the cold war has made you wary of the term, and the effects are still showing. Bernie seeks to raise taxes on the very wealthy (who have only gotten wealthier since the 70's, while everyone else was declining) as well as close loopholes multi-nationals use to not pay a dime in taxes.<br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/BFAq-4Vv5c0  [ ]</br></br></br>  Bump. FEEL THE BERN!  <br>A democratic socialist is still that. I've watched sanders on the daily show and some other news program. I'm not "wary of the Cold War" because I never lived it. Bernie simply doesn't have enough money to run a campaign in the U.S. American business lobbyists will simply not allow him to be elected because of his thoughts on wealth distribution and where jobs should be. Cheap labor doesn't exist in the U.S. but Bernie seems to think that businesses are willing to pay a person $15 an hour to work a register or $19 an hour for a skilled factory worker when they can go to Mexico and pay the workers a dollar fifty for the same job. Again, Bernie will lose in the democratic primary to Hilary Clinton because she actually knows about American Fiscal issues</br>  <br>Look into democratic socialism, as opposed to untempered socialism. You won't find Lenin, you won't find Marx, you'll find universal healthcare, proper treatment of veterans, fair taxes, and in general some of the happiest countries on the planet.<br><br>When I said that you were wary because of the cold war, it's because I believe that it has turned socialism into a bad word. into an insult, while many don't even know what socialists believe.<br><br>All you're giving is practical considerations. Fundamentally, Sanders has it right. <br><br> Bernie simply doesn't have enough money to run a campaign in the U.S. American business lobbyists will simply not allow him to be elected because of his thoughts on wealth distribution and where jobs should be. <br><br>People should chose their leaders, if that's not the way it is, the last thing you should do is bow down to however has stolen the reigns of your fucking country.<br><br>And as for cheap labor, companies make billions in profits, they can afford to pay their workers more. It won't bankrupt them. Do you even know how much of a profit margin there is on a pair of jeans? on an iphone?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Bernie simply doesn't have enough money to run a campaign in the U.S. <br><br>People keep saying this. As if they're fine with the only people getting to run for anything being the people billionaires pick and choose.<br><br>Can't never could.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm in America. I'm voting for Bernie.</br>  <br> &gt;When I said that you were wary because of the cold war, it's because I believe that it has turned socialism into a bad word. into an insult, while many don't even know what socialists believe. <br>To be fair, the rise of neoconservatives and moral majority politics didn't exactly help socialism's image in America, either.</br></br>  I would worry about your own country. Americans simply are "rugged individualists" and don't care about their citizens unless they contribute something of worth to society. Also people in charge are people also and as long as they don't infringe on our rights they're fine.  <br>I really can't tell if this whole thing is a troll thread or not.<br><br>If so, 9/10, made me mad</br></br></br>  What is your experience with Hispanic chicks?  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;625955312 <br>pathetic samefag with the same ugly webms again</br></br>  <br> not knowing what samefagging is </br>  i had a story with a mexican lawyer girl, 2 years older.<br>she came for hlidays to my place and we fucked without interruption, for like one week.<br>Best fucktime ever, she liked and did everything and enjoyed it a lot.<br>also, she was very funny and lively.<br>i was forbidding her to wear panties as a joke one day, and she got me serious and didn'T wear any for the whole rest of the week.<br>i fucked many nationalities, but latinas : just the best</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>shut it nigga, lemme get that SAUCE OP</br></br></br></br>  <br>trying to promote shit tier videos with false conversation starters</br>  <br>search on xvideos "mexican american estrada sexy" and it should come up</br>  <br>i think you're just mad because you can't get Latina pussy</br>  <br>oh no, the "u mad" card</br>  <br>u mad</br>  OH MY GOD POST MORE  <br>that's all I have but there's a lot more of her on xvideos, she has her own channel</br>  <br>Her tits literally get bigger by the end of the video</br>  <br><br>most get fat as fuck</br></br>  <br>ehh that's just a stereotype<br><br>plenty get fat hut they're not much worse than white women in that department</br></br></br>  <br>*but</br>  All I know is that you better wear a condom, they are the hottest at ages 22 and younger, and they will eventually become obese.<br><br>If you had to pick a race of people to send into space to populate the galaxy choose the Mexicans</br></br>  Best fuck I ever had  <br>you crazy They're bringing drugs.
