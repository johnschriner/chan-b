I'll have you know I graduated at the top of my class in the Canadian Politeness Force, and I've been involved in numerous secret runs to Tim Hortons, and I have over 300 confirmed friends. I am trained in welcoming warfare and am the most passive aggressive member of the entire canadian population. You are a person that I have yet to make friends with. I will talk to you with kindness the likes of which have never been seen before on this earth, mark my passiveness. You think you can get away with not saying thank you? Think again, neighbour. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of syrup drinking moose across the northern territories and your IP is being traced so you better prepare for the gift baskets, buddy. The gift baskets that not only contain Gift cards, but donuts from tim hortons too. You're gonna be befriended, guy. I can be nice anywhere, anytime, and can be nice to you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just if I write letters. Not only am i extensively trained in passive aggressive combat, but I have access to the entire moose army of the Canadian Maple Leaf Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to welcome your friendly ass right into the neighbourhood. You little neighbourino. If you had only known what friendly retribution your comment was about to bring down, maybe you would have eaten poutine with me. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're gonna let me pay the bill because that's how nice I am, guy. I will put you in the hospital and it will cost nothing cause our healthcare is free. I'll say sorry now, friendo.</br>  <br><br>yea</br></br>  <br>Madea goes to jail?</br>   Shit I'm going ar war <br> Shit I'm going at war <br> Walk in the desert <br> Oil on fire <br> The End </br></br></br></br>  <br>I love you too anon no bad feelings here</br>   I'm a happy jedi <br> I'm a sad jedi <br> I'm an angry jedi <br> I'm not the jedi I used to be </br></br></br>  <br>Jarhead</br>  <br>kek</br>  <br>Jarhead?</br>  <br>Jurassic Park</br>  <br>jarhead</br>  <br>harry potter</br>  <br><br><br>Yup</br></br></br>   really old but look young <br> had a dick but lost it <br> people die </br></br>  <br>Is it white chicks?</br>   oh no my dog got killed <br> it's ok though, i'll just blow myself up </br>  <br>28 weeks later?</br>  <br>The lost erection?</br>  <br>the invisible man</br>  <br>dexter</br>  Ok, if you guess this one I stop.<br> Mother died <br> Dad is an alcoholic <br> Live with grandmother <br> Random guy come and live in the house </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Let the right one in</br></br>  <br>Nope c'mon guys <br>hint:<br>  terrorizes a family </br></br></br>  <br>Yes you have many wins sir</br>   tell story to emperor <br> story is a lie <br> tell story to emperor <br> story is a lie <br> tell story to emperor <br> story is no lie <br> storyteller is kill </br></br></br></br></br></br>   Earth is doomed <br> retarded shit in a bookcase <br> Earth is saved </br></br>  <br>Hero</br>  <br>Born on the forth of July/ Benjamin button</br>  <br>yup</br>   burnt popcorn <br> fun trivia game <br> talk to mom and dad on the phone </br></br>  <br>Fuck I'll try again. <br>Is it Fear?</br></br>  <br>Interstellar</br>  <br>winrar</br>  <br>Interstellar</br>  <br>Eloise?</br>  <br>I am legend</br>  <br>Yes ding ding ding you are a winner!</br>   guys in suits <br> lots of police cars </br>  <br>Predestination</br>  <br>The men who star at goats</br>  <br>Blues Brothers</br>  <br>blues brothers?</br>   bad guy turns into car <br> pedophile <br> coffee in bed <br>mfw no one ever gets this</br></br></br>  <br>blues bros</br>  <br>yes</br>  <br>Blues Brothers</br>  <br> Mother died <br> Dad is an alcoholic <br> Live with grandmother <br> Random guy come and live in the house <br> Random guy teach me life by fucking my dream girl <br><br>Haleping with this one.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   you dont talk about it   <br>wait shit he didn't lose a dick, he got one</br>  <br>Faggot club</br>  <br>is that the first rule?</br>  <br>The Blues Brothers.</br>  <br><br>yes</br></br>  <br>No it's the second</br>  <br>Star Trek</br>  <br>Soap guys</br>  <br>it's both</br>   kids trapped in kitchen <br> dinosaur opens the door <br> kids are on the floor <br> everybody walk the dinosaur </br></br></br>  Cinema<br>Can't swear<br>Barbara Streisand</br></br>  <br>how</br>   big house <br> Pencak Silat in your face <br> there was a dog </br></br>   ''We have to kill a dragon'' <br> Kekerino let's go to a mountain <br> Dragon is kill <br> Mothafuckin' war in the middle of nowhere </br></br></br>   kill   <br>must be Star Wars ep 4</br>  <br>kek ...gay beat up club except they pretend they arent gay and call it fight club</br>  <br>ssshhh dont talk about it</br>  <br>hobbit</br>  <br>Cretaceous period recreation center</br>  <br>the first rule of fight club is you don't talk about fight club<br>the second rule of fight club is you don't talk about fight club</br></br>  legitimate question... how do u green text?
