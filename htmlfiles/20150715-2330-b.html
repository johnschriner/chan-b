I want to but it is pretty much just for looks, I am circumcised and I like the way my cock looks.<br><br>statistics show that circumcision is becoming less popular though, i don't want my kid to be self conscious about his different penis in the change rooms.<br><br>wut do /b/rothers?</br></br></br></br>  Loss of penile sensitivity<br><br>The tissue in the penis is much like the inner lining of the mouth. Under that membrane teems thousands of nerve endings just below the surface of the membrane. It’s not just skin as one would find on the hand, or any exterior of the body, it’s a membrane. Fluids can transgress it’s surface. Indeed, bodily fluids can pass through the membrane, which, if a man is having sex with a female partner infected with a STI, is how the STI virus can pass through the membrane of his gland (head) and into his blood stream, thus infecting him. (citation needed) This occurs more easily in an natual penis because his membrane is thinner. A circumcised penis, shortly after circumcision, starts to rub against underpants and clothing. That frictional rubbing against cotton or other material dries the membrane out and in response it starts to thicken. This thicker membrane explains (scientific citation needed) why circumcised men have less chance of contracting STI’s. The naturally thicker dermis of a circumcised penis creates a natural barrier to STI’s transgressing across their membrane. A natural condom if you will. Also, if looked at carefully the gland’s surface, rather than being a moist smooth membrane (as it was prior to the circ), post circ, the surface is cracked and dried. As the dermis builds up over time, the surface colour of the gland transforms from a dark pink/purple to a light pale pink.<br><br>sht</br></br></br></br>  <br>why dont you prove your statements instead of letting me disprove them?</br>  <br><br> not knowing what /pol/ stands for </br></br>  Anyone know what happened to this chick?
