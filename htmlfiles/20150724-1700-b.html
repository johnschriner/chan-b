You guys are violating this women by viewing and sharing their private photos without her consent. This is a form of sexual assault. You don't see it as such because you have been blinded by rape culture. If I were to punch you in the face, you'd be in pain. If I were to shoot you in the torso, you'd be in more pain. Both actions cause you pain, but one more than the other; the lesser act of assault is not negated simply because you could be a victim of a greater act of assault. Likewise, the act of sharing and viewing these nude photographs is still a violation of these victims/women regardless of whether greater forms of sexual assault exist. If you sick individuals have a conscience, you will leave her alone because you are currently no different than a common rapist.  blackanese?<br>I will take my nudes now</br>  <br>Amerasian.</br>  chinkanese  C-can we have a preview?  <br>Singaporean<br>American</br></br>  Earthling?

I have this as my weed, bought in Montreal for 60 CAD (about 46USD). I am getting rolling papers tomorrow, what else do I need and what kind of technique should I use?<br><br>Also stoner general.</br></br>  <br> what else do I need <br>Got hemp tips? those shit are good to use as roaches. Otherwise use a small presentation card or train ticket</br></br>  <br>Yeah. We are buying RAW brand filters and papers tomorrow at a local smoke shop.</br>  Use a bong.<br>Joints are a waste of weed because they continuously burn and unless you're sharing it you won't be able to finish it fast enough for it to not waste. Also bongs are just smoother.</br>  It's actually a personal thing, you're gonna have to roll some joints untill you find how you like your joint rolled.  <br>And buy a pipe, you are going to do it sooner or later, believe me.</br>  <br>We might buy a bong if it really worth it.<br><br>I don't know where to start though.</br></br></br>  <br>Are those metal pipes any good?</br>  <br>waatch trailer park boys</br>  <br>Do buy a bong, it will be so worth it</br>  <br>dont buy branded smoking shit you fucking retard. you are the reason why smoking weed is fucking gay</br>  <br> Break up some weed <br> Put it in a dollar <br> Roll it a little <br> Roll the paper into it a little <br> Wet the paper <br> Roll it the rest of the way <br> Enjoy </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I saw some local stores selling them. A girl I'm with says she prefers joints, don't know why. I will talk to her about changing ideas.<br><br>Google RAW rolling paper, apparently it's good.<br><br>Bills in Canada are plastic now, no way.</br></br></br></br></br>  Pretty sure youtube tutorials will work better than anything /b/ would describe with text  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=JnN<wbr>B_EyfpRc</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>I knew I had made a video<br> Use some paper then, fuck</br></br></br></br>  put weed evenly throughout, dont worry about letting some fall out while your roll just do it on a surface, try to get a nice even spread as you twist it up, do a pre twist to compact the weed a little into a roll, then do one full twist by rolling thumbs up, turn around lick the glue, then just finish the roll and lick along the seam on the outside as well. take end and twist it like you're curling a leg hair, then hold on mouthpiece end and shake lightly to get the weed to compact a little better it'll smoke nicer. light it joint facing 45 degrees up while turning like a bbq. when you pull the first time i like to kinda tilt my head up so the heat evenly pulls thru the middle instead of canooing right away.  <br>edit, forget the turn around part to lick glue, glue should already be facing you lol</br>  <br>bro buy backwood or cuban cigars and roll blunt ...much easier than js and better.</br>  Tobacco is easier to roll by hand and good to practice with  <br>no, you can taste the metal buy a glass one, you can get a cheap one for like $10us</br>  <br>joints are convenient for smoking in public because the evidence is immediately destroyed. Sure they might waste a small amount of weed but if you roll it right it will burn slowly and evenly. you want it fat in the middle and a smooth taper down to where you put your mouth on it. when you're rolling it try to fold the mouth peice over on itself, then finish rolling, so that its not just an open circle at the end. this makes it so weed doesnt fall out.</br>  <br><br>Me again, do this instead: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=b1J<wbr>8v-dC0Kc</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>agreed backwood is 10x better than a joint</br>  <br>don't do this shit, rolling with money is gunna get dirty ass shit all over your joint man. be a real g and roll a joint just with the joint and weed fucking retards.</br>  <br>I really only dab any more.

Lost it than and there  <br>a similar thing has happened to me before anon, the girl of my dreams liked me but I refused to really press it and have a relationship because I just don't like being around others despite seeming well adjusted when I'm put in social situations</br>  <br><br>It's a shame, he sounds like a really cool guy..<br><br>RIP David Higgs</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I was in the original thread I tried to talk him out of it but it was too late.</br>  bump  <br>Not much else to say. We talked 24 hours ago about a problem she had with sex, and she hasnt texted me back since.<br><br>We made plans the day we agreed to take it slow to see each other tomorrow (friday) so Im hoping thats still going on. Havent seen her since, when in the last few months we'd see each other every 1-3 days.</br></br></br>  <br><br>You tried, Anon. But I feel that no matter what timing you tried to help, he was a damaged soul. He had his mind set already.<br><br>You're a good person, Anon. There was nothing you could do.</br></br></br></br>  There seems to be a huge influx of feels thread this past week  <br>Continued<br> my dumbass fails a class, have to do credit recovery <br> find out nicole does too <br> had helped her get over the pablo situation, notice she had gotten a bit of a crush on me <br>if only she knew<br> we begin getting more and more physical, more hugs, more tickling, that flirty stuff <br> one day she tells me she needs to talk to me <br> "Ofcourse nicole, what is it?" <br> "I think i am in love with you" <br> my mind went blank, my chest pounded, i about damn cried <br> "I have been in love with you since i met you" <br> we both give eachother a teary eyed look, hug, not like a friendly hug, an intimate, special hug. <br> I break up with my gf that day, and we begin seeing eachother <br> Happiest i had ever been, everything seemed so small when i was with her <br> but she knew <br> she knew about my fucked up life, how fucked up i was, and i knew she knew, though i never told her <br> i take her on a date, and we go to her house, she plays piano for me, and i play guitar and sing for her.  <br> I play one song for her, and she just looks at me <br> she fucking knew <br> "you know, one thing i absolutely love about you?" <br> I look at her and ask "What?" <br> "You have sad eyes, like you seem like you are happy, but when i look in your eyes, you seem very sad" <br> look at her, and a single tear drips from my eye <br> i hadn't cried in nearly 5 years at that point. <br> I tell her everything, i don't even know why, but i tell her about my shitty life, the abuse, the sexual abuse, everything. <br> She hugs me, tells me everything will be okay <br> i feel like the worlds biggest pussy at this point, embarrassed out of my mind. <br> She looks at me, and tells me everything that she kept from me all these years <br> Found out she was adopted, and a ton of other stuff i dont wish to disclose <br> I hug her, and we look at eachother, and started making out, and just did that for as long as we could, it could've been an hour for all i know <br> we stop because her parents come home, we hug, and we both leave, happy as hell. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's the golden ratio, faggot</br>  <br>You're right I just can't stop and feel like if I would have said something differently then he would still be here. Thank you though I really needed to hear some kind words :")</br>  <br>Why are you bitching to me, fucktard? I didn't make the image.</br>  <br><br>No problem. But like I said, he was a damaged soul. Tortured by his own thoughts and the environment around him.<br><br>You could've offered him the entire world, but I know in my heart, his mind was set. Nothing was going to change it. He'll forever be remembered...</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is there moar?</br>    <br>More coming, have to type this out</br>  i feel like a wanna bitch about my overall okay life, just let it all out, even though theres nothing unusal or "feely" about it, and thats my fucking problem.<br>life just goes by, all the same. i have my problems, but they are so unimportant i dont feel like i should bother sharing</br>  <br><br>Perhaps something is missing in your life and so you want to express how you feel in an attempt to find whatever it is you're looking for.<br><br>Perhaps you don't know what it is you're missing, but you'll know it when you see it?</br></br></br></br>  Boyfriend is away for summer, calls me about once a week.<br>I love him but I'm also worried, because I have shitty anxiety, that we won't work. He's stressing about being self sufficient and saying he wants to pay me back for the stuff I bought him for his care package and stuff, which I told him he doesn't have to do because were dating, I'm not holding tabs on that.<br>When I mentioned if we were living together and he would pay me back for the rent if we split it he said I dunno, well figure it out. I was like that's ominous and he laughed and said he loved me.<br>So now I'm here like, what the fuck. If were dating, why should he worry about paying me back? Is that just a guy thing?<br>I really opened up to him guys, and I'm terrified that being apart for this time is gonna cause us to wither is all.</br></br></br></br>  <br>R.I.P. David Higgs</br>  It's my /b/day today and I'd really love a gift /b/. If someone could gift me Age of Wonders 3, I'll love them long time. I've been playing on a torrent forever and just want to face some human opponents. id is imboreds<br>pic unrelated enjoy the eyecandy /b/</br>  <br>nasse-laila is the real source<br><br>these guys are retarded</br></br></br>  <br><br>shes some german bitch who likes facials, not a trap<br><br><br><br>thats not cherry crush</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>so it is a girl and not a trap?</br>  Pics you saved from not supposed to share threads        Your embarrassing fetish<br><br>Let it out /b/</br></br>  <br><br>xvideos is now better than mless. shitty deal.</br></br>  <br>Not at all, I was genuinely curious because it's more common for girls to like to be spanked. I don't mind getting spanked but much rather dish it out.</br>  Joi and wanking in calls  R8 my cock - medium dick edition.  <br>10/10<br> I would let you fuck my throat silly. </br></br>    <br>Would you let me take a pic like this?</br></blockquote>]
