She's the one who got fucked during that parade or some shit right? <br>God damn her voice is annoying.</br>  <br>that just makes me sad.</br>  that white knight below and the amount of people agreeing with him. Sometimes I wish I could just wish these white knights away  <br>Where can i find the public 3some vid?</br>  <br>she got an offer from brazzers but looks like she didn't act on it. will be the second biggest mistake of her life.</br>  <br>right here <br><br><br>checked.</br></br></br></br>  Wtf is this? Let her have an orgy in a church if she wants, who cares  <br>anyone who isn't a complete degenerate cares</br>  <br>If you care about trivial shit like this you're a fucking faggot</br>  <br> anyone who isn't a complete degenerate cares <br>Browses /b/</br></br>  what a shame, she looks hot  POST THE VIDEO  <br>three types of people<br>those who think she's a hero<br>those who think she's a whore<br>and her, for being proud enough to have a 3some in an ally but not enough to share</br></br></br></br>  has anyone saw the video ? Is it great ?  <br>it has been posted you illiterate faggot. <br/></br>  thats the video<br><br>vid <br>me <br>/ wkXo</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's a sketchy ass domain nigga.</br>  <br>check'd</br>  <br><br>Fucking pussy.</br></br>  this is the extent of it? seven seconds? bruh  <br>Both of them are faggots.<br><br>She is a hero, because she's encouraging sluts. We need more sluts who aren't afraid to admit it and are proud to be sluts. Then people who like sluts can find sluts, and people who don't like sluts can look for non-sluts without having to worry about stealth sluts.<br><br>Y'all motherfuckers need to think a minute.</br></br></br></br></br>  Nobody said she was a hero because she had a threesome you dumb fucks. The point is she's standing up to people sending her hate messages because of it.<br><br>God you fucking baboons are embarrassing.</br></br>  <br>that doesn't make her a hero either.</br>  <br>How does that make her a hero?</br>  <br>She is saving the city once again, thank you Batgirl!</br>  <br>hue</br>  <br> The point is she's standing up to people sending her hate messages because of it. <br><br> close laptop <br> dont see messages <br> hero? </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Why, why must I explain this stuff to you guys when you could just be using your brain to figure it out instead?<br><br>Being a conservatard is like vandalizing shit all the time, then evaluating liberals on their ability to fix it effortlessly. You are intellectual welfare queens.</br></br></br></br>  <br>see<br><br><br>The only people who lose when women are allowed to do slutty things without being harrassed for it are the bottom tier of men and ugly women who don't want to be sluts.</br></br></br></br>  i saw the video, she looks like my kind of girl  <br><br>What an idiot fucking child. The fact that people are calling her a hero is a goddamn tragedy.</br></br>  <br>Because you're an asshole and no one respects you. We're not stupid, we just think you're a faggot.</br>  And now her little " I regret none of it" video has millions of views. This world loves making stupid people famous  <br>Hilarious if it was a woman filming and uploading. Bonus points for fat feminist.</br>  <br>uh...<br>this made sense.</br></br>  Reads like a "The Onion" headline.  It is a woman filming. Sounded like an Irish woman.  <br><br><br><br>Same here.</br></br></br></br>  Post some of her pics for scientific purposes.<br><br>She looks a bit fat on that video.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>/pol/ pls</br>  <br>No shit. We treat sluts like shit despite men wanting to fuck women and do kinky shit, so it creates this need to hide shit and lie and play useless little games nobody enjoys playing.<br><br>Meanwhile if we let sluts be sluts and were cool with it, we'd all win because you wouldn't have to worry about finding out what you thought was a nice girl is fucking six dudes and a dog behind your back or plans on drugging you, tying you up and shoving pickles up your ass because that's what gets her off.</br></br></br>  You have been visited by the matriarch of body positivity. All of your faults and regrettable actions will magically become other people's problems but only if you reply "Thanks feminist sluts" in this thread.  <br>Fucking underrated post.<br><br>Sums up /b/ very well.</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks feminist sluts</br>  <br>Thanks feminist sluts</br>  <br>are you fucking joking</br>  <br>I'll give you the benefit of the doubt that you're stupid rather than just evil.<br><br>Let's say there's a guy who was filmed having a threesome with two somewhat drunk teen girls who are legal in his state. What he did was borderline legal but he's currently being berated constantly by an army of angry feminists for having raped and womanized those poor souls and he publicly declares that he doesn't give a shit and that he's gonna stand up for himself.<br><br>How do you feel about him?</br></br></br></br></br>  am I banned  <br>You know you can go to 4chan.org/banned to find out, right?</br>  A woman has a threesome and she's a mentally ill slut, a guy has a threesome..<br>Why should she be ashamed.<br>Who gives a fuck.</br></br>  <br><br>a guy has a threesome and he's a sleazy disgusting manipulator and abuser of women...</br></br>  <br>All about keys and locks.</br>  <br>He's cool. It's easier for women to be whores than for men.</br>  <br>When unlocking the lock makes people on both sides of the door happy, why make your lock hard to unlock?</br>  <br>It's not.<br>You're just retarded.</br></br>  <br>This.<br><br>Men have to put in effort and resources to come out with some pussy at the end of the day. For women, there's no skill involved in whoring yourself out.</br></br></br>  <br>Good rebuttal.<br>My point remains true.</br></br>  <br><br>...That's completely besides the fucking point. I'm talking about standing up to getting publicly shamed. <br><br>It's much easier for women to be publicly shamed. All she had to do was have sex with two guys. He had to have sex with two drunk teen girls.</br></br></br></br>  Serious question: does anybody have some advanced sex tips? Either OC or articles. It's the dumbest shit, all "sex tips" on the webz is for virginial amateurs, or some cosmo feely shit. How about guys who are ALMOST perfect, but seek for the little extra?<br><br>No weird extreme fetish/tantric shit, those won't fly at one-night stands.<br><br> inb4 fag &gt;inb4 reddit &gt;inb4 Chad &gt;inb4 small dick </br></br></br></br>  Have a big dick  <br>If you're trying to truly blow minds, it all depends on the girl m8. Every girl wants something a little different. Some like it hard and deep, others want more clit. Just depends.</br>  Tantric shit ain't weird. Kama Sutra is basically a tantric art.  Pin her arms over her head during missionary. Both of her wrists in one hand and use the other to support yourself. You are holding her wrosts firmly, but not crushing them.<br>Then lick/GENTLY bite/kiss her neck. If you did everything prior to this point properly she should be sensitive all over and the neck action, combined with you restraining her arms, will drive her insane.<br><br>When in doggie make sure that her back is arched downwards. Push it down by force if you have to. If you are taller than her, her knees go between yours. Vice versa. Pic related. She may be self-conscious, make it happen anyways.<br><br>When changing postions, slip in a confident "Good girl" or "There's a good girl" make sure that it doesn't sound like you are talking to a dog. Just a regular kinda cheeky "Good girl"</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh and I forgot.<br>Take it slowly at first. Then speed up a little. Then slow down. This will tease her into oblivion and make her beg for you to make her cum.</br></br>  <br><br>how to last more than 2 minutes, not OP, just curious</br></br>  Ask a guy whos had sex with 1000+ women anything.  <br><br>First question: why are you a liar?</br></br>  How to advanced sex:<br><br>  1. Fuck girl doggystyle  <br>  2. Spit on back of girl, make her think you cum <br>  3. She turn around, ask you if you cum <br>  4. Punch girl in face </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>When are you killing yourself</br>  <br>why are you a virgin?</br>  <br>when are you gonna get some pussy?</br>  oh please sauce on the op's webm  <br>see, this is the shit that doesn't help anybody.<br><br><br>This could be tho.<br><br><br>I have a big dick. Being circumzised in Norway is a pretty big deal, when it's thick and long aswell, taht get's you places. I've had girls who say shit like "omg the rumors were true". I'm great in bed. But I wanna become even better. See?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  When she is riding cowgirl, stick your arms by your side and grab her ankles. Then fuck away.<br><br>It's simple but you take total control so it's very dominate</br></br>  <br>Well. For starters don't jerk off as much. This doesn't have much to do with lasting longer, but it will be more pleasurable for you. A woman's vag will never have a tighter grip than your hand and cumming could be an issue for you sometimes. Cumming in 2 minutes is definitely better than not cumming after an hour.<br><br>Pacing is very important if you want to last longer. Pacing and some unreal self-control. When you alternate between slow and fast fucking take the time to recollect yourself. Like a 2 second breather. <br>The best tip I can give you, though, is not to focus too much on your dick. Just fuck.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Samantha Rone Casting Couch, pleb</br>  <br> Samantha Rone Casting Couch <br>Thank you kind sir</br></br>  <br>Well all of that already happened or I did, I was expecting son Ron Jeremy magical trick for the lols</br>  <br>Responding as if I believed you. <br><br> why? <br><br>You do know that sex with a fuckbuddy or gf is infinitely better than casual one night stands? <br><br>So by banging 1k girls, you've basically robbed yourself of like, 800 better fucks in your life,</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>you sound like a faggot who's talking to his gay twink lover.<br><br>OP, women respond to force and force alone. Once you're in the bedroom, start ordering her around. Tell HER where to lay and for the love of fuck don't utter the words 'That's a good girl' like you're rewarding a dog taking a piss outside. Fucking be assertive and tell her what to do.<br><br>Personally, I like to pin her hands down during doggie, push her back and butt to the bed so she is laying with only her ass up, then railing the fuck outta her while she cant really move. They cum faster when you restrain them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> not to focus too much on your dick. Just fuck. <br>This is best advice !</br></br>  <br>says the virgin, kek</br>  Not OP here, but I'm wondering how to use bondage with a girl, without the equipment. My current buddy loves bondage, but not the toys and accessories. How the hell do I do this?  How does it feel to know I have sex with more women in a week than anyone here will in their lifetime?  advanced sex tips? What the fuck? You put the penis inside of the vagina. It's not rocket surgery ya dumb faggot.  <br>Why downward arch? Does it feel better for her?</br>  <br>The Chinese fingertrap<br> be fucking, cow girl works well for this <br> stic a finger in her ass <br> let her stick a finger in your ass <br> fuck like rabbits <br> make big cums </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>perhaps you can tell us what makes you so insecure you need to lie to strangers?</br>  <br><br>Gr8 b8 m8.<br><br>You probably have had more sex than me. But that doesn't change the fact that you are a White trash loser.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This guy has a valid point. <br>The more you get to know each other the more you know what eachothers needs and wants are.</br></br>  I like telling my girlfriend when she's about to climax that Hitler did nothing wrong.

We felt good but it definitely wasn't the same thing even though it should have been.<br><br>Point being, you need activity going on to get the full experience.<br><br>Question: Is there any way to avoid the memory loss that's associated with ecstasy? It's a pity I hardly remember parties where I enjoy myself so much.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It sounds to me like it didnt hit you properly. Take double dose next time. Also go to a club.</br>  <br>Yeah mdma is a stimulant. MOVE motherfucker. Watching shit and cooking is gonna be lame.<br><br>Also how much did you take? Sounds like you didn't take enough.<br><br>Personally I like to walk and do stuff outside with friends. Though I did see how to train your dragon 2 while on 300mgs and it was pretty amazing.

The "epic" Banana guy, isn't it? I imagine you little shit laughing so hard as you click it that you drop your Doritos on the floor, but it's ok, your mother will clean it up in the morning. Oh, that's right. Did I fail to mention? You live with your mother. You are a fat fucking fuckup, she's probably so sick of you already. So sick of having to do everything for you all goddamn day, every day, for a grown man who spends all his time on 4chan posting about a fucking banana. Just imagine this. She had you, and then she thought you were gonna be a scientist or an astronaut or something grand, and then you became a NEET. A pathetic Bananafag NEET. She probably cries herself to sleep everyday thinking about how bad it is and how she wishes she could just disappear. She can't even try to talk with you because all you say is "I REALLY REALLY LIKE THIS PICTURE." You've become a parody of your own self. And that's all you are.

Let's settle this.  <br>it could be both real and a hoax, either way they won't get our guns so its a mute point, even is there is a daily spree killing nothing is gonna happen.</br>  L<br><br> mute point </br></br>  Jet fuel can't explain atheism.  <br><br>it's "moët".</br></br>  <br>Dammit we need answers not this.</br>  <br>Life, will figure it out.</br>  <br>Too many people are involved for info to not leak.</br>  <br>he ran in the woods, so it was totally fake, it was an excuse to bomb Yemen. there happy?</br>  <br>Well, there is so much more evidence proving it was a hoax. The only evidence to 'prove' it was real are news articles and the obviously faked news stories.<br><br>It doesn't make any sense, and it makes you think about the people who actually live in Sandy Hook, how they feal or how they reacted seeing people they've never met before come and get interviewed.<br><br>Makes less sense than Area 51, or the meaning of life.</br></br></br></br></br>  Was all a hoax    <br>Easy to to settle this.<br>People who think it's real post sauce backing it up<br>People who think it's not post sauce backing it up<br>Strongest sauced argument wins<br>Remember to ignore anything unsauced</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>I worked in the community next to sandy hook, newtown. I personally met too many people who knew a family involved to believe that is was bullshit. I personally can't believe that these families and friends were plants, nor can I believe any of the theories on what "actually happened". <br>It is very easy to not believe something didn't happen when you are no where near it. It is impossible to believe when you meet literally hundreds of people personally connected to it.</br></br>  <br><br>hoax. the school was empty<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ZJL<wbr>IqdFRHg0</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  i have no sauce, but I think about it this way, what would they gain by faking a mass shooting? You could argue gun control, NSA spying or something like that. But they already have total survellience, and they know the name of everyone who buys a gun already but shootings keep happening, so I think its real just because the establishment hasnt gained anything from it.  how can such a thing be hoaxed its impossible, unfortunately someone who was obviously mentally ill got access to guns and you know the rest, the real problem here is guns  <br>Let's do this, let the debate/argument begin</br>  <br>Yes, totally guns, no possible way that the issue is mental illness. Get rid of the guns and what's the next problem, knives? Swords? Propane? Gas? Largest US school attack was done with dynamite, not a gun.</br>  <br> how can such a thing be hoaxed its impossible, <br><br>run a drill, only a few know its a drill, get media involved &amp; offer misinformation to them, everyone believes the media<br><br><br> unfortunately someone who was obviously mentally ill got access to guns and you know the rest, the real problem here is guns <br><br>Ok, not the mentally ill person eh? So we blame an inanimate object. go fuck yourself.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br>implying it would be possible to do a massacre with knifes retard</br></br>  <br>Did you even read my post i said he was mentally ill and the problem was he was able to get access to guns, so in conclusion both guns and mental illness was the problem and nothing has been done about either</br>  <br>the largest massacre by a single person was done with a knife. retard.</br>  <br/>    There are entire towns lived in by communities of various operatives from various agencies.<br><br>To anyone outside it appears normal, bills, people going to jobs etc.<br><br>Once in a while one of these communities performs an exercise deemed as Apate, at this point all contact with agencies is lost and the community is committed to the act. It's not defined what that act is. This could be one.<br><br>These came after the MK Ultra thought control experiments when they realised it was easier to control its own population than a foreign entity but with potential to set up these communities elsewhere.<br><br>At last count there were 437 in approximately 20 countries, this also was not clear add they are not controlled by a countries government and often the country is not aware of this community except possibly a few people who may work for the government who are actually members of this organisation.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Muh gun control! </br></br>  http://www.bestgore.com/documentary<wbr>/we-need-to-talk-about-sandy-hook-w<wbr>atch-full-documentary-here/<br><br>watch the video in this link. its a bit long but afterwards you'll know sandy hook was an outrageous lie created to push gun control legislation through the senate.</br></br></wbr></wbr>  <br>I hope everyone you love is murdered in thier sleep. Half will be the fault of a mentally ill intruder, half will be thier fault for not having an impenetrable home.</br>  <br> Implying it would be hard to slaughter a whole class of elementary school kids with a machete. <br><br>Look at Africa, they kill thousands with machetes every time there is a "civil war".</br></br></br>  <br>the chinese knife attack you linked had multiple attackers.<br><br>On a related note, the same day of the sandy hook shooting a guy stabbed 20 people in a school in China. None of them died.</br></br></br>  <br>wut?</br>  <br>Cool story, care to offer up any evidence to validate your claim?</br>  <br><br>Have you ever considered that "doing something about guns" may, in fact, have a price of its own?<br><br>Depending on whether you believe the government, the NRA, or groups like MDA or MGSA there are between 30,000 and 1.2 million defensive firearm uses in the United States each year.<br><br>Restrictions on guns may prevent mass killings like this... but that may cause a far greater loss of life. The difference being that John Doe Workingman won't end up on CNN if he gets mugged and murdered in an alley.<br><br>Mass shooting are tragic, but they may be an acceptable price to pay for the protections firearms offer. The fact is that while they are very public and heart wrenching they account for a very small number of deaths per year, relative to virtually every other form of violent crime.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>would you say that shit to my face tho?</br>  <br><br>So did fucking columbine.</br></br>  Holy fuck what the fuck is so hard to believe some mentally ill kid shot up a school? People believe ANYTHING anymore. Give me ONE good reason why Sandy Hook would of been fake and DO NOT tell me gun control.  <br>Honestly at first I was suspicious and watched this, but if you Google Sandy Hook hoax debunked, you'll find that it's all bullshit.</br>  <br>There in NO need for having an armed civilian population why do you think we spend so much on the military, only cops and soldiers should have guns that would stop things like this from happening</br>  Is this a good message to her /b/? Help a bro out    what did you do OP?  <br><br>allright /b/ you have talked me around text me that and ill ask you out</br></br>  <br>Is being beta as fuck a thing now?</br>  Did you do your sister or something?  <br>Short summary: She lives in another country about 4 hours from me, we were scheduled to meet in late August, we are not together or anything, but we've talked about 2 years on the phone back and forth. She is very active on social media and I saw that she flirts with other guys on Twitter so I confronted her and went a little too far with my words, but I said in the beginning that I do not think it is the right time to flirt with other guys just before we meet, which was that we would stay at a hotel near her home town for a week. Ive never been to this country and cant cancel, if she chooses not to see me, I am in practice left all alone in a country I have never been to, and do not know the language or anything.</br>  <br>If you have cheated then this message will achieve nothing. She will still think that you are an untrustworthy piece of shit. Take a deep breath, harden the fuck up, and move on</br>  <br>Shit Anon you kinda got me in the feels there. I'm assuming you're possibly a Eurofag if you're able to just visit that easily. I would basically keep with what you got going in that message and hope for the best. <br><br>I only say that because I had a thing for a foreign exchange student that kinda was similar to your situation. I just fucked it up a different way.</br></br></br>  im waiting /b/ waiting for your text  <br>Yes i am an Eurofag actually, she went from saying "im done with this" to "idk about us" to "leave me alone for now", and all this happened today so I thought ill send that text tomorrow or something.</br>  <br>what a fucking bitch. not worth your time<br><br>girls are fucking stupid jeez</br></br></br>  <br> Click here <br>Did you rape her?<br>Did you vomit when she undressed?<br>Did you kick her dog?</br></br></br></br>  <br>you're not going to do it are you.</br>  <br>I am, I have nothing to lose, I dont really even care about having sex with her or stuff like that anymore, I just need someone to show me around there.</br>  <br>Havent done any of those</br>  <br>You're a huge beat and she knows it<br>She probably has been fucking with tons of guys while you keep talking to her by phone. Do you REALLY think he hasn't had sex in those 2 years?<br>You're a beta so keep going with this shit and let her flirt with other guys, who knows... maybe she will convince you to have a threesome when you get there? so you can assume your cuck status once for all.</br></br></br>  <br>if you don't care why dont you just leave it alone</br>  <br>So you're not together<br>and you care that she flirts with other guys<br> not together <br>anon, just send her a quick message saying "sorry, I went overboard, I know we're not together, but I care about you, and I got jealous. It won't happen again. Can I buy you a drink to make up for it?"<br>Your message pleads of desperation. Simply oozes it. You come across as such a beta, that if you sent that, and I were her, I'd roll my eyes and close it. Own up to your mistake quickly and precisely. Be an adult.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>*beta</br>  <br>Sounds like you kinda scared her off a bit. If she's really into you she'll take it as a sign that you care or whatever but if she's just curious about meeting with no big intention of hitting it off then you might have to cut your losses.</br>  <br>then you're fine. Just don't be such a beta on your message.</br>  <br>Or this OP especially if she drinks.</br>  <br>thats the right path my friend<br>stop caring so much. Silly females perceive that shit as confidence and you might end up fucking her anyways</br></br>  <br>Fuck, you're a faggot.<br>Stop posting this kind of shit on /b/</br></br>  <br>Have been talking on and off for two years, not two years straight, she has been fucking around and so have I, but not since we planned to acutally meet.</br>  ok /b/ what's the worst case of computer illiteracy you've had the displeasure of witnessing?  <br> mom on her phone <br> add says one new message!! <br> she clicks it </br></br></br>  <br>Ad*</br>  <br>Clicking submit/search/enter etc instead of hitting the enter key.<br><br>Using right click menus for easy keyboard shortcuts.
