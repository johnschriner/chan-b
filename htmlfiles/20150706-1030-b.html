See pic</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I hate everyone.<br><br>the answer is 2/3rds</br></br>  <br>No, you're not more likely to have one of them over the other. You just pulled a gold ball. Only two boxes have a gold ball in it. 100% of the time, your next ball has a 50/50 chance of being either gold or silver. I know you think that because one has two gold that it makes it more likely you have that box than the other, but that's not the way probabilities work.</br>  <br>50/50<br>cause you all ready know you didn't get the double silver box</br></br>  <br>I'm not stupid and this makes complete sense to me.</br>  <br><br><br>hur dur what are your odds of winning the lottery? well you either win or lose, thats 2 possibilities so 50%<br><br>DURRRRRRR</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>5/12</br>  <br>This nigga knows how to math.</br>  okay you guys lets do a thought experiment.<br><br><br>There are three boxes.<br><br>One box has 1 million gold balls.<br>One box has 999,999 silver balls and 1 gold ball<br>The Third box has a scorpion in it.<br><br>You reach into a random box and grab an object at random. It's a gold ball.<br><br>What are the odds that the next ball is golden? 50%?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  The answer is 50% anyone who says otherwise is stupid or trolling. The question is the probability of the next ball being gold after you already pull out a gold one. There are 2 boxes that it is possible to pull out a gold ball first and you picked at random. One will have a silver left, the other a gold. Therefore there is a 50% chance  <br>2/3 because 2/3 of the gold balls are in the box with 2 gold balls</br>  <br>odds of winning the lottery? 50% you either win or lose thats two possibilities~!~!</br>  <br> &gt;There are 2 boxes, but you're more likely to have 1 of them over the other. <br><br>/////////Nogga Whut?</br></br></br>  <br>see <br/></br>  <br><br><br><br><br> All of these people think the answer is 50% <br><br>Morons.<br><br>What's it like being shit at Math?<br><br>Answer = 2/3<br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertr<wbr>and%27s_box_paradox</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>but there is a 100% chance of pulling a gold ball out of the box with 2 gold balls and only 50% chance of pulling a gold ball out of the box that has a gold and silver ball</br>  <br><br>the fact that you randomly picked out a gold ball as your first ball means that you are TWICE as likely to have the all gold box.<br><br>2/3<br><br>See pic Related.

You are counting the possibility of the 2 golden coins being flipped as 2 separate possibilities, when they are the same thing. It doesn't matter which you pull first if they are both gold. So remove that factor from your little troll "proof" pictures and you get the real answer of 50%  <br>The most important thing in life is to not rage at stupids.<br><br>You are right, stay strong.</br></br></br>  that one was easy<br>now I want you to try and solve this one</br>  <br> see <br><br><br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertr<wbr>and%27s_box_paradox<br><br/></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  It's really not hard. The two silver one may as well not be in the picture because the picture said you already grabbed one gold. You have a 50% chance to grab a gold because out of the two boxes one will be gold remaining and one will be silver remaining.<br><br>If the question hadn't started you with already having picked a gold, it'd be different. You're picking from the same box remember.</br></br>    <br><br>You're wrong.<br><br>Answer = 2/3<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertr<wbr>and%27s_box_paradox</wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>^this</br>  <br><br>is wrong<br><br>Finished that sentence for you, anon.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>42/69</br></br>  <br>But there are 3 boxes here and the coins are pictured to be sitting there as they are. It would be 2/3 if there were 6 boxes or if you shook them up or something. It is 50%</br>  <br>No I stand by it. He is right</br>  how fucking dumb are you faggots? it's 2/3's  <br><br> mathematicians agree answer = 2/3 <br> HURR durr the answer is 50% HURR <br><br>Sure, anon. Read the article, you fucking pleb. The answer is 2/3<br><br>Simulation also shows 66.666....% = 2/3</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But you're wrong.<br>The picture says you grabbed a gold. If you grabbed a gold your next pick has two options, gold from the double gold box or silver from the one of each box. If the picture didn't have you already hold one gold it would be 2/3.<br><br>You have one of the two boxes picked, not one of the three. It's 50%<br>Even simpler is making the question this:<br><br>You have two boxes. One is gold and one is silver. 50%</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The following reasoning appears to give a probability of 1⁄2:<br><br> Originally, all three boxes were equally likely to be chosen. <br> The chosen box cannot be box SS. <br> So it must be box GG or GS. <br> The two remaining possibilities are equally likely. So the probability that the box is GG, and the other coin is also gold, is 1⁄2. <br><br>The flaw is in the last step. While those two cases were originally equally likely, the fact that you are certain to find a gold coin if you had chosen the GG box, but are only 50% sure of finding a gold coin if you had chosen the GS box, means they are no longer equally likely given that you have found a gold coin. Specifically:</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Actually, you're wrong and the answer is 2/3.<br><br>Answer this question.<br><br>You pick a random box from the same 3 boxes in the OP question.<br><br>What is the probability that the box you picked contains 2 balls of the same color?<br><br>Answer = 2/3. Read the link.<br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertr<wbr>and%27s_box_paradox</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Whilst your logic makes sense, it is incredibly high level math which makes you wrong, soz bro.</br>  <br>gyiuy</br>  <br>Simple math is a mind fuck, mate. I still don't believe that you should always switch in that other situation, but it's the same 2/3 shit.</br>  <br>ya now even you slow people don't have an excuse for not getting 2/3. We have pictures for you now</br>  lrn2math  <br>With these situations, you have to look at the situation from before you picked the first ball. At first, there's a 50% chance to pick either a gold or a silver ball. Having already picked up a gold ball, 33% of the original 3 boxes are now kill. From the remaining 2 boxes, 3 of the 4 balls are gold, so you have a 75% chance to grab gold ball 1, 2, or 3. Gold balls 1 and 2 are in the first box, while gold ball 3 is in the second box. Since you picked up a gold ball first, silver ball 1 is irrelevant at that point. If you picked up gold ball 1 in the first drawing, then you'll pick up gold ball 2 in the second. If you picked up gold 2 first, you'll grab gold 1. If you grabbed gold 3, then you'll grab silver 1. Those are the only 3 possible outcomes, and 2 of them result in picking up another gold ball.</br>  <br>did you do this? which program did you use <br>to write the code?</br></br>    <br>Except that you're looking at what ball you picked, not which box. out of 4 possibilities (gold [1,2,3], and silver[1]) for the first draw, one has already been declared impossible, so we're down to 3 possible outcomes. Gold 1 and Gold 2 are in box one, while gold 3 is with silver 1 in box 2. You picked one of the three gold balls, that is, 1, 2, or 3. The outcomes of those three possibilities is that you then pick out gold 2, gold 1, or silver 1.</br>  <br>This picture gave me 2/3 of a cancer.</br>  <br>Except that you could've picked out gold 1 or gold 2 from the upper box. see, computers are exceptional at doing the exact same thing thousands of times and calculating probability. It's 2/3, both from theory and from practice.</br>  <br><br><br><br>the debate is settled.</br></br></br></br>  It's one half.<br><br>Let's break this down. You picked one ball out of the box, and it's gold. There is now one ball in the box. There are two possible outcomes in which the first ball is gold, and one possible outcome where both balls will be gold. One out of two. One half.<br><br>Jesus Christ it's like you people have never actually moved an object in the real world or something. I think I'm gonna go outside.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Written in C using gedit text editor.<br><br>Compiled using gcc compiler and run from linux terminal, buddy.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  1/2 cmon guys  <br>except that every gold ball is unique. You can pick out gold ball 2 instead of gold ball 1 in the first draw, and then pick out gold 1 in the second.</br>  <br>Why do they have to be numbered? You picked a gold already.<br><br>If the question was "What are your chances of picking two golds in a row?" then it's 2/3.<br>It told you you picked a gold and now you're trying for another gold. You picked #1 or #2 for the double gold box, doesn't matter because you start out with one.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're implying that you put the ball back in the box after drawing it. OP does not say this happens, and therefore it should be expected that you can't pick the same ball twice because the ball is now outside of the box. You can't pick Gold ball #1 two times.</br>  <br> You're implying that you put the ball back in the box after drawing it. <br><br>No he isn't implying that at all.<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertr<wbr>and%27s_box_paradox<br><br>Answer = 2/3. Read the article</br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>I am certainly not implying that. If you could draw the same ball twice, it'd be 4/5, because the possibilites would be g1/g1, g1/g2, g2/g1,and g3/s1. <br><br><br>They have to be numbered, because otherwise most people ignore the possibility of having grabbed the right ball instead of the left.</br></br></br></br>  http://jsfiddle.net/4nGU5/<br><br>here you go. you can change the numbers in the text boxes to test different scenarios.</br></br>  50/50  I first thought I should stick with 50%, but I realized we just picked one of six balls. Since there are three balls of each color sorted into a pair for each box, that leaves us with two balls of one color (gold in this scenario) and three of the other (silver in this scenario). The only thing we're sure of in this scenario are that we did not pick a silver ball, and that our box has/had at least one gold ball in it.<br>So, my new answer is 33.334%</br>  9/11ths  <br><br>2/5<br><br>40% chance</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> realizes he's wrong <br> still gets the answer wrong <br><br>Jesus Christ, anon.<br><br>Have you read any of teh solutions/explanations in this thread?<br><br>Answer is 2/3</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hur Durr there are millions of different combinations of numbers for a lottery ticket and there's three boxes... can't compare</br>  <br> there are millions of different combinations of numbers for a lottery ticket and there's three boxes... can't compare <br><br>Why can't you compare?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Allow me to explain.<br><br>There are 3 EQUALLY probable ways to draw a gold ball as the first random ball. 2 out of these 3 ways results in a 2nd gold ball being drawn.<br> <br>The 3 ways are as follows:<br><br>1. (Box1) Draw Gold ball 1. Next ball out is Gold ball 2.<br><br>2. (Box1) Draw Gold ball 2. Next ball out is Gold ball 1.<br><br>3. (Box2) Draw Gold ball 3. Next ball out is a Silver ball.<br><br>Answer = 2/3</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  This guy is right<br><br>This moron is wrong<br><br><br>Because the question explicitly requests the probability of the next ball *from that box*.<br>This means any balls removed previously or in between whenever the first draw to get a gold ball happens, and the second draw *of that same box* happens, are not considered or relevant for the requested probability.<br><br>2/3 would be the answer to a question formulated differently, as per Bertrand's.<br>Since the question OP placed is, with the first draw already a given, what the odds are for the second draw from the box in question (which is determined at the start of the question already, even though you don't know which specifically) it is irrelevant what the probability WAS that it was Box 1 or Box 2. This will not factor into the probability requested, and that event has occurred already and is not factored into calculating the remaining probability. Ever.<br><br>If the OP's was an attempt at Bertrand's ,it failed. The answer here is 50%.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>If i said the probability of winning the lottery was 2/3 that wouldn't make sense either. Which happens to be the answer, so obviously that doesn't line up</br>  <br>Holy shit fucktard, way to miss the point.</br>  <br>Box A has two gold<br>Box B has one gold<br>Box C has zero gold<br> <br>P(second gold) = 1 for A; 0.5 for B; 0 for C <br>1.5/3= 0.5. <br>QED <br>Find a flaw.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>P(picking a gold ball|having picked a 2 gold box)=100%<br>P(2GB|having picked a gold ball)=?<br>hint its not 50%</br></br></br>  <br><br>You take the coin/ball from the SAME box in Bertrand's problem too. Read the article, you fucking idiot.<br><br>Her's a quote:<br><br> After choosing a box at random and withdrawing one coin at random, if that happens to be a gold coin, it may seem that the probability that the remaining coin is gold is 1⁄2; in fact, the probability is actually 2⁄3 <br> remaining coin <br><br>Answer = 2/3<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertr<wbr>and%27s_box_paradox</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But you already pulled a gold ball out retard. That makes it 100% if you picked the gold box and 0% if you picked the mixed box. It's fifty percent. You're all retarded niggers</br>  <br>Yes. 50%</br>  <br><br>Do you not see how retarded the logic is.<br><br> Next ball out is either gold or silver, therefore 50% <br> You either win the lottery or you don't, therefore 50% <br><br>There are 2 outcomes possible in both of the above cases. <br><br>The outcomes are NOT EQUALLY likely is the point being made.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  choosing a second golden ball can only happen if you chose the 2 gold box. if you chose the 2 gold box you will get a second gold ball. getting a second golden ball&lt;=&gt;having chosen a golden box<br>if the first ball you chose is gold what the probability is came from a 2 gold box</br>  I'm 100% hetero faggots. I don't choose balls.  <br>I was instinctively disregarding events happening before the specific point in the question the probability is asked for (retrieving the second ball) but upon more careful examination of the enunciation, 2/3rds is indeed correct.<br><br>This man is right, and I recant my previous my previous statement.<br>The first ball drawn determines which box you are working with, but at the time of making the 'call' for the second draw, your probability does indeed factor your unknown first choice retroactively.<br><br>Thanks for the elucidation.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the balls choose you faggot</br>  <br>42%</br>  <br>Most of you are looking 2 deep.<br>50/50 is my answer.<br>2 boxes have gold balls, you know its either the box with 2 gold balls or the box with 1 gold 1 silver therefore the chance of the next ball being gold is 50/50 defending which one of the two it is.</br></br></br>  <br>it wouldn't be 2/3 because if you already picked a gold ball then it's impossible that you have your hand in the box with the 2 gray balls.<br><br>The answer is 1/2 or 50%.</br></br></br>  <br>That's not the point I took issue with, you fuckless idiot.<br>But yes, the answer is 2/3 like you said, that's the correct interpretation of the problem described.</br></br>  1 in 2<br><br> Original chance of 1 in 3 <br> finding gold ball rules out possibility of box 3 </br></br></br>  50/50. you pulled the all-silver balled box out of the equation in your description.  <br> it wouldn't be 2/3 because if you already picked a gold ball then it's impossible that you have your hand in the box with the 2 gray balls. <br><br>It's 2/3 because there are 2 WAYS to draw a gold ball as your first ball from the All gold box and just 1 WAY to draw a gold ball as your first ball from the gold/silver box. We are IGNORING the all silver box as we know it can't possibly be the box we chose.<br><br>Answer is 2/3<br><br>Fucking hell, anons, learn2math</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> thought the answer was 50% <br> calls anons explaining the correct answer of 2/3 "idiots" <br><br>top kek</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You are twice as likely to have box 1 as you are to having box 2.<br><br>Answer = 2/3</br></br></br></br>  <br>Let me help you by referring you to <br><br>Imagine you can win a million dollars if you can draw two gold balls in a row.<br>The setup is as described, and you are blindfolded.<br><br>You feel your way up to one of the three boxes, and take a ball.<br><br>In your very first pick, you luckily draw a gold ball. Good! You have a chance at the prize if the next is also gold.<br><br>Do you draw it from the same box, or do you draw it from a different one? That's the question now.<br><br>You know the box you drew from is not the silver only box, but the question is whether there are any more gold balls in it..or if you just took the one gold ball that was in the 7:1 box.<br><br>So yes, those are the two boxes you might have just taken a ball from.<br>But surely you agree that it is incredibly unlikely that out of the three boxes, you went in the one with mixed balls, and happened to take the 1 gold ball in there amidst all the others.<br><br>It is most likely, if you drew a gold ball from a box, that the box you are in now is the gold balls box. So the best bet is to take a new ball from the same box.<br><br>In the OP's example, the difference in probability isn't as extreme..but taking a new ball from the same box is still your best bet. By a 2:1 chance.<br><br>So yes, the answer is 2/3s as the other anons explained, not 50%, as we thought.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>they are absolutely equally likely because as of the time the question is being asked you only have 2 boxes that you might have your hand in. The third one is completely out of the question now.<br><br>The question is stated AFTER the fact that you have already gotten 1 gold ball. meaning the next one is either going to be a silver ball or a gold ball. the probability of the result is NOT the same as when you drew the first ball. regardless of whether you picked a gold ball from the box with 2 gold balls in it because you had the same chance to pick the box with 1 gold and 1 silver.</br></br></br>  <br>Pretty much.</br>  <br><br>Good explanation and thought exercise to show how 50% is not correct.</br></br>  <br> We are IGNORING the all silver box as we know it can't possibly be the box we chose. <br><br>Exactly! which means you now have 2 fucking results. With the information stated by the question there are ONLY 2 results. and they ARE EQUAL because each box only has 2 balls in them and which ever one you have your hand in, you've already taken 1 ball out. That means you'll either get only the silver ball or only the gold ball</br></br></br>  <br>good explanation.</br>  <br>But in the question OP asked, you have to take a ball from the SAME box you got your first gold ball from.</br>  Probability is number of cases favorable divided by cases possible.<br>There's 1 favorable case in which we get a gold ball.<br>There's 2 possible cases, a gold ball or silver ball.<br>Favorable/Possible=1/2</br></br></br>  <br> they are absolutely equally likely because as of the time the question is being asked you only have 2 boxes that you might have your hand in. <br><br>The question is asked after you have randomly picked a gold ball from the box.<br><br>The very fact that you have randomly picked a gold ball from the box means that you are TWICE AS LIKELY to have the box with the 2 gold balls.<br><br> The question is stated AFTER the fact that you have already gotten 1 gold ball. <br><br>Exactly<br><br> meaning the next one is either going to be a silver ball or a gold ball. <br><br>Exactly true, yes<br><br> the probability of the result is NOT the same as when you drew the first ball. <br><br>Not the same BEFORE you drew the first ball.<br><br>Allow me to break it down for you again.<br><br>There are 3 EQUALLY probable ways to draw a gold ball as the first random ball. 2 out of these 3 ways results in a 2nd gold ball being drawn.<br><br>The 3 ways are as follows:<br><br>1. (Box1) Draw Gold ball 1. Next ball out is Gold ball 2.<br><br>2. (Box1) Draw Gold ball 2. Next ball out is Gold ball 1.<br><br>3. (Box2) Draw Gold ball 3.

The answer is 2/3.</br></br></br>  <br>you're missing the point.</br>  <br> Exactly! which means you now have 2 fucking results. <br><br>No. There are 3 results where you can draw a gold ball as your first ball:<br><br>The 3 ways are as follows:<br><br>1.

The answer is 1/2.<br>Since the first coin you pull out of the box happens to be gold, you had to have chosen one of the boxes with at least 1 gold coin. Therefore second coin the the boxes is either a silver, or gold coin.</br>  <br><br>I'm going to demonstrate how you are wrong, but I'd like you to figure it out for yourself by answering the question in this picture.</br></br>  <br>it's not 50/50. You can think of it like this: since you have pulled out a gold ball, it is MORE LIKELY that you have the box with both balls, BECAUSE THAT WOULD GIVE YOU 2X THE CHANCE OF PULLING A GOLD BALL IN THE FIRST PLACE.</br>  <br>thank you</br>  <br>Why does it matter which numbered gold ball that is picked? In OP's picture it's only asked for another gold ball. Which would mean it's a 50% chance. You pick either A gold ball from the first box or the gold ball from the second.<br><br><br>Calling me stupid doesn't make you right.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>2 gold balls 3 silver balls = 100%<br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;3  silver = 60%<br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;2  gold = 40% <br>the probability of a gold ball is 40%?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> hahahaha I fucking love these threads, people are so sure of themselves. <br><br>I know. It's crazy. Even when they are presented with solutions, explanations, and licks to the Bertrand Box problem, they still believe the answer is 50%.

You seem to be thinking about this backwards, and most people in here are simplifying out a key detail without realizing it. <br><br><br>this post should clear it up for everyone, the remaining people who still say it is 50% are trolls because it would be impossible to figure out how to post on the internet and still be stupid enough not get it at this point.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>20/21</br></br>  <br>you can still do the math and get an answer for this, and it still won't be 50%. I'm not sure what point you are trying to make here.</br>  <br> Why does it matter which numbered gold ball that is picked? <br><br>Numbering the balls was simply to illustrate to retards that there are 2 EQUALLY PROBABLE but DIFFERENT ways to extract 2 gold balls from the box with 2 gold balls.<br><br>I'm not going to call you stupid. I'm going to try to explain the answer.<br><br>There are 3 results where you can draw a gold ball as your first ball:<br><br>The 3 ways are as follows:<br><br>1. (Box1) Draw Gold ball 1. Next ball out is Gold ball 2.<br><br>2. (Box1) Draw Gold ball 2. Next ball out is Gold ball 1.<br><br>3. (Box2) Draw Gold ball 3. Next ball out is a Silver ball.<br><br>Answer = 2/3<br><br>If you're still having difficulty understanding the answer, refer to this:<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertr<wbr>and%27s_box_paradox</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>of course it wont be 50% because the number of balls in the second box isn't equally silver and gold like it is in the OP's problem.<br><br>i'm trying to illustrate how misleading it is to do so.<br><br>Suppose there is a box with 20 gold balls and a box with 10 gold and silver.<br><br>thats more analogous. surprise. it ends up being 50% too.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>38/39</br></br>  ITT: People who don't understand that previous events don't affect future probability.<br><br>If I flip a quarter and it is heads, what is the probability that the next flip is heads?<br><br>If you go to casino roulette table and the wheel has landed on black 10 times in a row, what is the probability it will land on black the next time?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Wrong.<br>Since you chose a box that contains a gold ball, you know you didn't choose the box with 2 silver balls, so we can take that box out of the equation. That leaves 2 boxes left.</br></br>  <br>these aren't independent events, as has been explained repeatedly, the fact that you have a gold ball makes it twice as likely that you are in box 1 to start with. The coin flipping thing has nothing to do with it. <br><br>Think about it like this, 3 boxes, containing balls AB/CD/EF, you pick one and it is one of ABC; what are the chances that the next one you pick is either A or B? that is literally the question in the OP, restated in a different way.<br><br>HOLY SHIT PEOPLE ARE BUSTING OUT BITS AND PIECES OF FIRST YEAR HIGHSCHOOL PROBABILITY AND STILL JUST BEING COMPLETELY FUCKING WRONG <br><br>I love this thread, it's just awesome.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>thank this nigga, u faggots.he is right</br>  <br><br> doesn't know what conditional probability is <br> thinks he's making a valid point </br></br></br>  I don't want to live on this planet anymore...  <br>since you chose a box with a gold ball, you know it is twice as likely box 1 as box 2. You can therefore weigh the probabilities from that point on accordingly.

Chances of getting one over the other is 50% since it's random  <br>I support this, but it's apparently wrong.</br>  <br><br>5/7 the next ball is gold/. Am I right?</br></br>  <br>Nvm. Am stupid. It is 2/3rds</br>  <br> 50% because if you've bought a lottery ticket you know it's either a winning ticket or it isn't. 2 outcomes. Chances of getting one over the other is 50% since it's random <br><br>^^^^THIS is how retarded your logic is, anon.</br></br></br>  <br>It's 1/2. Either it was the box with 2 gold balls or the box with one gold ball and you just took it. Two just as probable cases = 1/2</br>  <br> one over the other is 50% since it's random <br><br>negative. It is 2/3rds because at this point we have additional information! We have a gold ball, which is TWICE AS LIKELY WITH BOX ONE! which means it is twice as likely that the next ball is gold! 2/3! <br><br>my head is going to explode pretty soon. If one of you math wizards wants to explain to me why having twice as many gold balls doesn't make it twice as likely to pick a gold ball from a box, I'll listen. But I warn you, this is very simple math and there's really not a lot of room to argue here.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's 1/2. You must bread the question properly.</br>  <br>Learn to Bayesian faggot</br>  <br>no</br>  Having picked one gold ball from one of the boxes. The chances for the next balled picked is gold as well is:<br>Box 1: One gold ball remaining, therefore 100%<br>Box 2: One silver ball remaining, therefore 0%<br><br>(100% + 0%) : 2 = 50%<br><br>This is how I think.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Did you even read some of the answers before posting?</br></br>  <br>50/50</br>  <br><br>What's the answer then? Also, give solution/explanation.</br></br>  <br>0.5</br>  <br>The answer is 7/9. Just use conditional probability.<br><br>P(B|A) = P(AB) / P(A)<br><br>A = first pick is gold<br>B = second pick is gold<br><br>P(A) = (1/3)*1 + (1/3)*0.5 + (1/3)*0 = 1/2<br>P(B) = (1/3)*1 + (1/3)*(2/12) + (1/3)*0 = 14/36<br>P(AB) = 14/36 (since dependent)<br><br>P(B|A) = (14/36) / (1/2)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Yeah once you are left with those two boxes and 1st ball gone there are three balls left two are gold one is silver and since by default each box had at least one gold ball but not equal number gold balls it cannot be 50%  I put my balls in a box. What is the probability that you will grab my balls from the box?<br><br>Well, /b/?</br></br>  <br>Kek</br>  <br>Not only will I grab them, I would suck and lick them as if my life depended on it.</br>  <br>I can't believe there are still retards here who think it's 50/50.<br>Seriously, look up the monty hall problem.</br></br>  <br>Sigh, no you fucking idiot, because we have more knowledge.</br>  <br> look up the monty hall problem <br><br>You can't change the box you pick the balls out of.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Explain this part<br> P(B) = (1/3)*1 + (1/3)*(2/12) + (1/3)*0 = 14/36 <br><br>Especially where you got 2/12 from</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Doesn't fucking matter, I mentioned monty hall to show how even if there are 2 of something, that that doesn't mean both are as equal.<br><br>Monty hall works because we have the knowledge that there are TWO scenarios that put the prize behind the other door.<br><br>This problem is 2/3 because we KNOW that there are 2 scenarios where we pick a gold ball from the box with 2 gold balls, while there is only 1 scenario where we pick the gold ball from the box with just one gold ball.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>HICKS HICKS HICKS, listen here:<br>"next ball you take from the ****SAME BOX**** will also be gold" <br><br>We have 4 balls 3 gold and 1 silver<br>1 gold is taken out<br>3 left <br>2 gold and 1 silver<br>2/3 chance you get da gold 1/3 you get silver<br>66.666666667%</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Trick question the scorpion has gold balls</br>  <br>40% <br>Reasoning - 5 balls left - 60% are silver, 40% are gold - the 3 boxes don't matter, only the color of the remaining balls.</br></br>  <br>Yeah but the chances you draw a gold ball out of the one with the silver ball is 50% and the chances you draw out of all gold is 100. The chances are better that you drew out of all gold. Just because the problem says you've already drawn a fold ball doesn't mean this aspect doesn't matter. It is more likely that gold ball came from the all gold box</br>  <br>Please refer to -&gt; <br>the boxes do matter.</br></br>  <br>But we do not know if the box we chose has the other gold ball or not. The next ball picked would either be a gold one or a silver one. Right?</br>  I've been convinced it is 2/3. Someone on an internet forum has changed their mind.<br><br>If you have a gold ball there are 3 left, 2 gold, one silver, and of those you have no knowledge of where they are.</br></br>  <br>There are 12 possible combinations of two to choose from. Out of those 12, two are both gold.<br><br>G1, G2, S1, S2<br>total combinations:<br>G1-G2, G1-S1, G1-S2<br>G2-G1, G2-S1, G2-S2<br>S1-G1, S1-G2, S1-S1<br>S2-G1, S2-G2, S2-S1</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No actually they don't. You're confusing the probability of the contents of the boxes with the chances of getting a gold ball on the next pull. <br>The chance is 40% because that is how many remaining gold balls there are.</br></br>  I feel sorry for the people who think the answer is 1/2. Luckily evolution will soon wipe out people with your level of intelligence.<br><br>I feel especially sorry for the people who think its a half and mention the monti hall problem.
