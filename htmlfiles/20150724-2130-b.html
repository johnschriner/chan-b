One Ferrari for every white man and one deportation for every beaner!<br> Trump 2016 </br></br>  <br>Good point..<br>It might also be sabotage because it would be a certain victory for Hillary if she goes against him. Every god damn minority is gonna raise hell in the polls against him</br></br>  <br>The same reason they supported Palin: Republicans are Real 'Murricans.</br>  <br>I'm from Europe, please, americans, let Trump become your president. This is just too fucking funny to become reality.</br>  People like Trump because he doesn't go in for a lot of the traditional political newspeak BS. He says what he thinks and gives zero fucks. He is also, ironically, one of the few GOP candidates who doesn't appear to be in the pocket of big business.  <br>But they can't possibly be this stupid. Trump has no real chance to get elected. At least walker or bush have a shot with Rubio as the VP to get Hispanic voters, but god damn the GOP is gonna shoot itself in the foot back to 2008 if they nominate trump</br>  <br>He IS big business you dipshit.</br>  <br>I believe most of America would be fine with that.</br>  <br>Exactly. He's so fucking rich none of the corporations can buy him off.</br>  <br>Sure he gives zero fucks, but as  said, he is what is wrong this country. He's gonna either bankrupt us to Niger levels or he's gonna let anyone who makes less that 100k a year die</br>  <br>at least trump will try to run the gubment like a for profit entity. i said try.</br>  <br>They elected Dubya twice and almost put Sarah Palin 2nd in line to the Presidency, of course they're stupid enough to do this!</br>  <br>Id rather see him over Jeb.Bush for the republicans.</br>  <br>But I dont wanna vote for Hillary :-(</br>  <br> America is gonna have to decide between Hillary Cunt or Trump?! <br> implying Sanders isn't going to beat Hillary </br></br>  Thumb for peresitent 2016  <br>Idk I think bush is moderate enough to be ok. He isn't like W</br>  <br>No, he can just use the office to further enrich himself. Don't be stupid. The wealth gap in this country is greater than it's ever been, the wealthiest few have more wealth than the overwhelming majority, and you want to elect a BILLIONAIRE?!</br>  <br>Sanders is 2016's Ron Paul. <br>He resonates well with the youth and the Internet but old farts won't vote for him</br></br>  <br>Trump is early election pomp &amp; circumstance.<br>He's not the candidate. Bush is.</br></br>  <br> dreams </br>  <br>If he were to get the nomination you cant tell me that he wont be getting advice from W once he gets in. That if he does.</br>  <br>Yeah because Obama did such a killer job closing the wealth gap</br>  TRUMP 2016!<br>TRUMP<br>TRUMP<br>TRUMP<br>TRUMP<br><br>LET THE TRUMPETS BLOW!</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So don't. Vote 3rd party instead.</br>  I gotta be honest nothing is more funny than americans talking about the election like they have a real democracy  <br>Who cares? There's no difference between any of them. They're all neo-liberal shills for the twenty sociopathic families who comprise the billionaire corporate elite who rule this planet.<br><br>"I have this feeling that whoever is elected president, like Clinton was, no matter what you promise on the campaign trail -– blah, blah, blah -– when you win, you go into this smoke-filled room with the twelve industrialist capitalist scum-fucks who got you in there. And you’re in this smoky room, and this little film screen comes down, and a big guy with a cigar goes, 'Roll the film.' And it’s a shot of the Kennedy assassination from an angle you’ve never seen before, that looks suspiciously like it’s from the grassy knoll. And then the screen goes up and the lights come up, and they go to the new president, 'Any questions?'" -- Bill Hicks</br></br></br>  <br>I'm sure that would apply to all republican candidates</br>  <br>Trumpets here we go?</br>  <br>May as not even bother in that case.</br>  <br><br>Actually his claim that he's worth billions is false. In real life, his net worth is like 150 million.</br></br>  <br>It's between Hillary's cunt, the socialist kike from Vermont, or Trump<br>I've been to vegas and saw the trump hotel, if he runs the country like his resort then he's got my vote</br></br>  <br>I'm not gonna waste my vote on the 3% of the popular vote that might very well skew either trump's or cunt's % to win</br>    <br>Trump is leading because everyone knows it doesn't really matter in this early stage and we want to see more Trump before the end<br><br>don't worry about him getting the nomination, he's not even really interested in the presidency, it's a publicity stunt</br></br></br>  <br>True.</br>  <br>Point. Trump is an asshole but the people crying "He rich he gonna bankrupt errybody!" are retards. Every candidate on both sides is rich as fuck and has mega interests in the corporations. At least Trump knows how to manage wealth and grow an economy.</br>  <br>Your choice, man. For me, Bernie Sanders is the only candidate I actually want to vote for. Usually I vote for one person because the challenger is even worse, but Bernie I would happily vote for.</br>  <br>Wow, you americans are so fucking retarded.</br>  We need to be talking more about Ben Carson. <br> I had dinner with the man <br>I know it's hard to believe, but I did. He was campaigning in my area and a select few people had dinner with him. He's incredibly smart and has great plans for entitlement programs and healthcare. He should get elected. Plus, he's black so he will get some of the nigger vote</br></br>  <br> "I have this feeling that blah blah blah <br> sincerely, a pretty good comedian <br><br>k but you know there's not really a conspiracy and shadow government in a smoky room... right?</br></br></br></br>  <br>This is why the two parties continue to rule us.</br>  <br> manage wealth and grow an economy. <br>The president of the united states does not do this, other people do that and the president is blamed/praised by idiots like you for their performance</br></br>  <br>4 billion</br>  <br><br>Wonderful, when government is responsible for so many chargeable natural monopolies (roads, forests, defence, sanitation, water), I sure would love to see a private industry mindset applied there.

Yes. Shadow? No. It's all right there in the open. The Trilateral Commission. The Bilderberg Group. The Project for the New American Century. I mean, they don't even bother to hide it.

I'm from auckland but i should have known.<br><br><br>yeah you're sweet. Credit ratings only get fucked if you apply for heaps of shit at different places.<br>make sure you tell the bank you have a legit reason for the loan. If you're concerned you're broke we average out the last 3 months of your income/expenses, try lower your expenses for that 3 months.

Or just Auckland vs Wellington? <br>Wellington is much cosier, as is most of the country minus Christchurch city, although a guy I know reckoned he saw at least as many homeless people there as in Auckland, surprisingly enough. Chch is more or less a smaller Auckland I think. It's flat and earthquake damaged and I wouldn't recommend it unless a construction job is your thing. Auckland is congested, suburban, not very pretty architecturally, and full of Indians/Asians/Islanders. What kind of work are you planning on looking for BTW?</br></br>  <br> Nah why? <br>whole mudcake to yourself</br></br>    <br>I..

I want to see it before its inside you</br>  <br>Auckland is pretty shit, you need a car to do anything, it's pretty expensive to buy a house and shit.<br><br>Wellington is mint, really cool if you're a young and hipster. gets cold and during the holidays you can see all the homeless people.<br><br>Chch is pretty shit since quekes.<br><br><br>What's your weight/height? you look alright in that photo but i feel like you're arching, I'd bang you if you were naked on my bed.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>kek</br>  <br>Anon I....</br>  FRI NIGH MFERS  <br>would you be into "netflix and chill" with a lovable chubby guy</br>  <br>Oh.

So I've been seeing a lot of threads asking why you don't have several different guns for protection and a common answer was: "Cause I live in a country with strict gun laws". Y'all do realize that all gun laws do is make it easier for robbers? You can't own a gun, but criminals don't follow laws.<br> black market mayun <br>I'd rather enter a fight gun vs gun rather than kitchen knife vs gun. Just a thought.</br></br>  <br><br> you have easy access to guns - yet you still have crime... lots of it. <br><br>You're making the false assumption that I live in America.<br><br>You didn't answer the question.<br><br>Did you even know that gun crimes are down in America?<br><br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/630079923#p630087333">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not going to shoot some poor fucker running off with my lawnmower, your mentality is shit.</br>  <br>nigger we have moon bases obongo can get pluked by michael, his tranny wife.<br><br>That shit takes printing money and blowing up bitches who won't respect our petro dollar. <br><br>think of it like satan sodomizing the tight anus and eating the face off of your friend who didn't accept him as the new king. <br><br>Because it's more than kind of like that, it's exactly like that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  roll assholes  Rolos  roll  Rollin  to whosoever doesn't like kiddie porn: fuck you. Little girls doing adult things is SUPER HOT! I was on the tor network a while ago and there were lots of pictures and videos. There were creampies (ages ~1 to ~13), facials, there were little girls getting fucked in the ass, blowjobs, there were multiple guys fucking and nutting on one girl. The lbfmachines videos are very hot. Also the latina ones, where the pervs down in peru or whatever buttfuck country it is, the girl must have been 10 and she was getting fucked dp and bukkake'd all over her body by some other dudes! Wow! Anyway i see a lot of traps and faggotry here, you niggers need to get with the program. LITTLE UNDERAGE GIRLS DOING ADULT THINGS AND ADULT MEN DOING ADULT INAPPROPRIATE THINGS TO PREPUBESCENT GIRLS IS MINDBLOWING!
