Because who gives a shit about silver.  <br>No one cares about silver. It's not a useful metal for industry and it's not really valued as a luxury material.</br>  because it isn't the dark ages and "OOOOO SHINY" doesn't matter even a fraction of what it used to.<br>you need something shiny AND practical, like lithium or crude oil. get with the times.</br>  <br>What are you, some kind of plebeian faggot?<br><br>https://www.silverinstitute.org/sit<wbr>e/silver-in-technol</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>It's very useful industrially.<br><br><br>Not far off, Goldman Sachs is the culprit I believe.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Silver is a really good conductor... don't you know? Since you're with the times and all...</br>  Silver is presently $15.87 per ounce.<br><br>USGS claims Silver to become first metal to become EXTINCT on the Periodic Table by 2020. Which would put it at $10,000.00 per ounce in the first few days alone, if it hits scarcity.</br></br>  <br>silver is the nigger of the precious metals.<br>it's everywhere and nobody gives a fuck about it.</br></br>  <br>Extinct? Silver can't just die, all the silver that started on this planet is still on the planet.</br>  <br> $10,000.00 per ounce in the first few days alone <br><br>seems legit. <br><br>I'll invest all my bitcoins in it</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Have you been living under a rock? Scientists found out last year you can't recycle silver, it's chemical compound changes once it merges with any other material... It's basically useless and we're using it for jewelry...</br>  <br>RIP Silver</br>  for the first 25 years of my life silver was under 6.00/oz...it is now 15/oz. buy a motorcycle  <br>Brother people think diamonds are rare, but the jews keep holding stockpiles of the stuff. It's as valuable as sand really.<br>Silver is the same.</br></br>  Gold has 33 primary uses whist being the perfect investment metal (rare, non-oxidizing and unreproducible).<br><br>Silver has over 32,000 uses and is being consumed at a rate of 16 to 1 (in relation to how much we can mine and how much we consume in 24 hours). All those new Flat Screen televisions, iPods, iPads and Mobile Phones and Solar Panels use enormous amounts of Silver. That's why China banned the sale of silver and is now the largest buyer. <br><br>Fun Fact: USA has no more silver Reserves.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Silver is used extensively in industry and tech you charlatan!</br>  Silver is just undervalued. It's like having a house in detroit right now. No one wants it. <br><br>Right now the market can do no wrong. It's where you make the most money, but when that flops and the bubble we are in pops, silver will be worth at least three times again.<br><br>When and how long that will take? No idea. But if it breaks 20 again, it's going to 45 easy.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Extinct? Silver can't just die, all the silver that started on this planet is still on the planet. <br><br>Actually, Silver is a Surface Metal. It's not found deep within the Earth's Crust. There are no new Silver Mines being discovered and many no longer produce enough mineral to make it viable to operate. Some scientists suggest that Silver might have been deposited on the Earth's Surface by asteroid impacts during the early formation of the Solar System. <br><br>The reason Gold is so rare is because it take the collision of TWO Neutron Stars in order to strip the electrons from Iron in order to form heavy metals such as Platinum Group Metals, Gold and Silver.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sauce?</br>  <br>Stop spaming /qa/ with your shits /b/ <br>GO FUCK YOUR SELF DOUCHEBAGS<br>I HATE YOU</br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>your fridge has silver inside of it right now, it kills bacteria</br>  <br> Silver is used extensively in industry and tech you charlatan! <br><br><br>It's also used in modern medicine. Some of the only cures used by modern hospitals involve the use of pure silver strips (just like foil) and the use of Colloidal Silver to treat medication-resistant bacteria. We can also create nanotech spheres with silver to allow certain medicines to be absorbed by the body.<br><br>Aside from being listed as one of the most important medicine applications known, Silver is an extremely conductive metal and it used for many other purposes in industry. It conducts both heat and electricity. Silver is also the best reflector of light known to man. It is used for Surgical implants to prevent rejection. It's used to make batteries, cameras, semi-conductors, printer inks, 3D printer inks, cloud seeding, washing machines (pioneered by Samsung and LG to pair with water and clean clothes from bacteria, Windows, car engine bearings, solver, Ice Making Machines, tinted lenses, personal deodorant, air-conditioning, radiology, surgical masks, door handles (to prevent bacteria transmission), circuit board contacts, speaker wires, RFID tags, CD roms, DVDs, BluRay disks, nuclear reactors, fuel cells... the list goes on.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>underrated post</br>  <br>No sauce, I just made that up</br>  <br>Because the bubble has burst. All those Ayn Rand fans who "invested" in precious metals during the banking crisis are now repenting at their leisure.<br><br>Why buy silver in the first place? It doesn't even yield.

Hey guys, just lemme finish up.  My girlfriend constantly going on about how she expected to be married with kids now and we're not.<br><br>Shes 26, I'm 27 and we've been together 5 years. What do /b/?<br><br>Pic related, it's her</br></br></br></br>  1. Post moar pics.<br>2. Then we'll talk.</br>  Marry her or dump her idk anon its not rocket science  I wanna see her child feeding tits  <br>look like some sexy feet<br><br>go marry her already</br></br></br>  <br><br>Nah man, too early. If you're doing good with her, just live happy, go traveling etc. <br>I'd think marriage not until 30 and after some living toghether. <br>You gotta make sure she isn't a massive whore or you're screwed for good after a kid is around.</br></br></br></br>  be fucking her raw ... look at that body!  <br>WE have bought a house together and I've spent a lot of time/money making it awesome. <br><br>I want to get married but in my own damn time. Getting married (the way she wants) is also fucking expensive. Fuck fuck.</br></br></br>  <br>I've been with mine for 8 years and we still haven't talked about that very seriously</br>  <br>I agree with you so much, 30 is a better age to start thinking about it, we won't get these years back,</br>  <br>Tell her you don't want to get married yet, not until you're in your 30's but if you feel comfortable doing it then perhaps propose to her and just remain engaged for a few years? Most girls want a sign of commitment and as long as it's a decent ring she should be down with that.</br>  <br>Man the fuck up dude. You've been dating for 5 years, at least get engaged.</br>  For some strange reason, most women take it extremely personal, if you don't want to marry them ASAP.. Their ego is just so weird...  <br>This. Do everything you ever wanted to do together before you take the parent plunge. Afterwards, your whole life will be dedicated to the children &amp; the things you wish you had done beforehand will haunt you until you're too old to properly enjoy them. <br><br>Source: Hit up Amsterdam before knocking up &amp; marrying my gf of 8 years. No regrets.</br></br></br>  Do what this genius says <br>https://<span>youtu.be/OIV0zSqaysU  [ ]</br>  <br>You're getting married, faggot. Just do it. Or don't, and dump her.</br>  Dont do it, OP. Marriage is a scam, it will never last forever and it will cost you a gajillion dollars.  <br>to early. clearly a kid that doesnt reliase how old his parent are compared to him. 80% of children and families are started before 25.</br>  <br>You need to talk to her about it. Figure out her wants and needs and compromise. A wedding doesn't need to be expensive, mine was dirt cheap even though we both make great money. At the end of the day we didn't want an a wedding at all, we only had one because our parents begged us to, rather than just go to Vegas. <br><br>There are a few things that need to be discussed. Does she actually want to be married or does she want a wedding. If she insists on a big expensive wedding, try to figure out why. It's probably just for show. Address the fact that that's a very poor investment and see if that's what she really wants. <br><br>She could just want a ring. Same conversation needs to happen. Does she want a ring so she can show the world that she's taken or so she can flash a rock. <br><br>If she really wants kids, that is what it is. In all honesty, if she really wants to be a mother and you don't want kids, you need to be a man and end it. You're wasting her very short time that she can have kids and that's a pretty shitty thing to do. Don't string a woman along during her fertal years. You're taking something that she can't get back. Besides, if you do break up you can go fuck madd bitches.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I donno man, couldn't be that expensive if you're that tight on money.<br><br>She would be happy enough that you even asked her marry you to understand you won't have a big wedding or anything. <br><br>Just do it man. There is literally nothing that can go wrong. You'll lose her if you don't.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>80% of poor people. That's why you need a younger woman. Go live your life, then settle down. Women don't really have that option. Once you're 40 find a girl in her late 20s who's starting to sweat her biological clock.</br>  <br>THIS.</br>  <br>I wish i could be so gullible and naive. Nothing can go wrong? Holy mother of gawd..</br>  I'm kinda on the same boat except I'm 23 my gf is 26. I also bought a house that we live in together. We've been together 3.5 years. However I imagine il be married with a kid or 2 by the time I'm 27. Don't make her wait too long but make sure you are 100% sure u want to be with her.   5 years <br><br>what the fuck did you expect, hurr i'm actually not committed to this relationship anymore durrr</br></br>  <br> I want to get married but in my own damn time. Getting married (the way she wants) is also fucking expensive. <br><br>instead of talking to unknown people, talk to her.</br></br></br>  <br>No faggot you see if he ignores any possibilities that could go wrong then he'll rush into it and make his girlfriend happy and he doesn't realise how he fucked up, if he did.<br><br>Man you're a fuckhead</br></br></br>  <br>Lets see her ass</br>  <br>dubs ... do it, OP</br>  <br>Indeed. 5 years is more than enough if you want to sign away your entire life out of pure stupidity.</br>  <br>post moar</br>  <br><br>Get her pregnant.<br><br>If she's fixated on marriage there are other reasons she's doing this. I suspect it rhymes with 'divorcing and fleecing you".</br></br></br></br>  <br>/thread</br>  Tell her to shut up, me and my girl been together 7 years I just proposed on February, getting married next July no kids yet either, no complaints from her  <br>Dafuq did i just read? Nigga yo post don't make no sense</br>  <br>Nah man you see I'm on acid atm</br>  <br>A) find a girl that won't bitch.<br>or<br>B) marry her and have kids<br><br> Now fuck off starting these faggoty posts, faglord </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Surprisingly prudent advice.<br><br>Also - is your issue with getting married, or with having kids? Even if you propose now, you aren't getting married until summer 2016, which leaves until 2017 to have kids even if she starts incubating right from the honeymoon.</br></br></br>  <br><br>It's a power thing. Once a woman's married she's got almost complete control over the man. At any point she can claim rape or that he molested the kids and it's a golden ticket to easy street.</br></br>  <br>this here is sensible advice.</br>   wants to kill dragons <br> wants to fuck dragons <br> i mean ride them  <br>  i mean dicks </br></br></br>  <br>Suddenly it all makes a wee bit more sense.</br>  <br>Because getting her pregnant to find ulterior motive will fix everything?</br>  Just keep posting your gf bro.  <br>Thanks fam</br>   Jesus Christ... <br><br>Listen, Marry the Bitch<br>Tell her now that you're both married you get to fuck her everyday for the rest of y'alls lives<br>Then STICK YOUR DICK IN ALL HER HOLES FOR THE NEXT 70 YEARS!<br><br>Fucking Noob..</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tell her you'll hve kids when youre both financialy self suficint and she learns how to whipe her own ass and doesnt mind not going out anymore because she has to help you watch the kids</br>  <br>I was in that situation exactly. We got married no kids yet though. Not sure if we even want them anymore.</br>  Marry her,the fact that you even got one girl on your dick is a surprise  <br>This. A woman doesn't have many years of exceptional fertility, so her clock must be ticking hard. My wife turns 29 next year so she's doing everything she can to get knocked up now. Even signing up to see a fertility doc.</br>  <br>Why does she want to marry kids?</br>  <br>takes 7 years to raise a kid or some shit evolutionarily we fall out of love after that 7 years required to raise a kid. marriage is a trap. don't ever marry. if u knock her up and u like her that much give the kid ur house (last) name. doesn't matter if ur married or not its law the parents can decide which last name is used. fuck marriage. again. repeat. marriage=trap. don't ever marry. like her/kid that much, give it last name. REALLY like it that much, raise it. but don't ever marry.</br>  If you think you'll stay with her quit being retarded and at least propose. That buys you a minimum year or two to plan and save for the wedding. Fucks sake dude.  Thanks for all the advice guys, it's appreciated.  <br>Oh god shes also one of those "i need an extravagant hollywood wedding where i cry and everyone cries for me because im so hot and im special"<br><br>Fuck that OP tell that bith marriage isnt about a party to you it a serius thing and if she gives you the bullshit " its tradition" excuse tell her then fine "traditionally" the brides parents pay for the wedding expensses" see how quickly she turns it around saying thats archaic and a stupid tradition. Honestly bro i've told all my long term girlfriends, i would never give her a diamond ring. My parents are jewelers and i know how worthless they are and stupid it is to spend money on the cheapest most hyped rock in the world. They all broke up with me within a month of knowing that. This ones stuck around for a year. Women are evil, teat them. There is no shame.<br><br><br>If worse comes to worst dump<br>Her and get a dog that little nigger will love you forever.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>don't marry expensive its wasted money OP<br>trust me that 20k I spent few years ago really hurt<br>and everything I got for the money are a few shitty photos, a gay film about my wedding what I never watched again and my wife which got fat now that shit isn't worth 20k</br></br></br>  stick it in her pooper, nothing else matters  <br>28 year old anon here, been dating a girl for 5 years myself. When I got my dream job and moved out of our home state, she moved alllll the way across the country to be with me, another whole time zone. <br><br>She's decently attractive, knows how to cook, doesn't mind cleaning and sucks a decent dick. We have never had an argument about anything, ever. people described us as the perfect couple. <br><br>I broke up with her last week. She moves out tomorrow morning. Do you want to know why anon....? Fucking pressure about marriage and kids. it's all I would hear about, from her, her friends, her parents, my parents.. everyone except ourselves and that got old. It got boring. She got boring. <br><br>So what I believe is.. we are young enough that it doesn't matter. She wants marriage and kids? Free her to find it. I might be being selfish, but personally there are too many things in my life that I want to do before I settle. I can tell that if I did do the whole.. settled down, white picket fence, kids and Labrador puppy stuff I'd have slowly been filled with regret from not living my life more fully. Was it sad in the beginning? Yes, but after you wrap you're head around the idea, most liberating thing I have ever done in my life. No regrets. <br><br>Just some food for thought. Best of luck to you</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  And yeah suggest eloping instead. Instead of wasting thousands on a wedding you don't care about, save up money for a vacation to someplace nice that does wedding services.  <br> &gt;leviathan b8 m8 r8 s8n/8 </br>  <br>Don't have fucking kids dude. You can be thankful watching your buddies go broke while their fat ugly wives sit around all day at home watching the little turds. Meanwhile you get do whatever you want whenever and keep all your money.</br>  <br> Getting married (the way she wants) is also fucking expensive <br><br>honestly, geting together with the kind of girl who still wants to have a big-ass, over-indulgent expensive wedding in the glorious future of 2015 was your first mistake.</br></br></br>  I'm a 27 yo kissless virgin<br><br>fugg</br></br>  <br> it costs a lot of money to raise retards - anon from /b/chan 2015 </br>  <br>Better be careful bro.

Several times. She said she wanted to wait, 5 years, 10 years, she said it didn't matter. <br><br>It sounded crazy and scared the shit out of me. 10 years of limbo, of basic coexistence before I'm expected to throw alllll my money into a lifestyle I may or may not believe in and turn off even the remote possibility of adventure and excitement solely because it's "the right thing to do" or "the expected thing to do" or, per many, because I "lucked out finding a wholesome girl". uhm. Yeah, pretty much fuck that.. I'll take my chances. As far as OP is concerned... high maintenance women are a nightmare, I don't know her obviously but the Disney Princess mentality really can't be good.. I feel for you though. its a ton of pressure.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>oh so this</br>  Wish I'd known all of this sooner. I wouldn't have fallen in love with a girl the same age. She wants kids at 27 (the magic number apparently).
