Then he would be actually doing some good in addition to achieving his goal.</br></br>  <br>Because Americans have a thing for shooting schools. They just can't help it.</br>  <br>It would be guaranteed to make the news</br>  Get plastic surgery to look like a nigger and have a cop kill you on cam  <br>"Witness Me"</br>  If you're gonna shoot a place up and then kill yourself, at least go somewhere you'd kill a lot of niggers, like a welfare line or something idk  <br>Go to a crowded area.

Wear a peace shirt and a combat boots with black cargo pants. Get an anarchist tattoo on your right Arm and wear a Hat saying "Politically Incorrect". Go on a shooting spree. Targeting only local malls, apple stores, starbucks, and chipotles. Any other place where niggers, faggots and hipsters hang out is also acceptable. Don't just go in shooting. Find a vantage point and go for as nigger, fag, hipster looking targets as you can. Parade through the streets going from one consumerist facility to the next. Don't just stay in one starbucks. Go to another one. Go for a high score and then when you're finally surrounded or caught put a bullet in your head or taunt the police to shoot you. Make sure to look them deep in the eye and ask them "Ever have one of those days?" Then go on and say "I regret nothing" and kill yourself or get killed by the cops.</br>  Shoot up a black school (itll be filled with nigs for summer classes) but blame it on science and then all the anons throughout the world can laugh as the american media goes on a campaign against science and it ushers in a new dark ages<br> top lulz </br>  <br>The fuck?

It's great for talking about your fetishes with like minded people but it's definitely not a dating site which some people make the mistake of assuming. Find a profile with a lot of fetishes and groups that seem relevant to your interests and start joining them to make friends on there.

A good night streaming can net us up to $500. Monetizing our xtube has been a bitch since most of the stuff we make at home is shitty cell phone footage, but it works as a good marketing vehicle, and the two of us tend to make around $100 an hour shooting stuff for Clips4sale producers, and a normal day is about 8 hours of shooting, but trustworthy producers who aren't sleazebags are few and far between so we don't do that TOO often. We even did a day of shooting for a dude with a shrinking fetish where my I had to sit down and jack off on a greenscreen pretending my girlfriend was about to step on me and we wound up getting this shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br>oh sweet a fellow fetlifer<br><br>/b/rofist.jpg</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm more of an observer anyway.

God, this website is golden tho. <br><br><br>Well why would it be bad if that's the thing that gets you off?

I don't have a 5th reason</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>1) for sexual plessure<br>2) to supress suicidal tendencies<br>3) releasing stress/anxiety<br><br>here's the 3 reasons I do it. Now give me 3 reasons why it's bad.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Same girl as earlier, she was anorexic. So I am sorry if it's offputting to you or anything</br>    <br>I mean in the eyes of a top who's into cutting, more blood = more fun, at least to my understanding, so go for it. Unless it's the kind of clotting issue that makes minor cuts life threatening, then I'd probably recommend against it.<br><br><br>It turns my girlfriend on when I talk, so at least when shooting stuff for free and for fun, I'm probably not going to stop because turning her on and getting her off is a higher priority than making sure I don't offend anyone's sensibilities when they aren't even paying for the content. And I live in the busted ass basement cus I was working part time and not making much money at the time, and my dad's busted ass basement was quite comfortably free. In the process of moving into a nice apartment together in the next week or two though.</br></br></br></br>   mfw this thread <br>How do u guys get off to seeing this?</br>  <br>he asked for 5 you nigger, but here's 2 more for you<br><br>4. fuck you<br><br>5. fuck you</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>do I sounds like a nut when I say that turns me on? I'm quite the women-friendly guy, but idk.</br>    <br>surface cuts are okay<br><br>don't have any real kinky shit on my page just a pic of my dick but I'm a switch. been a bottom lately.<br><br>how do you identify sexually? ( I'll guess straight or bi)</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is that her chin leaking over?</br>  <br>1) you risk horrible infection by compromising your first line of defense. it's also not good to have a constant inflammatory response going on<br><br>2) you're being a bitch if you can't deal with problems other than by cutting. you could be taking medication, deal with it through education, or see a therapist to attack the root problem instead of "hurrdurr gonna cut to make me feels better"<br><br>3) it's gross to people when they find out about it or see cutting scars. it's a red flag for anyone that might otherwise want to get clsoe to you</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>post the last 2 pix of row 3 for fucks sake</br>    <br>Devil's fuck, how does one stay conscious to take of photo of that? At some point, you can handle certain pain and images, but this fucking ridiculous.</br>    <br>I've been on meds and I've have cut myself in the past. Meds make you completely numb, you're no longer the person you were before you started using them.</br>    <br>I've had succesfull relationships in the past.<br>I've been seeing a psychiatrist for 6 months<br>I've concidered taking meds, but meds are for faggots</br></br></br>  <br>It's almost as bad as the guro fags. I have a morbid fascination with pain and the human body's limits but for research, not for pleasure.</br>      VAT IST POINT?  <br>I mean, I'm the Nicest™ guy you'll ever meet, I give her massages, take her on romantic dates, and spoil her with attention and affection. When it's time to fuck though, I choke her on the most gentle nights, and call her a disgusting slut while fucking her ass with a dildo in her pussy and making her beg to suck my cock clean after filling her with cum on a far more regular basis. Being into kinky shit does not make you non-woman friendly, and honestly most of the fucked up kinky things I do to her are at her request and she loves it. Just make sure it's consensual and you're fine.<br><br><br>Technically I think I'm pan since I CAN sexually attracted to both genders but it's very rare that I find a guy who's my type whereas a very good chunk of women are attractive to me.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Saying "Is this real life?" in one of the videos wasn't turning anyone on. You were joking around and you sounded retarded. I'm just telling you that you could probably attract more paying people if your sample stuff was a little different.<br><br>So was your gf living with you in your dad's basement? Sorry for being a dick about that comment--good for you that you're moving to a nice place together.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Jesus it's like a train wreck.....I want more</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I really don't care what turns who on, may it be beastiality, scat, loli, gore. Whatever floats your boat. My ex and I still occasionally trade pics of self harm, mine is pretty bad though, in the sense of it being shallow and im a male as well. If I could I would keep sending you these past the 404 of this thread but posting any way of contact on /b/ is sort of dumb. <br> my leg when I used to do that shit <br> inb4 pussy not going deeper </br></br></br>  <br>pan here boss, gender is of no importance to me. i've been arround the block a few time with multiple partners of all boys and girls.. hadn't met a real life tranny yet..</br>  <br>Your move.</br>  <br>Fuck replied to the wrong post<br><br>There</br></br></br>  <br>ah finally someone who's like me. I would never force myself upon a woman, I'm just into weird shit I guess.</br>  <br><br>Successful in that neither party died when they ended? I'm suspecting your bar for successful is pretty low. Cutting is even more for faggots. Sry but it true. Stop being a crybaby and start getting serious about getting better or just kill yourself.</br></br>  <br>If you're cutting yourself, wouldn't you want to be completely numb, and be a different person than you were before? fucking idiot. I much rather be someone different if it meant I not longer risk killing myself...but I have self confidence.</br>  <br>well succesful as in multiple 3 years+ relationships, occasional hookups, etc. I'm only 20, so that's quite succesful in my opinion.</br>  <br>No need to apologize, I'm not fooling myself into thinking it WASN'T a busted ass basement. Shit didn't even have outlets, I had a 50 foot extension cord from the fuse box to my "Room" and if you look closely you'll notice that one of my walls was literally just stacked cardboard boxes. If not for the girlfriend I'd be a caricature of the typical basement dwelling nerd. <br>As far as the "is this real life?" comment and other similarly dorky shit like that makes her happy, and one of the most common comments we get from people is "We love how silly and cute you are together, you have great chemistry." We've actually drawn in more regular viewers due to the fact that we do and say goofy dorky shit together in our videos instead of it just being a fuckfest fade to black like most amateurs on the market.<br><br><br>It's more common than you'd think, and there are tons of girls out there who love it. I've gotten laid a lot from girls hearing that I know how to do shibari and other kinky things because a lot of them have a certain latent curiosity that they like exploring with someone "safe" and "nice" like me. You just have to put yourself out there and make yourself known and you should have no problems.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Close up, not sure what you find more arousing, close up like this or further away so you can see the bod?</br>  <br>It's all about the imperfections for me. Not nescesarilly the blood. So I like the scars and the blood, but when I can see the rest of the girl.<br><br><br>Hmm, I'm only 20, so finding girls between 18-22 who are into all of this is quite hard. I just have no clue on where to find them here. Only had one relationship with a girl who enjoyed some stuff like hardcore deepthroat and all that, but nothing more. I'm not very into the more extreme stuff and bondage aswell tho. I did that test on Fetlife, and it said I'm 85% dom and 66% vanilla. Weird combo haha.</br></br></br></br>  <br>your worthless.</br>  <br>fuck off nigger.</br>  <br/>  <br>Good points. Seems like you have a niche clientele that works for you.

Something a little more your level.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Exactly.<br>The movie is a -5 whereas the book sits at about a 5 in the other direction.<br>Movies never beat the books.<br>And the book wasn't great either.</br></br></br></br>  <br>chekd</br>  <br>nobody gonna back this guy up?</br>  <br>edge of tomorrow</br>    <br>Eyes Wide Shut.<br><br>*drops mic*</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, great movie</br>  <br>europa report</br>  <br>Edge of tomorrow/Live die repeat/ Tom cruises fucking ludicrous adventure is alright</br>  <br> Snowpiercer <br>This. This movie fucking BLEW my mind. It's so good.</br></br>  <br>Considering the actual Kubrick cut was never seen by anyone but himself and the studio Execs, we'll never really know what it was supposed to be.<br><br>Still a good film.</br></br></br>  <br>Ex Machina is great, watched it last night. It has like %90 on Rotten Tomatoes.<br><br>It's basically about a super genius guy who builds a fuck doll robot that has human-passable AI.<br><br>Feminist reviews of it are hilariously vitriolic.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Lol. Anyone claiming Eyes Wide shut anything other than complete and utter garbage instantly reveals themselves to be a Kubrick nut-hanger. I.E., completely disqualified from having an opinion.</br>  The Book of Eli was a pretty good watch  <br>Switch it up and watch Akira</br>  I wish there were Shadowrun Movies.  <br>Stay ignorant, retard.<br><br>I'm sure you'll be one of the faggots lined up for 3 days this Dec. waiting to see Star Wars.</br></br></br>  <br>tap dat bitch. hnnng!</br>  <br>Literally Dredd</br>  <br>What a waste of two fucking hours!</br>  Nobody's mentioned Children of Men? Fucking great movie.  <br>Actually pretty awesome movie.</br>  <br>Some amazing cinematography in that flick</br>  <br>Automata, it's a pretty good robots getting sentience type film.<br>Snowpiercer, earth is frozen, people live aboard a fucked up train.<br>The Road, some dude and his son are trying to not die eaten by cannibals in a post-nuclear world.</br></br></br>  <br>It's mediocre at best.</br>  <br>Nah, just first week. I dont need to see it opening night. Better than tom cruise crying in a fucking mask like a faggot for 2 hours.</br>  <br>Not a movie but a mini series.<br><br>Very weird, full of secret societies, brainwashing holograms from your tv, anti-corporate resistance fighters, etc.</br></br></br>  <br>Good fucking movie, even the comics are fucking amazing.</br>  Only Blade Runner gets on this ones level.  <br>Running man was 10/10 Arnold</br>  <br> tom cruise crying for two hours <br><br>If that's all you came away with, there really is no hope for you.<br><br>I guess it didn't have enough 'splosions and cheeky Weadon-esqe one liners to satisfy your refined tastes.</br></br></br></br></br>  watch cube if you haven't seen it. very must watch  Try: Infini, Sunshine, Mr.Nobody, Interstellar, that's just off the top of my head.<br><br>If you want to try some sci fi series, I'm currently watching Ascension. Helix wasn't so bad. I'm not sure. Can anyone name anything else?<br><br> pic related <br>Infini, strangely it was pretty decent. The acting imo was what did it for me. Check it for yourself.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's scary how close our society is getting to the one in the film.</br>  <br>Muh nigga. This is all you need. This or Event Horizon, which isn't dystopian but still a decent watch.</br>  <br>A Boy and His Dog</br>  <br>Read "Brave New World." Its basically exactly that except people have kids. The state still raises them.</br>  <br><br> Black Mirror <br><br>Not a movie, but most certainly interdesting</br></br></br></br>  <br>EH was originally at least 30 mins longer and was far crazier than what we got. The studio wouldn't realise it as it was, and forced the director to recut.<br><br>The footage was lost, but a small piece is floating around on youtube.<br><br>What could have been would have been a horror legend.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I have. Great read. Demolition Man was a play on BNW as well. Lots of references, right down to Sandra Bullock's character's name, Lenina (char from book) Huxley (author).</br>  <br>Brazil</br>  <br>This right here.<br><br>Easily the most wonderfully disturbing things I've seen in years.<br><br>Every episode leaves you thinking for hours afterwards.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That sucks. I always got the feeling that they cut a few of the more graphic scenes from it, would be very interested to see it again now with that extra 30min. <br>Why must studios ruin perfectly good films?</br></br>  <br>Here, I found the one I know about.<br><br>By 90's standards it would have been NC-17 without a doubt.<br><br>http://m.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ZK1deb<wbr>nXYlA</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you even Machinist?</br>  the old mad max movies<br>a boy and his dog<br>the road<br>book of eli<br>I am legend<br>12 monkeys<br>postman</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>do you even the prestige</br>  <br>"the old mad max movies"<br><br>don't even fucking bother, the first one is boring as shit and road warrior is low budget garbage, thunderdome is the only one worth even half a shit and fury road is still 2000000x better</br></br></br>  Blood of Heroes (aka Salute of the Jugger)  <br>thunderdome is awesome</br>  <br>Thanks for that. Look's impressive and I can see what you mean about the rating, for 90's audiences that would have been pretty graphic. Then shit like saw and hostel comes out and it suddenly doesn't look so bad.</br>  <br>are you autistic? or 12? thunderdome is fucking garbage.summerfag</br>  TRON!!!!  Prometheus  <br>also gonna vouch for this one.<br><br>good mini series.</br></br></br>  Children of men  <br>This has to be bait.<br><br>No one can be that clueless.</br></br></br>  <br>Psychopass for ya weeb</br>  <br>This</br>  <br>lol ikr?</br>  <br>If you like animation - fantastic planet.</br>  <br>this</br>  <br>My nigga</br>  Steins;Gate  Adventure Time  Cloud Atlas!  <br>I second this.</br>  <br> Cloud Atlas <br><br><br> Cloud Atlas! </br></br></br></br>  Rick and Morty  Trigun  <br>A movie about driving one road for two hours with no fucking plot. IMDB 8,5/10 seems right, right?</br>  <br>under rated post</br>  <br>Yup</br>  <br>I approve of this post</br>  <br>Steins;Gate was good.<br>The only anime I have ever seen are action-y ones with storylines a four year old could understand (Considering they explain everything, then flashback 2 episodes to re-explain.)<br>Steins;Gate was incredible, if not hard to start and incredibly Weebish.</br></br></br>  <br>El. Psy. Congroo.</br>  <br>Agreed, but that movie deserves some points for how brilliantly made it was technically. It's a beautiful movie, just wasted on the story. Certainly not worth 8.5, 7 maybe.</br>  <br>Still, everyone told me to go to and watch it and after 1 hour i still waited for some sort of story-line to start. The music, props, actions etc was all good tho.</br>  <br>it's good, but not topic-related, since they never show the future</br>  <br>Read a fucking book, no movie gets close to your own imagination, ohh wait you're 13</br>  <br>sepressing</br>  <br>Goddamn she's perfect</br>  <br> I thought that movie wass boring as fuck. What did ypu enjoy about it?</br>  <br><br>u feel like i've watched that years ago, can you give me an overview to remind me</br></br>  <br> Sacrilegiously underrated <br><br>Hell yeah!</br></br></br>  <br>what does age have to do with reading books? I bet you're underage</br>  <br>Very good, and I agree not to look anything up, it's impossible not to spoil that movie if you look into it at all.</br>  <br>Yes, this movie is brilliant, and should be way more popular. When you finally figure out whats going on its like HOLY SHIT.</br>  <br>thw world is basically like fallout, everything is gray and destroyed, there are cannibals and bandits everyhwhere and you cant trust anyone<br><br>Then it's a father and a son trying to find something and making a trip to the sea out of promises that life is great there as far as I remember<br><br>I remember I really liked it because I love fallout</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The colony<br><br>I remember watching it bu I don't remember what it's about so It 's not horrible I guess, but not good.</br></br></br>  <br><br>indeed, best series ever</br></br>  <br><br> jennifer connely <br><br>yep, I'm watching that today</br></br></br></br>  <br>if you have not seen it you really should</br>  <br>Garbage</br>  <br>Ohh yeah, /spoiler/ they got to the sea at the end and there was nothing there right?</br>  <br> Lets just set someone on fire and run off <br>Fucking women man</br></br>  <br>WHITNESS ME</br>  <br> mfw I watched it without knowing it was a prequel to Aliens <br>That revelation was the only thing I liked about that movie, but since everyone and their dog already know, it's not worth watching.</br></br>  <br>shit movie with shit production values and shit acting<br><br>imho</br></br></br>  <br>Is this a joke</br>  <br> dat ending <br>Gets me every time<br><br>What a beautiful story</br></br></br></br>  <br>imo smh tbh fml</br>  <br>seconded, a cross between The Abyss and Event Horizon, with a dash of the shitty weirdness of The Sphere</br>  <br><br>Toxic Avenger</br></br>  <br>Same, it's almost Fallout the movie. I didn't like the religious overtones, but Gary Oldmans speech about how the book is for controlling the weak minded and desperate made up for that.</br>  The Rover  <br>wrong movie bruh</br>  mfw I'm bored like op and I've seen literally every single movie listed here  <br>Fuck yeah it is. I haven't seen The Road, just assumed Book of Eli. That really felt like Fallout for me.</br>  <br>soylent green<br><br>planet of the apes (original)<br><br>get your charleton heston on.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Babylon AD, although people either really hate it, or really like it.</br>  <br>they both are really good for a fallout fan, go see The Road if you havent, then.<br>And "a boy and his dog"</br></br>  The Divide    <br>A boy and his dog.</br>  <br>its pretty much DayZ</br>  <br>Escape from New York is also excellent.</br>  <br>I watched it yesterday, I enjoyed it. In the end did only the girl and black boy survive or did I interpret it wrong?</br>  <br>There's always one</br>  <br>Well, I guess OP doesn't have to watch that now.</br>  <br>there are no zombies in the road</br>  <br>I hate spoilers too, but if a film isn't worth watching if you know the ending, then it's a poor film.</br>  <br>Don't call you self a 90s kid faggot. We're pushing 30. (Assuming you were born in the 80s and experienced the 90s, and not born in the 90s making you a 2000s kid) Calling yourself an anything kid when you're at the age when you should be starting a family makes you look like a loser.</br>  <br>this<br>Finally wactched it on blu-ray for the first time and it was glorious.

Only the Wachowskis seem to be able to pull it off, I don't know how they do their effects. <br><br>Interstellar and Mad Max really highlight how shit cgi is. Lots of debate on if they're good stories, but no doubt they look amazing.</br></br></br>  <br>the warriors is a fucking classic no doubt, but i would hardly call it sci-fi/dystopian</br>  <br>I do not understand what the fuck you are saying</br>  So good.  <br> only the wachowskis seem to be able to pull it off <br><br>this is a joke right?</br></br></br>  <br>Dredd was basically a very bad rip off of The Raid.</br>  <br>Not "apocalypse" but CLOUD ATLAS is a fucking wonderful movie :)</br>  <br><br>seconding these 2<br>also <br> Children of men <br> scanners (effects are dated but good movie) <br> starship troopers <br> and star trek serieses are always good </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It is brother</br>  <br>I was bitterly disappointed that I wasn't able to see Mad Max before its cinematic run ended, because I wanted to support practical FX. I'll definitely be buying the blu-ray when it's out. <br><br><br>I think he has a point at least as far as the first Matrix goes.
