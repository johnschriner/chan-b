Whoever you are.</br>  <br> normal <br>you have glowing purple nipples</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Just proving the point...You know there's a reason I don't talk to any of the knights around here.... does your weak jawline hurt from always looking down on others....</br></br></br></br>  <br>We will still be able to talk, regardless of what happens. We both met at the same time of joining and.. we are currently in close terms, and always will be, Revy. Even Team Moo are there when you need to talk with us.</br>  <br><br>You are terrible Medic....</br></br>  <br>Woo.</br>  <br>If someone needs a doctor I can always play surgeon!</br>  <br><br>To hell with that...I find you to be an incredible person...You're smart, you stand on your own two feet, and you got a damn good taste in booze...Hell if people don't want to talk to you because of a few things...Fuck 'em...You'll always have my respect Revy and I'm sure Spike would agree</br></br>  <br>Dear god no...</br>  <br>I don't trust you that much...</br>  Heyo everyone!  <br>SATAN QUADS, YOU DUN GOOFED</br>  <br>You are implying that I look in the direction of any of you, ever.

It is not safe for those kind of practices for you yet.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Please no. I will fix that problem instead.</br>    <br><br><br>Hello young girls, this place doesn't seem sutible for people like you, don't you have a village to stay safe in?</br></br></br>  <br>Names Revy.

I refuge to /b/ and /pol/ because reddit is a cesspool of progressive college thought that gets annoying as fuck, but as the years go by this is now becoming more and more true of 4chan as well and soon it will be time to migrate elsewhere, probably voat and 8 chan.<br><br>Thoughts?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  browse 4chan<br>hate reddit although it has some good information for some shit that I've encountered on there</br>  <br> NOT GREENTEXT'D </br>  Eh I'll be honest I go on reddit sometimes but dont really comment because everyone over there has a stick up their ass and here you can pretty much be an asshole freely.  don't browse reddit even though 4chan is shit now, reddit is still filled with absolute faggots  Love both  I don't use any social network. Just browse /b/ when bored  I use both and have no problem with either of em  stop these reddit threads holy fuck  I don't get how people don't understand reddit. It's super fucking simple  I love both, and browse for hours daily. I'm actually pretty torn as to whether I wanna join in on 4chan kicking Reddit while it's down (/r/crashingthisplane for those interested), or if I wanna hold onto false hope and see if Reddit lives. Either way, everything sucks right now.  I hate reddit and the faggots who go their more than I hate niggers and jews and I really hate niggers and jews. <br><br>I wish nothing but the worst form of death onto reddit crossposters.</br></br>  I go to reddit to look for specific stuff and look through various comments without having to sort through the autistic shit, b8 and spiderman threads and such thats's on /b/. I stay on /b/ mainly for the porn/rekt/roll threads and that rare chance when op isnt a faggot and delivers. Shit here is what its supposed to be "random" but if you dont talk like the kool kids then you're a fedora wearing autist and that's fucking stupid.   be 2012 <br> be me <br> be 18 <br> go on Reddit for first time <br> call someone a fag for dressing up like a cigarette <br> britcucks die laughing <br> Reddit community begins sucking their own dicks <br> report button is pressed with the force of a million weeb loads being fired at once. <br> Today was a good day. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>tbh I go on reddit pretty frequently because it has some good shit and is useful for news and a good occasional lol. Most other people there are really uptight unless you convo with them then they can be cool. I go to 4chan a lot and mainly for a good laugh. Not to mention /v/ is a whole lot better than r/gaming. Not proud to say it but reddit isn't all that bad but 4chan is sill better</br>  <br>Honestly I have been on reddit, but only because it had some usefull information on a subject I couldn't find information about anywhere else.<br>But I must say, 4chan (except for some boards) has better inforamtion and is a lot less cancerous.</br></br>  <br>the news there sucks now with how much it's moderated</br>  4chan has slowly just become a furry and trap sanctuary so I attempted to move on. I have tried getting into reddit because of actual normal people but the layout is fucking bullshit. Trying to follow a convo is impossible and there's a serious lack of pictures.<br><br>Whelp, back to the chanz</br></br>  I visit reddit daily for a select few game subs.<br>both are just a fucking website.</br>  I've decided to kick my reddit habit other than shitposting on /r/CrashingThisPlane until it gets banned. There is no community on reddit that you can't find a better version of on the first page of google  <br>leddit is for pinkos and weenies</br>  <br>I only look at the INFJ page on reddit &amp; /b/ on 4chan...the only human beings on the internet I feel a connection with...I'm okay with that.</br>  4chun and leddit are together now ? Fuck, we need another exodus  yeh. too many angsty kids on 4chan now. can't always stand the constant whining.  I use both mainly for porn. RIP in peace porn source ;_________________;  <br>4chan mainly never really gone to reddit</br>  does reddit have rekt threads?  I tried using reddit but I couldnt get into it's UI.    I go on two subreddits. <br><br><br>r/Smashbros and r/amiibo because I am a huge smashfag and /v/ is the worst cancer there is.</br></br></br>  I also browse reddit. It's better than this shithole.  Never on reddit unless somebody links something on reddit.  I'm thinking of trying voat. any good "subverses" anyone? for like posting teens or amateur chicks...  I only read a reddit post if I'm sent a direct link or screencap of it.<br><br>I don't specifically hate it, but I don't like its interface and I've grown accustomed to the *chan style of anonymous posting, so joining a site and having a profile and all that turns me off of a lot of shit now.</br></br>  <br>I browse reddit. There are some subreddits I go to for discussing specific hobbies and interests that are a little too general for 4chan.</br>  <br>same thing</br>  <br>fuck i been tricked</br>  <br>They banned those subverses after their paypal account got suspended.</br>  reddit is good for information but there is no point in comments there. 4chan is amazing for laughs and random moments but a lot of its users are just so fucking edgy. anyone i know that uses both sites pretty much says they go on 4chan so much because its the only site that updates at such a fast rate. you can see everything reddit has to offer in a day while 4chan changes things every minute constantly  Basically only use reddit for porn and sometimes news besides that I'm here  Been on 4chan for about 7/8 years and just getting bored of it, only so many times you can hear 13 hear olds say 'niggers r bad' before it gets stale and boring. Think that day was about 7/8 years ago.<br><br>Go on reddit but just don't fit in when commenting, I'm super left wing, probably too much. If I comment anything outside the centre left, neo-socialist rhetoric they believe is the only sensible one, I'm swarmed on like I've made some casual off hand KKK remark<br>Miss the equality here, everyone always hates everyones comments</br></br></br>    only use 4chan don't give a shit about reddit, don't care about it  <br> Go on reddit but just don't fit in when commenting, I'm super left wing, probably too much. If I comment anything outside the centre left, neo-socialist rhetoric they believe is the only sensible one, I'm swarmed on like I've made some casual off hand KKK remark <br><br>There have been two containment subreddits for commie scum set up at /r/gulag and /r/fullcommunism, you might have better luck jerking over there. Ps: kill yourself faggot</br></br></br>  <br>It's because you are a communist you fucking scum. Nobody likes you communists.</br>  Only /b/ and imgur<br>Fuckmeup.fam</br>  I dont use reddit, it seems like a scary place, ill just stay on /b/  I use /b/ only due to my superiority complex.  i tried reddit once. a friend of mine kept browsing it and i said i'll give it a try. being accutomed to the chan syle(image + story) i fucking hated the interface. i asked a question about how do you win an argument with a feminazi, got downvoted instantly and received only boring replies. after the downvote coulnd't post anymore on that subreddit. so back to the chans where i feel at home  <br> Admits he has a superiority complex <br>No you don't dipshit. If you're aware that you have a certain mental illness then you probably don't have it. You just have a huge ego.</br></br>  <br>are..are you autistic</br>  <br>you sound like a major faggot<br>only a floorlicking piece of shit cuck would believe that bullshit</br></br>  <br>I browse 4chan and hate reddit<br><br>Next</br></br></br>  <br><br>samefag</br></br>  I do both. Reddit for structure and seriousness. 4Chan for the craziness and dank memes.  I browse reddit mostly and when I'm very bored I come here  I browse reddit cuz interesting stuff and dont have to worry about surprise cp popping up on my screen. That being said the people are the biggest faggots of he internet and possibly the world. They are also full on retarded. Sometimes I go on pics or funny and laugh/ccrige at what people have upvoted to the front page. I come to b random cuz I can really b myself (oomg reddit fags did u catch that pun?!?!?!?)  <br>Confirmed summerfag.</br>  <br><br>you're the biggest faggot i've met all day, and I'm gay</br></br>  <br>browse 4chan since 2010.<br>never browse reddit, and don't care about reddit</br></br>  Occasionally browse 4chan. Mainly reddit    <br>Lol dafuq. Is that your OC ross?</br>  <br> and I'm gay <br><br>Figures you'd feel the need to point that out. Attention whore.</br></br></br>  <br>kill yourself faggot</br>  <br><br>I'm a 4chan regular, but I'm discovering new things on Reddit every day. It's a lot more detailed and there tend to be more in-depth discussions there.</br></br>  <br>I do.<br>Depends on the subreddit.</br></br>  I browse 4chan for the dank memes<br><br>I browse reddit for news<br><br> I like the dank memes more </br></br></br></br>  <br>Alright, so what subreddits?</br>  <br>Reddit is shit/slow/moralfag 4chan a best</br>  Tumblr is the only website with a degree of empathy for the wellbeing of others where as 4chan is just full of sociopaths  I browse 4chan like an hour a day.<br><br>Never browsed reddit, I don't like the point system and the template is fucking awful.<br><br>I do have to rely on it on sometimes, like when I had to search for some info about the long war mod for xcomEW</br></br></br></br>  <br>Dis is what entretanes me</br>  <br><br>  saying im gay makes it more significant that you're such a giant faggot, can you read? </br></br>  I went to Reddit once and I found their humor very unfunny. It was just comments of people trying to be clever and trying to give an air of being "above it all" and more mature than anyone else.  <br>i prefer reddit rather than 4chan. /b/ and /pol/ are only guilty pleasures, while reddit offers real value</br>  <br>what is this even<br><br>https://www.reddit.com/r/CrashingTh<wbr>isPlane/comments/3byv9v/vote_up_if_<wbr>i_just_submitted_a_post_a_tale_of/</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>I've used 4chan longer than Reddit but i don't hate it. (/u/spacebutterfly)</br>  I'll go on reddit if I'm lead there searing for something or I'm linked but I'm not a "reddit user" <br><br>I never hated reddit and think the internet tribalism is just the gross newfaggotry which has been going on so long that it's not really newfaggotry anymore</br></br>  <br>Never visited reddit, don't give a fuck now and probably won't give a fuck in the future.</br>  browse both , reddit mostly. hate more of the reddit community, also reddit is going to shit .  I only use reddit for computer problems. Other than that, I avoid it totally. I have an account there to ask for tech support ( reddit techsupport is much more reliable than 4chan). Other than that, I avoid reddit like a plague.  I grew kind of sick of 4chan over the years, the same rolling/porn/stupid games/want to kill myself threads day after day year after year. Sure reddit's community also sucks with its stupid positivity but 4chan is the other awful end of the spectrum; people are negative for the sake of being negative here. Really every internet community is gonna suck so you might as well try to get the best of all worlds.  What keeps me away from Reddit is that godawful UI.  Browse 4chan only<br>Never been on reddit</br>  On reddit i only lurk /csgo, i dont event comment<br>On 4chan i lurk and shitpost /b and /vg</br>  only browse 4chan and genuinely hate reddit. it's just a more strict version of 4chan, anything goes on 4chan (except for cp of course) but it's not like that on reddit.  <br>it is. You can make a subreddit dedicated to just about anything. ever hear of /r/cutefemalecorpses and /r/picsofdeadkids ? Not saying I enjoy those subreddits, but they're not deleted either.</br>  <br>I go on both, frequently. Reddit and 4chan are both quality websites with good content.<br>/b/ only seems so shitty because most people in /b/ are sheep who go with the majority.<br>They try to appear to be average stereotyping /b/tard and spam nigger into every sentence because everyone else is doing the same and nobody wants to be an outcast and form their own view of things.<br>Same with reddit and this whole LGBT shit.<br>Seriously, most users are insecure and post as someone their not.</br></br></br></br></br>  Browse and shitpost here. I sometimes lurk on reddit, but it feels not funny as here. Furthermore, they try do some puns in comments and I don't understand some of them.  <br> daily redditor. <br> first visit to 4chan. <br> ? <br> profit </br></br></br></br>   everyday <br>Go reddit, check 3 sub resits before bored. Go 4chan because /b/ is random.<br> look at naked pictures on both </br></br>  <br>4chan has anonymity and the threads are eventually deleted. mods aren't as strict and reddit steals a lot of our ideas. every single board on 4chan will have a racist who hates jews and will trace your grandma's IP then swat her or some shit, reddit is jollier (not saying reddit is jolly but the users are less offensive).</br>  Mostly browse /b/ /ic/ and /v/.<br>I barely visit reddit, I check out besieged collection of reddit machines a few months back, but that's about it. I've got lots of friends who regularly use reddit though, and I really don't understand what the fuzz is all about.</br>    <br><br> be today <br> be me <br> go to 4chan because reddit has internal problem <br> be called faggot <br> move on </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The users are less offensive as you said it the mods are more strict and everybody's not anonymous like 4chan.<br>4chan would be no different from the reddit community if it wasn't for this.<br>You fags aren't special.</br></br></br>  I rarely use reddit, and that's only if google suggests that an answer to my question is there. I don't hate it but from what I have seen it's worse than /b/ in may regards.  <br>I use reddit. I do hate the shitty voting system. I get banned from a lot of subreddits because SJW's get offended by things too easily.</br>  lurk 4chan<br>dont go on reddit<br><br>only hate the people that reference reddit irl<br>online i couldnt give a shit</br></br></br></br>  I browse /b/, /po/ and /f/ here.<br>I also occasionally lurk on SA.</br>  <br>Why is 4chans horribleness seen as a good thing? Most people agressively hating jews or black people are only faking it for 4chan's sake. It's all about being edgy. I don't see why this is something we should use to pick 4chan over reddit.</br>  <br>checked. also faggot is a term of endearment.<br><br>welcome to 4chan, faggot.</br></br></br>  <br>Offensive posts will be downvoted for the most part on reddit, so there is "passive" censorship I guess? Knowing that your opinion won't fare well leads to just not posting it.</br>  <br>reddit has better content.</br>  I jump all over 4chan looking for things that intrest me, great site for when you're bored.<br><br>I use reddit for looking up or talking about specific topics at any time.<br><br>I don't get the childish Muh Secret Clubhouse shit on these two sites though, they're both more or less the same but with different epic may may shit posters.

That makes leddit more SJWy so some people move from leddit to 4chan. Which has made here more SJWy and people heremove to the chan that is twice this chan.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I only go on reddit for obscure subreddits that nobody ever posts on</br>  <br>well lets look at /b/'s subreddit on the day:<br><br>reddit.com/r/crashingthisplane<br><br>sooooo much better kek. At least those reddit threads have discussion and thought out posting.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> faggot is a term of endearment <br>So is OP the most loved man on Earth?<br> inb4 "Yes, that's why he always has so many dicks in his mouth" </br></br></br>  <br>Shut up you cancer.<br>No, just joking. I agree 100%.</br></br>  Browse both. But more active on 4chans /k than anything else<br><br>4chan - b, k, fit, pol, vg<br><br>Reddit - gonewild, fallout, pcmasterrace, witcher, elite dangerous, gun</br></br></br></br>  I have never browsed reddit.<br><br>Only 4chan for many years so</br></br>  <br>Remember when anybody cared about Something Awful?</br>  <br>How fucking stupid can you be. &gt;You fags aren't special.<br>Yes, we are "special" because we don't have the shit restrictions you do. You just contradicted yourself by giving examples of why we are different then you go on to say we aren't special as if we're the same when you just pointed out differences. So basically you're saying we're different but in the end we're the same and if you use logic you're either different or the same you can't be both. Redditfags go back to your corrupt website. Now I see why your site is shit. Please do the world a favor and eat a bowl of cereal with bleach substituted for milk you wasteman.</br></br>  i don't browse reddit. tried it once but the site is a huge clusterfuck.<br>i only browse 4chan but don't hate reddit.</br>  <br>While I agree that the offensiveness of 4chan is mostly due to people being edgy, I think it's still better than the circlejerk of reddit. Downvote brigades, or people just disagreeing with your opinion leads to random and dumb downvotes. <br><br>Also, top comments take away the discussion for me. I just read the top comments and ignore the rest, because there's probably not much to add or I'm too lazy.</br></br></br>  <br>This is the only good answer for this thread</br>    <br><br>I only go to Reddit cause /vp/ is kill.</br></br>  <br>True enough, and I appreciate 4chan for not having that, however that also keeps shitposting at bay, and god is there a lot of shitposting on 4chan. On reddit lame puns and stuff tend to be upvoted though, so that's annoying too.<br><br>As a side-note, I do think 4chan would benefit from a voting system on threads (not comments). That way rolling threads and such would hopefully not be seen on the front page so much.</br></br></br>  <br>what happened to /vp/?</br>  <br><br>I check it a few times a day. There isn't much activity for what it is. Or maybe I can't tell the difference between content flow. It's just that I keep seeing the same thread bump to the top, which I'm not interested in those threads.</br></br>  <br>I agree with you on such a big part, and both systems have their merits. But it's so hard to get anything serious going on /b/ (serious like this), the lack of rule enforcement on /b/ is both its strength and its fatal flaw.</br>  <br>Ten people each post a pun on Reddit. Did they get downvoted to the bottom?<br>No. No pun in ten did.</br></br>  No way I'd go on reddit.<br><br>I mean compare their gaming 'subreddits' with the brilliance that is /v/? Yeah no contest.</br></br>  <br>You can hide those threads. I just think that there if there is a discussion on 4chan, it's more intense than on reddit. On reddit, people ask a question or talk about a topic and then everyone says what they think and that's it mostly. Maybe some dank meming or further additions, but I've not really seen anything like "You're wrong and a faggot, here's why:..."</br>    <br> Thinking /v/ is good. <br>I don't know about Reddit, but /v/ is a shitfest.</br></br>  <br>What has reddit done to save videogames from the rabid sjws?</br>  <br>What's a reddit?</br>  <br>You're the reason my mom got cancer.</br>  <br>implying furries, traps and bullshit is in any sense better. gtfo</br>  <br>I hate Reddit and I'm not even trying to be edgy.<br> shit layout <br> progressive hipster fucks  <br> over all shit atmosphere <br> bunch of nigger loving cucks <br> pretty much like /b/ now that I think of it </br></br></br></br></br></br>  Reddit at work<br>4Chan at home<br><br>Even then i still can't deal with reddits userbase because they are enormous faggots</br></br></br>  <br>Good. At least she had a good sense of tumor.</br>  <br>Yeah, I would love to have an internet page with more or less serious discussion with minimal shitposting. Without circlejerking (have my upboats!!111) or spiderman-posts or something. Like a chatroom I guess, just anonymous. <br><br><br>Epic meme, have all my upvotes you handsome fellow!!!!!!1 (no homo) :^)</br></br></br></br>  <br>www.reddit.com<br>it's the front page of the internet dude!</br></br>  <br>Get the fuck out with your shitty bait thread, made me reply/10</br>  <br>I only go to /r/leagueoflegends on reddit</br>  NORMIES.

I went to reddit because i was craving variety. <br><br>still come to /b/ when i'm in the mood for porn, though</br></br></br>  i use both reddit and /b/ (no other part of 4chan) for hours every day<br>im pretty ambivalent about both, they have their bad sides and both function as time sinks that i cant help but waste my life on<br>/b/ is fun sometimes<br>reddit has better discussions of course, like orders of magnitude better<br>lots of enjoyable content too, first sub that comes to mind is /r/academicphilosophy<br>but actually i especially like subs like /r/badphilosophy and /r/badlinguistics<br>idk about the whole blackout thing<br>dont have an opinion so im just sort of watching from the sidelines<br>other people seem to care more about the site than i do, i see no point in standing in their way</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The users on reddit can be the most arrogant fucktards who just act like pricks to people. At least on 4chan having anonymity allows people to not give a fuck. The lack of an ID means people don't feel as though saying one thing that pisses everyone off means that they can no longer speak because no one knows who the fuck they are.</br>  <br>/b/tards are at least as arrogant as the worst redditors</br>  I lurk both and sometimes post in some small subs subs like /r/Starcraft or /r/Formula1 , the rest is cancerous , not the same cancer /b/ have but cancer nonetheless.<br><br>The circlejerk is ruining everything and will ruin 8 chan too.</br></br>  <br><br>By the way thoses subs i post in are also cancerous , they just happen to have topics i have a few fucks to give about.</br></br>  <br> 4chan since 2005 <br> Never even heard about reddit until faggots on here starting talking about it in 2010 <br> Have never been on the website before <br>I hear its just a bunch of faggots anyway.</br></br></br></br>  Been browsing 4chan daily since 2008<br>Been browsing reddit daily since 2011</br>  <br>this</br>  I've been to reddit a few times when that was the only place I could find accurate info on vidya related shit.<br><br>A few months ago I went on there to see what all the "le XD epic memes" was about, and I didn't see a single one talking like that..</br></br>  <br>That's why he has so many dicks in his ass</br>  Been on 4chan since '07, longer then I was on reddit.<br><br>Askreddit, IAMA, and smaller special interest subreddits make the site entertaining.<br><br>Now 2/3rds of the reason the site is good are gone.<br><br>The site has been going to shit for a long time, it's having that digg-like identity crisis where the owners want to sell out and the userbase doesn't. Except rather then changing the frontpage to all blogspam like digg, they're basically just letting SJWs run rampant... kind of like 4chans mods amirite?<br><br><br>I agree with this anon actually, 4chan, especially /b/ is extremely stale nowadays. I blame "general" threads and the fact that it's way harder to spam "yiff in hell furfag" into a shitty cancer general thread 50 times nowadays. It's gotten to the point reddit has more influence over the internet then 4chan, because 4chan just posts the same shit in their general threads over and over, the topics never changing. I hate what /b/ became, people all trying to keep to themselves instead of people working together to generate a sense of site culture, we used to have more shitposts, but more OC as well. I've already accepted the inevitable decline of 4chan.<br><br>Probably the only thing 4chan still does really well is porn threads. 4chan has some of the best taste in porn I've ever seen.<br><br><br>Reddit legit did that (adding le to memes), but there was a HUGE backlash against it on reddit like.. 5 years back? 4chan did it too, they just have amnesia.<br><br>IDK, I've got to find something else to do, or maybe fall back to stumbleupon. Maybe I'll take up lifting.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  i go to both 4chan and tumbr  <br>I never go on reddit, you roody-poos</br>  <br> Bunch of nigger loving cucks <br><br>That's rich coming from someone on 4chan, the site where there are 1-2 "black cocks are superior" threads going on at all times. Here's a current one <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;625548474 <br><br>Not that reddit isn't full of cucks either. But as a 24 year old virgin with a big dick all I can say about porn where girls go "tee hee, what I really love is guys with huge cocks" makes me go pic related so long as there isn't a weird small dude shown mastrubrating.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Samefag</br></br></br>  More towards the latter<br><br>I don't necessarily "hate" reddit though, but I can see why a lot of people don't like it. When you have been on 4chan for a long time the humour on reddit seems pretty lame and cringey. <br><br>I have no problem going there every now and again to check out an AMA or whatever, but it's pretty rare that I do. <br><br>Personally I think some people here get too wound up about it, maybe some are jealous of it's popularity or something.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  sense of site culture <br>4chan always has a culture<br>  Askreddit, IAMA <br>The most cancerous cancers<br><br> &gt; you are a faggot </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>pretty much this<br>  ▲<br>▲ ▲</br></br></br>    both 4chan and reddit are moderated by "sjw" who remove things if it will hurt "profit" through advertising<br><br>this kills the website</br></br>  <br>I don't want Reddit to die, as annoying as some of those faggots are I enjoy the askreddit threads and the amas.</br>  Reddit's format is abhorrent to the style of forum I am comfortable with. I've been on imageboards like this for years, and I don't recognise an upstart with such horrible page layout and popularity shit all over it. none of our opinions are worth jack shit over eachothers', here on the chan we're essentially equal in the pit of shit we have created for ourselves. but I just don't go there. I went once to have a look and meh, it's literally cookie cutter shit from here. whatever, I'm rambling. OP is a faggot, etc. Hate is too strong a word, its just another insipid community, like Something Awful. that place was once something beautiful, now its a den of sycophants and tyrants.  <br>yea i use both</br>  <br>correct.</br>  <br>No.<br>I just don't find reddit interesting at all, I don't care about it.</br></br>  <br>Chairman pao is so fucking ugly.</br>  I do go to subreddits like declutter, libertarian, anarcho_capitalism.  you know what really pisses me off about reddit?<br><br>Gilding. aka another form of dicksucking<br><br>Fuck gilding.</br></br></br></br>  Been coming to 4chan since '07, never even visited Reddit once. <br><br>No idea whats it's like, how it looks or how to use it. <br><br>4chans still shit though.</br></br></br></br>  On 8 Chan, starting to hate 4 chan.<br><br>That's right fuck you guys<br><br>and i still look at reddit like maybe 1 time a month LOL</br></br></br></br>  I browse and post on boards like /co/ &amp; /v/ and I use reddit too. However, I don't go on shitty Subreddits like r/funny. If you go to the smaller Subreddits, you can see some worthwhile content.<br><br>It's the same for 4chan. /b/ is full of newfags but the other smaller boards aren't.</br></br>  You know what Reddit's good for? Telling people you go on it so you don't have to tell them about 4chan.<br><br>That's pretty much all I do. If I found something interesting on 4chan and someone asks me where I found it, "oh, on Reddit, you should go sign up and make an account." Easy.</br></br>  I think both are good in their own ways. There is the fucked up and the awesome 4chan, the faggot and the smaller subreddit Reddit.  <br>FUCK OFFFFFFFFF <br>STOP REDDIT THREADS /b/ DOESN GIVE A FUCK</br></br>  <br>4chan as fuck</br>  lurk on both<br>4chan's full of shitposters and people who don't have a fucking clue what they're talking about 90% of the time.

At the time, Fichter rejected a plea deal by the State Attorney's Office, seemingly in a bid to achieve a more lenient sentence.<br><br>And on Thursday, she gave an emotional speech at Polk County Court, telling her victims and their families, who were in attendance, that she wished she could 'go back and remove what I've done'.<br><br>Donning a blue prison jumpsuit and with tears streaming down her face, she said: 'I hate so much what my selfishness has done...

I thought Americans were free, some of your laws are fucked  bout time a woman was rightfully prosecuted  <br>How is ur summer ?</br>  <br> there is no acceptable face <br>Did you look at her face? She's like an 8/10. Way more than acceptable. And the lucky guys were 17. She should be given a medal for services to males and making education interesting, not 22 years.</br></br>  <br>Fucking checked but sack up</br>  <br>Finally. Equality.</br>  <br>Same, I live in Lake county... had no idea.</br>  <br>I second that<br><br>fucked up justice</br></br></br>  But..she's hot  <br>The better question is: Why are these kids snitching for?</br>  <br>Lucky does not begin to describe it, these guys truly are heroes.</br>  Don't get me wrong I would have fucked the Shit out of her, but I am happy that she got the male standard for her crime and not some sjw bullshit  https://www.change.org/p/white-hous<wbr>e-usa-%D1%81%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%B<wbr>E%D0%B4%D1%83-%D0%B4%D0%B6%D0%B5%D0<wbr>%BD%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%84%D0%B5%D1%80-%<wbr>D1%84%D0%B8%D1%87%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80<wbr>?recruiter=320618767&amp;utm_source=sha<wbr>re_petition&amp;utm_medium=copylink<br><br>sign the petition</br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr>  <br>It's not she had sex with a 10 year old or a 12 year old. I see nothing wrong with her actions.</br>  <br> she got the male standard for her crime and not some sjw bullshit <br>Now I am conflicted.</br></br>  <br>Agreed</br>  I wished she caused 'hurt' to me. lucky bastards!!!<br>who's the faggot that told on her???</br>  <br>This. Why would they snitch? They're 17, they're going to have sex or have already had sex. What's the point of snitching her out?</br>  WTF, they were 17 not 7. I every civilised country except the fucking morally repressed US 17 is long since legal.<br><br>She has basically been sentenced to life in prison for having consensual sex. Sure she was a teacher, but that doesnt mreally amjtter much, at most she should have been banned from teaching.</br></br>  <br>Probably someone who wasn't getting any.</br>  <br>she's not that bad, wish I had a teacher like that</br>  <br><br>Lucky little bastards.</br></br>  Equal treatment was served. Fuck her.  WATCH THIS MOVIE NOW!!!!!!!!!<br><br>You will laugh cause of ur depressing feels. I promise you.<br>ggogogoogogogogoggogfogoodododododo<wbr>doitittititititittititit</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>And I'm pretty sure they teacher would improve their grades in some degree. It's a win-win situation. Fucking autists</br>  <br><br><br>And it's comments like this which is why female paedophiles get away with it all the time.<br><br>Don't get me wrong, 22 years for having sex for 17 year olds is bullshit. Considering most places 16 is the age of consent, her punishment should be having her teaching license revoked for having sex with her students and that's it. And it SHOULD BE the same punishment if the genders were reversed.<br><br>If she was teaching 12 year olds, well that would be a whole different kettle of fish.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>no shit I want to be a "victim" of this "predator"...</br>  In prison for having sex<br><br>Lel</br></br>  <br>Quad dub checked</br>  <br> tfw by doing so we discourage all other female teachers to have sex with male students <br> tfw my son or his son will probably never have even a CHANCE to fuck his teacher <br><br>I don't want to live in this retched place that has become our world</br></br></br></br>  <br>Same</br>  <br>Wait, she's jailed because she had sex with students? Did she rape the students? No? They freely agreed to have sex with her? Then why the fuck is she jailed?!</br>   Muhrica <br> have sex <br> go to jail </br></br>  <br>Crime was not equal though. At least in terms of the effect it will have on the "children" in question. If anything this will only improve their lives. How many niggas can say that they fucked a teacher? That's a accolades to brag about.</br>  <br>youre an idiot<br>if it was a 40 year old man fucking 17 year old girls, you faggots would all be glad he was in jail<br><br><br>you're hypocrites and its the very definition of double standards.</br></br></br></br></br>  Fucking Amerifags.  <br><br> WTF, they were 17 not 7. I every civilised country except the fucking morally repressed US 17 is long since legal. <br><br>Murrican here.<br><br>Even in most of the US 17 is legal.<br><br>She was in one of the handful of states where its not.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>agreed. If it had been a male teacher who impregnated his 17 year old students he would have been nailed to the wall and left to bleed out.<br><br>She knew that she was breaking the law, she knew that she was abusing her position of authority for personal gain. I have no pity for her<br><br> inb4 pedo-dindunuffin </br></br></br></br></br>  thats fucking retarded <br>22 years for having sex</br>  <br>Probably. Why can't these motherfuckers let a player play?</br>  <br>you must be new here</br>  <br>That map is inaccurate for Florida. If you're 23 or younger the age of consent is 16 here.</br>  If she was fucking niggers:Fucking Bitch deserved it.<br>If she was fucking whites:Good on her, she was treated unjustly.</br>  <br>22 YEARS?!?!<br><br>fucking hell<br><br>and to think 17 is perfectly legal in this country.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Even in states where the legal age is 16, it's still illegal for teachers to sleep with students.</br>  <br>Lol, you, americans, saying shit about Pussy Riot, russian police and law. Enjoy your 21th century gaymocratic law system. Shit, 22 years, 22 fucking years for sex, do you realise it? I´m glad, I´m not from this country.</br>  <br>Why 22 years? She could have just registered as a sex offender, be court ordered to get psychological consoling and maybe spend like five years under supervised release. Why fill the prison system with non-violent offenders? Jesus fucking christ. The judge doesn't want justice or the betterment of society. The judge just wants to be "tough on crime" to get more votes to keep his shitty job.<br><br>When are we going to fix the judicial system? It's a goddamn joke.</br></br></br>  Tearfully pleading for forgiveness is literally 100 percent irrelevant, are you retarded?  We should all write her letters about how the system is fucked up and she did nothing wrong and we love her.  <br>Not me. I'm 49 and I'd love nothing more than to fuck a 17 year old girl.

She was just doing her job.</br>  <br>did you even read OP?<br><br>jesus christ</br></br></br>  <br><br>Dumb bitch didn't know women who commit statutory rape can still seek child support from the victim. She should have kept the baby.</br></br>  If a girl fucks her male teacher she probably enjoyed it too.<br><br>But if we normalize this shit, even if the teacher is a woman, we'd all be sending our kids to school to get fucked.<br><br>This bitch is a psychopath and belongs in jail.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I know you idiots are saying "Good she got the same sentence a man would.".<br><br>But what you need to realize is the same women supporting crazy statutory rape laws to protect their precious little girls are the same ones supporting shit like this to support their precious little boys.<br><br>The concept of a teacher "exploiting their position of power" is so frightening to them that they'll throw the book at her to make a statement. Not because anyone really feels that an 8/10 teacher letting her 17 year old students plow her is a terrible slight against the students; but because they have the "think of the children" mentality going and want to make an example of someone.<br><br>In any case it demonstrates that the statutory laws are bullshit regardless of whether they're fucking men or women.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well not all violent offenders are bad people. I had one bad acid trip and hit a few cops and I wasn't sentenced to any hefty jail time. I made a one-time mistake and was landed in a huge amount of debt but prison is the worst. It is torture. I think all murderers should be set free in a frozen wasteland and given supplies, and the rest of the offenders should be put into programs that are harsh but don't require prison time. Prison is a nightmare, it is straight-up torture.</br>  <br>They are provisions in the law that prohibit people oh higher authority (like a teacher) to have sex with people with lower authority (like students). I forgot the actual term for it. But it is to keep 17 year olds and college freshmen from being coerced into haveing sex for a better grade.<br><br>Here's a fun fact, if she was just 7 years younger she would have been able to fuck them with no legal ramifications.</br></br></br>  On pedophilia not being a disorder<br>==================================<br><br>Research<br>--------<br>http://www.sexarchive.info/BIB/pedo<wbr>philia.htm<br>http://www.theguardian.com/society/<wbr>2013/jan/03/paedophilia-bringing-da<wbr>rk-desires-light<br>http://articles.latimes.com/2013/ja<wbr>n/14/local/la-me-pedophiles-2013011<wbr>5<br>http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2<wbr>013/01/07/don_t_pooh_pooh_the_left_<wbr>s_push_to_normalize_pedophilia<br><br><br>On legalizing child pornography<br>===============================<br><br>Research<br>--------<br>http://phys.org/news/2010-11-legali<wbr>zing-child-pornography-linked-sex.h<wbr>tml<br>http://phys.org/news166769376.html<br>http://human-stupidity.com/stupid-d<wbr>ogma/child-porn-witch-hunt/legal-ch<wbr>ild-pornography-reduces-child-sex-c<wbr>rimes-milton-diamond-hawaii<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relat<wbr>ionship_between_child_pornography_a<wbr>nd_child_sexual_abuse<br><br>Food for thought<br>----------------<br>Falkvinge:<br>https://falkvinge.net/2012/05/23/cy<wbr>nicism-redefined-why-the-copyright-<wbr>lobby-loves-child-porn/<br>https://falkvinge.net/2012/09/07/th<wbr>ree-reasons-child-porn-must-be-re-l<wbr>egalized-in-the-coming-decade/<br>https://falkvinge.net/2012/09/11/ch<wbr>ild-porn-laws-arent-as-bad-as-you-t<wbr>hink-theyre-much-much-worse/<br><br>human-stupidity.com:<br>http://human-stupidity.com/irration<wbr>ality/stupid-dogma/child-porn-witch<wbr>-hunt<br>http://human-stupidity.com/stupid-d<wbr>ogma/child-porn-witch-hunt/watching<wbr>-child-pornography-victimizes-child<wbr>-voodoo-science<br><br>Wikileaks:<br>http://www.wikileaks.org/wiki/An_in<wbr>sight_into_child_porn</wbr></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></wbr></wbr></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></wbr></wbr></br></wbr></wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  They were legal, let's be honest.

Most people who fuck 16 year olds are in that age group anyway.</br>  <br> If she was teaching 12 year olds, well that would be a whole different kettle of fish. <br><br>Apparently not, mind that one bitch that got off with a warning for raping an 8 year old boy.<br><br>I mean I agree with you, but this is how it goes.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>1. Is the teacher hot: YES<br><br>2. Do you think the "kids" consented: YES<br><br>3. Do you think that beat their dicks to the "crime": YES<br><br>THEN NO FUCKING CRIME WAS COMMITTED. What other crime do people beat their dicks to (I guess that's not the best question to be asking here, but you get the point.)? And why is it they can try a 14 year old as an adult, but whenever there a prosecution again someone the age is never bumped to an adult status? The law is fucking ridiculous.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 17 years old <br><br>bitch plz, theyre treating her like she molested 6 yr olds</br></br></br>  <br>except judges and juries.</br>  Equality is a bitch! Isn't it?  <br>of course it's retarded but what are you gonna do? Kill all the retards? That shit ain't gonna work. You can't reason with them either because it's obviously not rational behavior. So, what do you propose? At least now everyone's fucked.</br>  <br><br>This<br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>That's snitching by proxy</br>  <br>I mean cmon. I know that justice and law should be objective, but surely there must be a biological and cultural difference between a 30 year old male teacher having sex with a 17 year old girl and a 30 year old female teacher having sex with a 17 year old boy?<br>She's fucking hot, you know. I'm just saying what i feel.</br></br>  <br>I'm they were bragging and someone got jelly</br>  <br> you should join NAMBLA <br>I don't want to legalize boy lovers, that's gross. fucking faggots.</br></br>  <br>what a shame, she is suck a beauty</br>  <br>the girls 30 m80<br>plus I would have fucked her given that chance.<br>what overly sexed teen in high school wouldnt?</br></br></br>  <br> yfw when she's a nigger lover and you would send to jail regardless of the age </br>  <br><br> It was 37 individual charges that's why it was so many years <br><br>Yeah that'll do it.<br><br>Basically every time she got fucked it counted as an act of statutory rape. So by the batshit standard of the law getting fucked 37 times by three 17 year olds is 37 times worse than getting fucked once.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>age of consent here is 16 anyway<br><br>america is, once again, backwards &amp; behind the times<br><br>feelsgoodtobeeuro</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> nigga who you hoping to convert on here? <br>biggots just like you<br><br><br> #stopPEDOPHOBIA </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck you takes two tango those 17 yr olds were no children.
