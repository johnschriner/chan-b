It is a timeless classic for a reason.<br><br>I'll be back. One of the best quotes of all time because it was both funny and true.<br>They don't make movies like this anymore.<br><br>It is like my uncle, he sent me a Christmas card which sad "Santa Claws" - You see, he wrote Claws instead of Clause. Now that's comedy, today's comedians could learn from that card.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>MURPH</br>  spooky shit  <br>Is it that bad ? I still need to watch it</br>    <br>Is it worth watching just for yolandi ?</br>    <br><br>What is a MURPH</br></br>    ded tred<br><br>Too bad it started well</br></br>  <br>This movie didn't age well. It was made before 911</br>  <br>You clearly did not saw Interstellar<br>Lucky you.</br></br>  <br>it's okay, could've been done much better imo<br><br>i fucking hated it, up to you</br></br></br>  I was 10 and like everyone else I thought how can they fuck up Mario?  <br>Interstellar. No good Sci fI these days.<br><br>Where's muh 5th element</br></br></br>  Birdman.<br><br>I was expecting so much from this movie, but the writing was just bad and there was just plots that went nowhere and some that just showed up without any back story.</br></br>  How has this not been posted.  <br>Meh I dont know if I have the time, Rocket League is killing me right now</br>  I thought it would be sci-fi. It turned out to be a bunch of stilted preschool dialogue and montages of looking at clothes, with an asshole "supergenius" who just happened to act like an average pseudo-intellectual asshole. <br><br>Between this and the absolute abomination that was "Her," I'm fed the fuck up with the state of modern sci-fi and am just about convinced it's my duty to pull out the trusty pencil and singlehandedly rescue the genre.</br></br>  <br> NOT 2 DAY SAYTEN</br>  <br>Waaaaat? This was funny. Had many a sensible chuckle.</br>  <br> singlehandedly rescue the genre <br><br>Nice</br></br></br>  <br>I could've written that post. Except the rescue part. I wouldn't wish filmmaking on my worst enemy.</br>  Really over hyped and boring  YOU HAVE TRIGGERED THE RARE WEEABOO<br><br>TRIPS KILLS IT, BUT ONLY IF YOU REPLY DIRECTLY TO THIS COMMENT</br></br>  <br>because it doesn't fucking exist, and it never will.</br>    <br> film needs more 9/11 </br>  <br>No one on /b/ currently ever saw that they wouldn't be born for 10-20 years</br>  <br><br>REPLY TO THIS IMAGE TO KILL IT WITH TRIPS</br></br>  <br>I've seen it and it was pretty good.</br>  <br>Soul power is the strongest force in the universe you faithless white nigger.</br>  don't deny it fags.  <br>It was quite good back when saddam was the biggest boogeyman we could imagine.<br><br>The music is still impressive to me, but so many other movies followed with edgy Shit that it just sounds like another edgy production.<br><br>I remember at some award show the Lindon Symphony Orchestra was playing ''uncle fucker" when trey and Matt took the stage at an event.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Birdman is god awful. The script is Troll 2 level foriegn. The performances are super off too.<br> Movie where main plot point is dude doesn't twitter or some shit. </br></br>  not sure if b8<br/>  Oh my fucking god this movie looks so fucking shitty you can't believe..life has disappointed me in yet another sorry ass cast  <br>Robin Williams singing blame Canada at the Oscars was amazing,</br>  <br>Keep talking to your imaginary friend.</br>  <br> disappointing <br> implying you actually expected that film to be good </br></br>  <br>I agree with Interstellar.<br>I heard a lot about it but it just seems a bit off. I am not a scientist or anything like that but even I know that ghosts don't exist. <br>So even if you fall into a black hole you won't become a ghost. That part ruined the movie for me a little bit. You would just fall forever, a black hole doesn't have a bottom to reach that is why they are called black holes to begin with.<br>So he should live for a long time, like 80 years or so while falling down the hole then die of old age.<br>But he came back a young ghost and not as his old 80 year old self?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You did not understand the clue, its not love or this fleetly bullshit... its the people from the future using their love for each other as a guild to lead them where they need to be to change the futures past and prevent the catastrophy.</br>  <br>what i hate most about this is that the rock guy is now a mean ass faggot. In the original movie he was atleast comedic, fucked it up.</br>  ITT: plebs criticizing something they don't even understand.  <br> but the writing was just bad and there was just plots that went nowhere and some that just showed up without any back story. <br><br>wow, you suck at movies</br></br></br>  <br> stilted preschool dialogue and montages of looking at clothes <br><br>wow, you fucking suck dude</br></br></br>  <br> terminator story <br> timeless classic <br><br>hehehe, funny, its a time travel story</br></br></br></br>  <br> You would just fall forever, a black hole doesn't have a bottom to reach that is why they are called black holes to begin with. <br><br>aaaaaand thats utter garbage</br></br></br>  <br>but ghosts do exist. I use to live with one and it would fuck with my brother and me monthly :(</br>  <br><br><br>actually good movies<br>you're just cynical</br></br></br></br>  <br>Jurassic World. <br><br>Decent to see at the cinema, like most films, but totally meh after watching it at home</br></br></br>  <br>its a cinema movie, i wonder what was in the first one that made it this good but i guess it could very well be the "it was the first"</br>  <br>Satanic trips of truth</br>  <br>I understood what the movie was going for, but it wasn't anything like I thought it would be and there were just so many problems with it. I'm also a pessimist so I'm pretty good at being disappointed.</br>  <br>  Live life like you were about to die the next day <br><br>Man, I'd be fucking depressed and probably cry a lot if I was going to die tomorrow. I would most likely just spend time with my family to say my good byes. <br>Take care of all the shit that needs taking care of so my family and friends doesn't have to worry about it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> They don't make movies like this anymore. <br>because the 80s are over and we don't circlejerk anymore about steroid pumped one liners.</br></br>    <br>Nothing about the Mario movie is good......</br>  <br>I think it's still amazing to this day.</br>  <br>Not the sharpest knife in the drawer, are you?</br>  actual shit movie here:<br>fuck off weebs it was shit. worst acting in movie history</br>  <br>This movie wins for most disappointing movie... hands down. I've never seen a worse turd than the Super Marios movie. There was a TON of hype because Mario was a relatively new thing in the early 90s and kids were crazy about that shit.... then everyone went to go and see this shitpile that was losely based on Mario, at best. Script was shit, directing was shit, plot was shit. Worse thing about it is it captured none of Marios wacky antics... it was just sort of a shitty depressing sci-fi with some of the same names as Mario characters.</br>  <br> 2015 <br> not owning a knife block <br>wtf kind of pleb keeps sharp knives in a drawer?</br></br></br>  <br>Did you even watch the movie? This was a masterpiece.</br>   &gt;/tv/   <br>No one. Hence the expression.</br>    <br> giant monster movie <br> good acting <br>Pick one</br></br></br>  <br>faggot weeaboo</br>  <br>if i was going to die tomorrow id try to do the things i would otherwise never do.<br><br>like rob a bank or maybe do something fun but expencive, like rend a water park for me and my friend, probably would pay people to do catering in the waterpark, and 10 prostitutes to help me make it enjoyable<br><br>anyone here want to be my friend? the water park would maybe hold 25 people, 5 catering and 10 prostitutes... :'(</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wow that's a lot of retardation here.</br>  <br>The new james bond movie will be shit with lots of action but no substance. Mark my words</br>  <br>Better than last year's Godzilla.</br>  <br>first king kong</br>  Going to be shit.  <br>knife blocks are unhygienic, and for restaurants they are banned in the EU<br><br>try again faggot, knife hangers ftw, let those knifes hang free like my balls.</br></br></br>  <br>Not watching it because the torch is a nigger.<br><br>I'll watch it when there's a movie about Martin Luther Coon played by a white guy.</br></br></br>  <br>My parents just took me out of the theatre, soooo many walked out I remember when they saw "bowser"</br>    <br>Yeah, now you circlejerk about gay vampires.<br>The shift in male role models explains a lot of the current faggotry — both around here and at large</br></br>  <br>That was your dad at night silly</br>  <br>dat loop<br>also checked</br></br>  <br>Almighty Lucifer has spoken</br>  <br>If anything I think her, along with whatever the crack head guys name is, are what made me hate the movie.</br>  <br> pessimist  <br>you mean edgy 14 year old?</br></br>  I can't even remember the name of it.<br>It is about this boxer, I think he is slightly retarded, in Philadelphia. Then some slow love story with some chick, I think she is slightly retarded, and he ends up buying turtles of her.<br><br>He is a no one but he still gets to fight the world champion. He gets his ass beaten but is like superman or whatever and stands up in the end.</br></br></br>  <br> this guy went to see the movie thinking it was about superheroes </br>  <br>You keep your butter knives in a knife block?</br>  <br>I went into Genysis thinking it would be the worst garbage I ever seen, it wasn't bad, acceptable actoin movie with some fun lines in it.</br>    <br>wtf i watched that trying to recognise what movie it was from and then it turned gay fast...</br>  <br>You do know its a comic book movie?</br>  <br>Thanks, Will Smith.<br>The fuck is he doing there, seriously?<br>"Let's go be heroes," or some shit in the trailer.<br>Let's go an hero.</br></br></br></br>  <br> torch being a nigger  <br> Probably /pol/'s favourite movie for 2015 </br></br>  <br>Careful with that one. It's so old it might fall apart.</br>  <br>He's an ignorant, unimaginative faggot whose mind has no ability to digest anything but the analogue of babyfood.</br>  <br>Debe.. <br> The fact that they're fucking kids is pretty effin' ridiculous</br></br>  <br>I didn't though. I went knowing it would be a drama that had little to do with superheros except that the guy use to play one.</br>  <br> bryan cranston shows: awesome <br> bryan cranston movies: utter shit </br></br>  <br>your butter knives are sharp?</br>  <br> its rambo u fag</br>  <br>Mine our</br>  It was okish but where are the bloody brits?  <br>Drive. checkmate, faggot</br>  <br>Same as you, but I think the best scene was when Kyle and Arnold were loading magazines in that father vs boyfriend kinda way.</br>  <br>Just like any other Daniel Bond movie.</br>  <br>/thread</br>    <br>These super hero movies are fucking terrible... They reboot them every 2 years.</br>  <br>Will Smith lost his credibility 10 years ago. He should just go home and retire.</br>  <br> disappointing movies <br>Nearly all movies made after 1997</br></br>  <br>Jaden should take over.</br>  <br>Yea i liked the relationship between pops and khaleesi, the main character was a total flatline, but seeing the future war shit was awesome, want more laser movies. Plus fighting young arnie was great.</br>  Don't forget seventh son.. holy fuck  <br>Underrated to the max.</br>  <br>you went into that thinking it was a sci-fi movie. when it was, in fact, a romance chick-flick.<br><br>the kind of shit that Lana Wachowski's would want to watch.</br></br></br>  <br>Found the redneck.</br>  <br> better than most movies made in the last 10 years </br>  <br>How did they justify his aging?</br>  <br><br>im so glad I clicked into this thread just to learn about this amazing moment.</br></br>  <br>Pretty much.....most of /b/ are still in middle school</br>  <br>I really can't think of a bigger waste of time than watching this fucking piece of shit.<br><br>Worst movie I've seen hands down. If you want to get revenge on someone you hate give them this.</br></br></br>  <br>Sounds more like Rocky</br>  <br>I agree.</br>  <br>didn't he say he could age in terminator 2? been a long time since I've seen it</br>  <br>It sure was fucking pretty</br>  <br>The second was infinitely better.</br>  Thoughts on Affleck becoming Batman?  <br>The terminator is cybernetic, but he is covered in organic tissue. The tissue ages.</br>  <br>Terminators use living tissue. It was explained in the first Terminator movie. It ages and everything. It does everything the real thing does. Couldn't infiltrate if you couldn't mimic real humans.</br>  <br><br>He had been living in the past for the certain amount of years, the human skin on his body aged the same as normal human skin since it was living. <br><br>In T2 he says he lasts 120 years on his current fuel cell.</br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw i agree with satan </br>  <br>directed by zack Snyder so it will be amazing. also Affleck was the bomb in phatoms</br>  <br>Underrated film</br>  <br>Found the nigger.</br>  <br> Movies that never stood a chance due to a hack director. </br>      <br>i think he is going to be better than we're expecting. i honestly do.</br>  <br>no, he said hes covered in human tissue, tahts it.</br>  <br>They need to stop making Batman movies. In fact, I blame Batman for all the awful superhero movies that followed. Except for the one with Danny DeVito. Fuck that was great casting.</br>  <br>It's not just sci-fi. Every genre now has to force romance into it which just kills it for me.</br>  <br><br> Robot Batman <br><br>Absolutely retarded<br>had the argument with some people about how easily superman would wipe batman out, they didnt seem to understand.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tippmann chronus <br> le rental baby tier gun <br><br>fucking ass....</br></br></br></br>  <br> cleft chin <br> mole on right cheek <br>Shit. We'll never figure out who batman is!<br><br>But this is the same universe that can't figure out Clark Kent is Superman because he wears glasses.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can't even right now.</br>  <br>ya maybe i'm just thinking about the part where he says his flesh can heal</br>  <br>Shamanlaniamama still think it's an amazing movie with no flaws, if you want cringe go watch any interviews with him talking about avatar</br>  <br> he lasts 120 years <br>Science now has one task: keep Arnold alive so he can make these movies until he's 120.</br></br>  <br>what did you say though? da fuq is tippman</br>  shit.  <br>It was less terrible than expected</br>  <br>Bad b8</br>  <br>Cringe yes.. Disappointing...? C'mon...</br>  I honestly enjoyed the first 2 Tobey Spiderman's as a kid but this was just pure cancer. Ended up watching it twice in the cinema the same day because friends wanted to  <br> pesimist <br>You should consider killing yourself?</br></br>    <br>Anybody who expected this to be anything other than a steaming pile of shit deserves to be disappointed, not just in movies but life in general.</br>  this film sucked balls  <br> directed by zack Snyder so it will be amazing <br>retarded faggot detected</br></br>  <br>A shark wouldn't even take this bait.</br>  <br>GET OUT<br><br> JAYDEN WAS SHIT IN KARATE KID AND HIS DAD WAS THE ONLY THING THAT SAVED THAT RETURN TO EARTH MOVIE </br></br></br>  <br>haha yes, that would be awesome.</br>  <br>Thank you, anon. Thank you for telling the truth.</br>  <br> movie for girls <br> literally everyone I know shit talks it to no end <br> never heard one oerson say: "yea, theyre pretty good." </br></br></br>  <br>That movie was absolute fucking shit</br>  <br>Underrated post</br>  <br>shit taste in movies detected</br>  <br> was obviously a shit movie to begin with </br>  <br>Only thing this movie was good for was reminding you that you weren't watching Jurassic Park instead.</br>  <br>what are you talking about? when do sharks take bait? its fishies and stuff you mongoloid</br>  <br>name me 2 good films by him. dont you dare say watchmen</br>  <br>did it insist upon itself?</br>  <br> Shamanlaniamama still think it's an amazing movie with no flaws <br><br>Is he just trying to see how far one man can fit his own head up his ass at this point?</br></br></br>  <br>Shut your fucking face, Uncle-Fucker!</br>  <br>kek</br>    <br>Don't worry anon I heard they are rebooting it with an all new diversified cast!</br>  <br>Watchmen was shit...</br>  <br>Chum. It's a fucking bucket of tampons and they come after it. Sharks will eat anything.<br><br>And why did you call me Asian?</br></br></br>  <br>300 (both of em, first one way better though obviously) suckerpunch dawn of the dead man of steel (watchmen)</br>  <br>Watch some of the interviews, its like he's stuck in a bubble world where he thinks it made billions</br>  <br>what does that even mean?</br>  <br>I know, it's quite a shame. RIP action.</br>  <br> mfw I'm the only one who thought the Garfield movies were better. </br>  <br>Oh so you can see into the future like Anakin Skywalker?</br>  <br>At least Jessica Alba stripped down in the<br>first one. This remake appears to be a joke.</br></br>  <br>it's not that they can't figure it out. it's the thought that Kent is Superman is laughable.<br><br>there's often mention to how much they look alike.</br></br></br>    <br>that was my point retard<br><br><br>1st 300 had some cool fight scenes but apart from that, utter bollocks. the other 3 i haven't seen but sound shit and haven't read very favorable reviews. watchmen is fucking dire. kill yourself and zack snyder whilst your at it</br></br></br></br>  <br> Will Smith </br>  No where as good as the original, mostly because shit is too family friendly now.... The original showed kids drinking,smoking wearing halter tops and microskirts  My favorite movie is Paul Blart Mall cop 1 and 2.  <br>Didn't she get fucked by the Hulk in the last one?<br>I wonder if they'll add that scene to this one as well.</br></br>  <br>The directors cut of this is much better.<br>Give it a chance.</br></br>  <br>This.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Family Guy</br></br></br></br>    <br>its not a bryan cranston movie, tard. he was hardly in it</br>  <br> suckerpunch <br><br>That movie was fucking terrible.</br></br></br>  <br>Automatic windows updates. <br><br>Heyoo</br></br></br>  <br> implying non-Craig Bond movies were deep, heady &amp; intelligent explorations of world politics and espionage </br>  <br>yeah i was doing brians bit you fucknut</br>  <br>I got the DVD..<br>It's too much CGI and dull story for me.. Not to say it doesn't have a load of potential cause it does</br></br>  <br>I find your idiocy and hyperboles disturbing.</br>  <br>okay let's get something straight here.<br> Movie was fucking terrible, yes. <br> but soundtrack was good </br></br></br>  <br>One of the two meanings of mongoloid is someone with Down's syndrome, you mongoloid</br>    <br>In what world was that a hyperbole?</br>  <br>It's been like 4 years since I've seen that episode but fuck me right?</br>    <br>same could be said for godzilla</br>  <br>That was the magic of the 70's before the muh children craze of the 80's took full root.</br>  <br>toby literally ruined spider-man</br>  <br>fuck you zoidberg</br>  <br>You're thinking of this fake.</br>  <br>Craig is an uncouth brute. His predecessors were much smoother.</br>  <br>Ok, I'll give you the soundtrack was awesome but that just makes the want to buy the soundtrack while burning the movie.</br>  <br>not even seen the movie, looked at poster<br> jason statham <br><br>k</br></br></br></br>  <br>I haven't seen the movie but it would have been better if it was about Harvey Birdman.</br>  Gandhi 2 - The Empire Strikes Back  <br>Best comic movie of all time.</br>    <br> implying it wasn't X-Men 1 that kicked off the superhero mania which is now dominating Hollywood </br>  <br>Earth, society, everywhere that's not 4chan. It's like when 4chan is a alternate dimension where common sense doesn't abide and the opinions of most are ass-backwards. Also even facts can be argued about on here as if they held no merit. This place is retched hive of dumb and villainy.</br>  You probably saw the digital edition. You should watch the analog original, much better.  <br>bro I didn't get it and i'm smart so it must have been bad</br>   shit cast <br> too much fucking blood <br> too much slashing and hacking off limbs <br> not scary like original <br> no Ash Willians (Bruce Campbell) <br> Bruce says "groovy" in after the credits as a shadow like figure <br> mfw still no Bruce  <br>Wtf has the movie industry come to?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Jurassic World <br>Was shit</br></br>  <br>never forget being excited for this piece of shit. <br><br>never trusted another super hero movie after.</br></br></br>  <br> directed by zack Snyder so it will be amazing <br><br>retard<br><br>Snyder can't do 3d. Everything he directs has to have 100% of its entirely on the surface. There is subtlety, no sub-plot, no suggested tensions/relationships.<br><br>He took Watchmen and made it all flashy and removed all the grit and complexity.<br><br>Snyder is a dickbutt.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying he was talking about Christian bale batman and not Michael keaton </br>  <br>jason statham is a cool dude il have you know</br>  <br>*wretched<br><br>Clearly you are helping to supply the dumb in your analogy.</br></br></br>  <br>Spider man 2 started that as it showed comic book movies can make big big money</br>  <br>Have you seen 'Automata' with Antonio Banderas? I really liked that one, a better take on AI imho than that shit movie.</br>  <br>Don't judge a movie by its trailer that you shouldn't even have seen.</br>  <br>Lol. This movie wasn't bad. It wasn't fantastically great like the first one, but it wasn't bad at all.<br><br><br>This one was pretty lame. It wanted to be an over the top action beat 'em up robotz film, but it took itself too seriously at the same time. Fell totally flat. 0/10 soundtrack too, 99% bass 1% hot gas.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ohhh yeah<br>"man I love space too much to be a farmer "<br>"he hey man go to space and time travel "<br>"yusssss"<br>Time travel<br>"hey granddaughter, imma fuck dis bitch who be waiting on me in the black hole lata"</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was never going to live up to the original</br>  <br> exploring the bix nood side of the force </br>  <br>this</br>  <br>jason statham is a better actor than he gets credit for. he just made the wrong decision by moving to the USA and being cast as an action hero.<br><br>he did it for the money, and we would all do the same thing.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=wSo<wbr>dvRnD3Qc</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br>  Every remake of King Kong for one.  <br>Yeah Watchmen was good you ass hat</br>  <br>By leaving out a letter while you didn't even bother to retort to the post in it's totality?</br>  <br> God tier film </br>  <br> thats the point </br>  <br>Agreed, though to be honest even if they tried to stay faithful to the original and had camp it still would have failed.</br>  <br> chick movie <br> not going directly to the trash </br></br>  <br>i know he was talking about Burton shitbrains. he said Danny DeVito ffs</br>  AVATAR    First potc was awesome, second one ruined the characters and each one since has been mediocre  this sucked. whoever calls this a masterpiece is a fucking retard  <br>HAHAHAHA <br><br>Nice try faggot</br></br></br>  Withnail &amp; I  <br>Still ain't seen this yet <br>Are the driving scenes good atleast?</br></br>  <br>then why would a movie made like 20 years later be the one that started the superhero craze?</br>  <br>The Brits were too much of a pussy after WWII. That's why Gandhi won in the first place. Their country would just feel sorry for India, prostrate themselves before them, and suck their dicks. Can hardly call them an empire anymore.</br>  <br>i thought it was a pretty great movie<br><br>if you think they were trying to replicate the original you're mistaken. it's not all about pulling out Bruce fucking Campbell. they were obvs stepping away from the campy comedy and fitting Evil Dead into modern horror cinema, which they did pretty well.<br><br>much as I love Bruce, he has no place in modern horror. that's why we have My Name is Bruce and the his upcoming TV show which are pretty much slapsticks</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> There are two sides to the force Luquenzel Skywalker. The dark side and the heagudboi side. </br>  I'm not even trolling. Genuinely interested to know, why do people find this so good?  <br> mfw they make movies after Disney rides <br><br>I was surprised the first one was so good. I did, however, know that they were going to milk the franchise to its death and sell tickets to see the corpse. Kinda a given unfortunately.</br></br></br>  <br>Plotless boring plodding. I don't get it either.</br>  <br>I was being serious.<br><br><br>Driving scenes are ok at times.</br></br></br></br>  <br>lol @ you for watching that piece of shit</br>  <br> 20 years later <br> superhero movies really took off after x-men <br> 20 year gap <br><br>do the fucking math shitbrain</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The action is great the plot is terrible and the actors vary from good to bad.</br>  <br>Not dissapointing if you don't have high expectations for it, besides the fact that it's not even out</br>  <br>Historical context is important when watching a lot of these movies. They're a classic because they had a VERY significant impact on films, filmmaking, and the way people look at cinema today.</br>  <br> Mr Wolf <br><br>Good film though, Give it a watch</br></br></br>  <br>hahahahahahahaha<br><br>gud b8 m8</br></br></br>  <br>right cause all the superhero movies between 1989 and xmen 1 were flops I guess.....</br>  So much disappointment was presented.  <br>you shut your fucking mouth</br>  <br>I was just asking, what part of which statement did you think was a hyperbole?<br><br>Was it because he said it was going to suck?<br>That is just a predictive opinion.<br><br>Saying the reason he thinks it will suck is because Will Smith is in it?<br>Why would that be a hyperbole if he honestly just doesn't like Will Smith's acting?<br><br>I just get the feeling you are trying to use words that you don't fully understand. <br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/629886592#p629897223">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Pleb of plebs </br>  <br>My name is b8</br>  Post your hand and let others guess your job.  hooker<br>that looks like a handjobs hand to me</br>  <br>Either thief or no job</br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br>Hand model</br>  <br><br>No</br></br>  <br>Don't /thread yourself you faggot</br>  why does it look like you wipe your ass with your bare hand?<br>it looks like you have a film of smegma covering it</br>  Public masturbator ?  <br>criminal</br>  <br>a faggot</br>  <br><br><br>Nope</br></br></br>  <br>janitor!</br>    <br>Well I do mop floors from time to time but that's not it</br>    <br>Carpenter?</br>  <br>Wow spot on guess... how did you know?</br>  <br>eva pilot</br>  <br>Obvious background is obvious</br>  <br>Here's mine</br>        <br>Hands are too delicate for me to guess</br>  <br><br><br><br>jobless</br></br></br></br>  <br>cock stroker</br>  <br>You got me</br>  <br>I'll give a hint, I do alot of heavy lifting.</br>  <br><br>Nope, Actually a roadworker but recently graduated so not been working for more than 2 months</br></br>  <br>You didn't get me though!
