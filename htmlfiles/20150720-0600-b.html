[ I have a massive unusable horse dick. Ask me anything /b/...  How big?  <br>How you feel about no having a women that really love you cause you could break it.</br>  <br>aren't you the guy from chatroulette?</br>  Wow. That's impressive  <br>8" long. 6" around. By internet standards that's not massive because everyone here has an 8 inch dick. But in reality all of my sexually experiences (especially casually) have been slightly worse because of my pee pees size.</br>  <br> unusable <br><br>how so?</br></br></br>  Can you such your own cock?<br><br>I must know!</br></br>  <br>well it is usable, just not all of it most of the time which is frustrating for both parties</br>  <br>I can kiss the tip. It's much more romantic.</br>  <br>And pics? I don't need to see face.</br>  How often do you get complaints about hitting too deep?<br>How often are the complaints instead about it being too thick to be pleasant? Or just thick enough that they'd like it a little thinner.<br>Got a 7' by 6'er that I've never used so curious.</br></br>  <br>shooped timestamp gg</br>  Looks so juicy OP...  I'll suck your dick man. I mean, I'm a straight dude but that's a pretty nice dick.  <br>If you could choose between keeping your dick or having a &lt;4in dick with average girth, which would you choose?</br>  can you suck your own dick?  <br>Out of about 10 girls i've only had only one girl who actually enjoyed the cervix smashing so i've usually had to hold back my thrusts which is difficult when your getting passionate haha.<br><br>My dicks really wide so i've had many issues, vaginal tears, UTIs, you name it. But most girls usually grow to like it.</br></br></br>  <br>i'd keep my dick as is.<br><br>Ideally i would probably lose and inch in length.</br></br></br>  <br><br>git gud. i have same size dick and i get no complaints, only orgasms.</br></br>  <br>I know a few lads with 8-10" who went gay coz only gay men can take it</br>  <br><br>Same, I'm 8.5 by 6.5 and I've only ever had one girl in 7 years get upset, she bled almost immediately and we never got to try again.<br><br>Aside from that stupid cunt bitch whore who turned out to be precisely that, every other girl big and small has taken it just fine, easier with baby oil but fine without - and most of them have been able to take the majority of it which is plenty for smashing hard.<br><br>You never get to use "all" of it in sex outside of very few positions and a genuine attempt at pushing the whole length in slowly and awkwardly.<br><br>OP = full of shit, looking for ego boost.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>that's really not that large. I think you should measure correctly it's clearly less 8''.</br>  <br>Faggot cockjockey here. I would love to go to town on that. I've taken similarly sized cock in the ass and loved every second on it. One guy had me cum on his cock twice just from fucking me in the ass before he blew his load in me. <br><br>So unusable... no fucking way.</br></br></br>  Not OP but same situation.<br>You just gotta find the right girl. You can't tell by looking at them. You have to stick it in and find out.<br>Also, I have assfucked a trap and he loved it.</br></br>  <br>ITT: guys saying they have 8"+ dicks.<br>Actually ITT: Microdick lies</br></br>  <br>I understand the feel OP. I have a 9" long (8" if you don't include balls) and no chick wants it cuz they're scared or something. Shit fucking sucks.</br>  <br><br>girl doesn't fucking matter. get it wet, get them horny, it will go fine. your cock is smaller than a baby.</br></br>  <br>Have the bitch lube her hand, and/or grab the base of your cock so it feel like your going all the way and she's protecting her cervix at the same time.<br><br>Hell... I'm only 6x6 and I bottom out with my current fuck buddy (she's small though). she like it... if i fuck her too hard for too long she does get sore though... hell even my dick will get sore from smashing too much...<br><br>you could always fuck their ass too.... bet you could pound balls deep no problem</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you don't include the balls<br>are the balls your dick?<br>fuckin retard</br></br></br>  <br>It will go in fine, once it didn't she was tighter than my fist. But some girls are just not deep enough to take everything and some of those girls don't like the feeling when you hit bottom.<br><br>Some girls REALLY like big dicks though. Go find of those bitches.</br></br></br>   go on omegle <br> post wins </br>  <br>just go gay faggot. most fags would love that thing off, myself included</br>  <br> (8" if you don't include balls) <br>LMAO who the fuck includes balls anyway</br></br>  <br>this....<br><br><br>including balls in a dick measurement is full on retarded. my guess is he's really got a 2 inch micropenis... that or he's a minor... since he obviously doesn't know how this game works...</br></br></br></br>  <br>Do the helicopter with a semi</br>  <br>kill yourself, faggot</br>  <br> (if you don't include balls) <br> My balls are one inch </br></br>  <br>It ain't easy if he's straight</br>  my dick is 7.5-8-ish but hard to measure cause it curves downwards, never had any problems with it being too large  <br>It aint easy if he's gay either.. the 2 guys I've fucked they have told me to stop because Im too big for them.. so it just ends up with me getting fucked by everyone... good thing Im a real sub</br>  <br> he measure from the bottom and stops where the balls start.  <br>this is why everyone on here thinks they have 8 inches. They're measuring the outside curvature and not from the pubis. Boy are they about to get a self confidence destroyer.</br></br>  <br> immediately <br><br>Agreed - he's probably just a terrible lover. I've not nearly identical dimensions to what he's describing and girls go crazy for my shit - I had a girlsay she wasn't going to sleep with me and then change her mind once she saw my dick.<br><br>Foreplay motherfucker.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>tell me again how the girls can't possibly handle your huge horse cock.</br></br>  <br>I bet you're 8x6 too, if you include the edge.</br>  post a chick you banged  <br> horse dick  <br>8 inch</br></br>    <br>read that shit yo'self. Most girls can. Out of 100 I would say there have been three that couldn't and only one of them REALLY didn't like it when I was bottoming out.<br>That help you bro?</br></br>  <br>you start</br>  Could I turn you gay?  <br>lol... you amateur....<br><br>I guess you'd be pretty upset to know that works 9 times out of 10 even with a normal (6x6) sized dick. A trick to getting girls in the sack it pull your dick out. when girls see a dick... they get horny... just like guys. Some try to hide it... but it's not so much the size that sways them as it is general aesthetics</br></br></br>  Op from above. I can try and get an accurate measurement to disprove the unbelievers if you wish.  <br>You could get yourself murdered. Remember you're still a faggot and there are people that would enjoy draining the life from your worthless diseased body.</br>  <br>assbro?</br>  <br> op from above <br><br>you wot m8? I guess we know where mother nature put your brains...</br></br></br>  <br>Im 6.5 and it gives me no problems</br>  <br><br>Become a porn actor, fag</br></br>  <br>Horse penises are 16+ inches, so... no.<br><br>Also, noice Photoshop of timestamp. Well played.</br></br></br>  <br> dick cancer </br>  <br>You're only slightly longer than me and we're the same girth. Chicks love me dick. Lots of foreplay and teasing until they're dying for it, and then either they're on top or you control the depth of your stroke. Heaven.</br>  <br>op are u devilishly attractive or are you forever stuck as uglybro with big dick</br>  <br>measure from the pelvic bone to the tip of the erect penis along the top faggot</br>  How far can your cum fly  <br>No<br><br><br>This op?</br></br></br></br>  <br>i bet he can do big cums</br>  <br>See </br>  <br>I remember you from yesterday.</br>  <br><br>I would like to see your face. kik me?</br></br>  <br>when she has a baby you'll need a catcher's mitt. the little fucker will shoot out of her like a canonball.</br>  <br>You mean this guy?</br>  <br>No offense but it will never happen. Too paranoid.</br>  <br>Yes, because child labor is so satisfying</br>  <br>Too paranoid to show face, but you will still shove a bottle and a shaver up your ass and post it. Don't know where I'm going with that one. Guess I just want to see your face.</br>  <br>Rashy ass is back</br>  <br>8"? you must have really small hands because it looks like 11-12"</br>  <br>He spanks it.</br>  <br>Fa-fa-fa-ke<br>do re mi fake</br></br>  <br>Is that what he says?<br>Sorry, that's not red from spanking</br></br>  <br>That is the story. How can you be sure it's not from spanking?</br>  <br><br>Lol it's from spanking I swear!<br><br><br>Shoving glass up my ass isn't nearly as risk-taking as showing my face</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>did he put a tablet in his dick</br>  OP, just find a trap. You got a few feet of colon to work with then.  <br>You think I just happen to have rashes perfectly on both cheeks? Really?<br><br>If anyone here has pics of me before the spanking please post them.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>y'all act like you never seen a cock before.<br><br>hope the girls say they like your baby-smooth prepubescent boy peeners.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Where do you live?</br>  Is this large cock thead?<br>Here's mine.</br>  <br>head looks kind of funny<br>weird how it gets fat in the middle<br>also weird that your pube hair matches your leg hair</br></br></br>  Yet again I find myself in a dick thread where everyone is claiming to have 8" dicks. Where did I go wrong in life?  <br><br>Austin</br></br>  <br> dat expression.. <br>b-but size doesn't matter right guise</br></br>  <br>Keep it weird anon.</br>  <br><br><br> claiming </br></br></br>  <br>I go to UTSA, we meet up in the fall and fuck or what fag?</br>  <br>Bullshit. Baby oil is not to be used as a lube. It can only be used externally or you can get fucked. So your dick is probably around 5-6 inches with average girth.</br>  <br><br> muh nigga </br></br>  <br> Bullshit. Baby oil is not to be used as a lube. <br>GTFO, fucking virgin</br></br>  Most girls like the idea of a big dick more than the feel. My buddy has a 9 incher and most girls don't like it. He says most sex is super awkward and girls won't let him all the way in which sucks for him.<br><br>My ex is also with a guy she says has a huge dick. She hates fucking him as it's painful and avoids sex with him as much as possible. She fucks me on the side because my dick "is a perfect fit". <br><br>I'm only 6 inches. <br><br>As long as you don't have a babby dick you're ok.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>nice razorburn on your ASS</br>  <br>how do you shave your ass?</br>  <br>You already have a thread. Why are you attention whoring into this one</br>  <br>It's the truth. I believe you would be the virgin in this situation. Everyone knows you don't use babyoil as lube.</br>  <br><br>dude ... she fucks you on the side because she's a slut.<br><br>she's probably telling him that his big dick is awesome and you never used to satisfy her.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You got fucking train rekt by</br>  <br>Actually it's from spanking.<br><br><br>With just a regular razor..why?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>or else what? you don't use it with latex condoms because it's not water-based, but wtf do you think is going to happen if you use it without condoms? total protonic reversal?</br></br>  <br>As he still get pussy</br>  <br><br>dude having hair thats the same color is the norm. i thin youre dick is fucked up.</br></br>  <br>like near your ass hole?</br>  <br>Yep, first of all nobody has a time stamp except op, which is fake as fuck. So until legit time stamps are given all these are just claims. <br><br>And second of the statistical likelihood of all 10 or so people claiming to have dicks above 8" just doesn't make any sense. <br><br> tl:dr  <br>You're a fag and please die of aids</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>stop talking, samefaggot.</br>  <br>This. He still has a bigger dick than you and you never be more of a man than him or have as much confidence as him because you're only average.</br>  <br><br>Because I'm greedy.<br>And bored.<br>And drunk.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I know you have a bottle on hand because all you do is masturbate. Read the label and then kill yourself.</br>  <br>not talking about colour. am referring to the density.</br>  <br>You wish I was same fagging</br>  <br>Knowledge without using it is stupid. If you've realised how to use a normal dick, dick size doesn't matter.<br>  maybe only Scorpios get this </br></br>  <br>well, it doesn't. it may be nice to look at but you won't get it wet completely</br>  <br>That's a dude's ass btw</br>  <br>Don't forget ugly</br>  <br><br>you are bad at statistics, cause this ain't no random sample.<br><br>the rate of 8" cocks is about 1 in 100, so if 1000 people saw this thread 10 of them have 8" cocks. those 10 people are way more likely to post than the 4"ers, so you end up with a thread with 50 people in it and 10 guys with 8" cocks.</br></br></br></br>  I'd like to see that fucking my girl.  <br>really? no way? you don't say?</br>  <br><br>dude with tiny dick confirmed.</br></br>  <br>You prob went wrong a little before you were born<br><br>But that is also your fault</br></br></br>   dick thread <br> attracting faggots <br> people thinking any human would dump em for a bigger dick (other than pretending they did, to hurt your feelings) <br> note that fags might actually leave you for a bigger dick <br> stop being a faggot </br></br></br></br>  <br>eh, he's quite paranoid me thinks - notice the chair holding the door, kek</br>  <br> Where did I go wrong in life <br>Typing 4chan.org/b into your browser.</br></br>  <br>How do you feel about getting more attention from faggots than females?</br>  Ask a guy who's learning C programming anything.

Remember, people don't get hired at good jobs because they know how to program - it's because they know how to program CREATIVELY.  <br>Sounds like a shit school with no real Computer Science department.

Because the C standard makes no guarantee that function arguments will be evaluated in the order that they're given, the value of a + b could either be 30 or 31, so this program produces undefined behaviour.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> c <br> methods <br> private <br><br>C isn't object orientated</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yup.

I doubt anyone here would actually be like this in real life. Most serious discussions here seem pretty level headed.  <br>C# =\= C dumb fuck</br>  <br>Yes it compiles just fine, but it's still undefined. Some compilers would produce a program that prints "10, 30", and others "10, 31".</br>  <br>Why did you pick the most deprecated and useless language?</br>  <br>Only somewhat as C isn't OOP. There are no methods for example, so use structs for objects and use functions that take a pointer to the struct to simulate methods.</br>  C++ is best C  <br><br>Probably immigrant in Norway.</br></br>  <br><br>oh shit, I finally get to call a black person a nigger to their face without consequences :D<br><br>Did you steal that ancient book from someone's house recently?

Usually these losers will talk up the people they know and make it out to be a win for themselves to know or be related to people who succeed at life, but when asked about their own accomplishments, they change the subject and turn back to admiring you to try and win your attention.<br><br>Always avoid these people. They are users and will always take but never give.

She was easy enough to find (She asked me out) and i've based my guidelines off of what she has/hasn't which I despised exes in the past having. <br><br>95% of girls may usually fit in those categories, but I don't want to date 95% of girls.</br></br></br>  <br>repost from previous thread:<br><br>I wouldn't say it's an immediate red flag, but a certain orange flag is child of divorce.<br><br>Children of divorce tend to be a lot more unsettled and have more skeptical attitudes towards long term relationships. People inherently look to their own parents as a model for how their relationship should be.<br><br>I've dated girls who have been from divorced families, and the relationships have often taken sudden bad turns because the girl starts to pick holes in the relationship, almost as if she wants to find problems.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Find a girl would gives all her attention to you and isn't an attention whore (protip a good family = better upbrining = better values) and constantly improve yourself to make sure you perceived social value doesn't stagnate/decrease.</br>  <br><br>Often when a girl has a "best guy friend" he's her fallback incase her number 1 choice in Men doesn't work out. <br><br>When I got my current girlfriend, 3 different Women I called friends stopped talking to me completely, 1 of them tried desperately to make sure my GF left me, another suddenly started throwing herself at me at every opportunity.<br><br>The funny thing was I didn't consider these Women friends in the real sense, just people I was friendly with at work, occasionally ate lunch with.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>funny, that best guy friend she broke up with me for, she did the same thing with him to be with another guy</br>  <br>/thread<br>The heart wants what the heart wants</br></br>  <br>but not every heart anon</br>  If a girls not a feminist.<br>Not even trolling, I like strong women who can recognize and stand against inequality</br>  <br>underrated post<br>my ex probably had what people would consider red flags, but I loved her to death.</br></br>  <br>You speak the truth. Holy shit last two relationships were from divorced parents and just like you said they try and find problems</br>  <br> implying 95% of girls arent crazy </br>  <br><br> best friend is a guy <br><br>This is a huge red flag. One of my girlfriend's friends just dumped her boyfriend of 5 years to be with her "best friend." The whole time there was tension between that girl and her "best friend." Everyone saw it except the two couples.<br><br>Guys and girls just can't be friends, someone always ends up wanting more.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> suddenly picking holes in the relationship <br><br>This has nothing to do with them being from divorced marriages. They just aren't happy in the relationship and are trying to rationalize why. <br><br>In alot of ways you are correct, their parent's relationship is a big indicator of how they will perform in a relationship. They will unconsciously mimic their parent's relationship because that is what they know.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   she was molested as a kid   <br> implying 5% are sane </br>  <br>i was the one being left for the best guy friend<br><br>disappotingi</br></br></br>  <br> They will unconsciously mimic their parent's relationship because that is what they know. <br>my ex, when she brokje up, came with the "look how my parents ended up" thing<br><br>she knew that she was wrong but still said it<br>i told her so many times that we were noth like her parents...</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's had 10+ partners by 20, big red flag.</br>  It's a red flag for me when her dick is bigger than mine.  <br>She likes rap music.</br>   she has brothers that are significantly older than her   <br>This is what you're getting in bed friend.</br>   you were still watching cartoons at the age she became sexually active   <br>I know right, probably molested at night by them when younger</br>  <br> nviting them self over to use your game console <br><br>I remember being 16 once</br></br></br>  None of the following - diseases, black (not being racist considering I'm mixed but black chicks are fucking crazy). I can't think of any more.  <br>Had that with latest ex. Found out she had over 40 partners (admittedly, but as she reluctantly first said about 20 that became 30 then 40 I tend to feel this is an underestimation). She's 23.<br>Part of the reason was that she had very low self-confidence (huge red flag as well), and wouldn't get involved in any relationship. Emotions were not something she could handle, she would not bear the fact she was doing some things wrong. So she preferred having multiple one-night stands when she needed to bang rather than getting a bf, which involved implication. <br><br>Another red flag : childish behavior with no patience whatsoever (again, my ex).</br></br></br></br>  <br>And her Freudian desire to be more like big brother, who is only interested in sex at his age.</br>  <br> childish behavior with no patience whatsoever <br>as in?</br></br>  <br>Omg stopthisstupid shit. <br><br>You either like the person or you don't.<br><br>Fuck you are the biggest red flag out there</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I was the best friend<br><br>It's not much better. Kind of annoying</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm the anon you were responding to. I agree with you, but looking for problems in the relationship is a very common problem when girls are unhappy. <br><br> came with the "look how my parents ended up" thing <br>My girlfriend did the same thing before we dated. Her parents are in a miserable relationship and she was worried she would end up the same way. Its been a fairly good 2 years though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Haha I love this gif.

And yet she would remain silent and cold throughout the whole conversation.<br>Pretty much the "I'm entitled to anything except doing the stuff I expect people to do" kind of behavior. Like a spoiled brat. She would get so angry when I was not abiding by her shitty rules.<br><br> mfw I dumped her </br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>2nd guy here<br><br>she was a virgin before me.<br><br>thinking that she had sex with her best guy friend is making me puke</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>When did it all start to fall apart? I'm the guy you're replying to.<br><br>Ignore the idiot saying that a virgin isn't possible. It's really more of an annoyance than anything. I enjoy that I get to be the first guy she does anything with (short of a peck on the lips that she shared with an ex), but it's a long and difficult road to take the virginity of a girl that has waited so long.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hate that crap, never know which girl is abused because it could be anyone and when she does bring that discussion it makes you see red and break shit.</br>  <br>Here are someone's that are not overly subjective.<br><br> cuts herself <br> threatens suicide for every little fucking thing <br> is massively self absorbed  <br> unwilling to compromise <br> is in constant contact with his/her ex <br> makes up stuff for attention <br> schizophrenic or bi-polar <br> does hard drugs on a consistent basis <br> is a radical feminist </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not all gay guys are like that just like all black people don't steal bikes. Stop it.</br>  <br>1. Get in a relationship.<br><br>2. Have it end messily.<br><br>3. Come back and tell me you don't want to avoid that in the future.</br></br></br></br></br>    Hangs with mostly guys cause "its less drama" <br>  No plans for solid career <br>  says shes a feminist <br>  Does not wear heels/dresses at formal events <br>  Does not excercise regularly <br>  utilizes typical female "mindgames" </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I agree. If she's always into then it is a problem. I get frustrated sometimes with my girlfriend when she listens to rap music occasionally. I tell her to turn off the nigger music and she says "it's not nigger music, its call fun music." Such is society today. It's mostly because rap music is one of the few genres left where the man isn't a neutered faggot crying about his problems.</br></br>  <br>Super gays have the best weddings so you can shut it</br>  <br><br>Shit man I was the best friend.</br></br>  <br>Red flag: When she's fresh out of a relationship.<br> &gt;Take girl to meet my friends. <br> &gt;They say, "she's a lot of personality" <br> &gt;Tell girl <br> &gt;She goes off on me <br> &gt;She invites me to a second party <br> &gt;She calls her friend to pick take her to third party. <br> &gt;We leave third party <br> &gt;Yells at me for drinking and driving <br> &gt;Had 6 beers over 8 hours <br> &gt;Be 6 blocks from her house <br> &gt;Ask her if she's more comfortable walking home <br> &gt;She says yes <br> &gt;Drop her off at sidewalk <br> &gt;She calls me next day to yell at me <br> &gt;See her at random party <br> &gt;She acts like nothing happened </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Take her word with a grain of salt, younger women do in fact lie about their virginity to give you the illusion that you're special. Private school girls are extremely notable for this.</br>  <br> not understanding the difference between an actual feminist and tumblr SJW </br>  <br> When did it all start to fall apart? <br>well<br>minor red flags here and there<br><br>but it fell apart when she broke up to be with said best guy friend.<br><br>some weeks later, when she came by grabbing some stuff, she told me the thing between them was going on for 2 months prior the breakup.<br><br>funny enough she said we had to be together for atleast half a year for sex, 6 weeks in and we had our first time</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I clearly typed "super gays". I don't give a fuck who steals bikes, as long as they're not loud and have reading comprehension.

There was no need for you to do it.</br>  <br>So not only was she a whore, she was also a total cunt<br>jeez how have you done that</br></br>  <br>Yeah, but he did mention super gays you fucking faggot.</br>  <br>Sends nudes</br>  <br> People who hang out with super gays are just too loud for my tastes <br><br> Not all gay guys are like that <br>You saying not all gay guys are super? Fuck you m8</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That sucks. I've been with my girlfriend a year and a half. She is a virgin. We tried to have sex 6 months and 3 months ago. Each time was too painful for her. We do everything but have sex. We've been meaning to go to the doctor but haven't gotten a chance. She makes me happy, and I don't mind waiting, there are far more intimate things than sex anyway.</br></br>  <br> &gt;Girl stares at me like I'm a piece of meat <br> &gt;Tell her I don't encourage cheating <br> &gt;Week passes <br> &gt;She tells me she's in an open relationship <br> &gt;Tells me she'd fuck me <br> &gt;Finds out I own a gun <br> &gt;Says we can't be together because I believe in violence <br> &gt;Never talk to her again. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thing is, that guy you replied to with your post didn't mention gays either. There was no need for you to be this stupid, yet you are.</br>  <br>Crippled black guys don't count. I've never seen a black capable of stealing bikes who didn't.</br>  <br>my ex had endometriosis, so we couldn't have sex for weeks before and after her surgery cause it was too painful.</br>    <br><br>see <br><br>No he motherfucking didn't.

Try harder.</br>  <br>Do you make sure to take it in the ass from the cops too before they leave?</br>   fucks black guys   <br>Agreed with the no compromise stuff. Only unadapted immature people do that.<br><br><br> the ex <br>Any slight hint that the ex is anything more than an ex to her is a red flag.<br><br> mfw I found out months afterwards that my ex's ex had sent her a present for her birthday to get back with her <br> mfw I remembered she proudly showed it to me as something she bought herself at the time <br> mfw the present had been sitting next to her bed the whole time </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The theory in discussions like this is that red flags are early warning signals for bigger problems. They are manifest symptoms of bigger problems.</br>  <br><br>I'm in NC. Call the cops all you want, I can have half an ounce and only get a ticket. I would just nope face them until they left anyway.</br></br>   keeps anything given from former relationship   <br>This is true, but this "manly" lyrical content on the radio today is almost entirely about "whipping out muh dick and date raping your girlfriend." I really miss back when, 10 years ago, every other line was a blatantly homophobic statement. The innuendos are becoming subtle enough to slip past censorship until some 9 year old girl echos the lyrics in front of father. This lack of talent made up for in flashiness would be acceptable if the rest of the musical components weren't computer generated, "autotuned" garbage.</br>  <br>i feel wit hthat ex</br>  <br>That's why you need to date a chick with a small-moderate crazy tendencies. Someone who has descended into the abyss of lunacy cannot be helped.</br>  BY FAR THE BIGGEST FUCKING RED FLAG IN EXISTENCE:<br><br> Talks about her ex(s) all the time <br><br>seriously. She starts talking about them fucking run.</br></br></br></br>  Met a girl named Malinda in college. Had lunch a bunch of times. One day I stained my shirt and needed to use her sink, since she lived on campus. She was crying b/c her bf blah blah blah. One day I told her that if she's ever single, I want to date her. Because of work, school and my dad was dying, I don't talk to her for a year. While taking care of my dad, I get fit and drop some 60 lbs of fatassery. Come back to school, see her at a local bar. We start dating. We plan a trip to Las Vegas with my roommate and her. Roommate invites 1 too many people to fit in the car. Tell the girl that the trip is cancelled and we should go somewhere else for that weekend. She flips out and tells me I screwed her over.<br><br>TL:DR Don't date girls on the rebound. Hit and quit.</br></br>  <br>i'm sure they won't enjoy repeatedly having to give you tickets</br>  <br> tfw my gf is all of them apart from drugs/feminist <br> tfw I wont leave because Id rather hug a whore than hug no one </br></br>  <br>But in blacks it's every individual chimp</br>  <br>Woah there, nobody mentioned things and dynamics. And woah woah woah, trying hard? Please be more considerate before posting, There was no need for you to do that.</br>  <br> &gt;Has more guy friends than girl friends <br>why is that bad?</br></br>  <br> &gt;mfw I remembered she proudly showed it to me as something she bought herself at the time <br> &gt;mfw the present had been sitting next to her bed the whole time <br>im sorry anon</br></br></br>  <br> Didn't want to have to bring up how much bigger her ex's cock was </br>  <br><br>Yeah, I know. My sister didn't believe me when I told her either. Everyone assumes we've done it, including her family. Her whole family was like that too. Her mom and dad waited 3 years. Her sisters have only been with 2 guys their whole lives. I don't mind putting up with a few months of celibacy if it means I don't have to worry about her cheating on me. <br><br>I went 2 years without pussy while I was in federal prison anyway. And it's not like I don't get regular blowjobs whenever I want.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Only unadapted immature people do that <br><br>That's not necessarily true. Those people just favor their own desires over anyone else's. They're like the Sith....but that shit doesn't work in a healthy relationship.</br></br></br>  <br>I assume you disagree with OP's opinion?</br>  <br>im the one who got ignored by the best friend til i got the boyfriend, (then i became interesting) and the boyfriend resented the old friendship, (which was left so he didnt feel jealous, i recognize that having a guy friend in relationships is an issue) but he did and refused to grow in the relationship. so by default, he was left for the best friend. who was pissy that he wasnt chosen first (when he wouldnt choose ME) so he doesnt wanna be around anymore.<br><br>both of you suck.<br>girls belong with cats, single.<br>like for real, fuck them. dont date. dont marry. you have your guy friends for life long support. bitches ruin everything and guys make us crazy</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If youre not fucking her; someone else is.<br><br> Her sisters have only been with 2 guys <br>lies</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not 100% true. I'm have a female best friend, we're both in relationships at the moment, and even when one of us is single there's nothing going on between us. We've been friends for 5 years now, we know everything about each other and there's 0 tension between us, even though we love each other to bits and hang out together all the time.</br>  <br> I went 2 years without pussy while I was in federal prison anyway.

It resonates with women, so who I am to judge. I don't have the patience or the energy to fight it. <br><br><br><br>I don't care what they like. They will probably get tired of your bitch ass calling. My mom used to call the cops on the neighbor shooting his gun about half a mile from the house. The cops just stopped coming out eventually. They hate rats as much, or even more, than criminals. They work with them because that’s their job, but unless you're a witness to a serious crime, they just view you as a tattle tale that creates more work for them.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   She expects me to pay when on a date <br>Excuse me my dear, I have to go to the toilet then leave through the bathroom window.</br>  <br>The question "what if he's gay?" is something that needed to be asked.

Adults are capable of forming healthy boundaries/ realize that there are certain qualities they appreciate in a friend, and these usually differ from the qualities they appreciate in a significant other.</br></br></br>  <br>never experienced an ex coming back.</br>  Biggest red flag for me now is divorced single moms. I'm in my 30s and just left a "relationship" with one.<br><br>They carry so much fucking baggage from their failed marriage and are so overly focused on their kids, that you will never be number 1 in their life.</br></br>  <br>has a dick</br>  <br>You need to place more value on yourself.

You'll never be number 1 in her life but you can still be the number 1 man in her life.</br>  <br> hat you will never be number 1 in their life. <br>maybe because they have fucking child</br></br>  <br><br>I married mine. 23 right now as well.</br></br>  <br><br>Things aren't always as they seem, but they usually are. It's not 100%, but I would feel comfortable enough to assume something is happening in most cases.<br><br><br>I was a 19 year old kid who got pinched for hacking ATMs. When you go through shit like that, it hardens you. When my car breaks down, I lose my job, my girlfriend breaks up with me, etc, I don't get rattled. I just think "I've been through shit 100x worse and I'm still here."</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>have hobbies and I do work out.<br>Hopefully it will get better but Ive been holding onto that thought for the last 10 years</br></br>  <br>Underage b&amp;</br>  <br> They carry so much fucking baggage from their failed marriage and are so overly focused on their kids, that you will never be number 1 in their life. <br><br>What makes you think that a decent parent would put you over their kids? The arrogance...</br></br></br>  <br>red flag for having pubes? pedo?</br>  <br>Let me guess, you think you deserve a daily blowjob for because you're such a enlightened gentleman for looking past the fact that she has a kid.</br>  <br> dead <br>Doesn't seem like a problem at all</br></br>  <br>wrong. they don't compromise on anything at all.<br><br>leave the toilet seat up?<br>get lost my kid comes first<br><br>want to eat somewhere she doesn't feel like that night?<br>get lost my kid comes first</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Sounds like you just got a bad roll.<br><br>Most divorced single moms realize they aren't exactly "in demand" and adjust their expectations accordingly.</br></br></br></br>  <br>youre an idiot for thinking a womans child doesnt come at first...</br>  <br>Put yourself in situations in which you can meet a good female. College is about the best place I can think of.<br><br>But who knows some times shit just all into your lap. Just make sure if such an opportunity reveals itself you seize the initiative. Or else you will certainly fail.</br></br></br>  <br>To be completely honest with you - I agree, to an extent. A lot of bitches have a circle of fags around them, waiting to get to her, who they will call best friends. <br>But usually, if it's just one guy and you know that they have been friends for more than 2 years, they don't have any romantic past and the guy has normal relationships with other girls, you will be safe.</br></br>  <br>Girl pedos are a anomaly but they should be shunned like the male pedos.</br>  <br>You are missing his point</br>  <br>pubes mean she will be a fat ugly smelly hambeast once she gets comfortable cause she doesn't take care of herself.</br>  <br>Kids are needy little shits. It's the child that is unable to compromise. You're having a pissy fit because a child is winning an argument against you? Learn to adapt, kids fall in toilets and are picky eaters. If she'd side with you instead of her kid, neglecting his wants/needs to keep a cock in her life, you'd be dating a shitty mother.</br>  <br>You can be attracted to crazy bitches but you'll never get anything worthwhile. <br><br>"Red flags"are there to look at and stop yourself from falling in love with a train wreck. Like my ex who was a LoTR nerd and had 3 LoTR tattoos and knew elvish and smoked weed and drank a lot. I loved her but the relationship wasn't healthy.</br></br></br>  <br>Agreed.</br>  <br> But usually, if it's just one guy and you know that they have been friends for more than 2 years, they don't have any romantic past and the guy has normal relationships with other girls, you will be safe. <br>nope<br><br>ex had this best guy friend she knew 2 years, broke up with me to be with him<br><br>did the same thing with him though, for another guy</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You are missing his point</br>   girl is chubby <br> has a bad relationship to her parents <br> 420blazeitfaggot <br> basic tattoos for the sake of being inked, not for personal reasons (like picked out of the catalog) <br> messy room <br> unshaved, unhygienic <br> loves horses <br> has already a child or more <br> can't think logically and freaks out on every occassion <br> feminist, vegetarian/vegan, activiest <br> right wing sympatisant <br> is not into trying out new stuff but simply bold and boring <br> high number of past sex partners <br> has cheated more than once <br> jealous as fuck <br> uses tons of make-up </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> but that shit doesn't work in a healthy relationship. <br>True dat.<br><br><br>Thanks anon. That was not the first time the ex issue had been brought up to be honest. I should have been more careful.<br>Bear in mind, that's the ex I'm talking about here  and there <br>Oh how foolish I was to help it make it last that long. She was a sad person whose evolution as a human being had stopped at some point during her teens.<br><br>Good point is, I'm in really good terms with all her friends now, especially one that I'm currently dating. Huge behavioral change. For the best.<br><br>Usually I'm not keen on making people suffer, but I'm certainly not dreading the moment my ex will find out.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Women aren't good at computer so they tend to get v&amp; quickly after becoming active with their desires.</br>  <br><br>We never even dated, that's the thing. <br><br> Says she likes me <br>cool<br> Dates some other guy who's "better" <br>well shit happens<br> Its not working oooouuuutttttttttt! <br>nice do I get to fuck you now?<br> no, there's someone else <br> its not working out!! <br> I love spending time with you! <br>shit so are we going to fuck or what<br> no <br> IIIIIITS NOOOT WORKINGGGG OUUTTTT <br>shut the fuck up please leave me alone</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm gay, and it's a red flag if the guy I'm dating has super loud fag hag friends.<br><br>You know what's up, anon.</br></br></br>  <br>no it doesn't</br>  <br>Yeah, it is viable with the right people. Maybe not many people have the right personality, but I don't think it is that uncommon.<br>One of my good friends is female, but we share a lot of common interests so it is pretty easy for me to stay friends with her despite not being attracted to her</br></br>  <br>Yeh dude, but I'm 23 and not at college so idk where to go. Bars/clubs dont work, I only find superficial chicks who want chad dick.<br><br>I have messed up on previous occasions but now I have a better mindset not to fuck up. Just dont know where to find respecatble chicks?</br></br></br>  <br>His point being that she needs to reciprocate for his needs by compromising her child's needs?</br>  <br><br>Social circle and online dating. I found my gf on tinder, previous one on okc.</br></br>  <br>my question is... everyone here is talking about relationships.<br><br>Why even get in relationships.<br><br>I got over that a long time ago. Girls are naturally monogamous... so long as you fufill certain needs.<br><br>And if you don't meet those... then she'll either cheat on you or break up anyway. What's the point of being in a relationship when it means nothing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Some women get nasty razor burn to the point that a light bush is the better choice. However, I trim my pubes and shave my shaft to make blowjobs less gnarly for my partner, so I would expect the same from her if she wants any chow time.</br>  <br><br>They go out of their way to constantly remind you that you are at the very, very bottom of their totem pole. Constantly. You understand that their kids are precious to them but there is no need for the never-ending reminders.<br><br>So why the fuck would a man not want to deal with that shit he wants to be on a level playing field in a relationship?</br></br></br></br>    Low self esteem <br><br>This is the one perk that you don't want in a woman.<br>THIS is the beginning of all shitstorms.</br></br></br>  <br>That sucks, m8. I feel sorry for you. Because of sluts like that my best friend has had many problems with her past boyfriends - thay wouldn't accept me being around, even though through 5 of our friendship we have never even cuddled, we're completely platonic. I hate this, because I know she suffers a lot, and I can do nothing about it. Fucking stereotypes and bitches who brought them to life.<br><br><br>It's not even about the attraction. My friend is easily an 8/10, very cute, and yet I never tried to hit on her - I feel good as her best friend.</br></br></br></br>  <br>this = me right now. I = dumbass</br>  <br>my god you are dense.<br><br>My point meaning that they will use ANY excuse to dump every guy in their lives when it's not the absolute most convenient thing for them, and then have the nerve to complain that there are no good guys.<br><br>I totally get that the kid comes first. You'd have to be a retard to not understand that, but to use the "strong single mother" stereotype as a crutch is ludicrous. It's not even just single mothers either, western society places WAY too much value on dismissing ANYONE who remotely does things differently.<br><br>Basically if you do any single thing they don't like, it's "fuck you I can get someone else" and repeat while moaning about nobody good left in the world</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Depends on how low it is and why she has it?</br>  <br>sure does.<br><br>will probably never understand why she did what she did and it sucks even more<br>because im so certain of it, that we belong together, as creepy as it sounds.<br><br>so disappointing, looking back on what we went through together</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>my social circle is guys, all of which have gf's, none of whom really go out clubbing etc either, we are our own social circle.<br><br>I tried social dating for years, but it doesnt work, Im not good looking despite trying and no one on there gives a fuck about personalities, which is my best trait.</br></br></br>  <br>gf on tinder?<br>how fucked up is she?</br></br>  <br>kek</br>  <br> girls are naturally monogamous <br>Please tell me this is b8. No creature on this planet is monogamous by nature. Girls (and boys) are trained to be monogamous for a variety of reasons, namely made up bullshit about morals and values, but also so that they have someone to support them when their vagina develops into a spawn point.</br></br>  <br>My best friend is a girl, I've known her for about 15 years. We know eachother as good as siblings would. I don't see a problem with this at all. Not saying if she got naked and said fuck me I wouldn't do it. But that's just how most guys are.</br>  <br> le open relationships meme </br>  <br>Low self esteem is easy to play, they are the kind of girls you fuck and go.</br>  <br><br> how fucked up is she <br><br>I'm the luckiest son of bitch in the world. She has terrible social anxiety and her sister thought she should do online dating. She didn't know what to write on a traditional profile, so she just made tinder because it looked easy. Talked to her for a month before we met. We clicked instantly and we're still together 2 years later.</br></br></br></br>   Debt. (100k) <br> Mean to everyone but me <br> Genital herpes. (Was able to avoid, been tested since break up) <br> Ex-husband <br> Narcissistic  <br><br>^Most recent ex. 2 years down the shitter. 28 now, feel like it's getting late in the game.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> social anxiety <br>welp... sooner or later she will go on the "i dont deserve you" train</br></br>  <br><br>There are very rare occasions where this would work, as I've conceded previously, but in most cases someone always wants something more.</br></br>  <br>Jesus, my ex matches all of those to a degree.<br>Should've seen it coming.</br></br>    If she is willing to have sex at the start of a relationship.  <br>  If she has been with a lot of guys.  <br>  Kids <br>  Large debt (other than student loans) </br></br></br>  <br><br>She has done that a few times. The key is to help build her confidence and tell her all the things you love about her, just as you would in a regular relationship.</br></br>  <br>Sounds like she just has some seriously jacked up hormones in addition to a resentment of the child's father. You say it like being a mother creates this personality in women, when it really just exacerbates character traits that were pre-existing. Being a single parent is stressful, some people can't handle the added stress of a whiny man-child.</br>  <br>and when you do that, there comes a point where she thinks<br> maybe he is right, maybe i am sexy looking <br>and poof, shes gone cause she thinks she can have anyone she wants</br></br></br>  <br><br> Not in the kitchen <br> Breathing </br></br></br>  <br>Hear hear</br>  <br> loves horses  <br>fuck that shit.</br></br>  <br> If she is willing to have sex at the start of a relationship <br><br>All guys are willing to do so. Why should women be held to a different standard.<br><br> If she has been with a lot of guys <br><br>If she's been with more than 10 guys and she's younger than 32 then she's probably got the Hope Solo<br><br> Kids <br><br>Depends on the age of the female in question. <br><br> Large debt <br><br>You're goddamn right.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>believe me, girls riding horses for a hobby <br>tend to ride you during sex like a fucking beast.</br></br>  <br>hi reddit</br>  <br>Raising the minimum wage to $15 would drastically eliminate this problem. These women settle for men they don't even have legitimate feelings for because they "need" the added support.</br>  <br><br>This is just your own insecurity. <br><br>The only other alternative is to have a clingy girl who perceives her own social value as lower than yours. That isn't love though, and these asymmetrical relationships never last.</br></br></br></br>  <br>HOLY SHIT! She looks like someone I know.Got more pics of that anon?</br>  <br> implying that you always act according to your instincts  <br>I guess everyone always shits on the floor when they feel like it, because that's natural as well.</br></br>  roll a dubs,<br><br>roll a game.<br><br>may the odds ever be in your favour.</br></br></br></br>    how is this possible?

Even /r9k/ is tired of his shit taste.</br></br>  People who put ranch dressing on their pizza and disgusting and should be imprisoned. Fight about it /b/.  <br>I completely agree.</br>  <br>I like tobasco on my pizza</br>  <br>Pizza is already delicious AND terrible for you, and those are the only things that are achieved by adding dressing to a food.</br>  Ranch in general is horrible. Ruins anything you put it on since its so overpowering. Not to mention unhealthy as shit  Yes, I agree. People who put disgusting on their pizza should be executed.  <br><br>faggots<br><br><br>mah nigga<br><br>Im ordering pizza right now because of this thread and I'm adding a fuck ton of ranch.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> op </br>  Anybody here tried mayo on pizza?<br>It's really not bad at all.<br>Kinda similar to shrim salad on hotdogs.</br></br>    <br> People who put ranch dressing on their pizza <br><br>There are people that do this?!?!? <br>Is this a nigger thing? Or southern US or what? <br>This is the first I've heard of this and I live in Ohio.</br></br></br></br></br>  I put sweet corn on mine  <br>on the pizza? no<br>on the crust? why not. Ceaser is better though</br></br>  <br>Around here (Texas) it's a beaner thing</br>  What about people who like extra cheese on their pizza ?  No arguement growing up half of my life in the midwest of america and in the middle east i was health consious as kid and I always thought ranch was the puss of pimples  <br>I think the first time I ever heard of anyone doing this was Anna Nicole Smith, most likely when she was a huge fucking loadpig on her shit show.</br>  RANCH EVERY FUCKING TIME NIGGA  <br>SHRIMMMMMM!!!</br>  <br> but not op <br><br>I don't care if a person is to add more to their food, I was just saying that because op said "and disgusting", not "are disgusting".</br></br></br>  <br>No shit? <br>We got beaners here too but not as many as you guys I'm sure.</br></br>  <br>shrim</br>  <br><br>Fight about it? Motherfucker you can't even fight depression.</br></br>   bacon, chicken, ranch isn't the best slice of pizza   I put ranch on my pizza and I'm not some fatass; I just like the taste. Only restaurant style though.  <br> op would say that </br>  I put French on mine<br><br>Tomato based, so goes well with the sauce. Gives just the right amount of sweet tang</br></br>  <br>This you fucking faggots</br>  <br>What are you dutch those fuckers dip there fries in fucking hellmans</br>  I eat all pizza with BBQ sauce  <br><br><br><br>wtf is shrim or shrim salad? google was no help. just a bunch of new age healing bullshit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hi op</br>  <br>ranch and wing sauce<br><br>fite me m8</br></br></br>   ranch dressing <br> not grape jelly </br>  Putting anything besides spices on pizza is wrong and you should feel ashamed of your gluttonous fat behavior.  Honey. Honey on pizza is delicious. And sticky as fuck. Denver here.  I put sauerkraut on my pizza.  Had a 4th grade teacher who I legitimately witnessed putting Domino's icing (the stuff that comes with their cinnamon sticks) on a slice of pepperoni pizza. She was, needless to say, fucking huge. Never seen the ranch thing, but I've heard it's a big thing in the Midwest? East Coastfag here, so yeah, just going by hearsay.  <br>So, just dough, sauce, and spice? No meat or veggies or cheese? Doesn't sound like pizza to me.</br>  <br>That means anything on it after it's been cooked.<br>Didn't realize I would have to explain it to amerifats.</br></br>  I wanna try the really old "pizza" not neopolitans but like thousand yr ones in the mesopatamia where they baked flat bread put some olive oil and dates and shit on it i wonder if you can get that anywhere  I was about to get up and make a pizza when I saw this thread. <br><br>When it's done I'll put ranch on it and take pics of it. <br><br>ALSO, Mayo is amazing on pizza.</br></br></br></br>  i remember in middle school there was this nerd that always dipped his pizza in ranch. And everyone made fun of him because they thought it was gross. Then the following year everyone was dipping their pizza in ranch and he was still a nerd. I personally hate ranch dressing.  Ranch is fucking gross, on top of pizza is unforgivable. Miracle Whip on the other hand...  Yeah well Papa Johns gives you a little tub of melted garlic butter with every pizza, whether you want it or not. Illuminati is killin our genetic failures lol  Face it faggot.<br>Pizzas are primarily a template for whatever you wanna make or put on it.</br>  Someone in my family eats pizza with ranch, and had me try it. It's not the worst thing in the world, but it definitely detracts from the pizza.  <br>lol</br>  I think this thread really seperates the neckbeards from non neckbeards  <br>That stuff is simultaneously disgusting and divine. And no two packets of the stuff are ever the same consistency.</br>  <br>Shrimm will heal you. Didn't you know that? Everyone needs shrimm</br>  <br>Agreed</br>  <br>tarter sauce goes well with anchovies</br>  <br>THIS! THIS!<br><br>It's so fucking good.</br></br></br>  <br><br>orange you glad I didn't say orange<br>its the best though</br></br></br>  <br>Best friend from kindergarten used to crush up Famous Amos cookies and dump them under that tire rubber cheese on those knock off Ellios Pizzas on pizza Fridays. Thought it was disgusting until I tried it, shit was cash. The next year's of my life involved alot of heavy breathing and sedentary sweating.</br>  <br>That sounds like ass<br><br><br>HNNNNNGGGG I always buy extra</br></br></br></br>  i put ranch on my pizza and its fucking delicious<br>you mad faggots?</br>  <br>What about people who put tomato ketchup on their mac n cheese?</br>  <br>SHRIMP you fucking idiot.

I think we could be some fifth grader's science project. "I simulated 1000 universes, with the value for gravity varied slightly in each one. In 516 of these universes life emerged. It was in the universes with the strongest gravity that life emerged. Gravity at levels one hundred times higher than our universe's gravity still supported life, but when we made gravity a tenth of what it is here life was unable to emerge. This shows that strong gravity is better for life than weak gravity."</br></blockquote>]
