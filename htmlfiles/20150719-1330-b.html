Almost everytime it got to some russian site with books...</br>  there was a thread here not to long ago with a onion link which led to a red page asking for a password, after getting in weird pictures started to come up, i was working on it when the thread 404'd, there was code inside the pics  <br>No, it's apparently legitimate.</br>  Can anyone post a screenshot of that "Daisy's Destruction"? I'm just really curiuos what is that  <br> clicking a darknet link posted on /b/ <br>NOTE TO SELF: DO NOT DO THIS</br></br>  <br>It's apparently a fucked cp and murder video. If you actually still want to see it i hope you die</br>  For the anons asking what Daisy's Destruction is and those further who are not willing to simply google it (I did you fuckwits) it's a child (3-8 idk) snuff film where a bunch of men torture and rape the child, then kill her. That's it.<br><br>It's on Yahoo answers ffs</br></br>  <br>Guys, I'm here to solve the mystery.<br>I haven't watched it (and I don't plan to after I've heard what it is), but here's what I found from yahoo: It is real. It is a child snuff film made by a man called Peter Scully. <br>It is perhaps one of the most psychologically harrowing things a human can see. <br>It is a well directed film of an older woman and a &lt;1.year (estated 8 months) old child. The woman has sex with the baby, so does a man. They then tear the child apart. Limb from limb, they take out her insides while she is barely alive. <br><br>It is considered the worst in its case, a thing I would argue having reported numerous red rooms where such things are directed by a viewer with enough money. <br><br>It exists and it is the most soul destroying realisation that mankind is beyond repair. <br>I am sorry that I could answer your question. The deep Web has left a mark regardless how much I report to the authorities can never be salved.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>any one want to see the pics i found</br>  everybody look up takedownman if they want to know more about daisy's destruction, dafu love, peter scully etc... he's an awesome dude, supports anonymous as well so +++  <br>Oookay, i have not asked that question... I just wanted to know what is about and now, i regret knowing it</br>  <br> being this scared </br>   go on deebwep lookin for pron <br> find this bestiality site on hiddenwiki <br> visit <br> regret <br>The site owner put newborn kittens in glass jars which had holes in them for mouth to breathe and for the anus to shit. I started reading and the guy was keeping a log in which he described for example how the kittens anus was getting a rash where it was glued to the jar. He wasnt feeding them solid food but rather through tubes and what not.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Do it</br>  <br>it's all good man. I never even seen it nor do i want to</br>  <br> The deep Web has left a mark regardless how much I report to the authorities can never be salved. <br><br>Fuck off</br></br></br>  <br>post 'em</br>  What about the videos from normalpornfornormalpeople.com which got deleted?<br>Someone must've have them.</br>  <br>Me neither...</br>  <br>Fuck off fbi</br>  <br>Screenshots and webms please</br>   daisy's destruction <br><br>We've got fags ruining finger box threads but nobody ruins this?<br>For fuck sake, Fingerbox threads are WAY more fun.</br></br></br>  <br>I literally won't watch it because Id get fucked for viewing shit like that, Highly doubt it will affect me psychologically though</br>  <br>You dont have the balls</br>  <br>I copied it from yahoo you retard</br>  <br>Go on YouTube stupid faggot.

No murder.</br>  <br>They never killed her you stupid faggots. Learn to do good research</br>  <br>Daisy's destruction isn't near as bad as people say. It's like 3 guys 1 hammer. It's only bad if you have any humanity left in your body</br>  <br>oh. i think it was dafu love or something like that that was the murder right? idrk kek</br>  <br>get off your high horse nigga, cause you black</br>  So you're telling me that in this world there are rich sick fucks paying other sick fucks to do sick fucks for them? This shit ain't logical, because the risk of getting caught.

The other little girl that did die, was murdered by Peter, but there's no certainty if he filmed it or not, but they think he did. There's a video with Peter Scully on the tubes talking with him after his arrest, a lot of it is explained there.</br>  <br>nice try spoder</br>  <br>Well, might be fake, onion sure is dead!</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=fsC<wbr>Dcf63x8k</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>interview with peter scully, from daisys destruction</br></br>  <br>These images are probably related to Cicada 3301</br>  <br>Because they take turns.

I have no idea how to get anything  <br>It's not fake. Peter scully is in a portugal jail for it right now.

Anons description about D.D. And peter scully is 100% legit. Just google his name for proof.<br>But, that's not the worst I've seen it's bad... But not the worst.<br><br>The most vile, humanity shattering thing I've witnessed was on the deep web. It was a now defunct onion site called, "meat boxes".<br>In a nutshell, a guy buys trafficked infants. He's a doctor, and he performs all kinds offucked up surgeries on them. For example, "meat boxing".<br>He cuts off their arms and legs below the knees and at the shoulder. He punctures their ear drums. Removes their eyes, and removes their larynx.<br>She treats the wounds and sees that they heal.<br>The ones that survive, are feed via tube. They are essentially trapped in their own bodies. They cannot and communicate.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Still here <br>You should regret nothing, you could be eating the cockmeat sandwhich right now.</br></br>  <br>Nice job pissing on /b/ history</br>  <br>so they actually kill the kid with a hammer?</br>  <br>5th pic</br>  <br> kid <br>It's an old man, watch it pussy faggot</br></br>  <br>I saw that greentext too</br>  <br><br>They had taken humans and done various experiments torturing them in warehouses.<br>One included inpregnating homeless women and then putting bleach into their vagina to see how long it would take to force an abortion. Creepy shit google it you will find it.</br></br></br>  <br>what is this shit? <br>a cult?<br><br>real cult-ish vibes</br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy fuck</br>  http://al2ecet5b2x52ho2.onion/  <br>That would be direct alien contact from intelligent species or at least fake contact. <br><br>Just look at this.

In the 3 guys video? They kill a lot of people. In 3 guys, they beat an old man to death. In the longer video when they kill more people they have a screwdriver as well. Stick it in eyes, and junk. But no, no kids in either video.</br>  <br> Google Deep Web Stories in google images, lolita slave toys story <br>Pretty sure that shit ain't legit, never seen anything to that level of fucked up not saying it couldn't happen some sick fucks in the world.</br></br>  <br>but where are the links haha. start at wiki and im finished in two links max</br>  Can somebody tell me what Daisy's Destruction really is? I would go find it myself but I'm not going on the deep web without a vpn.  <br>looks like something to do with cicada 3301. But I have no idea whatsoever.</br>  <br>This sounds like music I listen to on a regular basis</br>  This happens to them so young that they seemingly have no consciousness. Life is nothing but a series of un-understandable sensations. They cannot grasp reality. Some argued that they couldnt even process thought.<br>Once they reach aged 6+, he sells these. Children as "meatboxes". The prices started at 300k. They are nothing more than human-flesh sex toys. Their limbs were removed so they can be kept in suitboxes and stored under a bed. <br>Care instructions and a feeding tube kit were included with the purchase.</br></br>  <br>it was definitely fake<br><br>it was floating around /b for a while</br></br></br>  <br>only one of the 4 links, couldn't get te others</br>  <br>skeptical i've read that one before but it was in a creepypasta thread so yeah... skeptical whether thats true.</br>  <br>That's handy.

Post a picture</br>  Best reaction pics  this kek right here  Why cant i cum when i get blow jobs or hand jobs?  Because you're not getting good enough ones.  because your dad has emphysema and he can't suck very hard  <br><br>because you're a faggot<br><br>but seriously, you can't cum when girls are playing with you for the very simple reason you're a massive flaming whoopsie</br></br></br></br>  <br>I feel you man</br>  Fap too much, no sensitivity  <br><br><br><br>Virgins trying to be edgy. I suffer from the same problem OP. I think its because im too used to masturbating so I need to go at deathgrip lightspeed to cum and girls just can't do that well with their face.</br></br></br></br>  BJs are usually not done properly. I can count on my fingers how many girls have made me cum this way.  <br>is that a thing ?</br>  <br><br>Everytime my gf is giving me a handy i try so hard to come but her arm gets tired and in the end i have to do it until im close then i just make her do the rest</br></br>  Stop beating your dick so much and it does depend on the girl. Sometimes play with their tits or grab their hair to push it over the top  <br>I don't know if it's a psychological thing or a nerve ending thing but yeah you definitely lose feeling</br>  <br>some girls are terrible at it. trust me. and it doesnt just apply to blowjobs.<br>Like my current gf is meh looking, takes me like 15 solid minutes of pounding with a condom on to cum. went to a strip club and fucked a girl there with a condom on. I came in under 30 seconds, no joke.</br></br>  <br><br>No, I'm serious. I used to think I couldn't either, and then met my ex who changed all of that. After her I have gone back to not being able to cum from blowjobs/handjobs, and now my current girlfriend can make me cum by blowjob, but not handjob.<br><br>A girl's skill is very fucking important</br></br></br></br>  <br>not the guy you replied too but yeah, when you get used to watching girls being fucked by a cock the size of a lead pipe it tends to be a letdown when you do it yourself</br>  <br> but seriously <br> you're a massive flaming whoopsie <br><br>If this was a ylyl thread I just lost hard.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's the difference kegels make</br>  <br>just lay off the porn and jacking it for a week or 2, youll be good.</br>  <br>how the fuck people can quit fapping for more than a week ?</br>  This is a xenos purging thread now  &lt;&lt;&lt; this  <br>I did it for a month.

Bernie Hate Thread.  This will be the loneliest thread.  He's a faggot and anyone who supports him is a bigger faggot than he is.  <br>/thread</br>  <br> said the faggot</br>  <br>Just came back from a political argument thread where I was getting into an intense one with some German leftcuck. I'm up for some Bernie hate.</br>  <br>Yeah free higher education, unpolluted rivers, decrease military spending, better healthcare, the rich paying their due. Sounds like a nightmare<br><br>RIGHTCUCKs: They think they give a shit about you and what you want. <br><br>What do you fags even want?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> free <br> paid for other people <br>Nice try leftcuck</br></br></br>  <br> better healthcare <br> not realizing American healthcare was already the best in the world </br></br>  <br> the rich paying their due <br>What does that even mean? How much more is "their due"? And by what objective criteria did you decide this?</br></br>  <br>You walk into a community college and you don't have to pay for classes...free, as in you don't have to pay for it</br>  <br>Right as in someone else is forced to pay for it...you know kind of like slavery...</br>  <br><br><br> being this stupid </br></br></br>  <br>And why is this good? How many more psychology and gender studies degrees do I need to pay for?<br><br>Do you have any actual arguments?</br></br></br>  <br>We have to pay 9 times the rate for medical service compared to other euro countries, you cuck</br>  <br> taxes are slavery <br><br>Lol, you're stupid.</br></br></br>    <br>technically it's theft<br>Your move leftcuck</br></br>  <br>Those are arguments, listen man, just exit your parents basement and talk to someone on the street and you'll see what I'm talking about</br>  <br>The disparity is not that high and we get better medicine for what we pay.</br>  <br> taxes are theft <br><br>I don't even know anything about politics but I know how to spot stupid from a mile away</br></br></br>  <br>Whatever it is, its obviously more. The rich are a highwer burden to society and so they must pay for the upkeep of the social institutions which allow them their privileged status</br>  <br>As in every person that pays any sort of tax to the Federal Treasury gets some benefit from it. Sounds like a decent plan.</br>  <br>Someone's paying for it.</br>  <br> taking people's money under threat of imprisonment <br>In what sense is this not theft?</br></br>  <br>"meme about socialism, uses a picture of Stalin"<br><br>what a retard</br></br></br>  <br>which one are you? there are three people tagged in this post </br>  <br>The government defines property rights so it isnt theft</br>  <br>Oh shit we're dealing with one of these people.</br>  <br>In what sense are "the rich" (a term you have yet to define) a burden to this mysterious entity known as "society"?</br>  <br><br>Don't worry OP, we have 3x this many options.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=s__<wbr>rX_WL100</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>Thieves cant imprison you, nor do they define property to begin with. Its actually very different</br>  <br>In other words it's a category of theft that the government has made legal because the gov't does it</br>  trump  <br>Who the fuck is going to actually vote the old jew in? He sets his hopes too high, especially considering congress is full on republican now. The only good president is Rand Paul; he knows what he can accomplish, and has demonstrated that he isn't a batshit crazy republican, rather that he is a very smart, well balanced one.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> &gt;/pol/ </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Did you go to public school? do you drive on roads? Do you follow stoplights and road signs? I think the real question is why are you such a cuck slave for the super rich who could give 2 cucks about you</br>  <br>haha</br>  <br>Bernie is too good for USA.<br>But at least we now know there are some sane people still left in that shitstain of a country.</br></br>  <br>No not in other words. If youre willing to be this loose with terms you can conflate anything to mean whatever you want. Thats why people are libertarians</br>  <br>You get nothing in return for theft. With taxes you get shit like roads to drive on and education.</br>  <br>You're right, most thieves merely beat you up and leave. The gov't will imprison you or kill you if you resist.</br>  No we do not  <br>Essentially. It still isnt theft</br>  <br>wasted trips, faggot</br>  <br><br>Who would be a wiser president:<br><br>Bernie the Jew<br>Hillary the Trivial<br>Trump the Lipservice<br><br>or somebody you have to go page 10 google results to know they are running?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah I forgot about how we execute tax evaders.</br>  <br>When you remove deaths due to crime and auto accidents (which have little to do with the quality of a nation's medical care system), Americans have the highest left expectancy in the world.</br>  <br>The rich are a significant burden. Hoarding wealth from an economic system which runs on the movement of currency is obviously a burden to those who cannot amass such wealth</br>  <br>Stupid americans, worhiping money and the rich, and denying themselves prosperity. <br><br>Bernie is America's last hope.</br></br></br>  <br>And slaves were well fed by their masters.</br>  <br>Yeah we also all collectively pay for public school, but we would consider the act of going to school free</br>  <br>Youve yet to prove taxes unjust</br>  <br>has to be bait<br><br>where the fuck do you think widely accessible/drinkable water, roads, public schools, or any public utility comes from?</br></br></br>  <br>You have no understanding of the role of finance in a functioning capitalist economy. Good day. If you think the banks are stealing from you I suggest you hide the money under your mattress.</br>  <br><br> Bernie is America's last hope. <br><br>Coincidence he's Jewish?</br></br></br></br>  <br>And what are you going to do about it? Bitch on the internet?</br>  <br>As it is, income tax caps at like 400,000 and stops scaling after that, so poor, middle, and even the upper class who make under that annually suffer scaling tax rates based on income while those who are above that margin get a flat rate. It's almost like the tax code was written by the rich or something.</br>  Who has the advertising conduit?  The only person who cares about the actual citizens of u.s.a <br>  what a cuckoo <br><br>No wonder everyone hates us.</br></br></br>    Fuck bernie. Voting trump just to make the liberals bootybothered  <br>Obviously the money the gov't steals from us does some (but not many) useful things but that does not alter the fact that<br>1. It was taken through coercion and thus was stolen<br>2. It is by no means proven that those things could only be done through the government and/or a system of charging people only for what they use (i.e. toll roads and user fees for water consumption)</br></br></br>  Fuck this bait.<br>Sage.</br>  Lol yall niggaz desperate.  <br>So what youre saying is that I dont know anything about the economy because im not an austrian cuck? Grow up, the economy is a tool not a universal force governed by the free hand. If you honestly believe in the perfect market youre a sucker. Those are antiquated ideas. Shut yourself off from counterpoints though, thatll ensure you have the most rational views in life</br>  <br>That's only true of the social security payroll taxes.</br>  <br>No i'm saying that you have no understanding of the importance of finance, which incidentally is also true of most Austrian school followers.</br>  <br>Why would you remove those things? They would factor into the average life expectancy.</br>  <br>yeah fucking right. <br>Wrong.<br><br>Your life expectancy is due to obesityu and obesity related diesease (heart and vains), smoking, drinking and drug use. <br><br>And the tens of thousands that die because of your ridiculous gun laws.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maintaining your NEET status with wealth redistribution is not "care" in the slightest.</br>  <br><br>This person gets it</br></br>  <br>im guessing your one of those gerbil-in-the-ass white supremacist</br>  <br>Things taken by coercion are not always theft. Your premise is faulty. Many systems can only be done by government. Like establishing rights and a just road system.</br>  <br>IM totally voting for burnie,</br>  <br>He's Jewish? <br>I didn't know. I guess i just kept more attencion to his policys and opinions, rather than his religion.</br></br>  <br>Tax loopholes</br>  <br>for real</br>  <br>lel</br>  <br>And youve made this conclusion because i acknowledge that the rich are a greater burden to society in a consumer market? Not all of their money is leveraged you ass hat</br>    <br>Bernie is a stupid communist. All of his supporters consist of college kids and commies.<br><br>He is not a threat. The general<br>Public isn't even aware of him. Hilary Clinton is going to be the liberal pick. She's a stupid cunt.<br><br>Voting republican</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Rand Paul <br>hahahahahahahaha</br></br>  <br>this</br>  <br>You are completely clueless</br>  <br>Hold on rand paul needs to go check the polls to see what he believes in today</br>  <br>I'd pick Donald trump over Bernie and I I don't even like him.</br>  <br>exactly he used to be as good as bernie sanders, but now hes just like every other cookie cutter republican</br>  <br> Being this stupid </br>  <br>can say the same exact thing about banks.</br>  <br>Then he obviously isnt as good. Bernie has stuck to his values for decades. Even if you dont support them, you gotta respect that.</br>  <br>But... i just said what you said.</br>  <br>Amazing rebut, Id bet you went to one of the top universities.</br>  <br>you must love sucking on the corporate dick, go ahead, suck away</br>  <br/>  <br>ur a teabagger, correct? or racists... but i repeat myslef</br>  <br>Sounds like you have no clue what communism is. <br><br>I talk to people from all walks of life everyday as I'm a bar tender and when we talk politics not a single person iv talked to has any clue who Bernie sanders is. They either know Hilary or one of the republicans.</br></br></br>  <br>I own my own small business and don't want me sanders making me pay more money to a shit tier government. Even if you claim it will magically be a better government. I don't want to fund it.</br>  <br>damn, why you rain on my parade</br>  <br>Mr. Sanders*</br>  <br>Because those factors are irrelevant for judging a nation's healthcare system. There is little a doctor can do for you when you've been hit by a car or shot in the chest.</br>  <br><br>You sound like the biggest idiot on this planet... The kinda nigga who listens to kid rock, drinks Budweiser and fucks his cousin, oh, also live sin a southern state.</br></br>  <br>You probably dont make enough to see a differnce in your taxes, now youre just arguing for better tax rates for multinational competitors</br>  <br>I don't drink at all actually. I'm a fitness fanatic and train mma.<br><br>Nope don't like kid rock.</br></br></br>  <br>Who is this person you call society and in what sense is he or she being burdened by this group of undefined people you call "the rich"?</br>  <br> probably <br><br>Let's work on communism on a probably.<br><br>Please just stop before you fuck up your future.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>what is the definition of theft according to you then?</br>  <br>You clearly dont understand economics</br>  <br>Vote For Bernie or continue to live in a country that can't achieve all of its potential and will keep getting shittier. Those are your options.</br>  <br>I await evidence for these claims.</br>  <br>I was gonna take my ballot, bring it to the nearest bathroom, and wipe my ass with it. I guess voting for Rand may be easier though.</br>  <br>Please answer the question.</br>  <br><br> better healthcare <br><br>American healthcare is among the best in the world; you just have to be able to afford it. I work at a pharmacy in a ghetto neighborhood and I can tell you from experience, Obamacare was a bad idea. The very thing that all the right-wingers were saying was going to happen is basically happening. Every day, homeless people, drug abusers, fat diabetic assholes, and general human scum walk into the pharmacy, pick up like $400 worth of medication, pay either nothing or next to nothing, walk out. I actually had some homeless piece of shit cuss me out because the copay on his antibiotic was four dollars. Four fucking dollars. Without insurance that particular medication would have been around $60. I should also mention that the vast majority of these faggots are on food stamps, disabilities, welfare, or all of the above as well. Meanwhile, I have no insurance at all, because I don't currently work enough hours to qualify for insurance through my workplace, yet when I tried to apply for ghettocare I was told I make too much money to qualify. All the marketplace plans suck too; it makes more sense to just pay the tax penalty until I can figure out something better.<br><br>Leftcuck healthcare summarized:<br><br> people who earn no money, contribute nothing to the world, and don't even bother to take care of themselves get the most expensive treatments available for absolutely free <br> people who have no "need"; ie people who take care of themselves and earn money, have to pay more to make up the difference <br> somehow we all profit <br><br>Makes perfect sense.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Provide evidence for this rather ironic claim</br>  <br><br>I don't care what you do, I was just making rhetoric accusations. You just sound like a guy who isn't very intelligent, firstly because you "vote republican" - which the 'party' functions more as a business then a government and has fucked the country in GDP, growth, unemployment consecutively as every republican president has been elected. Bernie - Just like Ron Paul, i a figure who won't get far in US media because he actually fights for the people, not businesses.</br></br>  <br>Theft is when someone steals property from someone else</br>  <br>And in what sense is taxation not that?</br>  <br>You misunderstood what i was saying. I dont want communism</br>  <br>because it isn't stolen you nigger. It's money you rightfully owe the government in return for it's services to you, a citizen of this nation.</br>  <br> communist <br><br>i lol'd<br><br>I guess every other industrialized country in the world is communist then? what with their free education and healthcare? oh and half decent infrastructure. have you seen the roads and public utilities in european countries compared to our shit tier infrastructure?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The government decides what property is so the tax revenue is not really yours at all</br>  <br>Republicans are some of the wealthiest and smartest people in this nation.<br><br>Not sure how you figure drop outs and welfare queens are so bright.</br></br></br>  <br>By what principle do I owe anything to a government that wastes so much and fraglantly violates my rights?</br>  <br>because making the system work for people who have a job and are trying to get a degree is just socialism.</br>  <br>Do you believe government is the source of our rights?</br>  <br>You dont have rights ouutside of government</br>  <br> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxi<wbr>ng_and_Spending_Clause</wbr> <br>The same principals that protect the rights that you seem to hold so very dear. <br><br>Freedom isn't free. It's that fucking simple.</br></br></br></br>  <br>IDK how anyone couldnt. it is definitionally true</br>  <br>you dense motherfucker<br><br>you pay taxes in exchange for almost everything you take for granted. not just roads or public utilities, but protection from those who would do you harm (other countries, criminals, etc). the government is embedded in everything, simply how the world works. <br><br>as ben franklin said the only two certain things in life are death and taxes.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So the government could decide to arbitrarily execute us both tomorrow and it wouldn't be unjust?<br><br>Invoking the Constitution to defend a government that systematically violates so many of it's precepts is not helping your case.</br></br></br>  <br>Given the fact that rights only seem to matter once the government gets involved, yes.</br>  <br>I didnt say it would be just. But then again justice is relative.</br>  <br>of course. without an organized government the world wouldnt be jolly and everyone caring for each other as anarchists like to believe, it would boil down to feudalism, with those who have the most influence controlling the masses with fear and hired guns. then you would see what real tyranny is.</br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br> The Constitution is invalid documentation in an argument having to do with the rights of Americans <br><br>What fucking rights are you talking about?</br></br></br>  <br>Most of the money the federal government spends is on entitlement programs (i.e. welfare for the elderly) and much of it spends on legitimate functions like defense and roads (though I'm not sure about the roads part being legitimate) is spent in the most reckless way possible to enrich the politically connected.<br>In Ben Franklin's day taxers were much lower and the government mostly stayed out of our lives. I wouldn't mind returning to that.</br></br>  people calling bernie a socialist, Kek<br><br>He's an "American Socialist" not a true socialist</br></br>  <br>Natural rights. Some of which the constitution protects (if only it were followed)</br>  The simple fact is that Bernie wants to use the government authority over free people of this nation IE wealthy people(who knows what else he really will end up doing)<br><br>He is authoritarian and he is a leftist. He is communist or very close to it and will push this agenda.</br></br>  <br>Private roads are a very very bad idea. Be happy you pay for them through taxes</br>    <br>Natural rights have long been understood as a rhetorical device. It doesnt actually exist haha. think about it for two seconds</br>  <br>I'm not convinced of that though I haven't looked into that issue in particular very much. Private roads were the norm until relatively recently. And federal roads non-existent until the 1950s. If we have to have government roads I'd prefer the president not pry into them.</br>  <br> Most of the money the federal government spends is on entitlement programs (i.e. welfare for the elderly) <br><br>And the problem here is...?<br><br> much of it spends on legitimate functions like defense and roads (though I'm not sure about the roads part being legitimate) is spent in the most reckless way possible to enrich the politically connected <br><br>Welcome to politics nigger!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> legitimate functions <br> defense <br>bitch, couldn't stop 9/11<br>or any of the domestic terrorism<br>defense against what? Pedophiles and Interne lt piracy?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you moral nihilist?</br>  <br><br>The thing i republicans are rich because their party functions as a "charity" (seriously look it up) the members can withdraw and deposit as much money as they want - funds are collected through private companies so members can deposit more than $15,000 and withdraw more than $5,000 (which otherwise, if they went through the party would be illegal) - welfare is a good system of social support to people who were treaded on by society. There's no need to call people "welfare queens" - obviously the system is abused, but there's more people on it, then there are who abuse it. That's where Obama has cut welfare by almost 7% because a lot of people were abusing it and he put in new examiners to find and cut these people out. Also Republicans are far from the smartest people - they only support Israel because they believe that when Jesus comes, he will come there first and republicans want to get into heaven, not realising that having money by default and not giving it away will send them to hell, they are war-mongers and all-round terrible fucking people. I've had the displeasure in my line of work, of meet many republican politicians and all have been self-absorbed shit-stains on the world. And no, I'm not American, I'am actually a New Zealand journalist (won't say names) but I've written some stories for other newspapers. The point is, Republicans are a cancer on the American people trying to convince poor white people that they are better than the better off black people, to try and make war wthin the U society - in fact in the last election it was funny because they had 2 ads taken down because they were found be "racist" and "inciting racial violence"</br></br>  <br>everythings a zero sum game with you people huh? must be hard to meet friends</br>   free college for everyone <br>Under employment among college grads is already a huge problem. Let's flood the job market with even more college grads. I'm sure that won't drive wages down.</br>  <br>so, what, when we become too old to work we should just starve to death? or just be euthanized? after a life of working I think our elderly deserve a reasonable sense of comfort. we shouldnt be getting our money off the backs of the elderly</br>  <br> I have no insurance at all, <br><br>kek.</br></br></br>  <br>youre thinking about the interstate highway system. Just consider why a company would want to buy a road</br>  <br>That's where saving for retirement comes in. And failing that, have children to support you.</br>  <br> &gt;And the problem here is...? <br>1. There is no authorization for the constitution<br>2. The money that has been promised is far in excess of what present tax rates will pay.<br>3. It is infantilizing that the government should have to plan people's retirement for them.</br></br></br></br>  <br>are you retarded? how the hell could we stop all domestic terrorism while still being a "free" nation? the only way to stop all such actions would be for the government to be so involved in our lives and so controlling that it would be tyranny. if someone wants to learn how to make an explosive and set it off in public there's not much we can do short of searching all citizens or throwing all the sandniggers in prison (actually not a bad idea)</br>  Holy shit this fuckin thread  <br>I recognize that we live in a morally relative world but I do not choose to live without a moral guideline, if thats what youre asking</br>  <br>Then here's my question: Why are you still here? The United States was not founded solely on the ideals of Locke, Hobbes and Paine, so what do their words matter here?</br>  <br>he's not authoritarian and honestly he's not really pushing any policies the U.S hasn't been under in the past. Which I might add we did arguably better under in various ways</br>  <br>I kinda like it, legitimate, intelligent discussion. even if it is aggressive.</br>  <br>Why do you believe that if politicians (the most honest people in society no doubt) do not save money for our retirements on our behalf that people will not do so for themselves? Or that if the government did not care to the aged private charities and families wouldn't (as they have for centuries)?</br>  <br>this is actually the onle rational counter argument ive heard</br>  <br>I am asking, do you believe that morality exists independently of human opinion. Was the Holocaust wrong or merely something that most people find unpleasant?</br>  <br> Yeah free higher education <br>Someone has to pay for it. Look at the eurotrash failing. Hell Obama gets his shitty healthcare reform through and for the FIRST TIME our credit rating dropped. Giving out free shit without proper funding and cuts is just fucking retarded spending. Switching back, Bernie is no different and is in the same boat as the over promising politicians in Greece. Hell the majority of Greece cheered when when they voted down the austarity measures. We're all laughing at their autism while at the same time Bernie's following is exactly that.<br>  unpolluted rivers <br>Sure.<br>  decrease military spending <br>You mean decreased spending into the largest R&amp;D sector? GPS, Mircowaves, Radar, EPIPEN, Ducttape, hell even the management of IPs and domain names is handled by the military. People are REALLY misguided to think that all of the money that goes into the military is fucking wasted. The military gave more college dropout fuckwits an opportunity for a career than any other program by the government. I could care less about our military standing in the world, the military has helped a metric fuckton locally.<br>  better healthcare <br>We already have some of the best healthcare in the world. With no queue times and an abundance of availability, we're actually some of the best in the world. What people ACTUALLY FUCKING MEAN is cheaper healthcare. In which case one of the best models is fucking Brazil. Their unified medical database reduces the need for an excess MRI and other expensive as shit machines because you can be queue'd up more efficiently,reducing costs.<br>  the rich paying their due <br>Have you even watched the news interviews with him? His proposed tax hikes on the wealthy (middle class and up) and reduction on lower income families DOESN'T FUCKING WORK. Unless he increases it to upwards of 95% on the wealthy, there will be a huge deficit compared to the taxes collected now. Also the wealthy can actually afford to find alternatives to paying taxes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>before social security 2/3 of the elderly population died in poverty. Freedom.</br>  <br><br>while people should be saving for their own retirement, not everyone has the money for it. as we all know wealth inequality is ever widening, and with so many living paycheck to paycheck it would be very hard to make room for retirement as well. I just think elderly deserve a reasonable bit of comfort when they are unable to provide for themselves as a given right of citizenship</br></br>  <br>Who else are you referring to then? Montesquieu? Cicero? I fully acknowledge their influence along with Locke et al. I fail to grasp what point if any, you are trying to make.</br>  <br> 2015 still think the government doesn't have everything you send electronically </br>  <br>1. So why not sue the government? See what happens.<br>2. And if we all payed our taxes and divided them fairly? It surely wouldn't solve the problem, but I fail to see how it hurts us.<br>3.Nothing more than opinion. I, for one, would welcome the help of the government in ensuring the security of my future.</br></br></br>  <br><br> real tyranny <br><br>I think you have that confused with 'overt'. The U.S. has been imposing sanctions and starving other countries through politics for *Years now. Osama bombed us after half of Afghanistan's children under 5 were at a 50% mortality rate, due to starvation and a lack of medical supplies.<br><br>Fuck tyranny, that's outright Villainy.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That depends on how you define right and wrong though.</br>  <br>But hey, I'm sure it's just a coincidence that the only people who will benefit are university professors, who will now have greatly expanded job opportunities. It's almost like Sanders is trying to use public money to reward a key demographic of supporters.</br>  Is Bernie Sanders even known outside of Reddit?  <br> cheap taxes <br> first world country <br>Pick one.</br></br></br>  <br>Before social security most people never planned for old age as we know it today because most people never reached it. Today quite rightly people expect to live longer and should plan accordingly. In any event the elderly in the past may have been poor (as just about everyone was in that era relative to today) but private organizations ensured that they did not starve</br>  <br> meme <br>Macro.</br></br>  <br>You clearly do not understand moral relativism. No, outside of our notions of morality it does not exist. That doesnt change anything and I, like most relativists would agree that it was absolutely morally wrong. <br><br>Do you recognize the morality of an ant? Should the universe consider our limited moral frameworks? No. morality is an illusion but I still find it useful, obviously.</br></br></br>  <br>Utter nonsense, most people in America who "living in poverty" suffer no material hardships and have plenty of luxuries they could give up to plan for their retirement.</br>  <br>Wealth inequality doesn't have anything to do with it. Wealth isn't a zero sum game in any practical sense. Just because the rich are getting richer doesn't mean the poor are getting poorer.</br>  <br>Im a liberal who is fine with the defense budget because of the reality of the r/d spending</br>  <br>I understand moral relativism, I just reject it.</br>  <br>How can you agree that it was wrong? Don't you just mean that you don't like it in the same sense that some people don't like pineapple pizza?</br>  <br>no they did not ensure anything. there were no assurances. read a fucking history book. get an ounce of perspective before you talk to grown ups</br>  <br>anecdotal bleh you upper class twat</br>  <br><br> He's Jewish?  <br><br>Publically available information.<br><br> I didn't know. I guess i just kept more attencion to his policys and opinions, rather than his religion. <br><br>eg. Pay attention more closely if a candidate is a moonie.<br><br>This entire world is founded in "religion" due to the actual fact that God exists. If he were Muslim you would want to know as well.<br><br>etc.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>except you know that's exactly what is currently happening in the U.S</br>  <br>In what way can it be refected. it is self evident</br>  <br>My point is that this isn't a fucking anarchy, and the natural rights of man, as outlined by these three men, have little to do with how things work in the US today. <br><br>They're dead philosophers, their political views no more valid to the workings of the government than Plato's Philosopher King.</br></br></br>  <br>I have read many history books.
