China is quickly becoming a major voice in the Pacific trade sphere, they are the #2 economy in the world, and 1st in purchasing power parity. The Pacific trade sphere will be the dominant economic driver in the next century. If the United States wants to remain the "status quo" super power it is today, it must control and write the rules for Pacific trade. China greatly threatens the status quo, they've snubbed Western economic influence with the creation of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. For the US to remain dominant it has to control the rules for Pacific trade. China is not part of the TPP, this is a play to edge China out of Pacific trading rules, and eventually force them to play by the United States rules. There is a bigger game played here than what is suggested in the OP <br><br> Ever think that maybe it's being kept secret because the US is trying to stay ahead of China for good? Which is why they aren't involved in this deal. <br><br> Holy shit you people are retarded. Conglomerates and the U.S. don't give a fuck about the shit you are talking about. This is about a picture so much bigger you obviously can't comprehend it. Hint: US vs China <br><br> You are literally reading fake information and speculation and further speculating on top of it </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is a secretive, multinational trade agreement that threatens to extend restrictive intellectual property (IP) laws across the globe and rewrite international rules on its enforcement<br><br>Heres an explanation, maybe someone can trim it to 160?

Everyone's skin takes to ink differently, I have 5 tattoos and they have turned out alright, except for 1. The skin on my foot just didn't take it as well as the rest. Touching up a tattoo up shouldn't be a big deal.  <br>This</br>  <br>You should have picked off all the scabs as quickly as possible. I did that and my tat looks cash.</br>  Gimme some Femboy/sissy/trap/cd/shemale pics :3        TTP Thread #3<br>HOLD UP /b/, THIS SOME SERIOUS SHIT.
