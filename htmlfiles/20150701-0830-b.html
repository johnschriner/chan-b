[ Could you help me name my band please?  <br>3 men in a shed</br>  <br>Joker and the Bullies</br>  Just Finished Fucking (Each Other)  Ears Ears Ears!!!  Three Feet in the Grave  I'll just leave this right here.    <br> that font <br> taking you seriously </br></br>  <br>you think she swallows?</br>    <br>wow they all sort of look slightly similar...</br>  <br>No but she definitely takes it in the pooper, nut deep no rub.</br>  <br>those are 3 completly diffrent girls just because they have brown hair it doesnt mean that ... ugh god ..</br>  <br>Anybody have any information on body doubles?</br>  WHO IS THIS BITCH!!!!???  <br>are you high they just have the same hair color</br>  <br>she specialises in defending mass murderers?</br>  <br>i think she got a gypsy curse on here<br>shootings just follows her tracks</br></br>  <br><br>Not the same girl failed baiter...<br><br>Look at the hair lines also I know from far that one looks like kristen steward and the other looks more like ariel winter... <br><br>so nope.jpg</br></br></br></br></br></br>  spooky  <br>And they all just happen to part their hair the same way...</br>  <br>So all white people look alike? you racist motherfucker..</br>  <br>There are only two sides to part on. Holy conspiracy batman! Fucking autists</br>  <br>i remember visiting infowars once.</br>  <br>80% of the girls part their hair like that its common.</br>  How about noah pozner dying in Sandy hook then dying again in another school shooting in a different country? I'll have to find the related pic  <br>the pakistan school massacre</br>  <br>ITT: niggas that don't know that there's people that look like other people throughout the world.</br>  <br><br><br>What I want to honestly know is why conspiracy theorists truly believe that every single massacre and terrorist attack and anything really bad are ALL illuminati or the government? Every single one. Like humans never truly do anything horrible to each other out of their own will, its always staged. How can anyone really think this? And an even better question is for all of those paranoid nutjobs that feel like theyve figured out the illuminati and caught them red handed......If that was true why are they still here and havent been v&amp; yet. Surely if their conspiracies are actually true theres no way the gov or illuminati would want or allow them to go around preaching?</br></br></br>  <br>I see 3 different noses, chins, and eye spacing. These are three different people.</br>  <br>300+ million americans, 52% are female, so let's round down to 150 million.. now over 60% of them are white.. so out of the 90 MILLION white women in the US none have the same hair....?? 90,000,000...</br>  <br>Get on it</br>  <br>Shit follows her, that's for sure.</br>  I love this. Of course, you could call central casting and find resumes of hundreds of actors, but of course the government only has access to like 10 of them, and they always play very public roles during major crises. <br><br>Real fucking smart. Conspiracy theorists are morons.</br></br>  <br>Holy shit... Same bitch. She must be one of them 'victim actors' the government is using for every fucking "black flag yank shooting".</br>  <br>Not even the same people</br>  <br>80% are white</br>  <br>forgot pic</br>  <br>Thaz cuz all white bitches look the same</br>  <br>Yeah, I wouldn't want to be her bf or husband. Can you imagine that? hey hon you wanna go to cancun for vacation? sure!... fucking cartel chops my head off and shit.</br>  <br> be the us government  <br> use the world as personal testing ground  <br> second biggest arsenal of nukes  <br> strongest military on earth  <br> fuckhuge economy  <br> over 300 million people making it the 3rd biggest country on earth in terms of population  <br> on top of the resources in the country, have access to resources all over the world  <br> have the most influence in world politics  <br> but still can't find 3 different actors for a well planned plot to ban guns </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    Anyone have the pic of her with no pants on?  <br>anyone got the shoop of her without pants?</br>  <br><br>mother fuck what a weak fucking argument. NOT THE SAME PERSON.</br></br>  Go to /pol/ they'll believe you.  <br> why are conspiracy nuts crazy? <br>uhm... well... they..<br>they're crazy..<br><br>so.. yeah...<br>you feeling alright anon?<br>kinda worried about you</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Clearly three different people. Conspiracy nuts are the dumbest people on earth I swear. You can convince them off the dumbest shit as long as you let them believe they have some superior knowledge.</br>  <br>kek<br>She cried more tears than any mexican soap opera actress.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br> http://explore.georgetown.edu/news<wbr>/?ID=69555</wbr> <br><br> "Neuroscientists at Georgetown University Medical Center (GUMC) have discovered a brain anomaly that explains why some people diagnosed with autism cannot easily recognize faces â€” a deficit linked to the impairments in social interactions considered to be the hallmark of the disorder." <br><br>They look nothing alike, Rain Man.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not a real argument. It's just some faggot that was to discredit anybody that has any real questions about the media reporting of major events.</br>  <br> &gt;fuckhuge economy <br>Wow.<br> not knowing anything about economics  <br> not knowing about the debt the US has. <br> being this retarded. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Can't you just admit that you've made up your mind about the world and have reached a level of insanity that you simply cannot accept how crazy it is to suggest these are the same person.</br>  it has to be the akatsuki  <br/>  <br>throw enough darts at the board and one will eventually hit the bullseye, anon.</br>  Obviously they look slightly similar, but even a somewhat close inspection shows glaring differences.  <br>You are hardcore stupid.<br>I hope you never find someone retarded enough to breed with you.</br></br>  <br>But realistically speaking they're not all literally crazy. Theres so many conspiracy theorists who are totally sane and I cant figure out how they could possibly believe their own shit. I guess thats what im asking, How the fuck can anyone believe that.</br>  Not being able to tell people apart is a symptom of autism.    <br>Do you actually believe this picture is legit and not total bait? Are you that fucking dumb?<br> inb4 i was only pretending to be retarded </br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=IxT<wbr>afqejV6k</wbr>  [ ]  <br>I would fuck the shit out of that dead chick.</br>  <br> thinking the word economy means amount of money the nation has. </br>  <br>you are the one not understanding economics m8. of course i know of the debts.</br>  <br>too soon</br>  <br>Too soon</br>  <br>....<br>You obviously don't know what the debt is.<br>It's a debt owed by the US government to other governments. It has nothing to do with the economy.<br>You're obviously the product of the public school system. Get a real education or kill yourself.</br></br></br></br>  <br>i'm not on that faggot's side, but to counter your notion of debt. yes, the US has fuckloads of debt obligations local,state, federal although by the same token it can offset this due to various factors a major one relating to its economic output being many trillions of dollars.</br>    look you fuckin retards. the media isn't a legitimate source for information. this much is painfully obvious. so why would you trust it? what proof do you have of these things happening do you have that AREN'T from the news conglomerate? you know, the ones that are fed the same copypasta every day.  <br>Not soon enough</br>  <br>Was it staged, but why?</br>    Get 9999999  <br><br>TOO SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON! TOO SOON MAN!!!!!!!!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!! HOLY SHIT WAY TOOOOOOOOOOOO SOOOOOOON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br><br>too old.</br></br></br></br></br>  Give me 9s  <br> debt has nothing to do with the economy <br><br>i hope to god you're trolling</br></br></br>  9s haz  <br><br><br><br><br>Everybody who replied after the first rebuttal already said everything is an autismo who wanted to demonstrate their basic knowledge. <br><br>Nobody cares that you know what debt is. Somebody already cleared it up. Amazing how much of an ego people will maintain even when they're anonymous.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Get them 9s  <br>media jews. you have to be a moron to take the news seriously, anymore.</br>  I want 9s  All those 9s  extreme fisting gone wrong  9999999999999  9s get  <br><br><br><br>these motherfuckers saying too soon and have no idea what it's about</br></br></br></br>  <br>/thread<br>/bread<br>/greg</br></br></br>  <br>youre obviously the one who posted that dipshit post.</br>  <br>Stfu you idiot. The whole world economic system is based off debt. So many countries are so much more debt. You are repeating and spewing rhetoric. Compare the GDP to debt ratio. We aren't in the top 10, we are actually 20 percent off the top 10 countries in debt. 20 percent of , the ratio comparatively to Japan who is #1 with 2 times the amount of debt to GDP. Do some research before you speak. Japan is # 1 in debt ratio and most you retards will be like "ohh huh yaa yaa Japan has a strong economy". Also many current debt figures do not include pre- WWII debt amounts and their converted inflation rates.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> Fags, the whole lot of you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>yes I do, and it is pathetic and worn. lame.</br></br>    <br>stoplikingthingsidon'tlike.jpg</br>  <br>cause muslims always lie about "our children" it's literally a pic off the internet,, what makes you think he was there?</br>  <br>Op is indeed a faggot</br>  <br>Op is a disinfo agent, programing you to believe that all conspiracy theorists are retarded.<br><br>mfw it's working</br></br></br>  MOAR fake conspiracy shit, please.  <br>Where's the naked ones of her?</br>  <br>There's different levels of tinfoil, and the ones that see the all seeing eye, and see crazy shit in EVERY single thing, are just fucking paranoid schizophrenics. Simple as that. Do I believe SOME things are iffy, weird, and just flat out shady? yes. Do I believe in SOME conspiracies, yes. But they have to have hard evidence. Not just pictures of people that look similar to each other.</br>  <br> Fiat monetery system <br> trillions of dollars printed per year.  <br> government falsify economy.  <br>The us should be the poorest country in the world. But because the rest of the world is relying on the dollar to stay up because the US owe them so much money. <br>Bring back the goldbacked money and then we'll see how long America stays afloat.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There aren't any, he found out she was dead before he took any more pictures.</br>  <br>look 2 first pic<br>not same nose, it's obvious</br></br>  <br>you are right. it is working. i sincerely believe you are retarded.</br>  <br>but you also felt the need to write too soon?<br><br>wow</br></br></br>  <br>fun fact: america has the largest gold reserves on the planet as well.<br><br>The more you know, filthy britbong.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Clearly 3 different women <br> IT'S A CONSPIRACY 1 </br></br></br>  You realize all this is bullshit right?  <br>see <br><br>this thread is a psyop</br></br></br>  <br>She's not dead and there are naked ones of her. I haven't seen them for a while. C'mon, guise.</br>  <br>This.<br><br><br> Hey man, remember that chick we used as a parent for Sandy Hook? <br>Yea.<br> She was pretty good, we should make he James Holms attorney next. <br>Yea sure, we only have like 7 actors anyway.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Also, if you look through any photograph of Chinese history you'll notice it's all done by one guy. One guy is in every Chinese photograph ever? Coincidence?  <br><br>I'm the one who wrote it in exaggerative bold, then 'too old'.</br></br>  <br>Also, if you look in the mirror you'll notice you have autism. Coincidence?</br>  <br>The conspiracy wants you to believe this fake conspiracy are true, are you blind, mr. bluepilled ?</br>  <br>Fun fact: America is buying gold to keep the price low. <br>They would have to buy a lot more gold to keep the current economy.</br></br>  <br><br>Well meme'd my friend.</br></br>  <br>Nice try guys...</br>  <br>Fun fact: It doesn't matter how they influence the price, if money was for some reason instantly reverted to bullion, America would still be the richest nation in the world.</br>  <br>Sorry man, it's only you that sees an autistic person when you look in the mirror</br>  I'm an Illuminati. The conspiracy theories are mostly true.<br>None of you will take me seriously. You'll think me just some dipwad on the internet screwing around.<br>That's the way we want it. <br>I must admit, it is refreshing to tell the truth.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Some people don't like to accept that some nutjob could just randomly kill them for no reason. It makes them feel safer if they invent some higher purpose for why things like this happen.</br></br>    <br>That doesn't seem like the point he was making. What he was saying is if we moved back to goldbacked currency the US wouldn't be as bad off as people are saying, because they have a fuckton of gold.</br>    <br>Sorry man, I don't see an autistic person when I look in the mirror, must only be you.</br>  <br> i'm an illuminati <br>I think the illuminati would be a bit more well educated.</br></br>  Some are fact, some are conspirafagory.  <br>Do i see under-underwear?</br>  <br>Or is it just part of his clever ruse?<br><br>You're probably right tho.</br></br></br>  <br>Wow that bitch is unlucky as fuck!</br>  <br>how's your aspergers treating you today?</br>  <br><br><br>I think that these guys are just weeaboos who've watched so much Anime that they can only recognize people by their hair.</br></br></br>  <br>i dont understand this pic its a dead chick theres so much worse on 4chan why is everyone freaking out?</br>  <br>ahahahaha, I think you're right.</br>  <br>America can also take the whole western hemisphere and subjugate every country, besides Canada, in a few days. No one would stand up to the US if their economy started to plummet. There will be war before another depression.</br>  <br>Kek</br>    <br>The Pakistanis held a remembrance rally for their school and Sandy hook. Retards</br>  <br>Elaborately staged attacks for unclear purpose by highly organised group. <br> uses the same actors </br></br>  <br><br><br>here we have a great example of disinformation. The purpose of this is diminish credibility of any conspiracy theories</br></br></br>  <br>I was only pretending to be retarded</br>  <br>not EVERYDAY, but i get your point</br>  I think the biggest conspiracy is all the faggots out there that think george bush was the stupidest president of all time, but somehow pulled off 9/11 and hasn't spilled the truth in 14 years  These are getting ridiculous lol.<br><br>They're not even matching people who look remotely similar anymore.</br></br>  <br>kek exactly what i was thinking. how can OP be so utterly retarded?</br>  <br>Yea it came from a Facebook post by the anti media. It was on my news feed the other day. Probably where OP got it.</br>  Continue from the iCloud hack thread, anon pls post the mega link we beg you.  Bump!
