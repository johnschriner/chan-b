I use 7. Vista sucked balls. XP was great. 95 sucked. 3.1 was good. <br><br>The trend says 10 should be good. I hate change. What does /b/ think about 10? I don't even know if anyone could get their hands on it yet, but I'm suspicious of it. <br><br>Why is it free? I feel like it's loaded with spyware or some shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> inb4 botnet shitposting </br>  at least the after a year you need subscription theory is shit<br>the german faq doesent have these unclear formulations that created the theory in the first lace</br>  <br>*place</br>  <br>No, I'm genuinely curious. <br><br>I've deleted the update that downloads it automatically for you. <br><br>I just think that Microsoft would never give something away without there being some ulterior motive.</br></br></br></br></br>  I've tried the technical preview for a while and it seems really nice. I like the new UI. There's a change but personally I love it. Can't go wrong with free. Plus directx 12 is nice.  genesis is skynet<br>never forget<br>genesis is skynet</br></br>  <br> Why is it free? <br><br>My best guess?<br><br>Microsoft realized that the Android model (Giving OS free and making money on app sales) works pretty well. They alreadys tarted going that way with the Windows app store.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, they're making Windows 10 free to save face from Windows 8 being such a POS...much like you for not knowing that.</br>  A German site states that they give win10 out for free because they don't want win7 to become the 2nd win xp. They have to let thousends of users unsupported in 2020 when Microsoft stops the support for win7. But the update is completely free when you uprade to win10 within 1 year of release  What is the consensus on upgrading a pirate copy of windows with the free upgrade?<br><br>Big no no?</br></br>  <br>lol you still use windows 7</br>  <br>its a free upgrade, it wont catch you. many people have already upgraded with pirated copies</br>  <br>Bitch, you were like 2 years old when 3.1 was available.</br>  <br>http://m.chip.de/news/Windows-10-In<wbr>sider-bekommen-die-Final-nicht-gesc<wbr>henkt_76421696.html<br><br>Sauce btw</br></br></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>You can upgrade but it still won't be a legitimate copy.</br>  <br>7 will be supported until 2020. No worries...</br>  <br><br>Will you get watermark and stuff like that?</br></br>  <br><br> implying 8 is even a remotely viable option <br><br>inb4 Linux or Unbuntu</br></br></br></br>  <br>it actually does turn into a legitimate copy, it gives you a new key</br>  <br>Microsoft makes 90% of its Windows sales on new machines and that isn't going to stop.</br>  <br><br> is 40 <br><br>Kid, I remember fucking basic.</br></br></br></br>  Im getting it, leaving Win 7, might return though  <br>Yea right, they don't know how to handle people who upgrade their hardware and have to reinstall win10 after</br>  <br><br>Well I think another important factor for Win 10 being free is Microsofts new CEO who isn't such a bitch as the last one.</br></br>  <br>win7 is the best fucking version so far.</br>  <br>People just don't know how to use windows 8.1, literally runs programs quicker and smoother. There's a good reason why it's newer</br>  <br>They are trying to get as much of the market share as possible while the hype is going.</br>  I was thinking about installing it onto a separate HD to see how it works.  <br>I fucking hate the layout.</br>  <br>Torrent start8, or the other programs that get rid of metro, after that its windows 7 but upgraded software</br>  <br><br>There's also a reason why Microsoft is rushing to introduce a completely brand new OS. <br><br>8 was so bad, they skipped right over 9, and called it 10.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Again, get rid of metro and its an updated version of windows 7.</br>  Windows 8.1 is great, once you customize the UI settings to your liking. <br><br>The most likely reason why they are giving it away for free is that it is still in beta (it may not always be free) and every other OS (Mac OS X, Linux, Andriod) is being giving away for free so once again they are just copying what Apple does.<br><br>If you hate M$ so much then switch to Apple or Linux.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I will provide the world with FREE Windows 10 <br> Free for everyone <br> Boom <br> Heads explode </br></br></br></br>  <br>This</br>  Can anyone upgrade to win10 yet?<br> eurofag </br>  <br>SOON</br>  <br>Uk here, waiting till 00:00 then I am unleashing a thousand farts of tina turner on this shit.</br>  <br>Agreed. Win8.1 runs so much smoother than Win7. People are just to dumb/lazy to figure out how to turn off metro and install a taskbar app.</br>  <br>Lots of people use windows 10 already, they tested it during its beta and now they get the full release a week before the official release.<br>Most people are getting the upgrade tomorrow on the 29th, but most wont get their copy because they're rolling out the keys.</br></br>  <br>I'm not even the guy you were replying to, but I use windows 7 on laptop and Linux on tower. No interest in 8, due to navigation being shit amongst other reasons. I prefer a start menu in the bottom left rather than a windows button that I already have a key for.<br><br> I'm that fucking picky </br></br></br>  <br>This~</br>  <br>Stated this 3 times now, apps and programs to get rid of metro and get a start menu again, its not that hard mate.</br>    I'm putting my money on windows 10. <br><br> Theoretically speaking of course. </br></br>  <br> 2015 <br> Not using Gentoo <br>shiggy diggy</br></br></br>  <br>Downloaded the RTM ISO from TPB. Been running it for a few days now. Been running smooth so far, have not encountered any problems yet with my crossfire setup either.<br><br>The updates are a little frequent for the moment tho, as expected. Only thing I have to complain about is a blackscreen with only the mouse visible for straight 10-30 seconds, before the update. Which was somewhat confusing, but now that I know, its fine.<br><br>I came straight from 7 to 10, and so far I actually like it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck That. Thats way too hard. I have the computer skill of a woman. I rather just complain and stick with the slower Win7</br>  <br>Hhhhhhhkek</br>  <br>did microsoft just skip windows 9 or what</br>  <br>Windows 9 doesn't sound as good as Windows 10</br>   People still hating Windows 8 <br><br>Geez people, all you have to do is download a free program called Classic Shell and it gives you a start menu and gives your pc the appearance of any previous Windows version you want.<br><br>http://www.classicshell.net/<br><br>Now that Windows 10 has a start button II can uninstall it but it has been a great little program.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Isn't windows 10 supposedly going to remove any pirated software/music/movies/etc?  <br>Is this external program or built into windows 10?</br>  <br><br>I see that now. But still gonna stick with 7 on the laptop. It's an OLD hp and a few keys are even stuck. Not worth fixing or updating honestly. I use it typically as a "burner" if that's what you would call it. It's expendable to do illegal shit with and be destroyed. <br><br> inb4 CP <br><br>I mean Other shit</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Its Start8, its a program you download when usin windows 8 or 8.1</br>  <br>I get that. <br>Although if it atleast has 2gb of RAM windows 8 will run better for it, tests show wind8 runs smoother and extends life times of older machines</br></br>  <br>how should it know the difference between pirated necro porn and home videos?</br>  <br>10 is like a cross between 8 and Ubuntu. It comes with a new browser (IE has been replaced). It is faster and less resource-hungry than 8. Lacks some compatibility with elements of 7. Comes with DirectX 12, not the best OS for gaming. Less stable than 8.<br><br>Either upgrade or stick with 7 until there is no more support.<br><br> enrolled in beta, just received official release of 10 yesterday. </br></br></br></br></br>  mother fuckers it's 1 hour into the 29. and shit ain't ready, bullshit.  <br>No, its not.<br>It cant even detect if you're current version of windows 8.1 is pirated, mine is and I'm approved going to get a legitimate copy of windows 10, and an infinite amount of reformats or restores like a legitimate copy.</br></br>  <br>I hate it to. I use OldNewExplorer to remove the ribbon and add the libraries back to the sidebar, basically the way 7's explorer was.<br><br>Then I use ClassicShell Start Menu and AeroGlass for 8 to really make it look like 7. I also uninstalled all the Windows apps I can and completely hid the Metro UI.<br><br>The only thing I can't fix is that 8 enforces UAC more heavily and running as administrator actually makes a difference, even with UAC at the lowest setting ( apparently it can't be fully disabled.) Adobe directories such as Program Files can also have permission issues for programs installed to that directory.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>something to do with the source it came from <br><br>granted this was something I heard from a previous post so the validity is really questionable</br></br></br>  <br>wait until the 29th for California, US time.</br>  <br> this <br><br>Also, never upgrade Windows until the first service pack is released. Their betas are like alphas, their releases are betas, they aren't really stable until SP1</br></br></br>  <br>the lardasses hang back some hours my danish friend</br>  <br>See<br/></br>  <br>Same guy here, pic related.<br>Also, I liked on W7 that when you press the windows key you can instant search. For example, W-Key -&gt; notepad<br><br>On W10 there is a own button in the taskbar for searching.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You Norwegian faggot named Dan...</br>  <br>it came from my hardrive<br>more than that many torrents are perfectey legal, hell it would deinstall world of warcraft if it could</br></br>  <br> Posting spoilers for windows 10 for anons </br>  <br>Main thing I don't like is that you cannot turn off or select the updates you want. It will automatically update. To me this open it up for them to install hidden stuff onto your system for some fucks like the NSA that they are already in bed with.</br>  <br>lol<br><br>American news said most people will have to wait for a few days or even a week after the initial release date of the 29th.<br><br>Also, in America (Microsoft land) it's only 6PM or so July 28th.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>See<br/></br>  <br>8 is great tbh.</br>  <br>Consider 8.1 was 9</br>  I just upgraded from 7 and it's pretty nice. I skipped 8 because it looked silly. But the live tiles combined with the start menu looks good, cortana is convenient (once you install bing2google on Chrome). Some shortcomings (all white window borders are unattractive to me, would prefer aero glass) but all in all it's nice, feels modern, all my applications and drivers from 7 work fine, whatever. I look forward to a more unified Windows experience moving forward  <br>No it doesn't, you can select what you want at anytime of the day, it doesn't force you to do anything. Its literally windows 7 but updated and a new skin.</br>  <br>I dont like forced updates</br>  <br>This only happens with the beta builds. Automatic updates can be disabled in the official release.</br>  <br>so, guess what? you'll hate 10.</br>  <br><br>8 hours to go!<br><br>The DAN is for which language is used on windows. In this case DAN = Danish :)<br><br>Will do, /b/rother.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I actually use the W8 apps, for twitter, the weather, calendar, etc.<br><br>So much nicer to keep that shit out of the way until I need to use it.<br><br>The W8.1 upgrade made those work better.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You need to read the new EULA for 10. they say its better but with 10 you will not be able to turn off or select the updates you want unless you have the Enterprise.</br>  <br> Again, get rid of aero and 7 is an updated version of windows XP. </br>    <br>Not windows 7 by a long shot.<br>The beta forces updates. It broke my system about 2 weeks ago, I had to reinstall an older build, disable internet access, and let it update a few days later.</br></br>  <br>Nah man, the layout on 10 aint even close to as bad. <br><br>Pic related</br></br></br>  <br>If it broke your system then your system was destined to fucking explode.<br>See </br></br>  <br>Nope not this time.<br><br>http://www.zdnet.com/article/micros<wbr>oft-releases-new-license-terms-for-<wbr>windows-10-no-surprises/?tag=nl.e53<wbr>9&amp;s_cid=e539&amp;ttag=e539&amp;ftag=TRE17cf<wbr>d61</wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Also not true. Again, these are terms of the beta program.</br>  <br>INSTALL GENTOO</br>  <br>Yes windows 8 and 8.1 you can but windows 10 you will not be able.</br>  Does the install completely reformat your hard drive, like will I lose my files and stuff, or will it simply take the place of my current OS?<br><br>Also, will this actually improve the performance of my laptop or is it essentially just a new skin/format? (currently running off windows 7 on a 4 year old laptop)</br></br>  mfw OP is just another faggot sheeple who didn't bother to learn how to utilize win8.1 because it "sucked" <br>Fwi the only thing that sucks is ur mum op<br>tfw no face<br>#rekt<br>#thecancerisreal</br></br></br></br>  <br>I haven't heard any information confirming that, but I also haven't heard anything denying it, so idk about 10. I was talking about windows 8.1 to the other fag</br>  <br> this tells me nothing <br><br>Point being, I HAVE the official release of Windows 10. Beta testers got it yesterday. The first thing I did was disable automatic updates.</br></br></br>  <br>its a soft format, you won't lose anything important.</br>  <br>8.1 is actually Windows 9, ignorant</br>  <br>You can install prerelease versions of 10 right now to try it out, and you haven't done that yet? What the fuck faggot?! Just use is and go sit in a corner and think about how useless you are and feel shame!!</br>  fuck you windows update  <br>Technically i guess it could be considered 9</br>  <br>No, it doesn't reformat. Remember when you upgraded to 7 and got a Windows.old folder? Or the last time you did a *buntu dist upgrade? Same general concept.<br><br>Performance increases are noticeable.</br></br></br>  Windows 10 is going to keep automatic updates enabled all the time so that means eventually you will have to pay to disable it - if you don't they will keep doing updates and you can't stop them from doing it.  <br>Performance upgrades are fucking HUge, massive frame increases on my older machine.</br>  <br>Vista was good</br>  <br>I got this laptop fresh with windows 7 so I never had to update<br><br><br>this is something I desperately need and look forward to</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm a poor fag so I have outdated GPU and most parts other than my mobo, in games like WoW, Crisis, GTA 5 etc, huuuuuuge increases, also helps the cpu calm down a bit</br>  Why update, 7 64 still works fine    <br>just disable the port they use for the upgrades in your router firewall?</br>  <br>works fine but its slow compared to 8.1 and 10. <br>that is if you do anything other than FB and 4Chan</br></br>  <br>You won't lose any data unless your drivers/hardware are unsupported, then. Pathnames/directories change a little bit, but it is all automated, and does not affect the physical location of your data.</br>  <br>Windows 10? You mean Vista 4th Edition.

Post Maisie's most recent fb pics like the ones she uploaded 3 weeks ago</br></br>  <br><br>Doxing who?</br></br>  So here's my theoretical timeline:<br><br>13-year-old Sophie Turner and Maisie Williams befriended during the first season of GoT. As two blossoming girls bored in hotel rooms they started "experimenting" sexually like lots of kids do.<br><br>As Maisie went on being straight, Sophie discovered her homosexuality.<br><br>Becoming adults they eventually parted ways sexually and probably remained friends (or pretend to be for PR). They may even still have a little diddling session every now and then, for old times' sake.<br><br>Sophie was now a full-on lesbian with a celebrity status, giving her the opportunity to be sexually aggressive.<br>Thus all the personal photos of her fondling her friends and acting slutty.<br><br>Then Sophie met The Vamps guitarist and literal faggot-head James McVey. Gossip websites went bananas.<br>Looking like he could suck a golf ball through a garden hose, Sophie used him as her G.B.F. (Gay Best Friend). Until McVey, thinking he actually had a shot, made his move and was publicly turned down with extreme prejudice over Twitter.<br>Hilarity ensued.<br><br>That's when Sophie met Hailee Steinfeld while shooting Barely Lethal together. They dated for several months, being spotted by paparazzi walking hand in hand in public. It was so cute.<br>They broke up for unknown reasons.<br><br>Now Sophie is all woman and legal, totally self-aware of her steaming hot sex appeal, and unleashed in Hollywood.<br>She was recently seen using the "Haha I was only pretending to be hitting on you!" technique on Natalie Dormer during ComicCon.<br>Let's hope it worked and right as I'm speaking their bodies are intwined in some weird position of the Lesbo Kamasutra.<br><br>This is what I believe.<br>Or at least what my penis believes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>get the fuck back to reddit you faggot</br>  <br> get the fuck back to reddit you faggot <br>did you learn that insult on 9gag?<br>you're not even making sense</br></br></br>    <br>She can't be lesbian, I need to fuck her.</br>  <br>let it go man, let it go...</br>  <br>Never.</br>  <br>Lel</br>  Holyfuck Lmao guys. Did you just see Maisie's most recent tweet?<br><br> ''cheesy pasta'' </br></br>  <br> implying she would fuck you if she was straight <br> implying shed fuck you if you were the last man standing <br> you will never lay eyes on her cold and soulless face while she's on her knees sucking your dick <br><br>Why fucking live</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>search Missie Brown</br>  enjoy  <br>I got a plan; probably won't work but it's the best I got.</br>  <br>???</br>  <br>cheesy pasta????!

But that mouth looks familiar</br>   tfw you'll never meet either of these two in real life and get to know them aside from becoming a stalker or being friends since childhood.  <br><br>Live in your fantasy world /b/, the reality is too much to bare</br></br>  <br><br> Missie Brown <br><br>Hahahahahaha you stupid dropkick</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You dumbass...
