Thanks mate.</br>      <br>My IQ is measured to be 143. There is only one retard here, you.<br>I can comprehend the vastness of interstellar space, the very distance between.. let's take two stellar objects. Pluto and Mars, the space between those two points. How it expands, how far the distance... My brain can comprehend all of that easily. I have nine math degrees. I have solved a countless amount of mathematical problems that have been unsolved since the time of Aristotle. I also do engineering as a hobby and I have designed several Earth orbiters. I also have four books about nuclear radiation and it's effect on space published. I know the last part "Considerations on the Universe as a whole" in Einsteins TSAGTOR by heart. That's short for "the special and general theory of relativity" if you didn't know. Sorry for my bad English, it is my fifth language. I learned it a couple of months ago. now why don't you go back to solving your Sudoku puzzles while thinking you're the next Einstein. I have important real-life applications to attend to. I get paid to think, yea, they PAY me just to sit in an office all day thinking and finding solutions to advanced mathematical problems. Think about that the next time you post something as retarded as "kek", like anyone cares about that an Anonymous internet user somewhere in the world slightly giggled to a post.

Like the Zombie mod. Those were genuinely terrifying back then. Those modders had some serious talent. But overall, the most hours I had played were in MW2. Something like 592 hours. And then I was randomly banned for no reason. Which is a shame because I loved that game almost as much as COD4. <br><br>In comparison, I had only played 92 hours of Black Ops. Absolutely hated it. And then MW3.. Less than 30 hours. Every game after MW3, I've played less than 10 hours of because I hate them so much.</br></br></br>    <br>might just post some shit anyway</br>  <br>Yeah most of COD went to shit after MW3.

Does that help?<br><br>The square "snouts" or noses are called "standard cabs" as opposed to "widecabs." Google it and you'll definitely see what I mean. Widecabs are the new standard for new power but standard cabs still linger in great numbers. Hope this helps lol</br></br></br>  <br>yeah, i don't really know if there's a NAME that classifies them all?

I find that specific locomotive's paint scheme very nice. It's pretty rare today (only 10 or less in that green/silver scheme roam around on CSX today) and I find the thrill of hunting down rare locomotives before they get rebuilt, scrapped, or retired to be very fun.

The improved software would be even better at improving itself, leading to recursive self-improvement. The new intelligence could thus increase exponentially and dramatically surpass humans. Technological progress will cause a runaway effect wherein artificial intelligence will exceed human intellectual capacity and control, thus radically changing or even ending civilization. Humanity is doomed one way or another.  How much information can you put in a line of code? Unless you have the hardware to back up the software you wouldn't have the memory or power of a human brain then you couldn't be equivalent to one. We're not even close to producing something on a scale with our minds, the collective internet is about 4 brains worth of cat videos and other useless stuff Amd you're worried about an A.I. on a potato in a lab somewhere messing that up?  <br>With advancement in technology people have to do less, think less, remember less.
