I see you called someone a "faggot" I'm assuming you meant this jokingly, but I've been mulling this over in my head for several days and it does not sit right. Let me please (re)iterate you on this word. Not only does it aim hatred at a large group of people that I myself and many of my friends are a part of, the word has the power to tear down and undermine a fight that we have been fighting for decades. I don't know where you stand on the issue, but I'm assuming you value your rights to equality as a citizen of this country. You may think that this is only a word, a mere configuration of letters, but this word is the foundation that keeps LGBT people held in the depths of inequality, while men like yourself toss around hateful slurs in a joking way thinking immaturely that you are immune to hurting anyone. This is not true. Next time you throw this word out (however jokingly and privately you may thing you are using this- in this era NOTHING is ever private), think about those who have struggled for the right to feel safe in their own country. The word "faggot" creates a hostile environment and makes many LGBT people feel unsafe around those who have enough power in society to use such words. Don't make me feel unsafe. I have a right to my safety. And although I have tremendous pride in being a mature, strong, bisexual woman, it really sucks when your words get in the way of my pride. Thanks for your attention.</br></br>  It's a funny Internet meme that 9gag started about 4-5 years ago where if you say his name, Candlejack, he comes and takes you away. It's not very funny but alot of new fags enjoy laughing at it.  <br>v</br>  how does anon feel about the deep web  <br>I'm calling bullshit, everyone has a different story about what's in the video. Where did you even find it?</br>  You want some links or what?  <br>Bump</br>  you groove you lose?

Why sad?...you know you can share and /b/ will always be here for you..</br>  <br>Well it is the only constant in my life, what can I say<br>The ship has been sinking for some time down, and we all know the captain goes down with it</br></br>  <br>fuck off newfag</br>  <br><br><br>It's getting better tho, my high school generation made a group on Facebook and invited me, they're not the bullies they used to be (apparently) and a nerdy girl that had (apparently) a crush on me aged quite well, is still single and showing interest, she even helped me with a job interview<br>I'm with hope, unless it's an elaborate prank</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, if things are getting better that's good.<br>Just play it cool and don't let it go down the drain.<br>Just play along, the show must go on</br></br></br>  <br> unless it's an elaborate prank <br><br>What then retard? WIll you do it? An Hero...</br></br></br>  <br>Great, hope it goes well for you. I wouldn't think they would be sad enough to still be pulling 'bully pranks' like that as adults...but if they do just remember that you're the better person and you have the morale high ground...and the pain will only be for a few seconds/minutes, then you can go home, return to b and return to the community</br>  <br>What is an hero?</br>  <br>sadly yesterday <br> mfw newfag </br></br>  <br>Go back to reddit</br>  <br> What is an hero? <br>suicide</br></br>  <br>Well at least reddit doesn't have these damn captchas!</br>  <br><br>I love knowing what those pranksters did to make their money. It brings me great pleasure.</br></br>  <br>Im on Reddit apparently you shitskin faggit</br>  <br>Oh.. O.o</br>  <br>I'm to much of a faggot to an hero, probably would just give up, stop trying, lose my sanity and probably live in the street</br>  <br>Kekekek, yes this so much.<br> mfw that tough guy bully is now a toilet cleaner </br></br>  <br>not everyone is as sad as you are faggot. some of us come here to help and some of us come here to laugh at stupid autistic fuckers like you<br><br><br>i have a 6 figure job, gf who hovers between a 6 and an 8 (depending on the night) live in a great city, with dozens of friends and acquaintances to hang out with. plus i have a house on a lake that i'm renovating.</br></br></br></br>  <br>send pics tho when you do that :)</br>  <br>Aww cmon bro, there's always hope, don't think about such things, for all we know they may well have changed their ways and decided to be different people now</br>  Man, I'm a newfag. I can't triforce, I don't remember having a fingerbox as a child, it's pretty rough  <br><br>You people are so fucking stupid. You think I don't know what I'm saying?</br></br>  <br>Nice! I also chose Lakeview Manor</br>    <br>Fuck off frog poser</br>  <br><br>Nah. Way better to talk shit instead of hiding.</br></br>  <br>Finger bob?</br>  <br>Tell me more about it. You call it a prank but what if it is really a trap of some sort?</br>    I  <br>i don't get the joke and don't feel like googling it. is it a game joke? something like the sims maybe?</br>  <br>Yes, be careful anon. It may be a trap, they may try to torture/rape/drug you, don't let your guard down</br>  <br>Nice try normo</br>  <br>what did they use to do to you?</br>  <br>Skyrim</br>  <br><br>Define real world. Last time I checked your real world was insanely inaccurate.</br></br>  <br>by trap I may mean something else like a nigger slut cock monster is waiting for you <br>(see related pic please)</br></br>  <br>It's a line from Cowboy Bebop.<br>Nice going</br></br>  <br>  2015 <br>  Using that maymay still </br></br>  <br>Oh...that too I guess...</br>   implying I'm gonna fat or autistic for much longer.   <br>well this place is real and it has a cool little jail cell looking room in the basement. just need to put a door on it. there is a little rock wall room and behind that a room that is a shower and has a drain in the middle of it.</br>  <br>Shit, you collect jojos too</br>  <br>Nice, must feel good to be you</br>  <br>Just normal bullying, making fun of weird gestures, my autism, the fact that I never talked to a girl, etc. I wasn't the primary target tho, or at least I don't remember it like that, maybe I blocked it idk, don't remember much of school</br>  <br>It isn't, but b/ autists are so entertaining.</br>  you are all just a bunch of faggos. Why do you canalise the hate towards yourself? Start to channel all the hate towards the society. This society is a lottery of genes and environment, there is no free will, noone is responsible for his life. So if life has fucked you over, you were just unlucky. So why hating yourself? it is not your fault. And now look at all these people who had luck in their life, how they look condescendingly at you? Dont let them get you, take retribution, take their luck and happy lifes and have your own justice, show them that they aren't in control of their lifes. because at the end of this life, no one will judge you, there is no god and nothing will be okay. So man up and destroy what destroys you or you are just a faggot.d  <br>Normos rooooo!</br>  <br><br>Yeah, they keep underestimating me and it's never been the other way around.</br></br>  <br> making fun of weird gestures <br><br>pics please also drawings if possible my OC folder is empty</br></br></br>  <br>You gotta consume the world in flames before the world consumes you</br>  <br><br>I don't know anything about that so now I feel silly.</br></br>  <br>Yo b I'm sitting here and I'm literally asking myself why op is such an idiot why can't he just go out and get a good job like the rest of us? i got great family backing me, a gf, a 7 figure job, a penthouse in Cali, a summer house and an Aston Martin, and on top of that I recently got the one plus one. Some people are fucking idiots, go get a job op, lazy weeaboo fag</br>  <br><br>Porn does that to everyone it can.</br></br>  <br>Faggoty liar. 7 income salary, time to waste on b/, and buys a OnePlus. Sure.</br>  <br>No problem.<br>Best anime ever, you should watch it. Don't make them like'em anymore.</br></br>  <br> noone is responsible for his life. So if life has fucked you over, you were just unlucky. <br><br>Thats no excuse to just lay down and take it you edgy autistic fuck. <br><br> HURR THE WORLD IS UNFAIR SO LETS FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE HURR <br><br>Are you 15? Boo hoo a few things went wrong in your life, stop being a little fucking cunt and grow up.<br><br>Nobody has a perfect life. If you're gonna take everything on face value, then you're just as retarded as you sound.<br><br>Instead of focusing your energy on innocent people who haven't done anything to you, focus it on not growing up to be the fucking shitstain that it looks like you're going to be.<br><br>Stop being so bitter cause daddy didn't get you your ps4 for Christmas.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>about the same time i realised i was an alcoholic</br>  <br>When I got into a room I looked for the windows (had claustrophobia as a child) and started counting the corners, did it by moving my fingers and didn't stop until the last corner finished with my thumb.<br>Also clinched my jaw wile I did it.<br>Don't have photos, avoided them until well into college.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Think she'd fuck ron jeremy?</br></br>  <br>Thats ok. Please make some drawingws of this for me. I will reward with a huge folder of traps if you want.</br>  <br>What the fuck is wrong with it? It's a great phone fucking idiot. Go back to one of your fucking iPhone rallies newfag</br>  <br>That could take a while and I'm about to leave, some other time, anon</br>  <br>Yup, great phone. Nobody on earth who has a ton of cash owns one, though. Faggoty liar.</br>  <br>WHis Ron Jeremy?</br>  When despite holding numerous occupations that forces me to interact with people, my interpersonal skills haven't developed past a 9th grade level.
