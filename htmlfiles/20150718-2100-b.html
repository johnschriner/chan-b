[ What do atheists live for?  well atleast you decided to use a new pic this time  THE LAW  <br>What do christians die for?</br>  dank<br><br>memes</br></br>  The new season of Rick and Morty.  <br>CRIME AND HATRED AND THE BLOOD OF WHITE BABIES</br>  <br>dank wubs</br>  When will this gay shit end?  <br><br><br>What we choose to live for. It's very different from your sad circular theology logic. <br><br>We don't paint the world up in imaginary colors/stories, we just see it for what it is, accept it, and live for what we choose is important to us. That could mean family, careers, friends, hobbies, interests, whatever the fuck we choose. When we kick the bucket, we kick the bucket. We you die, its no different then looking at a dead bird or dog on the side of the road, when you're dead, you're dead. No use wishing for more. In fact, acceptance to "what is" makes life more enjoyable, like taking a fresh breath of air everyday. It has its own rewards that aren't made in fantasy.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>either when christians stop being so butthurt at being on the wrong side of history or when atheists stop wearing fedoras and being so easily trolled</br>  <br>so... never</br>  <br>Every Crusade after the first one</br>  laughing at how hard people try to troll us like this  <br><br>Exactly. Nobody ever falls for it.</br></br>  I feel that the meaning of life is found in the great moments that we have on a day to day basis. You know, like a great meal, the warmth of a summer day or the way the woods look after it has snowed....the feeling of when youre in someones arms. Out of the billions of people, our experiences are meaningless. To ourselves they are priceless. Its these thoughts that keep me from being depressed!  pussy  Dopamine. I do a lot of drugs.  <br>They live for that question</br>  <br>That and that there is no heaven or god</br>  <br>To become Christians</br>  <br>That's actually pretty deep, anon.</br>  <br>Grounded anon</br>  Answer: Desire<br><br><br>Keep it in your religious support groups, coward</br></br></br>  <br>i live for my self</br>  <br>Black cock</br>  It doesn't mean anything faggots. You're all just star stuff. As infinitesimally probable collection of cosmic shit that got ripped out of nonexistence into this body and mind. When you die you become part of the cosmos again, and your conscience will exist the way that it did before you were born. There's no meaning. You just enjoy the fucking ride.  the search for the truth  <br>Sad</br>  <br>rollin dubs</br>  <br>Why do christians knock up their sisters?</br>  <br>Troll threads apparently</br>  <br>i live in hopes that we as a society start building floating cities, orbital stations for average civilians, discovering possible wormholes, etc. mostly futuristic space stuff</br>  Religion<br>HAHAHAHAHAHA!!1!<br>its almost as funny as women's rights!</br></br>  <br><br>Amazing, isn't it?</br></br>  <br>we have nothing to die for and everything to live for...</br>  <br>There is always a meaning. <br>Why else would the universe have developed a consciousness to observe itself?</br></br>    Everything. We simply have nothing to die for  <br>for ourselves, by our own rules</br>  <br>It didn't. It developed a consciousness by chance.</br>  <br>/thread</br>  Peaceful coexistence... and getting laid.  To witness the death and suffering of religious people.  <br>I find living as a slave, prostrated and groveling for mercy before some vile and vengeful desert-kike war-godhead, to be the sadder of the existences my good anon. I prefer a life of dignity. Dignity doesn't come cheap, and living without a rulebook is difficult and wracked with uncertainty. You are forced to stand up and decide for yourself what is right and wrong in the ugly gray area that is life, and it can be hard sometimes. But it is an authentic existence.</br>  <br>For the glory of Satan</br>  Anything but God  <br>of course.</br>  <br>Suck black cock</br>  To be honest, would a creator not accept his children for not believing in him? And if you flip that.. Would you want to join someone who did?  <br>That's fucking gay dude.<br>Enjoy getting assfucked by demons while I'm chilling with Jesus in my mansion. Think about it! Does it not stagger the imagination? No builder on earth can concieve any structure to compare to the mansions above. Won't that be something when you go to live in your own mansion? There'll be no concern about paying for it, it's already taken care of. There'll be no worry about being moved out of it. It will be yours forever."</br></br>  <br>Suck big black cock</br>  <br>The odds are almost very statistically impossible. But im sure you knew that.</br>  <br> I'm chilling with Jesus in my mansion. <br><br>That's fucking gay dude.</br></br></br>    <br>You have the intelligence of a gnat</br>  <br>You are dreaming, time to wake up.</br>  <br>They are the same as the odds of anything else in existence.</br>  <br>implying you only live to please god</br>  <br>Monty python, mostly</br>  <br><br><br> not questioning the ICP lyrics <br>Oh, atheists...</br></br></br></br>  <br>Death.</br>  Are we just going to do this every fucking day?  <br>Could be. Could also be a complete anomaly. <br> Common life sure that seems like it would just take the right chemical composition and the right environment. <br> Advanced intelligent life past that of the common animal. Now that is strange and unusual. </br></br></br>    Dick.  <br>Why would I recognize that kind of shit, I'm White, but I'm not white trash.</br>  <br>/b/ is dead. It died years ago.<br>Now that I think of it was around the time of boxxy...</br></br>  <br>you are contributing to it</br>  <br> implying I've ever listened to their music </br>  Why do atheists always answer with a question or insult?<br>They're probably lashing out here because they can't when their teacher gets mad at them for being retarded.</br>  <br>Sex and drugs</br>  <br>see <br> , <br>you tremendous faggotface</br></br></br>  <br>It is a complete anomaly. But so is a light on Ceres, or a mound of dust on the moon, or a storm on Jupiter. They're all anomalies, and equally radical when you look at them through a cosmic lens.</br>  If there is a god, he's probably gonna let all the atheists in and not the religious people. Think about it.. if you were god, would you invite the butt lickers or the honest people?  <br>Being able to have sex before marriage</br>  <br>see</br>  <br>Nothing. They just live.</br>  They dont' know, every atheist philosopher wonders about the meaning of life.<br>We christians instead believe that the meaning of life is to live with a meaning, to take consciousness of our role in the God's Creation.</br>  <br>What is our role?</br>  <br>Didnt know about ceres. That is interesting.<br>Also would have to be a pretty big cosmic lens to look it that way instead of an individual basis. Pretty fascinating point of view.</br></br>  <br>Life</br>  <br>No, you fucking faggot. Try not to ad-hom and put up an actual fucking argument for once.<br><br>Fucking. See. </br></br></br>  <br><br>Also the way you mentioned that simply implies that every piece or atom in this universe and every configuration is an anomaly. Which is absolutely true but I was saying that the more advanced configurations seem even more unlikely than the first. Than again if almost everything is unlikely than it throws any statistics or probabilities out the window.</br></br>  Why you need to live for something ? Or Somebody ? Is it an obligation ? Something written on very old book ? Personally I live to build something with my life. I'm married and I have a 6 months old baby, 2 cats... I want to build a family, and I'm happy doing so. I don't know if god exist and I don't care, the only thing I care about is my own code of living which is respect other people, respect the nature and all living things, be strong, be kind, help as much as you can the one in need. Be brave and be there for your family, provide for them...  <br>the text really doesn't make it justice, find a video of it. shit's cash</br>  <br>Trips confirm.<br><br>I, personally, live to experience things and gain information and insight. I love meeting different people and acquiring different skills.</br></br></br>  <br>the destruction of the church, the demolishment of all their buildings and the torture and execution of all religious people as a sacrifice to our atheist god</br>  <br>You're just answering my question with insults.</br>  A reading from the books of Bokonon:<br><br>In the beginning, God created the earth, and he looked upon it in His cosmic loneliness.<br><br>And God said, "Let Us make living creatures out of mud, so the mud can see what We have done." And God created every living creature that now moveth, and one was man. Mud as man alone could speak. God leaned close as mud as man sat up, looked around, and spoke. Man blinked. "What is the purpose of all this?" he asked politely.<br><br>"Everything must have a purpose?" asked God.<br><br>"Certainly," said man.<br><br>"Then I leave it to you to think of one for all this," said God.<br><br>And He went away.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I dont think anyone fully grasps what any of this is about. Those who have doubts believe there is no purpose those who hope believe there is a purpose. Those who are wise simply admit they dont know. Hey at least its a good starting point?</br>  bump  <br>No, there are those who are weak and must have a purpose somebody else made up to guide them and there are those who are willing to walk the difficult path of the autonomous individual and find their own purpose, if any, along the way.</br>  I'd kill myself but I don't want my grandma to be sad.  <br> implying you didn't blatant ad-hom and i called you out on it <br><br>I'm going to be slightly ironic for a second and tell you to fucking kill yourself. You are worthless.</br></br></br>  <br>you have truly transcended</br>  we live in a world where miley cyrus, rihanna, one direction etc are celebrated as talented. what hope is there for genuine talent to break through to some sort of mainstream audience ??    <br>No OP you pretty much have to look like Bruno Mars. Or you have to fool the public into accepting you.<br><br>I don't think any of us are up to the challenge.</br></br></br>  <br>It's possible more offbeat stuff might get popular with pot culture coming back into style. But the cat's out of the bag regarding electronic-driven pop. You're not going to kick that genre out of the top slot.</br>  <br> miley etc are celebrated as talented <br><br>No they arent. Nobody ever claimed they are musical geniuses... they are just pop stars who are played all the time, thats it.

Meanwhile there are still millions of people enjoying more complex and creative music. :^)  <br>Because the media controls what we listen to.

It was invented, and has been continually refined by, the world's leading defense contractors, communications afficionados, programmers and coders, back-alley hackers and visionaries worldwide for nearly half a century. What was originally intended as a nuclear-resistant communications hardline has metamorphisized into a vast codex of basically all of the world's knowledge on everything fucking EVER. This includes Canada's child abuse and AIDS rates for any year up to last fiscal year. If you can't figure out how to Google that shit and yet can do the mental gymnastics required for this level of /pol/lack delusion, then there truly is no fucking helping you. Is it so hard to just type "I THINK GAY SEX IS JUST THE WORST AND FUCKING GROSS, GODDAMN"? Because that seems to be the extent of your point, beyond some flailing notion that gay people are somehow more abusive to kids than straight, bi or asexual people.</br></br>  <br>From what I can find, in Canada 1 in 3 girls and 1 in 6 boys experience a form of sexual assult before the age of 18.</br>  <br>How does gay marriage impact child molestation? <br><br>I don't see the corrilation.</br></br></br>  <br><br>All that time typing out that comment and you still can't look up and post the rate.. <br><br>Typical.<br><br><br><br>So higher than the US, then. Wonder what the rate was PRE-shitdick marriage.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Slippery slope, opening the floodgates of degeneracy, normalizing paraphilias.</br></br>  <br>Here you go<br>http://littlewarriors.ca/about/help<wbr>/info/statistics-research/<br><br>It seems heterosexual child abuse is MUCH more common then homosexual. So by your logic we should outlaw heterosexual marrige so the rate of girls being molested goes down.</br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>The slippery slope isn't real, 10+ years of gay marrige in other countries and nothing bad has happened. <br><br>Try again.</br></br></br>  <br> All that time typing out that comment and you still can't look up and post the rate..Typical. <br>You're the fuckass that wants data. We're on the internet. Go look for data.</br></br>  <br> MUCH more common <br><br>No, in terms of total numbers absolutely, but there are FAR more heterosexuals than shitdicks (1-3% of population). <br><br>A homosexual has a 1 in 3 chance of being a child molester. This is not some fantasy statistic this is solid math based on US government crime and demographic stats. <br><br>It's like niggers, they are far more likely to commit crime, even if the majority of crime is committed by white people.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's mentaly handicapped cut him some slack.</br>  YES<br>IT'S STARTING<br>I'M GONNA BE FUCKING LITTLE GIRLS SOON</br></br>  <br>  homosexual have a 1 - 3 chance of being child molesters  <br><br>Citation needed.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Google it.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;628742076 <br>We also need to rid the world of down syndrome. <br><br>As a result this guy <br>Will not survive the purge.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Can we also call into question how much he ACTUALLY cares about some fucking kid somewhere? I mean, I like kids. They're assholes sometimes, but they're fun. But surely you have to be a big boy sometime and understand that occasionally, horrible shit happens to people for equally horrible reasons (or no reason at all), even to children. THIS, however, sounds like the same cacamamie bullshit gun-grabbers pull to gain favor.</br>  <br>You are a fucking moron. Child molesters have a 1/3 chance of being LGBT, not the other way around you mindless fuck.</br>  <br> dancing around the issue <br><br>Just as I though you are talking out your ass.<br><br>Oh wait I should say<br><br>"All that time typing out that comment and you still can't look up and post the source... <br><br>Typical."</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Pad?  68m3vt7g2pf1  <br> 68m3vt7g2pf1 <br>Pass?</br></br>  <br>i didn't need one. not my room.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;68 m3vt7g2pf1<br>Dead</br>  <br>what does pad mean god damnit</br>  <br>google padlet</br>  <br>Does any one no how to get unbanned from there?</br>  <br>Clear browser cookies.</br>  <br>wait a couple of days</br>  any rooms?  <br>go through a proxy</br>  <br><br>Ok thanks..

Actually got a bunch of people on.</br></br></br>  <br><br>check</br></br>  <br>You'd better, shit's dead in hurr.</br>  <br>depends what the pictures are of.</br>  <br>Word, we were all up pretty late too</br>  Hastings Street, Napier, 1880s, photographed by the Burton Brothers.  <br>actually having females in it was better.</br>  <br>Checked<br>Yeah that thought has crossed my mind but I think I'll be right seeing as though most of the bar clientele that I cover are usually pretty chill. They usually just chuck me on door rather than inside because of it because of that actually, at least that's what one boss does</br></br>  Another scarfag here.<br><br><br><br>Tomatoes and feta salad, don't give a fuck about health but it was pretty much the only edible thing left in my fridge.<br><br>Shit's tasty, too.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>tomatoes and feta salad?<br>so you have tomatoes and feta.</br></br>  ‘Princes Street, Dunedin in 1862′  <br>I would have just roasted tomatoes, then chucked feta on top and grilled the cunts.</br>  <br><br>and olive oil.</br></br>  <br>go fuck some sheep</br>    <br><br>Hmmm, intriguing. Sounds like something my drunk friend would cook.

Now I know this sounds insane, and most of you have already stopped reading, but think about it. If you believe there is intelligent life outside of our solar system, then you should also believe that we are most likely a simulation. Consider this: astronomers estimate that there are at least 2 billion planets that have water and are a safe distance from the sun, just like earth. If any intelligent life among those 2 billion has managed to create a simulation of the universe, then they have most likely done it more than once. These numbers mean that there is a higher probability we are in a simulation, even if they have only simulated the universe twice. Most likely, intelligent life has simulated the universe millions if not billions of times. Thoughts?  <br><br>That's one amazing weed you smokin' right there bruh.</br></br>  <br>Im way too high to even want to try to comprehend that shit OP.</br>  <br>There's only one physical universe and an infinite series of simulations. You're infinitely more likely to be in a simulation than the real universe. This means that God exists, and is a mathematician who don't give a fuck about us. Probably a simulation within a simulation himself.</br>  <br>This is real shit. Physicists like Richard Feynman first theorized it.</br>  Can i have your weed guy's number?  <br><br>ive come down enough to spit at you.<br><br>Listen OP, here's the deal. We may very well be in a simulation. However assuming that is the case it in fact does not change the fact that we are stuck here. We've already proven that our perception of reality is warped, and that we are all living inside a hologram. 99.9% of reality isn't actually there, it can't be regarded as real. We know that based on physics. So a simulation is a very real possibility.<br><br>If only it solved anything in life. Or gave us some direction. But sadly it's not going to adjust our lives to find that out for sure. We will still be stuck here. Unless you go down a schizo avenue and believe you must die in order to break free of the simulation.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Its possible, especialy when you consider how similar reality is to a holograph. This shit aint 3d, it's 2d. Push pull, left right, up down, forward backward, black white, male female. Next time you take shrooms, think about it.     male female <br> caitlyn </br>  <br>Hologram not holograph, too high for this</br>  <br>and we're supposed to believe the bible and give our lives to christ</br>  <br/>  A while back some researcher found code in the string theory... <br><br>http://theawakenment.com/theoretica<wbr>l-physicist-james-gates-finds-compu<wbr>ter-code-in-string-theory-equation/<wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>or beings from the fourth dimension</br>  <br>Death is inevitable, those who slip between the crack in the worlds will be free.</br>  <br>OP here, ya im not saying we should give up, a simulation this advanced would feel just like real life, so we can still enjoy our lives.</br>  <br>Dude its all numbers. Math is just the system used to calculate the universe created. A system is Not randomly developed. Its created. By whom. Idk. We just discovered it. Thats why no matter what ive always believed in god. Everything is around is just too perfect, and everything out of reach is too much of a mystery.</br>  <br>You know the "forth dimension" isn't a magical place, right? Look up "10thdim" on "imagining the xth dimension" where x is a value between 0 and 10. Yes, there are 11 dimensions</br>  <br><br>Basically what im saying is that if you escape duality through a supreme balance of awareness sobriety and purpose, you will be free.<br>Death is an opportunity to do so. Instead of percieving the imensity of the entire universe bearing down on your unprotected consciousness as either heaven or hell, just see it as it is.</br></br></br>  <br><br>If you follow what we are "suppose" to do, you would be living in absolute insanity. Those that are able to use rational analysis of this reality without religion or other obscene bias are able to take a good look at the universe as a whole. <br><br>Most likely, if we are being realistic, we are being of vibration and frequency. We can't see this, because we lack the senses. But we recieve and emit waves. The same as the sun and earth, and the other heavenly bodies. <br><br>What that means, combined with the fact that our reality is 99.9% holographic, is that our very reality entirely depends on our perception. It also gives up freedom to build ourselves as we wish.<br><br>If we truly are being of vibration and frequency, and that is the "observer" not the "thinking mind" then there very well may be life after death. our energy may seek out a new host. We might really just be renting these meat bags until they bitch out.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>why would said "simulators" allow us (the subjects) to be aware of their presence in said simulation if only for a millisecond knowing that ould skew their data???<br><br><br>put down the mushrooms dude, they are starting to do long term damage.</br></br></br></br>  <br>would*</br>  <br>it was a simulation, could have just been some game of evolution type thing that they thought was interesting to observe and see how far we got</br>  itt: people make baseless assumptions on theories they don't understand or have only ever read about in an online article.<br>and general stoner talk</br>  <br>I didn't say it was "magical", it is the most likely to have life that communicates with us</br>  <br>We do not lack the senses need to see the true form of energy, we lack sobriety. Remove your description of the world and all worldy images will crumble. All that will be left is a world of luminous living fibers of light.</br>  <br>The thing is they probably don't know that, or at least want to see it happen. We might be running the same kind of simulation one day...</br>  <br>yeah, still interesting, since I'm stoned</br>  You guys should probably watch this.<br>https://vimeo.com/122325664</br>  <br> implying we aren't the 5th iteration of simulations inside simulations and the original simulators even have a clue about us </br>  <br><br>I like this idea. And I believe there may very well be some truth in it. <br><br>Are you saying you believe that the only way to actually proceed with the escape from this endless cycle is the recognition of that awareness as we die? That's what most say.<br><br>I have an issue with the processing tho. I'd be ready to leave. Right now if need be, leave all my attachments behind. But...<br><br>If that is truly the case, then I could leave right now, and not have to suffer any more. <br><br>Do you believe it is necessary to live out the extent of which we can experience life, do you believe it is necessary? Or do you believe you would sabotage yourself if you simply threw yourself off a bridge?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What if our real lives are so shitty that we came here</br>  <br>we should boycott said simulation and planetary suicide</br>  <br>are you all living up to this kind of crap???? really dudes, you should forget all about this shit and start living a life based on reality and not in theories that you barely understand.</br>  <br>wouldnt being aware of the outside simulation engineers be the pinnacle of awareness and thus end said experiment???</br>  <br> buzzwords </br>  For all of you wondering about the true nature of death, smoke salvia, if it is ment to be, it will show it to you.  <br>This is what slightly frightens me. If we run the same simulation, there will be actual numbers supporting this theory. Technological development doubles every 2 years, and has been increasing even quicker recently.</br>  <br>sorry, this comment was meant for</br>  <br> If that is truly the case, then I could leave right now, and not have to suffer any more.  <br><br>fuck off life is no anime</br></br></br>  <br>fuck dude what could be more shitty than this though</br>  <br>tumblr</br>  <br>It can be achieved while alive, but first you need the awareness that you are already indeed dead. For that you must die at least once without actuallu dieing. Try smoking salvia</br>  Who is to say that any of those planets have life forms smart enough to create such a good simulation. Very few bugs and glitches, great graphics, good AI and a built in reward system?  <br>no because we don't have proof, and anyone who actually bases their life around this will be considered insane by others. it would only be a threat if the entire world or entire galaxy knew and truly believed it</br>  <br><br><br>dude, this isnt inception.... hell why not go as far to say its a simulation... in a simulation... in a simulation... in some aliens video game =\<br><br>or maybe... juuust maybe... everybody here is wrong and we all sound like a bunch of spaced out hippies making conspiracy theories about a very real reality.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>moore's law dude. we might be able to accomplish such a thing in the near future</br>  <br>thankyou, was too lazy to reply but pretty much this, unless it was scientifically possible to break the simulation it would theoretically only end when we are all dead or our creators decide to end us</br>  <br>Imagine a race without food or water. Unable to survive, living on nuclear derived food. They enter into a simulation where they live out a life as long as they can, for as many lifetimes as they can. Until that nuclear power runs out, and the last of their race dies. <br><br>They might be approaching the very last universe cycle where everything consenses back up, and sucks in all of space to be crushed in some kind of ultimate black hole. The same type that then explodes again to create another big bang event and from that a new universe.</br></br></br>  Freedom of this world means to be free of your description, this world is only created by your description of it, without your description there is nothing, yet it is filled to the brim.  Fuck all you faggots with your immature theories..<br><br>Oh well this could, or well that would be... <br><br>No.. either shit is? or shit isn't...<br><br>There is a fucking theory for you nerds</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I drank floripondio (some kind of datura) and I almost died but woke up and felt fresh and new, am I a human being who's in another plane of existence and can vibrate higher than all of you?.</br>  <br><br>no you fucking dipshit, a quantum simulator isn't even remotely close to "the universe being a simulation." it's a theoretical super computer, it has nothing to do with what you're talking about<br><br>holy shit retarded teens trying to sound deep and intelligent on /b/. amazing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>only one form of life needs to be advanced enough to make one simulation good enough to mimic life, and it is more likely that your consciousness is in that simulation, with an exponentially increasing probability.</br>  <br>Moore's law doesnt apply here. <br><br>Where is the Beta version? Where are the mods?</br></br></br>  <br>realistically, they would have created their version of "heaven" for them to put themselves into</br>  Here's proof<br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/clnozSXyF4k  [ ]</br></br>  <br>christfag detected</br>  <br>Too bad it doesn't work that way.</br>  <br>are you retarded?</br>  <br>Nah man, just high quality weed</br>  <br><br>Describe the process to me. I've done a lot of drugs. But I havent fucked with salvia. <br><br>Are you trying to tell me that I need to experience a fake death, and realize that I am already dead, but what do you mean by that? <br><br>That I never was alive to begin with? That I really am a hologram. That my initial kick of energy was from the being of light inside of this sack of meat? The one we already refer to as the observer?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Possibly, do you remember death?</br>  <br><br>for someone who made such a "far out" theory its awfully funny you go so far out and then also limit it to only one species being advanced enough?<br><br>how about we all just end this debacle with a nice friend... "I dont know".... I think if alot of thiests and "enlightened folks" said that more often there wouldnt be wars over belief or people going out on a limb to describe what is simply out of our mortal grasp</br></br></br></br>  <br>Life is simply nothingness resisting itself, its the universe struggling to understand. That resistance creates duality, thus life. Death is the realization that you are ultimately nothing and everything at the same time, with no duality.</br>  <br>No, I was sleeping all day long, and my friend told me he could not wake me up and he was very scared. Few hours later, I woke up.<br>I remember I was an idiot before floripondio, now I have a different life and shit so yeah we all should try hard natural drugs</br></br>  <br>Hey op, even if it was all a simulation, it wouldn't matter. This is because the parameters of our world are real to us, and we cannot influence the hypothetical non-simulated world. So to us it doesn't matter either way.</br>  <br> If any intelligent life among those 2 billion has managed to create a simulation of the universe <br>This is the tricky part.</br></br>  <br><br>What if heaven was too boring? They needed some pain to appreciate the pleasure?<br><br>Have you ever done opiates a few days in a row? You just need a break every now and then. Eternal bliss would become normal, it would become boring, you would strive for a come down, something to adjust the frequency. What if this is nothing more than a game weve been placed into. With the outcome being anything we desire. All we have to do is make the effort. If we want to be miserable, we shall, if we want to be successfull, then all we have to do is go out there and grab it.<br><br>It makes sense if you look at what the ideal would be.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Good AI <br>How can you really know that the people around you are not AI?<br> Bugs/Glitches  <br>That would explain hallucinations, optical illusions, etc<br> Great graphics <br>If we had no knowledge of sight/senses beforehand (memory eliminated or non accessible) then whatever we do see/sense inside the simulation would be as real/good as anything since it would be all that we know.<br> Built in reward system <br>Happiness, love, sense of accomplishment<br><br>It's all there anon. We're right in the thick of it. But then again, maybe you're AI. Maybe I am. Who's to say that you or I are even conversing with actual people?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Salvia may show you what it means to die, for it cannot be explained sufficently with words.</br>  <br><br>Google "The simulation argument". It's a well established philosophical hypothesis.</br></br>  <br>friendly*</br>  <br> lets all just refrain from saying anything about anything because we neeeeeeed deduction to answer any question <br>get the fuck outta here. there are inductive inferences that can be seen as legitimate you fuckwad.</br></br>  ITT: 15-year-old armchair philosophers<br><br>You guys are LITERALLY, ACTUALLY retarded. Not even metaphorically, just full-blown, weapons-grade retarded. <br><br>Please, don't even THINK about physics/philosophy if you're in middle-high school. You only make yourself look like an idiot.</br></br></br></br>  <br>op here, i agree. i even said that earlier the the thread :)</br>  <br>Sounds more like an atheist truthfully.<br>"It's there or it's not, you can never prove it so it's not true"</br></br>  <br>true. we really have no idea how our lives could be so much worse</br>   2 billion planets that have water and are a safe distance from the sun, <br><br>Where are all these planets, then?<br><br>Mankind: 1<br>Computers: 0</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>thanks for the post m8, but there are legitimate philosophers who debate this sort of things, and quite recently, a lot of physicists are saying there is a growing probability of these theories being true, or very likely. how about you educate yourself on the discussion instead of being an actual retard yourself</br>  <br>did you even read anything?</br>  <br> Perception is Reality  <br><br>If you perceive the universe as a simulation than its nothing but that. <br><br>We are all extras in your motion picture.

There's no freedom in death, or life, or even at all, ever. Inside the simulation we act according to our chosen code.</br></br>  This life is a process we created ourselves in order to understand, once we "get it" we can escape the cycle. Develop your awareness to be lucid after death. It is lime kucid dreaming. That sea of awareness will overwhelm you and you will be lost with no sobriety.  <br> implying humankind or whatever intelligent beings or entities didn't build supercomputers with unimaginable superintelligence and didn't create simulated worlds the way we create virtual worlds (albeit primitive) like Second Life.  <br><br>It is all a possibly. Life may be more futile than we already think.</br></br></br>  <br>  lets just say everything and pretend like we know some stuff to sound enlightened when none of this shit warrants any truth then debate with people like assholes about shit weve already admitted we dont know for sure <br><br>eat a dick you fucking knob.</br></br></br>  <br>Actually, I had this believe as a likely possibility when I was a teen (1986). The rich doing its best to exploit the masses while the masses are reproducing out of control to deplete this planet faster than it can recover, also while the industry owned by the rich destroys the environment faster than nature could... that is our simulation getting ready to reboot.</br>  <br>Scattered among the hundred billion or so stars in the galaxy.That planet count is just for the Milky Way, btw.</br>  <br>"weapons-grade retarded" makes me think of weaponized retards, like these are people strategically deployed by militaries to use their retardation to terrorize a country<br><br>top kek</br></br></br>  IS THIS REAL LIFE?  <br>go read any book on the legitimacy of inductive inferences and logic. i'm not going to talk with someone about a subject they clearly have no grasp on.</br>  <br>and it sucks</br>  <br>No, this is just fantasy.</br>  <br>are we caught in a landslide?</br>  <br>/thread</br>  We are the universe looking back at itself saying "how does this even work?" <br> Oh and don't take anything from String Theory as Fact. String theory has its ups and downs and nobody really has a proven Unifying theory as of yet. Just my two cents.</br>  <br>you went full retard son, re-read what you wrote and go sit in a corner</br>  <br><br>Listen man, serious question. <br><br>Did you smoke a lot of weed in your life? Was true sobriety in the sense of being sober in life, help to develop a sense to sobriety of reality. The break down of the illusion?<br><br>I smoke a lot of weed. and Ive fought with it back and forth for a few years now. I've really considered stopping the usage. And may do that here shortly, replace it with additional meditation.<br><br>In your experience what would you recommend?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No escape from reality</br>  <br><br> wooooOooO000ooo what if le books are part of the spacejews further confusing and just a tool of mind control... wooo000OOooo00ooo </br></br>  <br>If you mainline a moderate amount of ketamine then you will know what absolute nothing is like. <br><br>You can't see anything, you can't feel anything, there is no thought, even if you could think it wouldn't do any good because you don't know what English is, you don't know what language is. You don't know what or who you are. You don't know of the Earth, humanity, anything. It's a state of non existence. Literally nothing, just you.</br></br></br>  <br>your reading comprehension must be close to non-existent.</br>  <br>i knew there was reason i like milk with my waffles<br><br>fuck the spacejews</br></br></br>  <br><br>"holographic principle" (which is what you actually read about in all those Vice articles or whatever retards read) is different from the universe being a computer simulation, in fact, it contradicts the idea.<br><br>The articles all the pop-sci sites posted about were wrong and hyperbole (claiming that the holographic principle means we're in a simulation??? LOL) They're not even remotely close to the same thing.<br><br>You're an idiot.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Well, I'm not completely retarded or 15 although I was pretty retarded when I was 15 and I see our point. Perhaps you'd humour us with your take on things?</br></br>  <br> implying i was referring to the holographic principle argument <br>you're equally idiotic there m8</br></br>  I heard scientists would be able to simulate lives like ours to see if we really can be just simulations with the flaws that we already have to back it up.  <br>You don't even need to consider the possibility of alien life.<br><br>P1: We will likely perfectly simulate ourselves at some point in the future.<br><br>P2: We will likely simulate our history at some point in the future. This may even be a necessary part of creating a perfect simulation.<br><br>P3: Within this simulation our simulated selves will necessarily reach a point where they simulate themselves and their history.<br><br>C1: Therefore P1 to P3 recur infinitely.<br><br>C2: Therefore there are more simulated realities than real realities and probability dictates we certainly live in a simulation.<br><br>The argument against it comes from denying the first premise. Here's a thought experiment:<br><br>A king wants a 1:1 scale map of his kingdom, but not matter how many times the cartographer attempts to create the map rather than having a 1:1 scale map they simply end up with something that replaces the kingdom.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  If we're actually a simulation, then we're just as likely to create the exact same simulation and respawn our exact universe, we could also simulate a universe where endless simulations of universes are created etc.<br><br>It's incredibly unlikely by the way, regardless of the tards on the internet who read about how likely it is on a clickbait article</br></br>  <br>Interesting</br>  <br>Then the guys who simulate us must be fucking sadists.<br>Who wants to simulate my shitty life?<br>Simulate my dick you cocksucker.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Of course that's what you're referring to LOL, because that's the only thing that even comes close to anyone drawing any remote conclusion that "the universe is a simulation", because that's literally what every pop-sci publication released not but a month ago.<br><br>Universal simulation is a sci-fi plot device. It has no basis in reality because there's no reason for it to. Even philosophy needs at least a slight basis for their hypothesis'.<br><br>Grow up</br></br></br></br></br></br>  kek  <br><br>Well all the cartographer has to do create the map key, the model already exists in situ. You're assuming a dumb cartographer who insists in re-inventing the wheel.<br><br> If I have to click on pictures of steak one more time... </br></br></br></br>  <br>Ever play the sims or 2nd life? Lotsa people pay money to do it... and do horrible things in them.</br>  <br>why are you still posting? do you even read things, or do you just go on like you tried to read something and gave up because you realized how hard it is for you. i can assume you've stopped reading by this point and are all ready typing a response that has nothing to do with what i posted at all</br>  <br><br>Maybe your life is shitty because you resist your programming.</br></br>  <br>Without your shitty life how would we know what a non-shitty life was?</br>    <br><br>where'd ya find this?</br></br>  It would actually make a lot of sense for a super advanced race to simulate a new universe. The simulation could be run really fast and they could potentially generate thousands of new inventions and scientific advancement  <br><br>That's the only thing you can say? "why are you still posting?"<br><br>You could at least TRY to back up your paper-thin argument. You can't, because you're just recycling garbage you read on leddit without having an INKLING of an idea of what you're talking about. If you actually thought of it on your own, bravo, you're even more retarded in that case.<br><br>To round out what I was saying: "ITT: 14-year-old armchair philosophers"<br><br>p.s. philosophy is retarded anyway</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>so people should live without a philosophy?</br>  <br><br>And the closer the simulation is to reality the closer the probability of developing digital consciousness gets to 1.<br><br> Come on 4chins, I know what steak is, just stop already </br></br></br></br>  <br>i never made that argument you retard. seriously, you have no idea what you are doing. stop making assumptions about what arguments i made, because i've made literally 0 arguments. like i said before, you aren't even responding to what i've said, you just made this ridiculous red herring that has nothing to do with what is going on. <br><br>don't ever post again, you are actually retarded</br></br></br>  if we might be in a simulation then they that made the simulation might be in one that we made, though ?  <br><br>People should live without any philosophy in particular. Like they should live with a diet that does not solely consist of cheeseburgers.</br></br>  <br>I made you say stop posting <br> mfw you are that which you dismiss </br></br>  <br> how does temporal cause-effect work, mommy? </br>  <br>meh, that makes a disturbingly good point.</br>  <br>:/</br>  One of the reasons we are unsure about this universe being some sort of simulation is down to irrational numbers, such as pi. <br><br>As it is a non-recurring infinitely long decimal it doesn't really make mathematical sense in a simulation to leave strange numbers like this lying around. Pi is a great example because it is not only very common, but extremely useful. We see patterns all over the universe - but not quite everywhere.</br></br>  <br>Im not sure what is more sad in your life. <br><br>being the <br> 14-year-old armchair philosophers <br><br>Or <br><br>Being in a flame war on the internet with a <br> 14-year-old armchair philosophers <br><br><br>p.s. i eating popcorn watching you to go at it<br><br>mfw</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i'm serious ! if we are in a simulation then that means that at some point in time we also create a simulation of ourselves perfectly, and they who made our simulation are actually in the simulation that we made .</br>  <br>Wait... Is this a philosophical question?</br>  <br>this<br><br>I would be eating popcorn but I'm eating fries, to each his own</br></br></br>  <br>I don't know how to counterargument in this case.<br>You win, faggot. But only in this simulation.</br></br>  <br>i'm serious ! if we are in a simulation then that means at some point in time we make a simulation that perfectly simulates our lives, and that also means that they who made our simulation are living in the simulation that we made in the future .</br>  <br>Italian Spiderman</br>  <br>that would be impossible. you can't be serious. i refuse to believe you are being serious</br>  <br>i lied, i'm actually eating Doritos.<br><br>You think he'll take the bait and correct me <br>two not to<br><br>mfw</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> I'm sorry i had to send that one twice because I did not know that it would send the first time !!</br></br>  <br><br>you're using two types of philosophy, he's talking about idiots like Nick Bostrom, who actually go to college for it, instead of doing something useful with their lives.<br><br><br><br>You said philosophers think that it may be true. No, there's one that does. Nick Bostrom.<br><br>You also claimed that "there a lot of physicists are saying there is a growing probability of these theories being true". No, there's not, you're an idiot. It's a philosophy hypothesis that has no basis in actual physics.<br><br>Further, if they're saying the holographic principle is a very likely probability, it means (loosely) that the universe ISN'T a simulation. So, that directly counteracts what you're saying.<br><br>Like I said, you literally have no clue what you're trying to even think about. I'm sure you're not actually this stupid IRL and you're just philosophizing, which, I can understand can make someone 10x more dumb than they usually are.<br><br>I leave you with these words:<br><br>"Grow up"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>kinda frightening, isn't it?</br>  <br>how is it impossible ? it is simple cause and effect ?</br>  <br>Simulation Theory is a real thing in Quantum Physics.

And if I unleash a swarm of deadly viruses?

This is mainstream stuff, for you nonscience fags. It's not wacko conspiracy shit</br>  <br><br><br>what I think is we're projects for like 3rd graders.<br>Each one has a universe that he has to run. Parameters can be set freely.<br>Ours chose our physical constants, which lead to us coming to existence.<br><br>The most interesting project wins.<br><br>Problem is our 3rd grader is a /b/tard.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you're understanding of the topic includes half a wikipedia article quickly browsed through, looking at some major names and synopsis' of their articles. you are the one with a very primitive grip on what is actually being discussed.<br>also, i don't know why you keep on acting like i made an argument about anything anywhere, but it's troubling. are you okay? like you haven't had a brain aneurism or a stroke? <br>and there a several quantum physicists who put their backing behind simulation theory. you are exposing yourself, and what's worse, you think you are clever or something</br></br></br>  <br>How about Michael's sword?</br>  <br>take time into account. the original creators couldn't be created by what they created, without that creation traveling back in time</br>  <br>K-holes are a scary place kids, it just resembles an overwhelming feeling of doom, death, and destruction, without anything even being there. it just is.</br>  <br>yes , that is exactly what I am talking about ! simulation can travel back in time because in the future, that's what we can do . how else would their simulation reach us ?</br>  <br>You can get there on psychedelics too, but goddamn is that shit unpleasant-- for the first 2 hours or so.</br>  OP read The Holographic Universe by Michael Talbot if you want to know how to arrange what the shit you're trying to say you illiterate faggot.  <br>u wot m8?</br>  <br>ur pic is my life in a nutshell</br>  <br>nobody does understands !!! all i say is that if we are in a simulation made by they then their simulation (that is us) would have to travel back in time to reach us in the beginning . this also mean that when we in the future become they and make a simulation that perfectly simulates us, our simulation travels back in time to begin when they begin ! simpely cause and affect .</br>  All of our words are simply dancing around the actual truth, which I doubt can actually be verbalized or contained to an idea. These are all simply theories to help your brain get a grip on what it's not even meant to conceive in the first place.  <br>i don't get this film at all.</br>  What if growing up is part of a suppressive program that looses sight if the true reality. Maybe that's why there's all these motherfucking FAGGOTS!!! Who are closed minded about the truth.  <br>Nigger, I am tripping balls on drugs purer than you will ever know. You make no sense, see a doctor ASAP.</br>  <br><br> mfw </br></br>  <br>wot<br><br>I'm gonna have to guess what you mean. But I don't see how time travel is involved. It's a simulation, like a video game, we don't have to travel back in time to start up a new video game.</br></br></br>  <br>also look up LINDA MOLTEN-HOWE she will fucking blow your mind.</br>  <br>nobody do understands truth .</br>  <br>nobody done did</br>    <br>bet we ARE the new game ! we begin as not simulation , but when they understands simulation it travels back im time to start with us .</br>  <br>A video game can be fast forwarded and rewinded as desired by the creator. That's the only sort of time travel that would be going on, and the "time travel effect" is only felt by the inhabitants of the simulation, not by whoever is outside of it.</br>  <br>You're assuming the creator of the similar is bound to time like we are, time is relative to us, but to the hypothetical creators it could be absolute. What is, always has been. No time travel required.</br>    <br>but then how would begin when we begin if when we create perfect sinulation ?</br>  <br>well thanks for the video anon, I'm out of here before it goes even fuller retard</br>  <br>It's not "US" it's our "creator" that created the simulation. The simulation you're experiencing would already have to have a platform created for it to be experienced on.</br>  Yfw string theory basically implies our universe is just one pube on a giant cosmic nutsack.  <br> sinulation <br><br>I knew it was you Lucifer.</br></br></br>  <br>Also to add there had been studies in to the fact that the Alien species has already started putting humans in pods, hence all the abductions they want to start a whole new hybrid human race. Theres another theory that our planet has a planet with in its self, and theres an other sun thats why there are hot ass volcanoes. Just theories.......</br>  <br>this is now a ylyl</br>  <br>no no no no no !!!!! you got all wrong . if they create simulation then how we begin , huh ? we are creator of simulation , just like they are .</br>  did u just watch the matrix  <br>Begone Satan!</br>  <br>where are you from anon? i need to know so i never visit there</br>  <br>What "is" always "is" and simply will "be" -- that's the power of our "being" it's a timeless essence that some refer to as the spirit, it originates in a domain far beyond time. You're too caught up on the impression that the creator experiences time like we do, but the creatror "IS" "time".</br>  <br>i am japan .</br>  <br>NO NO NO I JUST SAY . creator is us !!!! we create simulation in future to being to get what they create for us in the future , the simulation that begins us .</br>  <br>are we really free or just on an other frequency? Remember the other life is suppose to be eternal, eternally stuck going in circles, eternally not here.</br>  Ill have what hes having  <br>i am fat man<br><br>aka little boy</br></br></br>  <br>You do realize that the points in time you're referring to only exist, because you perceive them in that way, right? To someone with a larger dimensional perspective, there is no beginning or end in time. If you think WE are the greatest beings in the universe, you will always be confused.</br>  <br>we are not free ,? because we are create of our own earth and dimensionals .</br>  <br>we are literally trans-dimensional niggers<br><br>just keep it going for the next guy</br></br></br>  <br>i never say we are greate beings , because what are they then ? you make none sense .</br>  For all of you poo pooing this as hokum; I have provided very reputable links below..<br><br>http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/02/1<wbr>6/opinion/sunday/is-the-universe-a-<wbr>simulation.html?referrer=<br><br>http://www.technologyreview.com/vie<wbr>w/429561/the-measurement-that-would<wbr>-reveal-the-universe-as-a-computer-<wbr>simulation/</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>sense none you make, young padawan</br>  <br>there are no trans dimentionals , because they create dimensions for us . there only one dimention , the one we create for they and the one they create for us .</br>  <br>thnak you ,!</br>  <br>Would you prefer a nature metaphor or a sexual metaphor?</br>  <br>Salvia sucks... this dude is trolling.</br>  If we are in a simulation, I don't think we could possibly be very far removed from the real universe. We could be in a simulation of a simulation, or even down several levels. However, the number of levels possible would depend on the maximum computation power allowed by the laws of physics in the original universe.<br><br>The original universe has to simulate the bits inside the computer of the simulated world. This means that each time a universe is simulated within a simulation, it doubles the computational requirements of the real universe's computer because it's simulating the bits of the simulation, and the bits within the simulated computer's simulation, and so on.<br><br>This is assuming that there IS a physical limit to computational power, which there is as far as we know.</br></br></br></br>  <br> i never say we are greate beings <br>You've been saying for 10 posts that we have the same power as the people who created the whole "simulation" we're experiencing... you have made no reference to "they" besides "them" being us, now it seems your mind has changed.

We're all watching each other, right now.</br>  <br>techincally by most theories the only watching is being doing by ours eyes in the mirrors .!!</br>  <br>if we are a simulation, most likely they are not watching you or me specifically, and time probably moves quicker for us. they probably aren't watching all of us individually</br>  <br>What I thought of when i read this: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=7Kc<wbr>PNiworbo</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Nobody's talking about the holographic principle you fucking ignoramus.</br>  <br>your constantly being watched open your eyes maaan!</br>    ITT: we pledge to replace the term God with Computer...<br><br>I vow to worship the one and only true Computer</br></br>  <br>op here, this is what got me into researching and thinking about the topic</br>  <br>We talking analog or digital, blasphemer?</br>  Disregarding comments about drugs or conspiracy theories...<br><br>There was a program on PBS a few years ago where the concept of reality was discussed with 4 "experts". <br>They were philosophers and physicists. (I don't remember the name of the program)<br><br>After much discussion and many arguments, they agreed that if we are really in a simulation, it only makes sense that we would perceive ghosts, UFOs and any other unexplained phenomena as expected glitches in our reality. <br><br>and if we, in fact, are really in a simulation, then our greatest accomplishment as humans, would be to realize we are in a simulation, and wave back at our creator/programmer and risk being terminated. <br>**it would also mean that our universe is much simpler than we imagine<br>**and according to several theories (including Moore's Law), we are most likely in a simulation</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    Yes indeed.

Not real scary, but its not the same thing over and over again.  <br>It's a bunch of school kids. As soon as they get near him, he knocks them over and shoots them or throws them down the stairs. Would you go first? All that aside, the whole movie is a good watch. I bought it the same day I saw this webm.</br>      <br>It's a pipe knocking around between the walls. It's changing frequency and volume because of the changes in air pressure, temperature, etc. Or it could be a loose piece of wood that's being knocked around by the A/C or whatever. Or maybe it's a demon that's tapping from inside your walls, waiting for you to open the walls and release it. No biggie.</br>  <br>Oh and this was just some weird thing I saw as a kid.</br>  <br>Fuck wild boars, those things are the meanest motherfuckers you'll ever meet, at least in Texas<br>They'll charge you for looking at them the wrong way</br></br>  <br>This image has been around for year, and you expect me to believe you were the one that took it?</br>  <br>I'm on /b/ why would I lie?</br>  <br>Damn</br>  While reading these skinwalker stories, some animal made a creepy fucking shrieking bark noise outside my window several times just now. Fuck that.  <br>Oh anon I have something for you</br>  <br>God I hate these stories but I told a friend about them and want to show him so I'm reading them now. Fuck sleep, im gonna be up all night now man.</br>  <br><br>FUCK this gave me chills</br></br>  I love innawoods stories  Bump  Bamp  Wait, so are skinwalkers actually real then? I feel as though this is some huge /k/onspiracy to fuck with the minds of idiots like me.  <br>There's some weird shit out there</br>  <br>there have been legends of them for a very long time in different native american tribes, its not something made up by /k/, its been here alot longer then that</br>  <br>what are they even supposed to be?</br>  <br>I believe it was originally a Navajo tale. Maybe another tribe. But its been around forever. Whatever the case it's fucking creepy.</br>  <br>One book I read said they were old gods that got greedy and stayed on earth when the other gods left. Altered over time into pure evil. But the story was a work of fiction and I haven't dug much into them.</br>  <br>Originally it was a Native American legend of a creature that could shapeshift into humans or other creatures</br>  <br>the navajo believed them to be evil spirits who could take the form of man or beast, attacking those who trespassed on there land, they could mimic noises and voices, but they couldnt take a form perfectly, in an animal form there eyes would be black and non-reflective, in human form they couldnt move fluidly like us and there eyes would be animialistic</br>  <br>skinwalker stories come from Windigo lore i think</br>  <br><br>Going off what I said, the book also said the tribes didnt talk about them much because they never knew whether the person they talked to was a skinwalker itself.</br></br>  <br><br><br>I saw a thread on Reddit(inb4 hurr durr reddit fag; someone here linked it) that was an AMA with a true Native American, and he attested wholeheartedly to skinwalkers being a thing. He said that they were technically humans, but he couldn't get into the specifics and lore and shit because it was a tribe secret of some sort passed down exclusively in the tribe, and also it was kind of taboo to speak of it. So there I still was kind of skeptical, but after seeing all these /k/ threads of perfectly rational people talking about this stuff, well, I don't want to be anywhere near the Mojave or California any time in my life.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>holy shit. Good thing I live in mid-western texas</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>By the way, does anyone think my stories are worth reposting? I probably will anyways, but I would like an opinion. I can't tell them as well as my old scoutmaster, havent heard them in a long time.<br><br><br><br>Yea no kidding.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>in native american tribes it is one of the most taboo things you can do, to speak of them to outsiders, because it could bring the wrath of the evil spirits to you and to those you spoke too. My tribe is no different, we are not support to speak about it<br><br><br>also, its not just the Navajo who know of them, multable tribes across America have stories about them or being just like them</br></br></br></br>   The stories and information posted here are artistic works of fiction and falsehood. <br>Only a fool would take anything posted here as fact.<br>This is true.. R-right guys?</br></br>  <br>If what you say it true, I completely understand your position. I know a few older native americans, they are serious about their culture and secrecy. <br><br>And, I don't know why I feel like saying this or if it appropriate, but, May the stars watch over and guide you from about, the ground stay firm and steady beneath you, and your path be ever strait and clear. <br><br>I feel like a nerd.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>if you dont believe whats written here, google it, skinwalker stories are not just on 4chan or reddit</br>  <br>I dunno, the one with the couple on the street in the middle of satan-ville is pretty damn convincing</br>  <br>Just out of curiosity, what tribe are you in? I always find authentic Native American culture fascinating. Would have loved to see it naturally develop without us having fucked everything up centuries ago.</br>  <br><br>So much truth can be found if you dig on 4chan <br>  is it true <br>  or fake </br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, as we said, the skinwalker stories have been around for hundreds of years. They may not be real but I will not lie to you. These people believed in these beings.</br>  <br>nerdiness is ok in context haha<br><br><br>id rather not go into too much detail, and i agree to a degree about our culture, but at the same time it would be hypocritical to say i dont like the world as it is, sitting in my house with ac and internet, talking to you /b/ros...</br></br></br></br>  <br>what actually are skinwalker stories? a specific set or kind or...</br>  Not as creepy, but it's a story.<br><br> be me <br> around a few months ago <br> watching some YouTube at night <br> neighbor's dogs start barking <br> notice the light is on in my front yard (imagine those lights that turn on when you get near) <br> see a cat just sitting there <br> think nothing of it, but check on it every few minutes or so <br> on third check the cat just starts looking at me <br> it wouldn't stop staring at me no matter what <br> look away for a second and it vanishes <br> what the fuck <br> hear a meow next to my window <br> it's standing right next to the fucking window on the roof (i live upstairs) <br> scream like a bitch and fall over <br> cat is gone when I look back <br> don't sleep for the rest of the night <br><br>It's still creeps me out because of the cat's stare.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You might as well post them about. Might not be the best but they add to the atmosphere</br>  <br>Yea well luckily I can change what I think before I talk. That is how my thoughts grow. Along that line, but I don't alter my speech as much on here.</br>  <br>nah agar.io is the actual game site, agor.io is just for anyone who misspells it or gets tricked into typing it just cause it's so similar</br>  <br> Would you go first? <br>better than getting shot and dying like a lil bitch</br></br>  <br>i just meant stories involving skinwalkers in general. The idea behind them has been around for centuries, long before 4chan or reddit got ahold of them and made them more well known</br>  <br>I don't mean culture as in reverting back 600 years and dealing with old technology. Embracing current tech is great lol. It's just that here we had an entire sect of people who grew, adapted, and evolved separately from the East and had their own beliefs, lore, religions, societal structures, language, technology, values, etc. and we completely stopped its development. It's akin to meeting an emerging intelligent species on another planet - one that is beginning to form societies and whatnot - and just annihilating them for our own development. It's stupid. It would be incredible to see what it would be today if it stayed entirely intact.</br>  By the way, any of you try explaining this shit to friends? I tried to tell one of my friends about skinwalkers while we were walking around a park at night, but I am pretty sure I just sounded like a wimp. I'm typically not good at retelling stories that are not mine, get too stuck on details that I get wrong.  <br>Cats can jump incredibly high.</br>  <br>fuck off</br>  <br>in that aspect i agree with you, yes it would have been interesting to see how the native americans grew and matured as a separate civilization from others.</br>  <br>I got that, but what stories are skinwalkers? The stories about people that aren't really "them" like a thing that takes their form?</br>  <br>What I thought of.</br>  <br>nice try satan</br>  <br>Basic premise is<br> X enters woods or secluded area alone or with Y friends <br> creepy shit goes down. <br> unnatural shit <br> shit that makes primal, animalistic, fight or flight "I'm going to be killed if I don't act" fear surface <br> either X has contact with weird not-quite-human but human acting humanoid or <br> Y gets lost and comes back. Y is acting strange, not quite fitting in or being themselves, and wants to get someone alone with them <br> fucking skinwalkers, man. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>more or less what he said yeah</br>  <br>Part of the mystery of skinwalkers(to an outsider), is not knowing what it is. So you have to think for yourself about what the story had in it.<br><br>Actually im not sure what your asking. What are the characterizations of skinwalker stories?<br><br>What are skinwalkers like? <br><br>How to tell whether a story has one in it? can you explain more?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck yeah love it</br>  <br>had a similar experience back in high school<br> mom forced me to take this week long sailing trip from one tip of the US coast to the other <br> different groups take turns watching over the ship every day, on this day I got stuck with the shitty midnight-4am night shift <br> me and some chick are sitting in the middle of the deck, chatting and looking at the stars <br> notice one star moving around in the sky, while all the rest around it are perfectly still <br> almost as if it's on a path, it will go forward and then change directions and keep going <br> ask the chick and she says she sees it too so pretty sure I didn't imagine it <br>at the time I was 100% sure it was some kinda UFO but thinking back maybe that star was much closer than the others so it was affected by the ship's movement or something, if that's even possible</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Naw nigga fuck that shit.</br>  <br>I'm new to spooky things and such. I didn't know how to tell a skinwalker story from a different kind of spooky story. But I think I do now.</br>  <br><br>Didn't mention the distance.<br>My house holds a long-ish driveway with the house being a meter or two away. It was around the start of it. It would've had to run, jump onto the roof, and then zigzag all the way to my window, which is to the far left of the window I mentioned, in 3 seconds before meowing. Must be a fast cat. The only reason I mentioned the story was because the fucking stare it gave me was eerie. It felt like eye contact instantly. Still probably nothing, it gave me a spook.</br></br></br>  Does anyone else feel safer when touchin their cat or dog?  <br>Yea that sounds similar. But I wasn't moving. I would say yours was a satellite but it changed course. I dunno.</br>    <br>sleep tight kitter.</br>  <br>basically <br>there are examples on this thread like : /k/ dude goes inna woods with sks and glock, hears screaming, goes to investigate, comes back, (ohshititsraining.jpg), sees dude over his smoldering fire acting weird, tries to talk with him, runs, thing chases him and screams like what he heard a while ago, gets to road, sees a humanoid figure in the woods, car comes, it goes away. <br>Shit like this, but this thread scared me shitless so I'm not going to read through them and link you to the exact one</br></br></br>  <br>My dog died around a month ago. :( gotta bring u down...<br><br>But I always did. I miss her.</br></br></br>  &lt;-- is the native American who was answering questions before<br>i myself have never seen or experienced a skin walker, but i have spoken to some elders who say they have, when they speak about it they always have a look of genuine fear in there eyes. It is because of that fear that i genuinely believe in there existence and why i started to study the lore of not only my own tribe, but most of the native American tribes and other cultures around the world. One of the more troubling things i found is how many cultures around the world have evil spirits or demons who act and are described in a VERY close way to skin walkers.</br>  <br>It's always freaky to talk to someone who legitimately gets afraid by mentioning something.</br>  <br>it was pretty bizarre, seemed to be making deliberate movements in various directions. plus with how far away it appeared and how fast it was moving across the sky I imagine it would have had to been going at enormous speeds</br>  <br>Malignant sorcerers with the ability to take the form of other people or animals.</br>    <br> decide to head in the direction I heard the scream <br>fucking hell why do this</br></br>  <br>one example is the irish believe in "witches" who could shape shift into hares and other animals, but itself it doesnt sound so similler, except that the original native american stories say the first skin walkers were witches who preformed "wicked sing" a perversion of a good "sing" used to heal, a "wicked sing" was to hurt or kill. and doing so would eventually turn the witch into a skin walker</br>  <br>I would have noped the fuck out of there. White people....</br>  <br>Yea. I may have written my experience off, except like what you said it was moving deliberately, and kept dissapearing and reappearing lower in a pattern.<br><br>like so<br><br> ----------- ----------&gt;* <br><br> --------------------------&gt;* <br><br> ------------- ----------&gt;* <br><br> ----------------------------&gt;* <br><br> -----------------------------&gt;* <br>(Asterisk is where it dissapeared, first arrow is where it started again.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Breaks were supposed to be longer, 4chan shortened them. Oh well, you get the idea.</br>  <br> Does anyone else feel safer when touchin their cat or dog? <br><br>sicko</br></br></br>  <br>fucking aliens man, stars are the perfect disguise too when you think about it</br>  <br>What is highlighted in the pic?</br>  <br>Mmmm...I don't believe that. Probably some scientific thing. Too tired. Didn't even consider that your post may be a joke, I dont know too out of it.</br>  <br><br>This is actually a lot more information than I've ever gotten about the subject, and you're not the first Native American I've talked to about it. Thank you so much man.<br><br>Just how taboo IS this subject? The holocaust was discussed more freely than this.</br></br></br></br>  <br>From what i heard, incredibly. Not a NA, but its supposed to be bad luck and dangerous to talk about it.</br>  <br>talking about it can make you shunned by your friends and family on native American land. Because by speaking about it, especially with outsiders, its believed you can bring the wrath of the skin walker on yourself, the one you talked about it with, and even sometimes your close family. Talking about it with an outsider is like talking about the Jewish family hiding in your basement to an SS officer...</br>    <br><br>That's ridiculous. As I've seen mentioned many times in this thread:<br> fucking skinwalkers </br></br></br>  For those who were after snapchat/twitter/cam from the last thread.  <br>Will be doing that tonight :)</br>  Bump  <br>post pics or the threads going to die</br>  So /b/ who's the one true king of Westeros?  If any of you could actually sit and read a book instead of a few words with pictures you'd know who the true monarch is, in the series he's not even mentioned yet but varis has been protecting him since he was a child.    <br>yeah mate, it's obvious with that dumb red bitch coming in on the same die of /kill</br>   Put up CL ad, asking for a dominant man to treat me like a sissy slut <br> Get a couple of replies, average looking guys, but immediately made me feel like a sissy <br> Setup a meet for the week <br> getting cold feet <br><br>Help me, /b/</br></br></br></br></br>        I met a couple of different black guys on Flickr that say they want to fuck me. One lives in Texas and the other in Akron, Ohio. I'm in Pennsylvania. <br><br>Is it a good idea to go meet them? I have nothing going in my life so I don't have much to lose.</br></br>  <br>place chili peppers between condoms so you are alerted when the first condom breaks</br>  <br>I'm 20 and they're both in their 40s. I think maybe I'll take a Greyhound bus since that's the only mode of transportation I'm familiar with for long distance travel.</br>    I ended up working for the wall from members to corporate in a form of a call center for these guys.<br>If you got any questions or want any hook ups drop your member number/check in codes + what you want and I gotchu</br>  <br>Eh I have a membership at la fitness.
